 Mr. President, just a little housekeeping, I understand  that there is a bill at the desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    Now, Mr. President, on the business of today, today the  Senate Appropriations Committee hears testimony from the Secretary of  Defense and the Secretary of State on President Biden's emergency  supplemental request, sent to Congress to address the national security  threats happening around the world.   The right path forward for Congress is clear. We must stand with our  allies in Israel; we must send humanitarian aid to innocent civilians  in Gaza; we must give aid to Ukraine and hold the line against Vladimir  Putin; and we must rebuff the aggressions of the Chinese Communist  Party in the Indo-Pacific.   As has been true from the start of this Congress, bipartisan  cooperation will be the only way anything gets to the President's desk.   So I am deeply troubled that yesterday, House Republicans released a  partisan and woefully inadequate package with no aid to Ukraine, no  humanitarian assistance for Gaza, no funding for the Indo-Pacific, and,  in addition, poison pills that increase the deficit  [[Page S5236]]  and help wealthy tax cheats avoid paying their fair share.   The House GOP bill is woefully inadequate and has the hard right's  fingerprints all over it. It makes aid for Israel, which has just faced  the worst terrorist attack in its history, contingent on poison pills  that reward rich tax cheats. In short, it makes it much, much harder to  pass aid for Israel.   It is insulting that the hard right is openly trying to exploit the  crisis in Israel to try and reward the ultrarich. The new Speaker knows  perfectly well that if you want to help Israel, you can't propose  legislation that is full of poison pills. And this kind of unnecessary  partisan legislation sends the wrong message to our allies and  adversaries around the world.   It is almost as if the real goal of this House GOP package is not to  help Israel but to get tax relief for the superwealthy, while leaving  out Ukraine aid, leaving out humanitarian aid for Gaza, leaving out  funding for the Indo-Pacific.   Instead of advancing a serious proposal to defend Israel, defend  Ukraine, and provide humanitarian aid, this House GOP proposal is  clearly designed to divide Congress on a partisan basis, not unite it.  The Speaker's allies have said as much to the press. I hope the new  Speaker realizes that this is a grave mistake and quickly changes  course. To protect Americans against any one of these foreign threats,  we must protect against them all, because you can be sure that  President Xi will watch what America does in Ukraine, just as much as  they watch what we do in Israel, in the Indo Pacific, and everywhere  else. And the last thing Republicans in Congress should be doing is  exploiting the crisis in Israel to sneak in a highly partisan provision  that caters to the ultrarich, as the GOP package blatantly does.    As I mentioned when I spoke to Speaker Johnson the night of his  election, the only way we will get anything done is in a bipartisan  way. Unfortunately, in his first major decision as Speaker, Speaker  Johnson has ignored that advice.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on AI, yesterday, President Biden  announced the first ever artificial intelligence Executive order that  will keep America in the lead on AI. Later this morning, the Senate's  bipartisan AI gang--Senators Rounds, Heinrich, Young, and I--will go to  the White House to meet with President Biden to discuss how we can work  together to pursue bipartisan AI legislation.   I applaud President Biden for doing the right thing by issuing  yesterday's Executive order. It outlines a number of commonsense  guardrails that will increase American leadership on safeguards and  better protect Americans against all sorts of risk, from cyber security  to bio and nuclear threats.   President Biden's AI Executive order was welcome news, but everyone  knows we can and must do more here in Congress. The President's action  yesterday importunes us to act, to augment and expand his Executive  order with bipartisan legislation. Congress must act with a sense of  urgency when it comes to AI because AI is already changing our world in  dramatic ways, and other countries are trying to gain ground on us.   Tomorrow, the Senate will continue our bipartisan work on AI with our  third and fourth AI Insight Forums.   In the morning, the AI Insight Forum will begin at 10 a.m. tomorrow  and focus on our workforce, both the risks and opportunities that AI  presents to American workers and our economy. We will hear from leaders  in labor, tech, civil rights, and business on how Congress can best  protect workers from the changes that IA will bring.   The afternoon AI Insight Forum will bring another diverse group to  debate how Congress can prepare for AI in high-impact areas, including  financial decisions, healthcare, law enforcement, among other highly  consequential use cases. We will be careful to pay attention to  potential bias when AI is used.   For the information of Senators, tomorrow's AI Insight Forums will  take place in the Kennedy Caucus Room. Each will last approximately 2  hours. I encourage everyone on both sides to attend, and I thank  Senators Rounds, Heinrich, and Young for their help making these  bipartisan AI Insight Forums possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on Jack Lew, it is going to be a busy  day here in the Senate. Before the end of the day, the U.S. Senate will  confirm Jack Lew as the next Ambassador to Israel. For the information  of Senators, we will have a cloture vote on Mr. Lew's nomination this  morning, with a final vote on confirmation in the early afternoon. I  urge my colleagues to vote in favor of sending an American Ambassador  to Israel today.   With everything happening in Israel right now, confirming Jack Lew at  this moment will be one of the most important and consequential  nomination votes the Senate has taken in a long time. The need to  confirm Mr. Lew is plain and irrefutable. Israel in crisis. America  needs to stand with her, and a most urgent and obvious step would be  ensuring we have an ambassador in place.   As the Senate takes this important vote later today, I want to  applaud the remarkable team at the U.S. Embassy in Israel, all of whom  have done exceptional work under the most difficult circumstances. When  I went to Israel with my Senate colleagues, I got to see the Embassy's  incredible work up close, especially the outstanding Charge d'Affaires.  So I thank them all for their dedication in these hard times. But it  was clear when we went there that Israel needs an ambassador from the  United States, especially at this time. So I hope we will get as large  a vote for Mr. Lew as possible.   I want to thank my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee who approved Mr. Lew on a 12-to-9 basis. Mr. Lew has a  strong, long proven record as a public servant and a ferocious ally of  Israel, and it will help send a powerful message of support to Israel  to have this appointment filled ASAP.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on the minibus, on the  legislative front, the Senate will move forward this week on bipartisan  appropriations legislation. I would note that we are the only  bipartisan appropriations legislation in town. The House has passed a  series of very, very partisan bills filled with poison pills, cutting  deeply, way below the agreement that was made in the last resolution  when we dealt with avoiding default.   Last week, we began holding votes on a large number of amendments  here in the Senate, offered on both sides of the aisle. In fact, when  all is said and done, we will have considered 40 amendments--40--here  on the floor. If both sides cooperate, it is my hope we can pass these  three appropriations bills by tomorrow. When that happens, these three  bills will be the only appropriations bills that have passed through  either Chamber with bipartisan support, which is the only way we are  going to get any funding passed in divided government.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the Senate, I am proud to say, has now  taken an extremely important step in our support of Israel. We have  approved, with bipartisan support, Jack Lew to serve as the U.S.  Ambassador to Israel. With Israel defending itself against Hamas, this  ambassadorship is as important and timely as any nomination that the  Senate has confirmed in a long time.   Mr. Lew is the right man for the job of Ambassador to Israel. He is a  capable public servant, a fierce ally of Israel's, and commands a broad  base of trust and respect, and he is a decent and humane man.   When my colleagues and I met with the Israeli Government, we promised  to send them an ambassador as soon as possible. Today, the Senate has  kept that promise. Having an ambassador in Israel means stronger  diplomatic ties between the United States and Israel at a time when  these bonds matter most. It means Israel's messages will be conveyed  appropriately to our government, but it also means our government's  messages will be sent appropriately to the Israeli Government. So it  helps the two-way street of communication--so important right now.  Having an ambassador ensures America can work with Israel and  communicate with Israel in both directions at the highest level as the  fight against Hamas continues.   I thank my colleagues for confirming Mr. Lew on a bipartisan basis.  Thank you to Chairman Cardin and the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, which championed Mr. Lew's nomination.   Finally, I want to applaud the remarkable team at the U.S. Embassy in  Israel, all of whom have done exceptional work under the most difficult  circumstances.   When I went to Israel with my Senate colleagues, I got to see the  Embassy's incredible work up close, especially the outstanding Charg  d'Affaires, but we also saw the need, the vacancy, the hole that was  there during a time of crisis when we didn't have an ambassador, and we  saw how much we needed one. We are easing the short-staffed Embassy's  burden by sending a fully appointed ambassador so they can continue  carrying out their mission with excellence during this pivotal moment.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 334.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 329.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 333.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, October 31, be  waived.    Mr. President, a few moments ago, I filed cloture on the  President's nominees for Chief of Naval Operations and Air Force Chief  of Staff, the remaining vacancies on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I have  also filed cloture on the nomination of Lt. Gen. Christopher Mahoney to  serve as Assistant Commandant for the U.S. Marine Corps. Lieutenant  General Mahoney's confirmation is urgent in light of the frightening  news that Gen. Eric Smith, confirmed last month to lead the U.S. Marine  Corps, was hospitalized Sunday after a serious medical emergency. We  pray for General Smith's recovery. Our thoughts are with him and his  family.   This scary incident involving General Smith shows why it is supremely  risky to play politics with military appointments, as Senator  Tuberville is doing. Emergencies happen, and when they do, the chain of  command must be able to respond. But thanks to Senator Tuberville,  there is no current No. 2 at the Marine Corps to fill in.   The situation at the Marine Corps is precisely the kind of avoidable  emergency that Senator Tuberville has provoked through his blanket  holds. Lieutenant General Mahoney should have been appointed a very  long time ago, but he is one of the more than 300 nominees whom Senator  Tuberville is brazenly blocking to advance his extreme agenda.   Every day that Senator Tuberville continues his blanket holds, our  military preparedness is worse off, our military families suffer, and  our military appointments risk being further ensnared in partisan  politics, which is a point of no return we must never cross in the  Senate.   Senator Tuberville should drop his blanket holds at once, and in the  meantime, the Senate will proceed to confirm these nominations that  should have been swiftly approved long ago, as has been the custom in  the Senate for decades.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
