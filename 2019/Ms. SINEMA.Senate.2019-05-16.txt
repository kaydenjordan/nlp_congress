 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and  legacy of the Honorable Stan Furman, a former Arizona State senator and  community leader who passed away in Phoenix, AZ, on April 1, 2019, at  the age of 87. Having spent his formative years in the Vista Del Mar  Orphanage in Los Angeles, Stan developed a strong sense of family.  While in the orphanage, Stan worked any job he could, and caddying at  the Hillcrest Country Club gave him some great stories about George  Burns, Milton Berle, Jack Benny and others.   Stan served his country honorably in the U.S. Air Force from 1952  until l956 and was stationed in Japan during the Korean war. After his  service, he moved to Mexico City, where he earned a degree in business  and foreign trade from Mexico City College. There, he met his soulmate  and wife of 58 years, Gloria. They married in Mexico City in 1960. The  couple moved to California, where Stan worked for a fabric wholesaler,  and they raised three children: Diane, Philip, and Susan.   The family moved to Phoenix in 1969, where Stan opened and managed a  new branch of the business. After their children left the nest, Stan  and Gloria started a successful translation business, allowing them to  travel to Mexico, China, Italy, Spain, and many other international  destinations. Stan loved Arizona and wanted to serve his community, so  he ran for the State senate in 1990. He served in the Arizona State  Senate from l991 to 1995. After he retired from elected office, he  continued to serve on many boards and commissions and worked for the  Arizona Corporation Commission.   In 1998, Stan was named Mediator of the Year by the Phoenix Community  Mediation Program. Long active in the Arizona Civil Liberties Union,  Stan served as Arizona ACLU president from 2002 to 2006 and was honored  to be named Arizona Civil Libertarian of the Year in 1995. He also  served for several years on the National ACLU board of directors. Stan  was an avid tennis player and golfer, quick-witted, and a natural joke  teller. He loved crossword puzzles, Boggle, and all word games. He  immensely enjoyed playing board games and online games with his  children and grandchildren. He loved going to the beach while enjoying  time at the family's vacation home in Rocky Point, Mexico.   Stan is survived by his loving wife, Gloria, daughters Diane (Randy)  and Susan, son Phil (Deb), grandsons Spencer, Dylan, Nate, Harrison,  Alex (Jessi), Hugo and Oscar, and great-granddaughter Cheyanne. He will  be dearly missed by other family members, friends, and the hundreds of  people whose lives she touched. Please join me in honoring his  memory.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and  legacy of Geraldine ``Jerry'' Emmett, a community leader who passed  away in Prescott, AZ, on April 30, 2019, at the age of 104. Jerry was a  lifelong Democrat and campaigned for Arizona's first Governor, George  W.P. Hunt, before she was old enough to vote. She will be fondly  remembered as the oldest delegate at the 2016 Democratic National  Convention, where she did several national media interviews.   While waiting tables in her family's restaurant, she met and  impressed an Arizona State Teachers College--now Northern Arizona  University--recruiter from Flagstaff, and received a tuition  scholarship of $14.00 per semester, allowing her to attend and graduate  from ASTC in 1937 with a degree in elementary education. She began her  40-year teaching career at Kayenta on the Navajo Reservation. She also  taught in Seligman, Tombstone, and Scottsdale, before finally settling  in Phoenix at the Creighton School District. She taught in Phoenix for  the next 30 years until her retirement, primarily at Lafayette  Elementary School, Larry C. Kennedy. Evidently, her teaching career  made an impression on her students, as over 60 former students attended  her 100th birthday party to pay homage.   Jerry cofounded the Prescott Area Democratic Women's Club and was a  regular sight at Democratic Party events with her friends Carolyn and  Dawn. Her smile and stories of growing up in Depression-era Arizona  will be missed.   Jerry is survived by her youngest son, Jim Emmett, five  grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren. She will be dearly missed  by other family members, friends, and the hundreds of people whose  lives she touched. Please join me in honoring her memory.                            ____________________
