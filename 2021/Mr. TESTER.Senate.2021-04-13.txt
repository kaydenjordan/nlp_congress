 Mr. President, today, I rise to recognize the Boys  and Girls Club of Yellowstone County for 50 years of service to the  Billings community.   The Boys and Girls Club of Yellowstone County first opened its doors  in 1971, serving 70 kids out of the basement of the old public library  in downtown Billings. Over the past half century, the club has grown to  serve well over 500 kids and operates five clubhouses and five  microsites across the Magic City.   Throughout the pandemic, the club never stopped doing what it does  best serving the kids who need it most. Like many other schools and  organizations, the club initially had to close their doors when COVID- 19 came to Montana. But they put in the hard work and managed to reopen  carefully and safely so they could continue providing a welcoming place  for kids to learn together, make lifelong friendships, and build skills  and confidence that will serve them for the rest of their lives. I  commend president and CEO Brian Dennis and his staff for navigating  these challenging times and for their steadfast commitment to ensuring  every child in our community is set up to succeed.   The Boys and Girls Clubs of America challenge each and every one of  us to reach our full potential and be great. For the past 50 years, the  Yellowstone County club has done exactly that. Congratulations, thank  you, and best of luck as you continue this truly commendable  work.                            ____________________
