 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6201, the second  coronavirus relief bill.   Fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills were enacted less than 3 months  ago, which included record levels of spending on our public health  infrastructure. This allowed the administration to respond immediately  to the coronavirus when the threat became clear.   Last week, the House and Senate voted almost unanimously on an $8  billion emergency supplemental, giving the administration new resources  to respond to the virus. Unfortunately, the threat we face has grown  more complex and costly in only a week's time.   The bill before us will provide a second installment of supplemental  funds and combat the negative economic effects of this disease that has  now been called a pandemic.   This legislation builds off of last week's bill, where we expanded  the availability of tests for the coronavirus to ensure that everyone  who needs to be tested, gets tested.   Mr. Speaker, in his remarks today, the President reaffirmed his  commitment to distribute millions of tests and speed up how they are  processed. This bill takes the next step to include more than $1  billion to cover the cost of taking these tests, including for  servicemembers and veterans. We must ensure tests are administrated so  that people know if they are infected. This is the only way we can stop  the spread of this virus.   Emergency food assistance is provided in the bill for seniors, women,  children, and low-income families. That includes additional help for  children whose schools are being closed as a precautionary measure to  keep them safe.   Tax incentives are included to encourage American businesses to allow  employees to take emergency leave to limit the spread of the virus. No  one should have to choose between getting a paycheck or infecting other  people.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard many concerns about the needs of small  businesses. In addition to the tax incentives in the bill, more than  $37 billion is already available from prior appropriations for the  Small Business Administration to make loans. As we watch the impact of  this virus on our Nation's job creators, I will continue working with  the administration and my colleagues to ensure they get the help they  need.   While bringing this bill to the floor has taken much longer than I  had hoped, it is time for Congress to pass it. This bill will give the  President and our public health officials the tools that are needed  right now to respond to this quickly changing threat.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this  measure. We must pass this bill today to help lessen the devastating  impact of this global pandemic on the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0020     Mr. Speaker, I yield to 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Brady).    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
