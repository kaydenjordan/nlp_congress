 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the urgent need for  additional relief for our restaurants.   Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, restaurants in my district and  across the country have been at the front line of our battle against  COVID-19.   The Restaurant Revitalization Fund offered a vital lifeline at a time  when restaurants desperately needed our help. However, the funds  quickly ran out, leaving hundreds of thousands of restaurants without  any relief, including in my State of North Carolina.   In a cruel twist, many restaurants were approved for funding, but  never saw a dime.  [[Page H4232]]    For example, Kim Hammer, who owns Bittersweet in Raleigh, was  approved for a grant by the Small Business Association. Despite this,  Kim still hasn't received any relief and said, ``It feels like no one  is listening.''   Well, we are listening. Every time a new variant emerges and cases  surge, the survival of countless restaurants is thrown into jeopardy.  As I hear from restaurant owners in my district, they all tell me how  essential the restaurant relief program was; but that it simply was not  enough.   During the peak surge of the Omicron variant, Cheetie Kumar, the  owner of Garland restaurant in Raleigh, said she just hoped she could  keep the doors open for both her customers and for her staff.   Jennifer Cramer, the owner of Catalan Taps restaurant in Cary, had to  start a GoFundMe campaign to keep her lights on and her employees on  payroll.   Mr. Speaker, our fight against this pandemic is not over. It is  unacceptable that we would leave the restaurant industry out to dry.  Restaurants contribute to the spirit, vibrancy, and success of my  community in Wake County, North Carolina, and many communities all  across this Nation.   I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying  legislation and replenish this fund.
