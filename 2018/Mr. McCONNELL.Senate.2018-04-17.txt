 Madam President, yesterday afternoon I filed cloture  on S. 1129, the Coast Guard Authorization Act, a comprehensive package  that equips an adaptable force to meet a variety of important missions.  I hope my colleagues will join me in ensuring its swift consideration  and passage this week.                            ____________________     First, Madam President, the Senate will consider yet  another chance to use the Congressional Review Act and repeal yet  another of the last administration's runaway regulations. Thanks to  Senator Moran and Senator Toomey, today's effort will protect consumers  from a brazen attempt by the past Director of the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau to stretch his authority and interfere in the auto  industry.   The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 got a lot of things wrong, but one thing  Dodd-Frank got right was protecting auto dealers from meddling by the  CFPB.   Our Democratic colleagues are usually fans of Federal regulations. I  guess even they had a hunch that, left unchecked, the Federal  bureaucracy would find a way to put the brakes on this key industry-- and how right they were.   In 2013, Federal regulators concocted a loophole. They bypassed  standard review and public comment periods for Federal regulations and  instead issued guidance that would regulate auto dealers' ability to  negotiate loan terms with their customers.   Dodd-Frank already gave the CFPB unprecedented insulation from the  American people's elected representatives, but apparently that wasn't  enough because they still attempted an end run around the express  prohibition on the regulation of auto dealers with guidance they  assumed would not be subject to the Congressional Review Act. Well,  today Senator Toomey foiled that plan when he asked GAO for an opinion  on whether this guidance was, in fact, intrusive rulemaking that should  be subject to congressional review. GAO decided that indeed it was, and  now Congress will have its say.   Republicans are chopping away at the tangled mess of regulations that  the last administration left behind. Our whole economy is getting a  tune-up, and now it is time for the front end of the auto industry to  come along for the ride.   We used the Congressional Review Act a record 15 times last year.  Let's join with our colleagues from Pennsylvania and Kansas and add  another victory to that list.                            ____________________     Madam President, today is tax day, the deadline for  most Americans to file their tax returns. For many middle-class  households, that means sending too much of their hard-earned money off  to the IRS--hardly cause for celebration. But this year, the gray  clouds of tax day have a silver lining. Today is the very last time  that American families will have to file under the unfair, outdated Tax  Code that Congress and the President got rid of a few months ago. Out  with the old and in with the new.   Republicans' historic overhaul cut taxes for families and small  businesses. We doubled the standard deduction, expanded the child tax  credit, and lowered rates as well. And we accomplished all of this  while preserving key middle-class provisions, such as the mortgage  interest deduction. The upshot of all of this is simple: major tax  relief for middle-class families and a big shot in the arm for the U.S.  economy, which will lead to more--and higher-paying--homegrown American  jobs.   Already, tax reform has given American workers a raise, since less of  each paycheck needs to be withheld for the IRS. When all is said and  done, the Treasury Department estimates that our tax cuts will leave 90  percent of wage-earners with more take-home pay--that is 90 percent of  wage earners with more take-home pay as a result of our tax reform  measure.   In addition, millions of Americans are receiving special bonuses, pay  raises, or new benefits from their employers as a direct result of tax  reform. Thousand-dollar bonuses for workers at Kansas City Southern  Railway in Missouri; a higher starting wage at First Farmers Bank &  Trust in Indiana;  [[Page S2192]]  higher wages and new job opportunities at CSS Distribution Group, a  small business packaging and distribution company in Kentucky; billion- dollar investments in pension plans for UPS and FedEx workers--the list  goes on and on.   My Democratic colleagues from New York and San Francisco scoff  publicly at the idea that a $2,000 tax cut or a $1,000 bonus would make  a difference for American families. They have called these things  ``crumbs.'' Something tells me they haven't tried that talking point  around many middle-class kitchen tables. I suspect they would be  laughed out of the room.   And these are just the first fruits. Tax reform laid the foundation  for a more prosperous future with more good-paying American jobs. That  is because we made sending jobs overseas less appealing. We created new  incentives for businesses to invest, expand, build, and hire right here  at home. We gave overseas competitors something to worry about--a  healthy, competitive U.S. economy. Already, job creators of all shapes  and sizes are investing more and expanding. For example, a furniture  store in Ohio is planning a 4,500-square-foot expansion, a craft  brewery in Iowa is planning to open a new production line, and a deck  and patio builder in Virginia is hiring 10 new employees to meet rising  demand, just to name a few.   Republicans designed every piece of tax reform to benefit middle- class families and small businesses, both right now and in the years  and decades ahead. That used to be a bipartisan priority, but this  time, Democrats chose to put political posturing ahead of America's  best interests. Every single Democrat in the House and every single  Democrat in the Senate voted to block tax reform--and by extension,  every bit of this good news--from happening. Later today, in fact, some  of our colleagues across the aisle will be demonstrating against the  law right here on the grounds of the Capitol. I wonder whether they are  protesting all the new jobs, or maybe it is the big family tax cuts, or  maybe they are protesting the bonuses and wage hikes or all of the  small business expansions. Their first mistake was voting to block all  of this in the first place. Now, even as the economy is starting to  thrive, they want to repeal these historic tax cuts and literally claw  back the money. But make no mistake--Republicans will continue to stand  and fight for the American people.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to S.J. Res. 57.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
