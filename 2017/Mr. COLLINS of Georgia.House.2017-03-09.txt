 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind us of the  need to repeal ObamaCare. We have an opportunity to address the  Affordable Care Act. It is real simple: by gutting it.   In northeast Georgia, I have heard again and again how my neighbors  have suffered at the hands of ObamaCare. ObamaCare levied $1 trillion  in new taxes, not including the de facto taxes that came to middle  class Americans in the form of increased deductible and insurance  premiums.   The laws that our friends across the aisle forced on the American  people while they worked in the shadows have crippled our healthcare  system. The Affordable Care Act is not affordable, and it is not  acceptable. Not from my neighbors and not for your loved ones, Mr.  Speaker.   Democrats created a brave new world in which coverage came with no  promise of quality health care, in which insurance markets continue to  crumble and families watch their healthcare resources slip way.   The only way forward is to say good-bye to ObamaCare, good-bye to  personal and employer mandates. Good-bye to additional and frivolous  taxes. Good-bye to unnecessary spending. Good-bye to heartbreaking  healthcare outcomes. Good-bye, and good riddance.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 180 and ask for its immediate  consideration.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on House Resolution 180, currently  under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward  this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 720, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, and H.R.  985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate for each bill, equally divided  between the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. The  rule also provides for a motion to recommit for both pieces of  underlying legislation.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Congressman Steve Cohen  on behalf of the Judiciary Committee, as well as Subcommittee on  Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Ranking Member Hank  Johnson.   The Rules Committee made in order 12 amendments total--four  amendments to H.R. 720 and eight amendments to H.R. 985, representing  ideas from both sides of the aisle.   I want to thank Chairman Goodlatte and the Judiciary Committee staff  for their work on both pieces of legislation. I am a member of the  Judiciary Committee, and we had the opportunity to consider both pieces  of legislation and enjoyed lively discussion at the markup for both  bills.   Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, we have worked tirelessly in this  House to pass litigation reforms that would promote access to the  courts for all Americans and ensure that the cost of litigation isn't  used as a tool to force settlements.   We have also talked about how to restore reason and remove burdens on  hardworking Americans. These bills help us achieve those goals.   Both bills have enjoyed thorough discussion at both the committee  level and on the floor, both in this Congress and in previous  Congresses.   H.R. 720, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, was introduced by my  friend from Texas, Congressman Lamar Smith. Similar legislation to H.R.  720 has passed the House before, and I look forward to its  consideration again.   This legislation provides a balanced solution to frivolous lawsuits,  based on the simple principle that if an attorney files a baseless  lawsuit that has no grounding in fact or law, the attorney should have  to compensate the victim of their legal action.   This legislation does not change the standard for rule 11 sanctions;  it simply gives this important rule some teeth by making sanctions  mandatory instead of discretionary.   Opponents will argue that this bill will stifle robust examinations  of existing law by discouraging otherwise meritorious lawsuits.   To be certain, LARA does not change in any way the existing standards  for determining what is and what is not a frivolous lawsuit, as  determined under rule 11. In fact, LARA expressly provides that  ``nothing in'' the changes made to rule 11 ``shall be construed to bar  or impede the assertion or development of new claims, defenses, or  remedies under Federal, State, or local laws, including civil rights  laws, or under the Constitution of the United States.''   H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, was introduced  by Chairman Goodlatte. This legislation now also includes the  Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency, or FACT, Act, authored by  Congressman Farenthold from Texas.   H.R. 985 provides a targeted solution to a unique problem. At its  core, the bill addresses whether the injury suffered by named  plaintiffs in a class action suit accurately reflects injuries suffered  by the class.   Let me be clear, again, this bill does not kill the class action.  Opponents would have you believe that it does, but these claims have  become a knee-jerk reaction to attempts to address clear abuses in the  legal system.   We want to make the system work for victims of these abuses and of  other injustices. We want to make it more difficult for anyone to take  advantage of the courts and make legal recourse more accessible for  those who genuinely deserve relief.   As a case in point, when Congress passed the Class Action Fairness  Act, CAFA, in 2005, opponents claimed that its passage would mean the  end of class action suits. Actually, it had two targeted goals: to  reduce abusive forum-shopping by plaintiffs and, in certain  circumstances, to require greater Federal scrutiny procedures  throughout the review of class action settlements.   For example, you may remember an infamous Alabama class action  involving Bank of Boston in which the attorneys' fees exceeded the  relief to the class members. As a result, class members lost money  paying attorneys for their legal victory.   Twelve years ago, opponents of CAFA made virtually identical  arguments against that reform that they are making against H.R. 985  today. These objections are unsupported by history.   In fact, researchers at the Federal Judicial Center conducted a study  on the impact of CAFA and concluded that--postenactment--there was an  increase in the number of class actions filed in or removed to the  Federal courts based on diversity jurisdiction, consistent with the  congressional intent behind that law.   We see that necessary reforms have resulted in a class action option  that is alive and well, representing an important part of our legal  system. And it  [[Page H1964]]  will remain that way. Claims to the contrary, Mr. Speaker, are just  simply inaccurate.   H.R. 985 is a targeted solution that says a Federal court may not  certify a proposed class unless the party seeking the class action  demonstrates through admissible evidentiary proof that each proposed  class member suffered an injury of the same type and extent as the  injury of the named class representative or representatives.   This requirement also exists in rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure. Unfortunately, not all courts appropriately interpret or  apply these standards.                                time  1245    To claim that this bill, which codifies existing standards, would  kill class action suits is just simply not supported by facts.   Class actions exist for a reason, a reason vindicated both by  compassion and by wisdom. The class action option exists to allow a  group of individuals who have been similarly harmed to join together to  seek appropriate compensation for their injuries.   In today's world, we see abuse after abuse of that legitimate  purpose. As a result, we have seen the rise of a class of people who  may bear legitimate injuries, but we also see countless others who have  suffered no injury at all yet are vying for class action spoils to  which they have no right. The no-injury class actions are designed to  exploit companies to achieve a quick payday through accusations that  are not grounded in genuine injuries.   Class actions should be preserved as a tool for those who are harmed  to plead their case and receive just compensation. H.R. 985 will allow  courts to focus their resources on cases in which the people have  actually suffered injuries. This helps ensure that we hold responsible  parties accountable for their actions.   As I mentioned, H.R. 985 also includes the Furthering Asbestos Claims  Transparency, or FACT, Act. The FACT Act is designed to reduce fraud  and compensation claims for asbestos-related diseases. This is a  critical step to preserving resources for true victims because,  unfortunately, double-dipping has become too common in asbestos claims.   For every dollar awarded to fraudulent claims, there is $1 less  available to true victims who are facing mesothelioma or other  asbestos-related illnesses. These victims are often those to whom our  country owes its greatest debt: our veterans. Veterans currently  comprise 9 percent of the population, yet they make up approximately 30  percent of the asbestos victims. Veterans are uniquely positioned to  benefit from the increased transparency that this bill offers.   Despite the positive impact that increased transparency can have for  veterans, detractors claim that the legislation will negatively impact  the privacy rights of claimants. Allow me to be clear, Mr. Speaker:  this is not true. The bill actually requires far less personal  information from claimants than State courts currently require in their  disclosure documents.   This legislation will reduce fraud in the asbestos trust system to  safeguard assets in order to compensate future asbestos victims,  veterans or otherwise.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 985 and H.R. 720 will establish meaningful reforms  to our litigation system. I believe the United States is the greatest  country in the world, and our justice system is designed to be free and  fair, yet we have seen our justice system abused by people who seek ill  gain at the expense of actual victims. These bills that today's rule  provides for help us to right that wrong. They may not be perfect, but  they recognize existing flaws in the system and strive to fix those  flaws to better serve the American public.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Sometimes it is often said that we discuss the issues that come to  the floor, and there are real debates taking place across the street  right now dealing with our discussions around health care. But I want  to go back to actually the bills that we are dealing with in the rule  and discuss the part of where do sometimes these issues come from,  especially when we are discussing things like H.R. 985 and class act  litigation.   This came, actually, from outside the walls here and outside into the  real world where this is being practiced. One of the things that is  happening is that Federal judges have been looking to Congress to  reform the class action system which currently allows lawyers to fill  classes with hundreds of thousands of unmeritorious claims and use the  artificially inflated classes to force defendants to settle the case.   As the Supreme Court has recognized, ``even a small chance of a  devastating loss'' inherent in most decisions to certify a class  produces an ``in terrorem'' interim effect that often forces settlement  independent of merits of the case.   Mr. Speaker, I understand that fear because what we are dealing with  many times in these class actions--and I know the Speaker and others  are aware--is the definition of the class that really depends on the  case itself, not as much of the merits of the case because of the  potential of a devastating loss. So the actual class certification  becomes something that is the main driver in these cases.   Notice what Ruth Bader Ginsberg said about this. She recognized this  when she said: ``A court's decision to certify a class . . . places  pressure on the defendant to settle even unmeritorious claims.'' That  is pretty powerful from a Supreme Court Justice talking about these  issues.   Judge Diane Wood of the Seventh Circuit Court of appeals, appointed  by President Clinton back in the day, has explained that class  certification ``is, in effect, the whole case.''   Then-Chief Judge of the Seventh Circuit Richard Posner explained that  certification of a class action, even one lacking merit, forces  defendants ``to stake their companies on the outcome of a single jury  trial, or be forced by fear of the risk of bankruptcy to settle even if  they have no legal liability.''   Mr. Speaker, listen to what these judges are saying. They are saying,  number one, that the class certification is the most important thing  because it depends on the outcomes and forces settlements. Notice what  was said here by Supreme Court Justice Ginsberg, ``unmeritorious  claims.'' Judge Diane Wood, Seventh Circuit, talked about it being  ``the whole case.'' Judge Posner says that, in actuality, they are  forced to settle ``even if they have no legal liability.''   In another Seventh Circuit Court decision, the court wrote: ``One  possible solution to this problem is requiring judges to do some  threshold level of review of the merits of a class action before  allowing certification, that is, approval of a class . . . It is cases  like the one before us that demonstrate precisely why the courts, and  Congress, ought to be on the lookout for ways to correct class action  abuses. Given the complexity of our legal system, it is impossible to  develop perfect standards for identifying and quickly disposing  of frivolous claims. Inevitably this court and other courts will be  faced with the cases that waste the time and money of everybody. Beyond  addressing the legal claims before us as we would in any ordinary case,  we must frankly identify situations where we suspect the lawyers,  rather than the claimants, are the only potential beneficiaries.''    Again, not coming in a vacuum, it is coming from the courts who see  this on a regular basis, from Judge Ginsberg on down, saying: This is  the whole deal. This is why we do these things.   Mr. Speaker, this is something that does need to be taken up. It is  something that we are proud to bring to the floor. In doing so, I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think what we are hearing today--and I think what we  are going through in the process--is issues of real change, issues of  discussions that have been going on in our country for really now  almost 8 years. It has been 7 years since the Affordable Care Act,  ObamaCare, was passed.   We are seeing the changes that have taken place, Mr. Speaker, from  your time here and my time here on really dealing with the American  people and dealing with the substances of what their concerns and fears  are. The things that I have come before this body and debated many  times were what does the view look like from outside of this Chamber.   Inside this Chamber, we have raucous debates. We have discussions on  things. And at the end of the day, I believe sometimes, Mr. Speaker,  those sitting at home say: Does anybody listen to me? Does anybody hear  my call?   Over the past few years, we have seen through election results and we  have seen through times of change here in this body that the Affordable  Care Act is nothing like affordable. In fact, as many have described  it, it has been in a death spiral. We are beginning to work on that.  [[Page H1966]]    Now, I understand how that can make the other side, the ones who gave  us the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, not want to see that changed. I  can appreciate that.   Reality must set in at some point, and reality says that to defend  something that is failing is asking for a status quo that hurts people.  Now, I believe my friends across the aisle don't want to do that, but  that is what they are doing, holding onto a legacy that is only a  legacy for many of heartbreak and problems.   Did it help in some ways? Are we finding some? Did we address issues  over the past few years and begin the discussion of preexisting  conditions, keeping our children on until 26, and removing caps? Those  were all discussed and could have been handled in many different ways  besides the government takeover of health care.   Instead, we chose to use an ideological position to begin the process  of moving forward, and moving forward in which government will put its  fingers on the scale and government will begin to say what is right and  what is wrong. What we found in the whole process was our individual  mark is destroyed.   I have had some of my colleagues actually say: Let's just start over  and go back to the way it was. That would be nice, except that land  doesn't exist anymore.   Even if you wanted to--and I don't think we need to--we need to move  forward with free-market solutions that put access to affordable health  care for all Americans on the table, so that we can actually bend the  cost curve so that we can actually work to help people. That is what we  are working on. We are going to continue to work on making a smooth  transition from the disaster that many of us have seen over the past  few years. When we do that, change will come, and change is hard.   My folks back home are looking for change that helps, by Brittany  Ivey, who joined me here for the joint session just a few weeks ago,  who had employer-based health coverage with her family taken. She had  to make choices about healthcare coverage and staying home. These  choices make families' decisions harder because they would rather make  the decision to stay with family, but are having to work because health  care became unaffordable. It is these kind of choices that we are  laying out for the American people to listen and to say: What do we  need to do and how do we need to go forward?   So when we look ahead, we take issues of health care seriously. The  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter) is a friend. She states her  position eloquently. It is always good to be on the floor with her. We  disagree, and this is the place for this disagreement. This is a time  in which we share; this is a time in which we come together. And what  the Republican majority will do, Mr. Speaker, is keep its promises.   Now, I have had a moment of sharing what we are doing in health care,  but also let's get back to why we are here, for the rule. The rule  deals with abuses in the system; it deals with fairness.   Mr. Speaker, today we are discussing reforms to our litigation system  that increase fairness, balance, and transparency. These principles are  part of our larger goals as House Republicans to create a system that  works better for the American people and restores accountability to the  system.   We agree that there are legitimate lawsuits and legitimate class  action suits. No one is arguing against that. In fact, I firmly believe  that Americans should have access to a robust legal system that  protects them.   We encounter a problem, however, when frivolous lawsuits are lobbed  against small businesses and employers in attempts to profit without  warrant and at the expense of jobs.   The bills provided for by the underlying rule help us address this  challenge and to ensure that the litigation system functions as  intended, rather than being manipulated to improperly target  individuals or entities for profit.   The rule itself provides for robust debate on the legislation and  amendments from both sides of the aisle.   I would encourage my colleagues to look favorably on these bills as a  step toward reining in unnecessary and burdensome litigation and making  the legal system work better to address true grievances and harms.   Mr. Speaker, that last statement probably sums up what we need to be  about here. Let's look at the truth. Let's help people. Let's remember  why we are here and, that is, those who sent us.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 180 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        Sec. 3. In rule XXI add the following new clause:        13. (a) It shall not be in order to consider a measure or       matter proposing to repeal or amend the Patient Protection       and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the Health Care and       Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-      152), or part thereof, in the House, in the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union, or in the Committees       on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means, unless an easily       searchable electronic estimate and comparison prepared by the       Director of the Congressional Budget Office is made available       on a publicly available website of the House.        (b) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order       that waives the application of paragraph (a).                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
