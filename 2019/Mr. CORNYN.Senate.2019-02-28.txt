 Madam President, as strange as it seems, socialism is  having a bit of a resurgence here in the Nation's Capital these days.   Why, you might ask, has this failed economic theory that is so  destructive of individual freedom captured the attention of some of our  friends in the Democratic Party? I admit, to me, it is somewhat of a  mystery.   My guess is I am not the only one who assumed that every American has  learned the lessons of history and that those lessons are common  knowledge. Apparently not. One other possibility is that socialism is a  stalking horse for other, less obvious goals. I will have more to say  about what the Founders believed about the concentration of government  power that would be needed to implement these utopian schemes at a  later time. I also will return to the Senate floor at another time to  talk about the well-funded efforts, including in the State of Texas, to  advance the cause of socialism, unbeknownst to most of my fellow  Texans.   Maybe self-identified socialists or democratic socialists--by the  way, that is an impossible contradiction in terms. You can't be  democratic and a socialist at the same time. Obviously, people put  those two terms together to try to mask their true intentions.   Obviously, these self-identified democratic socialists have never  learned what it is or what it stands for. Recent polling suggests that  Americans have vastly different ideas about what socialism really  means. A Gallup poll, for example, found that 23 percent of the people  who responded understood that it means economic equality--though the  definition of what equality looks like varies pretty significantly.  About the same number of people said they didn't know or had no opinion  of what socialism means. Roughly 17 percent understand it to mean  government ownership or control of business and the economy.   There were a variety of answers, ranging from government-guaranteed  benefits to communism, to people simply being social and getting along.  That is what some people think socialism is. This confusion about what,  exactly, socialism is has allowed its supporters to push this  discredited idea back into the political mainstream.   The so-called democratic socialists are trying to convince the  American people that bigger government and less liberty are the  solutions to economic inequality. But they don't just want economic  opportunity or equal opportunity; they want equal outcomes. They  clearly want to put the government in charge of Americans' lives.   To be sure, they will not be honest about the means by which that  equality would be accomplished under socialism. They use a lot of feel- good phrases to mask the consequences of their argument. They say  things like ``give a voice to the voiceless'' or ``to achieve a more  just society.'' What they don't tell you is that in order to  redistribute economic benefits, you would have to marshal the power of  the government to coerce the American people to give up the fruits of  their labor in pursuit of socialist, utopian aims.   While socialists will not tell you what the government would have to  do to force that redistribution, they like to point to Scandinavian  countries as a model for socialism's success. But there are some  problems with that.   They will say: Look at Denmark. They have free higher education,  universal healthcare, and subsidized childcare, and they are doing  great. So, they say, socialism works. But facts are stubborn things.  For one, Denmark is not a socialist country. Just ask the Danish Prime  Minister, who said:         Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is       a market economy.    The left argues: It is still a good model. We want that.   OK, so how are they paying for all of these programs? It is certainly  not just from the top 1 percent of the wealthiest of Americans. It is  the middle class too. Margaret Thatcher once said: ``The problem with  socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.''    Let's look at tax rates. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the  world. In the United States, tax revenue accounts for just over a  quarter of the size of our economy. In Denmark, it is 50 percent--or  double.   Let's also compare our two countries. The population of the country  of Denmark is roughly 1/60th the population of the United States. In  terms of landmass, it is about 16,000 square miles. Texas is almost 17  times the size of Denmark.   So if the model used in Denmark is, one, not socialism and, two,  unaffordable, let's instead look for a better example of a country that  has embraced socialism. I would suggest Venezuela would be a good  candidate.   In the late 1990s, then-Presidential Candidate Hugo Chavez delivered  impassioned speeches promising to lead Venezuela into a socialist  paradise. He talked about the country's wealth being stolen by evil  capitalists and greedy corporations and promised hope and change if he  was elected. That sounds similar to some of the snake oil being sold by  a number of radical Democrats today. By the way, you don't see caravans  of people attempting to immigrate to socialist countries like  Venezuela. It is just the opposite.   We now know that Chavez's promises were empty and dangerous, and  while Venezuela certainly saw a lot of change, it wasn't the kind they  wanted or the kind they expected. The government took over businesses;  they shut down free markets; and they suppressed free speech. As a  result, one of the richest countries in the world is now among the  poorest. Basic commodities like food, medicine, and water are in short  supply; freedom of the press has disappeared; crime rates have  skyrocketed; and millions have fled.   Of course, it is no surprise that self-proclaimed socialists in the  United  [[Page S1565]]  States refuse to accept this as an example of socialism. But this is  the truth. That is why socialism must be soundly rejected.   Sir Winston Churchill, who had an incredible gift for words, once  said:         The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of       blessings. The inherent virtue of Socialism is the equal       sharing of miseries.    Clearly, misery would be a result of a current fad celebrating  socialism, and we must firmly and clearly reject it.   In a society like ours, based on the free enterprise system, business  owners compete for business and make decisions based on what the  customer wants and needs, and this helps keep the cost of living low  while offering consumers choice.   Competition and free enterprise are the opposite of centrally planned  and administered socialist economies and the only economic system  compatible with individual liberty.   In a socialist country, the government owns or controls everything.  If you don't like it or insist on going your own way, you will be  squished like a bug. Socialism forces citizens to be submissive to the  government's plan--a far cry from the freedoms and liberties promised  under our Constitution.   Most Americans don't want the government to run their lives. They  want less government, which is to say they want more freedom. So while  things like free healthcare or free higher education or free housing  sound pretty good superficially, they are a fantasy and part of the  agenda to move the United States toward a socialist, government- controlled economy.   Under our free enterprise system, people work to earn their living.  The harder you work, the more you benefit and the better you can  provide for yourself and your family. That is something we call the  American dream. But with socialism, that kind of motivation doesn't  exist at all. Why would you put in the extra effort? Why would you work  longer hours when you will receive the same pay and benefits as  everybody else? Why would you pursue an advanced degree and pour your  heart into researching new medical cures when you know, at the end of  the day, the person who chooses to do nothing will receive the same  benefits you do? Well, you wouldn't. That is why socialism doesn't  work.   In a recent Washington Post column, George Will defined today's  understanding of socialism as this:         Almost everyone will be nice to almost everyone, using       money taken from a few. This means having government       distribute, according to its conception of equity, the wealth       produced by capitalism.    The problem is, as he said, the government will take and take until  eventually there is nothing more to take. Once that happens, the  economy will tank; jobs will dry up; taxes will get higher to pay for  the benefits promised; and those utopian sentiments will not feel quite  so good anymore.   The enemy of socialism isn't greed. It is experience. That is why  there are no socialist success stories. Venezuela, the Soviet Union,  Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania--time and again, we have seen socialism  fail. That has been the universal experience.   As President Trump said in Miami last week:         Socialism promises prosperity, but it delivers poverty.       Socialism promises unity, but it delivers hatred and it       delivers division. Socialism promises a better future, but it       always returns to the darkest chapters of the past.    Slapping the word ``democratic'' in front of the word ``socialism''  doesn't make it any less radical or any less terrifying. In fact,  democracy and socialism are at war with each other.   This is not about lifting up the poor. It is about taking our freedom  away and turning it over to our government overlords and taskmasters.   As so many seem to have forgotten the lessons of history, I plan to  return to the Senate floor to discuss this disturbing trend further and  remind the American people why socialism is the enemy, not a friend, of  our country.
