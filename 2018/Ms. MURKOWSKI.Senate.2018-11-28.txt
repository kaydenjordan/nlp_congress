 Mr. President, I speak today in memory of a  friend and dear Alaskan, Ellen Campbell of Juneau, who passed away on  October 16, 2018, at age 96.   Ellen was the mother of McKie Campbell, who served as Republican  staff director for the Energy and Natural Resources Committee from  2008-2013. On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I take this opportunity  to extend condolences to McKie, his siblings and their spouses, and the  many grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces, and nephews who held  Ellen dear. She was a very special person.   Ellen was a native of Waynesboro, GA. She grew up wanting to be a  stewardess. That is what women who wanted to fly aspired to in Ellen's  day, but after college, her career took a decidedly different  direction. She went to work helping the war effort. That was during  World War II when women were needed to backfill positions held by men  who went off to war. She was a link trainer operator at the Atlanta  Naval Base and then went on to lecture pilots. That led Ellen to wonder  whether she might become one herself.   ``It seemed absurd to be lecturing about flying and not have a  private pilot's license, so I asked my father for my birthday present  if he would give me flying lessons,'' Ellen explained. Shortly after  obtaining that license, she applied to serve in the Women's Airforce  Service Pilots, the WASP program. The hardest thing about it, Ellen  said, was the fear that she would wash out during training. Ellen came  darn close but managed to pass the three primary qualification tests.   She served in the WASP program from its inception in 1942 to its  disbandment on December 20, 1944. Her  [[Page S7183]]  role was that of an engineering test pilot. Stationed in Jackson, MS,  she flew many different kinds of aircraft; her favorite was the B-25  bomber.   Ellen was one of 1,074 women who earned their WASP wings. Her service  and those of her fellow WASPs was honored with a Congressional Gold  Medal authorized by law on July 1, 2009. Ellen traveled to Washington,  DC, to receive her medal in March 2010.   When asked how she felt about her time in the WASPs by the Juneau  Empire, the first word that came to mind was ``service.'' She went on  to offer a favorite quote from Marian Wright Edelman, ``Service is the  rent we pay for being. It is the very purpose of life, and not  something you do in your spare time.''   These were words that Ellen lived by, during her service to our  Nation and throughout the remainder of her life. Ellen came to Alaska  with her husband Charles, who had been recruited to head the Alaska  Department of Corrections. He retired from the department in the 1980s.  Ellen threw herself into community service. A person of deep faith,  Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Juneau was her anchor.   She ran a weekly Bible study group at Lemon Creek Correctional  Center. Inspired by interactions with women who struggled to reenter  society after serving their sentences, she founded Haven House, a  nonprofit ministry to foster healing and self-sufficiency for women  coming out of prison in Southeast Alaska.   McKie told the Juneau Empire, ``Without being naive at all, she was  convinced that everyone was good and had potential. She always saw the  best in people.''   Ellen relocated to northern Virginia in 2009, with Charles, who died  in 2012. It was there that she passed away, but Ellen's legacy will  long be remembered in Juneau, which celebrated her life in a memorial  service at Holy Trinity on Tuesday, November 13.   I am honored to pay tribute to Ellen Campbell, a force of nature who  helped people find the best in themselves.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, as the Senate returns  from recess, I wanted to speak in loving memory of Barney Gottstein, a  patriarch of Alaska's Jewish community, who passed away on October 21  at the age of 91. He was buried in the Anchorage Cemetery on October  22, in accordance with Jewish burial traditions.   I suspect that my colleagues might not be aware that Alaska is home  to a thriving Jewish community or that the origins of that community  preceded statehood by generations. One might be even more surprised to  know that Barney was not the first generation of Gottsteins to occupy a  leadership role in pre-Statehood Alaska, but the second generation. The  Gottstein family is up to four generations of leadership, with a  fifth--the great-grandchildren--now in place.   The first generation, Barney's father, Jacob B. Gottstein, originally  of Des Moines, IA, came to Anchorage in 1915, selling cigars and  confections out of the tent city established to construct the Alaska  Railroad. Jake, as he was known, then opened a wholesale grocery and  dry goods business, known as J.B. Gottstein & Co., which made sales  calls by dog sled. You can't get more Alaskan than that. Jake passed  away in 1963.   Barney was born in Des Moines in 1925, but soon moved to Anchorage,  population 2,500, where he was raised. He enlisted in the Army and  served in the Army Air Corps. After the war, Barney went to the  University of Washington studying to be an aeronautical engineer. That  didn't work out so well. He was told by a counselor that anti-Semitism  would likely prevent Barney from getting a job in his chosen field, so  he switched to business and economics and came home to work in the  family business, but he didn't abandon his love for flying. Barney was  a licensed private pilot who loved to fly around Alaska and beyond.   By the time Barney returned home, the family business was growing as  fast as the state. The focus had changed from dry goods to wholesale  groceries. Barney took it the next step. One of J.B. Gottstein's  customers was the Carr Brothers Grocery. The rest is history.   Barney partnered with Larry Carr to grow the retail grocery business  and pursue real estate ventures. Carr's Quality Centers sprung up  throughout Alaska, along with an associated chain of Eagle markets. By  the late 1980s, the Carr-Gottstein group of companies was the largest  Alaska-owned business in the State. Barney and Larry sold the grocery  side of the business in 1990 but remained in the real estate business.  Today, the Carr's name remains on grocery stores in Anchorage, Eagle  River, and the Mat-Su Valley.   In 1989, Barney was inducted into the Alaska Business Hall of Fame,  and in 1991, he was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree by the  University of Alaska Fairbanks.   Barney's business success in Alaska was deeply respected, but his  community engagement even more so. He was chair of the Alaska Board of  Education and provided financial assistance that enabled hundreds of  Alaska Natives to pursue schooling. He was an inaugural member of the  Alaska State Commission on Human Rights as well.   Barney was active in Alaska's political life as well. He was chairman  of the Alaska Democratic Party, Alaska's Democratic National  Committeeman, and an Alaska delegate to the Democratic National  Conventions.   I mentioned that Barney was one of the patriarchs of Alaska's Jewish  community. An early supporter of the State of Israel, he was the face  of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC, in Alaska for  many years. Today, Barney's son, David, leads the AIPAC group in Alaska  and in that capacity is a frequent visitor to my office. He provided  financial support to enable young Jewish Alaskans to participate in the  ``March of the Living,'' so that they might better understand the  legacy of the Holocaust. He visited Israel on many occasions and took  on the cause of supporting Ethiopian Jews who had made Aliyah to Israel  integrate into society and pursue advanced degrees.   Barney was not only a father figure to the Alaska Jewish community.  He was the patriarch of a large family himself. Barney is survived by  Rachel, his second wife, of 32 years, who not surprisingly he met on a  trip to Israel. Barney was father to seven children. Some of Barney's  children have followed in their father's footsteps to achieve positions  of great respect and prominence in Alaska. I am proud to count Robert,  David, and Jim among my friends. A fourth generation of the Gottstein  family, the grandchildren, are just beginning to make their mark, and  there are great-grandchildren behind them.   On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I proudly pay my respects to  Barney Gottstein and his wonderful family. May his memory be a  blessing.                            ____________________
