 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for yielding me  the time.   Mr. Speaker, as incoming chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science,  and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I would like to take a couple of  minutes to discuss that section of this bill and the agencies it funds.   We are currently on day 33 of the Trump shutdown. The impact is  growing as employees miss paychecks, individuals and groups dependent  upon Federal assistance go without, and our public safety and  scientific innovation is undermined. This is particularly true for the  agencies under the jurisdiction of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee.   Just last week, the Department of Justice had to scramble to find  cash to allow recipients of grant programs under the Violence Against  Women Act to be funded for 1 additional month.   The New York City field office of the FBI had to set up a food bank  for employees who are currently working without pay. We have heard  reports that individual FBI agents are asking not to be called back to  work so they can find paying jobs and that agents in training are  quitting the process, with no paycheck in sight.   The shutdown is also undermining scientific research and our next  generation of scientists. The National Science Foundation, NOAA, and  NASA are currently unable to award grants for ongoing research or  scholarships to ensure that our future scientists have the ability to  continue their studies.   At the Department of Commerce, key economic statistics are being  delayed. The International Trade Administration cannot investigate  unfair trade practices. In total, more than 90,000 employees at the  Department of Justice, which includes the FBI, DEA, ATF, U.S. Marshals  Service, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, are working without pay.   More than 90 percent of employees at NASA are currently furloughed  without pay, and more than 86 percent of employees at Department of  Commerce find themselves in the same situation--without pay.   The question I have for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  is simply this: Is this worth the cost? Should we imperil our economy,  our scientific leadership, and our public safety because the President  wants to waste money on an ineffective and unnecessary wall?   We all know the answer to that question, although some are too  afraid, unfortunately, to say it.                                time  1415    This bill offers us a bipartisan way out of this crisis. It is the  compromise that the House and Senate negotiators worked out last fall.  I think that bears repeating. This bill is the bipartisan compromise  that House and Senate negotiators worked out last fall. While the CJS  section does not contain everything that our side may want, it does  contain important investments in science, innovation, justice, and  economic development. In fact, with very few changes, this portion of  H.R. 648 very closely mirrors what the Senate introduced just 2 days  ago.   The CJS division of this bill includes significant increases for the  Census Bureau, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the FBI. It  rejects the administration's proposed cuts to the Economic Development  Administration, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the  Manufacturing Extension Partnership program and more. It is a  commonsense solution to the shutdown, and it lets our Federal employees  get back to the business of helping our Nation.   I urge Members on both sides to vote for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to close by saying what I said before:  we continue to push and push for this wall to be built. I don't spend  time on whether the wall will be big or small, cement or wood or metal.  For me it is simply this: this country, of all countries in the world,  should never build a wall. This country is not the country that builds  a wall. So in New York we have the Statue of Liberty, and in the south  a wall.
