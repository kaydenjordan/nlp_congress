 Mr. President, before I begin, I want to join with my  colleagues from Wyoming and my other colleagues here in the Senate and  express my sorrow at the news received this morning that our former  colleague Senator Mike Enzi had passed away.   Mike was a cherished colleague and one of the finest human beings you  will ever meet. A former Budget Committee chairman, he was, in many  ways, the conscience of the Senate on spending issues, always reminding  Members that Federal dollars are not unlimited and that every dollar we  add to the debt is a burden we are placing on our children and  grandchildren.   One of my favorite memories of Mike happened a few years ago when he  was a neighbor next door in the State of Wyoming. He was someone, as I  said, for whom I had tremendous respect. He was always a gentleman. He  had something that, I think, in politics is really rare, and that is,  he would deal with big policy issues here in Washington, DC, but he  always retained his common touch. He had a terrific way of connecting  with people on a very personal level.   I remember I was experiencing heel pain from overrunning, which, it  turns out, was plantar fasciitis, and I happened to mention it to Mike,  who at one time was a shoe salesman and a shoe store owner. Well, it  isn't more than a day later or so when he comes up to me and he has a  solution. He had some heel inserts for my shoes, which turned out to be  just exactly one of the solutions that I needed to deal with that. That  was very typical of Senator Enzi. He was thoughtful. He was practical,  incredibly hard-working, and very, very smart and very, very  principled.   To his family--to his wife Diana, his wife of more than 50 years, and  to his children and grandchildren--I want to say how much we will  deeply miss him and how much we are sending our thoughts and prayers to  them during this very, very difficult time.    Mr. President, there is still a lot of reason to be  concerned. The Department's reversal was cloaked in bureaucratic  language, leaving room for a future flip-flop by the administration.  Too many schools around the country are already considering or adopting  outlandish proposals informed by critical race theory, from a math  course that suggests that focusing on the right answer in math is  grounded in racism to materials implying that the nuclear family is  somehow inherently racist.   This is a grave disservice to students of all races, and we need to  make sure that Federal education dollars are going to genuine history  and civics education and not radical propaganda. We owe all American  students better than historically inaccurate history lessons.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds).   The result was announced--yeas 58, nays 41, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 279 Ex.]                                  YEAS--58       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Blunt      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Graham      Grassley      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Tillis      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--41       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Cassidy      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Paul      Portman      Risch      Romney      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--1               Rounds           The nomination was confirmed.
