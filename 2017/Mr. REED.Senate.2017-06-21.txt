 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    As a proud resident of Rhode Island and proud resident of  Providence Plantations, I thank the Chair for the recognition.   Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in expressing strong  opposition to the Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act  and to ask my Republican colleagues to abandon these efforts. They are  crafted behind closed doors, and they embrace a huge tax cut for the  wealthy at the expense of the most vulnerable among us.   Indeed, I implore Republicans to work with us on a bipartisan basis,  in good faith, to make improvements to our healthcare system. We can  make these improvements. I hope we can.   Just a couple of weeks ago, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  Office told us that 23 million Americans would lose health insurance  under TrumpCare. Let me say that again: 23 million Americans will lose  health insurance under the Republican bill. That is more people than  live in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, New  Hampshire, New Mexico, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont,  West Virginia, Wyoming, the District of Columbia, and my home State of  Rhode Island and Providence Plantations combined--a huge portion of  Americans. That is a shocking number.   What is worse is that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  plan to dismantle our healthcare system--one-sixth of the country's  economy--without so much as a hearing to get input on the bill. Their  bill is being written in secret, and from what we can glean of the  process the Republicans are employing, we likely will not even see the  text in the near future, although I am encouraged that there is some  discussion of releasing the text tomorrow. Regardless of whether it is  released tomorrow, there has been no deliberate consideration in a  hearing. There has been no thoughtful interaction between Republicans  and Democrats.   In sharp contrast, I was a member of the HELP Committee while we  drafted the Affordable Care Act. The Senate spent 25 consecutive days  in session on consideration of the Affordable Care Act, the second  longest consecutive session in the history of the Senate. The Senate  Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which I served on at  the time, held more than 47 bipartisan hearings, roundtables, and  walkthroughs on health reform. In fact, the HELP Committee considered  over 300 amendments over the course of a month-long markup, one of the  longest in the history of the Congress.   Over half of the accepted amendments were from Republicans. This  bipartisan input, along with testimony and consultation from healthcare  organizations representing hospitals, doctors, nurses, and patients,  among others, over the course of a year led to a better, more informed  bill.   We have a lengthy legislative process for a reason. Yet the  Republican leadership--up until this moment at least--continues to  write their bill in secret as they look for ways to convince their  caucus to support a bill that nearly every major healthcare  organization opposes, to say nothing of the 23 million Americans across  all of our States who would lose their health coverage, and millions  more would seek increased costs because of TrumpCare.   I would like to remind everyone that these are real people who will  be hurt if we go forward as my Republican colleagues intend to. These  23 million people are all our constituents, our family members, our  friends and neighbors. In fact, since the beginning of this year, I  have heard from thousands of my constituents from all walks of life,  through phone calls, letters, emails, appearances at townhall events,  and even those I see out and about shopping around the State or on the  airplane to Washington and back to Rhode Island. They have all  indicated how they have benefited from the ACA and how TrumpCare could  have a devastating impact on their families.   For example, David from Providence, RI, wrote to me to tell me how  his life has been affected by the Affordable Care Act. He said:         I don't usually write Senators, actually I've never written       a Senator. I have great concerns about my healthcare. I have       a preexisting condition, two heart attacks and open heart       surgery, triple bypass. I had medical issues and needed to       leave my position at a full-time job 3 years ago to get       well. During that leave, the company went chapter 11. I       lost my healthcare and had no income. I was able to       acquire Medical Insurance through the Affordable Care Act.       I started my own design business as a sole proprietor and       worked a second job to make ends meet. My healthcare was       subsidized for two years. I am now successful in my design       business and will be paying back the subsidy for this year       and no longer need the subsidy going forward. I am able to       purchase affordable healthcare through the Health       Connection in RI. Affordable healthcare and the subsidy       were there when I needed it. This allowed me to start my       business and become a successful business/sole proprietor       in RI. It is critical for my continued success to have       access to affordable healthcare and not be judged by       preexisting conditions.    As David describes, the Affordable Care Act gave individuals and  families control over their healthcare for the first time. He was able  to get the care he needed, regardless of preexisting conditions, and  able to start a new business. This is something I have heard a number  of times from my constituents.   I have also heard from Andrew and his wife in Little Compton, RI, who  decided to strike out on their own and open a dairy farm after the  Affordable Care Act was implemented. Andrew said: ``We took this plunge  and started a business knowing that the stability of health care was  there--we have a four year old daughter--and if it goes away, we are  not sure what we will do.''   Time and again, I hear from Rhode Islanders who are now free to take  risks and start new businesses and other creative pursuits knowing that  they will be able to access affordable healthcare. I ask my Republican  colleagues: Do you want to go back to the days when people are locked  into their jobs for health insurance? The only reason they are there is  for health insurance. Their creativity, their ability to innovate and  to invigorate our economy is stifled literally because they need the  health insurance. Do you want to discourage your constituents from  starting new businesses? Under TrumpCare, people like David, with  preexisting conditions, would not have the option, and Andrew and his  wife may not have been willing to take on the risk of leaving a job  with health insurance to start a new business.   However, as we speak, my Republican colleagues are meeting in secret  planning to take away these opportunities. I encourage my Republican  colleagues to meet with their constituents, to hear their stories about  the ACA. They are not unique to Rhode Island.   It is not enough to just ban insurance companies from denying  coverage to people with preexisting conditions. The ACA eliminated  annual and lifetime limits. In fact, yesterday I bumped into a family-- two families--one with an adorable little girl who had a tracheotomy  and who was being pushed around in a stroller. She is about 2 or 3  years old. And I met some other children, another young boy named Tim  with a tracheotomy. Today I found out that their problem is lifetime  limits. These are very young children, 2 years, 3 years old. Most  insurance policies, except for the ACA, would have a lifetime limit.  Now, you might be able to go buy it, but before these youngsters are  10, 12, or 13 years old, they will not have health insurance for the  rest of their life.   So it is not just the preexisting conditions. The ACA eliminated  annual and lifetime limits. When I saw those darling children  yesterday, I just knew that has to be the law. Otherwise, it is just a  matter of time. Maybe in 5 years, maybe in 6 years, but the kind of  conditions they have, at some point, they will hit that limit and at  some point the insurance company will say: No thanks.   We made those changes in the ACA. They are going to be disposed of in  the proposals I have seen. The ACA requires coverage of basic  healthcare services like maternity care. That is not guaranteed.   Before the ACA, insurance companies would cut off coverage just when  it was needed most and priced people with health conditions out of the  market. These are not abstract concepts. I hear from constituents each  and every day about the importance of the critical consumer protections  under the ACA,  [[Page S3665]]  and TrumpCare would undermine all of these.   Susan from Warwick wrote me to say:         ObamaCare saved my life. Please keep fighting to make       affordable healthcare available to all Americans. I was       diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in 2012. I have my own       business and pay for my own health insurance. We always       purchased what we thought was adequate, but I'd reached the       limit on my policy within just a few weeks of cancer       treatment. That left me with huge bills, a need for more       expensive coverage in order to obtain lifesaving treatment .       . . and technically with a ``preexisting condition--cancer.''    Susan knows that insurance doesn't mean much if you are sick and have  limits on your care. She goes on to say:         I am horrified by the Republican plan to replace Obamacare.       Health care is not a luxury. It should be available to all. I       never want anyone else to experience the fear I did when my       insurance ran out and I realized the care that could save my       life might not be available to me. Before we found additional       insurance--and jumped through hoops to get it--we looked at       selling the house, emptying our IRAs and savings account to       pay for my care. It would not have been enough.    Cynthia from Woonsocket, RI, wrote to me to tell me about how  TrumpCare would undermine care for people like herself with Parkinson's  disease. Specifically, Cynthia wrote about how patients with  Parkinson's rely on the essential healthcare benefits required under  the Affordable Care Act, including rehabilitative services, mental  healthcare, and access to prescription drugs. TrumpCare would do away  with these benefits.   Cynthia also points out that the average age of diagnosis of  Parkinson's is around 60 years old. However, TrumpCare creates an age  tax, leading to skyrocketing costs for this very population. Cynthia  also said in her letter that one-third of patients with Parkinson's  access care through Medicaid. She says TrumpCare puts all of those  patients at risk of losing care. As a patient, she knows better than  most that without these existing protections, health insurance will not  actually cover the care that is needed.    To add more detail on how critical Medicaid can be, especially to  seniors, a constituent living in a nursing home in Pascoag wrote to me  to say:         I am 101 years old and enjoy every day to the best of my       ability. I am petrified that many of the programs that I rely       on for my health and well-being, indeed my life, will be       reduced or even eliminated. Please protect my access to       Medicaid. DO NOT make Medicaid a block grant to the states.       My daughter is helping me to send this communication to you.       Please do not forsake me.    So I ask my colleagues: How do you intend to protect her access to  nursing home care while cutting Medicaid by over $800 billion? Block- granting Medicaid, as Republicans have proposed to do, will reduce  Medicaid funding by at least 25 percent over the next decade and leave  States unable to maintain current Medicaid programs, leaving behind our  most vulnerable.   Indeed, the most significant costs for Medicaid in my State and every  other State is nursing home care. It is exactly those men and women,  like my constituent from Pascoag, a vigorous 101-year-old, who will be  forced to pay more, who will be forced because of cutbacks in service  at the facility not to have two or three people on duty but just one.  All of that we can foresee, and we only can prevent it if we reject  this attempt to replace, to repeal, to undercut affordable care.   Now, this Medicaid crisis is serious, and it is not just going to  affect the healthcare sector because we know the pressure is on the  States to make up some of this lost funding. It will not just be by  transferring funds within healthcare efforts. They will have to go  everywhere through their budgets: That is K through 12 education. That  is infrastructure. That is law enforcement. That is all the things  States and localities do but particularly States. They will try to plug  the gap because they will have people, like I have described who have  written me, coming and not just demanding but obviously in need of  healthcare, and they will try to respond, but the response will affect  our competitiveness, our education systems, our productivity, when you  can't fix infrastructure, and it will be a profound impact.   In fact, a significant number of jobs in my State and a significant  number of jobs projected for the future are in the healthcare industry.  When this significant reduction of resources to the healthcare sector  comes about, the jobs will go, too, because without the resources, you  will not employ people--you can't employ people.   Let me share a letter from one of my constituents because it  succinctly describes what TrumpCare will really mean for this country.  Glenn and Paula from Wakefield, RI, shared a letter from their  daughter, Gianna, who has type 1 diabetes, saying:         Let me offer you a translation of what your votes mean: I       will die younger and sicker. Probably much sicker. My kids       will have a mother for less of their lives. Your votes are       what will cause this. Because no matter how consciously I       care for myself, no matter how responsible I am, it won't       matter if my insurance refuses to cover me. And it won't       matter for you either, if you are one of the vast majority of       Americans who will end up with a pre-existing condition over       the course of your life. If you think you can simply pay the       costs yourself, you are in for a rude awakening.    These are only a few examples of the letters, calls, and emails I  have received from constituents. The response in opposition to  TrumpCare has been overwhelming by the very people whom it will impact  the most. I hope my colleagues will listen to these concerns, not just  the Rhode Island stories I am sharing today but also from their own  constituents. People's lives are at stake.   I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to abandon this  effort to pass TrumpCare and start working with us on bipartisan  solutions to improve our healthcare system.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today, along with Senators Brown, Tester,  Blumenthal, Kaine, Duckworth, Warren, Baldwin, Franken, Klobuchar,  Cortez Masto, Van Hollen, and Menendez, I am reintroducing the Military  Consumer Enforcement Act to further strengthen consumer protections for  service members.   Our Nation has a strong tradition of working to protect our service  members while they sacrifice to keep our Nation, safe. Building on  these efforts, Congress passed the Soldiers' and Sailor's Civil Relief  Act in 1940 to provide essential financial protections for service  members to ``enable such persons to devote their entire energy to the  defense needs of the Nation.'' Now called the Servicemembers Civil  Relief Act (SCRA), this law provides such protections as prohibiting  the eviction of service members and their dependents from rental or  mortgaged properties and capping the interest at 6% on debts incurred  prior to an individual entering active duty military service.   Despite the importance of the SCRA's protections to our service  members, enforcement of this critical law has been inconsistent and  subject to the discretion of our financial regulators. For example,  according to a July 2012 report from the Government Accountability  Office, the estimated percentage of depository institutions that  serviced mortgages that were examined for SCRA compliance varied by  year between 2007 through 2011 at a rate of 4% in 2007, 17% in 2008,  18% in 2009, 26% in 2010, and 15% in 2011. Without a change in the law,  SCRA enforcement will continue to be subject to the changing priorities  of the financial regulators, which can also change with each newly  elected President. Simply put, prioritizing the consumer protection of  our service members should not be discretionary; it should be  mandatory. Our legislation ensures that SCRA enforcement will be a  permanent priority for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB,  which Congress created to enforce Federal consumer financial protection  laws.   In 2010, as we debated the authorizing legislation for the CFPB, I  led the bipartisan effort to ensure the CFPB would play a key role in  protecting service members through the establishment of an Office of  Servicemember Affairs, OSA. Since that time, the CFPB, through its  enforcement actions, has helped service members recover approximately  $130 million in relief from unscrupulous actors in the financial  marketplace and through the OSA's monitoring of complaints, the CFPB  has helped other regulators provide more than $60 million in relief for  more than 78,000 service members harmed by SCRA violations. Imagine how  much more the CFPB could do for our service members if it could do more  than just refer potential SCRA violations to other regulators and  educate service members about their SCRA rights. With this demonstrated  record of success in protecting our service members, the CFPB should be  empowered, as it would be under this legislation, to enforce certain  key SCRA provisions, such as the protections against default judgments  and being charged no more than the maximum rate of interest on debts  incurred before military service.   We should do all we can to make sure there is a strong watchdog on  the beat that can enforce the protections we have put in place. When it  comes to the SCRA, that strong watchdog should be the CFPB. Our  legislation is supported by more than thirty groups, including the  National Military Family Association, the Military Officers Association  of America, Veterans Education Success, Student Veterans of America,  Consumer Federation of America, Americans for Financial Reform, Public  Citizen, the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, U.S. PIRG,  Consumers Union, National Association of Consumer Advocates, National  Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low income clients), National  Community Reinvestment Coalition, Center for Popular Democracy,  Alliance for Justice, American Association for Justice, and the Center  for Responsible Lending. I urge our colleagues to help honor our  commitment to our Nation's service members by joining us in this effort  to improve the supervision and enforcement of the SCRA.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Tillis):   S. 1393.
