 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Kan  nomination?    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.
