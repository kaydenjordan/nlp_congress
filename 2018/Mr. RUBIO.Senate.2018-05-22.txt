 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the en bloc consideration of the  following nominations: Executive Calendar Nos. 840, 841, 842, and 843.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, today I honor Heather Anderson,  the Manatee County Teacher of the Year from Martha B. King Middle  School in Bradenton, FL.   Heather credits her students as the reason why she was named Teacher  of the Year. During the award ceremony, she noted that they keep her  going every day and thanked them for giving her purpose and meaning.  Everything she does is for her students, and she cannot wait to see  what the future holds for them.   Heather wanted to be a teacher since she was a child and said this  award is one of the most rewarding parts of her career. For students  who enter her classroom, she has committed herself to positively  contributing to their lives, promises to value and treat them with  respect, hold the highest standard for herself and students, and  monitor and adjust her work to ensure they are prepared for their  educational future.   In her classroom, students are able to use tablets to learn and  conduct research for their assignments. These tablets were not provided  by the school, but through a fundraiser she put together. She is  dedicated to seeing each and every one of her students succeed in  school and in life.   Heather is an English I honors and language arts teacher at King  Middle School. She serves as chair of the language arts department and  has been a teacher for 18 years.   I extend my appreciation to Heather for her hard work and dedication  to her students and wish her continued success in the years to  come.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I honor Catelyn Boze, the  Putnam County Teacher of the Year from Q.I. Roberts Junior-Senior High  School in Florahome, FL.   Catelyn received this important recognition because of her ability to  encourage students from all ranges. She challenges the gifted students  and helps motivate those who struggle. This dedication to her students  resulted in many striving to produce work that will make her proud.   Catelyn's success is built on three components. According to her, a  large portion of teaching is relational. When students know their  teacher cares about them, they are more open to learning. She  demonstrates this to her students by setting high expectations and not  allowing them to become unengaged. The second component is Catelyn's  creativity and deep content knowledge. This allows her to create  questions that challenge her students to think critically. The third  component of her success are two initiatives she designed in the past 2  years: student choice and nonzero grading. Catelyn believes that a  student who receives a zero for an assignment does  [[Page S2832]]  not give her the necessary feedback to determine what a student has  learned and damages their motivation to school. Instead, her grading  practices allow for end-point mastery, which she believes to help her  students learn.   Catelyn has taught at Q.I. Roberts Junior-Senior High School for 3  years and is involved with several extracurricular activities. As  yearbook sponsor, she doubled the size of the yearbook and increased  sales to where more copies were needed to be ordered. She also  cosponsors the Hi-Q team and attends school sporting events and  performances of her students.   I express my best wishes to Catelyn for her commitment to her  students and wish her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I honor Helene Hotaling, the  Marion County Teacher of the Year from Madison Street Academy in Ocala,  FL.   Helene believes what best describes her life as a child, parent, and  as an educator can be attributed to a quote from Dr. Seuss: ``To the  world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.''   Helene's parents were poor, had little education, and spoke broken  English. As a result, her initial introduction to school in first grade  was difficult. It was not until a retired teacher in her neighborhood  guided her to where she is today. That retired teacher, Ms. Nuesell,  saw she could make a difference in her life and taught her the joy of  learning. This inspired Helene to become a teacher at a young age.   Ms. Nuesell took Helene to the library and sat with her as she  struggled to read. This kindness and persistence paid off, and by the  time Helene entered second grade, she could read and keep up with her  classmates academically. Helene knows Ms. Nuesell did not have to do  this; she did so because she enjoyed teaching. Ms. Nuesell has been her  role model in life.   Helene is a graduate of the University of Georgia with bachelor of  arts degree in elementary education and a master's degree in teaching  reading from Barry University. She has been a teacher for 29 years,  with all but 2 years in Marion County. Helene has taught fourth grade,  third grade, second grade, and kindergarten, She is currently a third  grade teacher at Madison Street Academy.   I thank Helene for her dedication to teaching countless students  throughout her nearly three decades long career. I express my best  wishes for her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I am honored to recognize  Jason Lancy, the Lake County Teacher of the Year from Windy Hill Middle  School in Clermont, Fl.   Jason was not a math wizard when he was in school, originally  struggling with the subject. It is fitting that he has been given this  prestigious award while serving as the chair of the math department.  Jason said it was hard to explain how it felt to receive this honor,  though he felt it was definitely one of the greatest nights of his  life.   Jason's students tell him how he explains math is different and  easier for them to understand. He relates this trait to the fact that  he can empathize when they feel lost and confused with math. He seeks  to deepen his student's understanding and increase engagement by  teaching passionately and with a sense of humor.   By all accounts, he has a close relationship with his students. Jason  shared his feelings towards the night he received this honor by putting  the trophy in his classroom and showed his students pictures from the  event. They were ecstatic for him, noting it was a class atmosphere  unlike any other he had experienced before.   Jason has been an eighth-grade Algebra 1 and Algebra 1 honors teacher  at Windy Hill Middle School since 2007. He earned his bachelor of  science degree from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in mathematics  education and earned his master of education degree from the University  of Central Florida in mathematics education.   I express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Jason for his hard  work and look forward to hearing of his and his students' continued  success.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I recognize Angela Perry,  the Lafayette County Teacher of the Year from Lafayette Elementary  School in Mayo, FL.   The compassion Angela displays to her students and her demonstration  of being a model teacher to her peers led to her being named Teacher of  the Year. Angela credited her school's administration, colleagues, and  friends who share her love of teaching for her receiving this honor by  the district.   Angela's teaching philosophy is guided by a quote from Mother Teresa:  ``Not all of us can do great things, but we can do small things with  great love.'' She abides by this quote when it comes to teaching her  fifth grade students as they begin to transition from elementary to  middle school.   Outside of the classroom, Angela is involved throughout her community  by volunteering with her church youth's ministry. She has coached  soccer, basketball, and softball for local youth programs. Angela has  also been a board member for the Lafayette Babe Ruth Program for 14  years.   Angela graduated from Lafayette High School in 1992 and continued her  educational career by earning an elementary education degree at  Valdosta State University in 1997. She has taught at Lafayette  Elementary School since 2011, teaching fourth grade for 6 years and is  currently teaching fifth grade math.   I express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Angela for the  dedication she has provided to her students and community throughout  the years.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I recognize Amy Roberts, the  Columbia County Teacher of the Year from Summers Elementary School in  Lake City, FL.   Amy's colleagues describe her as an organized, structured  professional with proven teaching, motivating, and leadership skills.  These abilities undoubtedly contributed to Amy becoming her school  district's Teacher of the Year.   Her administrator noted that Amy works to ensure all students are  able to experience success during their academic career. One of her  former students remembers that Amy always did whatever she could to  help them succeed in school.   Amy is a firm believer in fostering a growth mindset and developing  lasting relationships with her students and their families. She views  these relationships as paramount to students achieving success in her  classroom, college, and in working environments.   Amy has been a teacher for more than 7 years, with most of those  years at Summers Elementary School. She is currently a first grade  teacher.   I am honored to express my sincere gratitude to Amy for her hard work  and look forward to hearing of her continued success throughout her  teaching career.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I honor Beth Rosenow, the  Monroe County Teacher of the Year from Coral Shores High School in  Tavernier, FL.   Beth received this important recognition because of her exemplary  marine science and leadership programs. Her colleagues note her  outstanding work in and out of the classroom because she connects her  class material to the outside world and keeps her students engaged.   Beth is known by her coworkers for her unique teaching style. She  uses hands-on techniques to give her students a firsthand experience to  the material they are learning. Her expertise and participation within  the local marine science community provides her with material for her  students. Beth's commitment to this field allows her students learn how  to assess the health of coral reefs and to report data to the National  Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.   Beth has certifications in fish identification, rescue diving, and  uses her expertise to challenge her students and herself. She began her  teaching career 18 years ago in Fenton, MI, and is coming up on her  seventh year of teaching  [[Page S2833]]  in Monroe County. She previously taught at Key Largo School before  coming to Coral Shores High School.   I am pleased to learn of all the hard work Beth has done for her  students and extend my best wishes on her continued success in the  years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I recognize Danielle  Summers, the Liberty County Teacher of the Year from W. R. Tolar K-8  School in Bristol, FL, where she teaches elementary school.
