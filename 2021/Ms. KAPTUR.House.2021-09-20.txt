 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight in support of the Biden  administration's new guidance regarding the Packers and Stockyards Act,  and heartened that the administration took swift and decisive action to  protect small farmers and local producers. Too often, local farmers  suffer economically at the expense of large integrators that practice  oppressive tactics in the marketplace and thwart the ability of small  producers to flourish.   The COVID-19 pandemic exposed great frailties in our food supply  chains. And while Americans are paying higher prices, 14 percent on  beef, 12 percent on pork, and 6.6 percent on poultry, the country's top  four largest meat processors have increasingly gained the lion's share  of the market since the 1970s. They control the entire market, the  largest producers.   Meanwhile, poultry giants Tysons and Purdue recently settled a $35  million lawsuit in which local contract growers cited the combination  of low wages and the financial demands of compliance with the  companies' barn standards that unjustly pushed them into a debtor's  prison.   The action taken by the administration will help smaller farmers  stand strong, achieve fair contracts, and come forward to speak their  truth, without the fear and threat of retaliation.   Congratulations to the Biden administration for doing something that  is fair and just.                            ____________________
