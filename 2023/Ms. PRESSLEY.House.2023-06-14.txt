 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Caribbean  American Heritage Month.   First, I want to give credit where credit is due and thank  Congresswoman Barbara Lee for her leadership which made this  designation possible beginning in 2006. I have to thank Caribbean  American Shirley Chisholm who was the first Black woman to serve in  Congress. I would not be here today if she had not blazed a trail.   Throughout the month of June, we come together to uplift and  celebrate the remarkable contributions, radiant culture, and deep  history of our Caribbean siblings, some who are the descendants of  those who were forced into migration due to the transatlantic slave  trade and those who migrated as Caribbean nationals.   I represent the Massachusetts Seventh which is the third largest  Caribbean population in the United States.   Dominicans, Jamaicans, Trinidadians, Bajans, Haitians, and more shape  our community and contribute to our economy, culture, and civic life.   Whether we are experiencing Caribbean Carnival, the third largest in  North America in Boston, or at the policy table working to mitigate the  impacts of climate change on our island neighbors, I am deeply grateful  to and for them all.    In honoring Caribbean American Heritage Month, I reaffirm my  commitment to my Caribbean neighbors throughout the United States.                            ____________________
