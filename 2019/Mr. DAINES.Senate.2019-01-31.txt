 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Marilyn Maddox of Lewis and Clark County. This week marks  Marilyn's 100th birthday. She is being honored this week at the Montana  State capitol, not only for her birthday, but also for 80 years of  service with the Montana Federation of Republican Women.   Marilyn was born in Chicago on January 31, 1919, and grew up in Ohio.  She attended Ohio State University where she performed as a  professional dancer and concert violinist. She joined the National  Federation of Republican Women in 1939 and still has her original  membership card.   While in Ohio, she married Thomas Maddox to whom she would be married  for 71 years. Tom, was a journalist with the Associated Press, and they  lived in several Midwestern cities before Tom received a transfer out  West to Helena, MT. They packed up their 1951 Plymouth station wagon  with two young daughters and two dogs and headed for Montana. Like many  folks who find themselves in Montana, the Maddoxes fell in love with  Big Sky Country.   Marilyn is an avid outdoors woman and loves hunting and fishing. She  also worked for the Montana Stockgrowers Association for many years.  Marilyn has 2 daughters, 6 grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren, 6  great-great-grandchildren, and a Shihtzu named Toby Wong.   I congratulate Marilyn on reaching this milestone and thank her for  her many years of service to the people of Montana and the Helena  community.                            ____________________
