 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in favor of my amendment, which  prohibits Department of Defense Education Activity schools from  purchasing and having pornographic and radical gender ideology books in  their libraries.   The Department of Defense Education Activity services over 66,000  military-connected children in the Americas, Europe, and the Pacific.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will mischaracterize  this amendment as extreme. All the while, the Biden administration has  spent the last 2 years promoting radical gender ideology to  impressionable young children in K-12 schools throughout our country,  including our military schools. Now that is extreme.   Speaking as the mother of four boys, enough is enough. I don't send  my boys to school to receive indoctrination from the woke mob or to be  sexualized by groomers. The same can be said for our servicemembers who  are also parents that send their children to DoDEA schools.   I will take some time to discuss the books that have been found in  DoDEA libraries that contain explicit sexual details not appropriate  for children.                                time  1845    One book titled, ``All Boys Aren't Blue,'' published in April 2022 is  a book included in DoDEA libraries. It is described as a nonfiction  ``manifesto'' by George Johnson that includes lines with sexually  explicit content. The book describes oral sex, ejaculation, anal sex,  pornography, and masturbation.   Another book, ``This Book Is Gay,'' also included in DoDEA libraries,  discusses the casual hookup site ``Grindr'' and includes detailed  information on how to have gay anal sex. This book includes details  about sex parties, orgies, and sex toys.   Another book, ``Gender Queer,'' by Maia Kobabe, again included in  DoDEA libraries, contains explicit imagery of oral sex.   ``Middle School Is a Drag'' by Greg Howard, included in DoDEA  libraries, is about a 12-year-old boy who starts a talent agency  business for child drag queen performers. One of the kids he signs is  an 8th-grader named ``Mistress of Madness and Mayhem.''   I see some folks getting uncomfortable in this room right now, and I  would agree that this is very uncomfortable, especially for our  children in K-12 schools.   Another book that is found, ``Some Girls Bind'' by Rory James,  included in DoDEA libraries, explores the journey of a character who  questions whether she is ``genderqueer.'' The teen binds her breasts  every day ``to feel more like herself.'' Chest binding is associated  with some medical risks, which can be permanent.   ``Julian is a Mermaid,'' found in DoDEA elementary school libraries,  describes a boy who wants to become a mermaid. During the book, the boy  repeatedly strips down to his underwear. Later he puts on lipstick and  dons a headdress. He is then given costume jewelry before being taken  to the NYC Mermaid Parade where he can freely express himself.   Here is the bottom line: Let's stop grooming our children, including  our military kids. It is gross. It is wrong. I am here to take a stand  against it, and I urge my colleagues to pass my amendment to protect  our military children from obscene content they should not be exposed  to.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would say that allowing these books in our  DoDEA schools is what is harmful. Saying that I am characterizing this  as pornography, no, I am saying exactly what it is.   As a mom, I am not allowed to show my children triple-X-rated videos,  nor would I. That is illegal. They have to be 18 to watch this. We have  ratings on things.   I am simply saying do not allow this in our children's schools. This  is something that is harmful. It is grooming our children and  indoctrinating them, and I urge adoption of this amendment to put an  end to it in our military schools.
