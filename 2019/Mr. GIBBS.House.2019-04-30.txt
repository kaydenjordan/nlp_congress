 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today to support H.R. 1449, sponsored by Representative Kelly.  H.R. 1449 names a post office in Olympia Fields, Illinois, in honor of  Captain Robert L. Martin.   During World War II, Martin joined the Army Air Force and trained at  the airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama.   As a member of the famous Tuskegee Airmen, Captain Martin flew over  63 missions. He was attached to the 100th Fighter Squadron, providing  air support for Allied bombing runs into Central Europe.   Captain Martin was decorated with a Distinguished Flying Cross, the  Air Medal with oak leaf clusters, and the Purple Heart. In 2007,  President Bush awarded Captain Martin the Congressional Medal of Honor  for his bravery in World War II.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 1198, which names a post  office in Henderson, Nevada, in honor of the city's veterans.   The men and women from Henderson, Nevada--and all veterans--who  fought to protect this Nation should be honored. They leave their homes  and their families to defend our freedom. Veterans put their lives on  the line for the liberties we enjoy. Today, we celebrate and honor the  veterans from Henderson, Nevada.

H.R. 828 names a postal facility in Smithtown, New York, in honor of  the man who represented the First District of New York four decades  ago, former Congressman Bill Carney.   Congressman Carney was elected in 1978 to represent Long Island. He  served as a Member of this body for four terms, until 1987.   Before coming to Congress, Mr. Carney served in the United States  Army Medical Corps. From there, he went on to serve his local  government as a member of the Suffolk County legislature. Congressman  Carney is remembered as a lighthearted man of the people.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.
