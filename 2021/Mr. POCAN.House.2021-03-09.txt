 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the  Protecting the Right to Organize Act.   As a small business owner and union member of the International Union  of Painters and Allied Trades for 30 years, I know how important it is  that every worker has a union.   Giving workers a voice in their workplace, negotiating for good,  family supporting wages and benefits and worker safety are crucial to a  family's ability to thrive.   Democrats will deliver on this important legislation today, but it is  interesting Republicans lately have been trying to falsely rebrand  themselves as the party of working people while opposing the strongest  bill in Congress to give power to workers. The same Republicans who  fought tooth and nail to reduce stimulus checks and unemployment  insurance, championed union busting and prevented an increase in the  minimum wage from being included in COVID relief.   They claim they are the party of the working people. Their idea of  helping working people is voting for a $2 trillion tax cut for  corporate donors and billionaire friends but refusing to vote for a  $1.9 trillion investment in the American people.   Their tax breaks for the top 1 percent, by the way, even included a  provision that might make it easier to send jobs overseas. Yes. That is  fighting for the average worker--in China.   Please, if you are the party of working people, then I am a stunt  double, doppelganger for Brad Pitt. I hope you enjoyed me in ``Fight  Club.''   Today, on this side of the aisle we proudly stand up to protect the  right to organize for every worker.   We will stand up for better worker protections in a pandemic.   We will stand up for negotiating for better pay and benefits to  support your family.   We will stand up against antiworker so-called right-to-work laws that  inevitably mean right to work for less.   We will stand up for gig workers, for nurses, for grocery workers,  for meatpackers, for fast-food workers, for public service workers,  and, yes, for Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama.   That is what the party of working people would do, and that is why we  are going to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act this week.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two pieces of correspondence  from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Transport Workers  Union of America.                                          International Brotherhood                                                    of Teamsters,                                      Washington, DC, March 5, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I am writing       to state our strong support for H.R. 842, the Protecting the       Right to Organize Act (PRO Act). I urge you to support this       critical legislation and to oppose any weakening amendments       and any motion to recommit when H.R. 842 comes to the House       floor this week. The Teamsters Union believes that this       legislation is critically important to rebuilding the middle       class and to begin reversing decades of income inequality and       the erosion of worker rights.        Today, the economy is not working for working people and       their families. Wages have stagnated for workers across the       economy, while income has skyrocketed for CEO's and the       wealthiest one percent. In large measure, this inequality is       the result of a loss of bargaining power and the erosion of       workers' ability to exercise their rights on the job.        Today, when workers make the decision to stand together and       bargain with their employer for improved working conditions,       the deck is stacked against them from day one. Under current       law, unscrupulous employers, armed with limitless funds,       routinely violate the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and       block workers' ability to exercise their right to bargain for       better wages and better working conditions with impunity. The       Protecting the Right to Organize Act is an important step       forward for workers' rights, rebuilding the middle class, and       addressing inequality. It would restore and strengthen worker       protections which have been eroded over the years.        The Protecting the Right to Organize Act addresses several       major weaknesses in current law. The legislation enacts       meaningful, enforceable penalties on employers who break the       law and gives workers a private right of action if they've       been terminated for union activity. The bill would make       elections fairer by prohibiting employers from using coercive       activities like ``captive audience'' meetings and by       preventing employers from hiring permanent replacements of       workers who exercise their right to strike. It would       establish a process for mediation and arbitration to stop       stalling tactics at the bargaining table and help parties       achieve a first contract. Importantly, the bill also       addresses rampant intentional misclassification and ensures       that misclassified workers are not deprived of their right to       form a union under the NLRA.        Research shows that workers want unions. However, there is       a huge gap between the share of workers with union       representation and the share of workers that would like to       have a union and a voice on the job. The PRO Act would take a       major step forward in closing that gap, addressing income       inequality, and ultimately growing a strong middle class.        I urge you to demonstrate to the American people that       workers and their rights are a priority for this Congress. I       hope I can tell our members that you stood with them and       other workers in their efforts to achieve meaningful worker       rights and protections and better wages and working       conditions. The Teamsters Union urges you to vote yes on H.R.       842 and to oppose all efforts to weaken this bill by       amendment.            Sincerely,                                                    James P. Hoffa,      General President.                                   ____                                              Transport Workers of                                               America, AFL-CIO,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of more than 150,000 members       of the Transport Workers Union (TWU), I am writing to urge       you to support the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act       when it comes to the floor this week. This bill directly       addresses the needs of the middle-class in the 21st century       and will help ensure that our next generation economy is one       that puts working families first.        Our labor laws are designed to provide access to the time-      tested process of collective bargaining. Under the National       Labor Relations Act, certain workers, through their elected       representatives, negotiate with their employer over the terms       of their labor. How often will they work? How much will they       be paid? What benefits will they receive beyond their salary?       Through collective bargaining, these questions are answered       in a unique way for each work group and at each company. This       is an incredibly flexible process that has allowed TWU to       successfully negotiate contracts for everyone from airline       mechanics to bikeshare workers.        Bikeshare workers at Motivate (a company owned by Lyft) are       often considered part of the ``gig economy''. They are also       proud TWU members with a national contract. For many of these       union members, the majority of their interaction with their       employer is through an app--very similar to the way rideshare       drivers interact with their employers. These workers move       around a large geographic area collecting and repositioning       bikes in the same way a rideshare driver would pick up and       move passengers. Unlike rideshare drivers, however, bikeshare       workers' rights are not seen as incompatible with their       company's business model.        These workers and many others are proof that collective       bargaining is powerful enough to live on into our future.       None of the more than 200 current contracts that TWU has       negotiated and implemented is identical--in fact many of them       would work at no other company or among any other work group.       While the process mandated under our labor laws may be the       same, the outcomes vary wildly, allowing for growth and       change as circumstances shift and technologies evolve. All       workers deserve access to that process in order to better       their standard of living.  [[Page H1140]]         Unfortunately, the proportion of unionized workers in the       U.S. is near a 90-year low because of structural hurdles       which make joining a new union very difficult.        The PRO Act would directly address these issues and give       workers across the entire economy equal access to the       collective bargaining process. In order ensure workers'       rights keep pace with the new economy, the Transport Workers       Union strongly urges you to vote yes on the PRO Act and to       oppose any weakening amendments.            Sincerely,                                                    John Samuelsen,                                           International President.     Madam Speaker, it is interesting today listening to the  debate. I didn't hear anything about workers, trying to actually help  workers get a better wage or better benefits or better safety in their  workplace from people on the other side of the aisle.   But what I have heard over and over and over again are Planned  Parenthood, the Clinton Foundation, and Progressive Democrats of  America which, by the way, Madam Speaker, don't appear anywhere inside  this bill today.   I guess if you can't talk about what you are going to do on behalf of  workers, you are going to talk about Planned Parenthood, Clinton  Foundation, and Progressive Democrats of America, which, by the way, I  would  [[Page H1162]]  argue the free time they have given them this afternoon on national TV  is probably more than the donations that actually came from union  organizations.   The bottom line is the other party here across the aisle has over and  over said they want to rebrand themselves as the workers' party, and  yet they haven't done a thing today to prove they care about workers.  They have certainly proven for the bosses and corporations that they  are best buddies, BFFs forever, but on behalf of workers it is this  side of the aisle that is doing all the heavy lifting.
