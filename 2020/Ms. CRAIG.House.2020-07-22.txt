 Mr. Speaker, last week, our country lost a fearless  fighter and hero for civil rights, and we in this Chamber lost a  colleague and a friend.   Representative John R. Lewis' sense of fairness and of right and  wrong was always ahead of his time. That sense of fairness extended to  all civil rights issues.   His willingness to support opening up the 1964 Civil Rights Act to  add protections for the LGBTQ community was critical and personally  incredibly meaningful to me. My colleague and I, over my term in  Congress, found that we had something very important in common. We both  were adoptive parents.   His bill, the Every Child Deserves a Family Act, is another example  of his commitment to fairness, eliminating discrimination against the  LGBT community in foster care and adoption.   He took time to listen to my story of my fight to keep my son, Josh,  in a years-long court battle. He understood that all that should matter  is that children have safe, loving homes. He understood that right is  always right.   My heart tonight is with his family, and my commitment is to continue  his work to restore and protect the Voting Rights Act, to address  systemic racism, and to do what is kind, good, and just.   Rest in power, Mr. Lewis. We promise to work today, next week, next  month, and next year, just as you did for our lifetimes.
