 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a tragedy that  happened in Richmond a couple of days ago at the Altria center, in the  heart of our city, when gun violence erupted right at the end of the  graduation ceremony for the 2023 graduating class of Huguenot High  School.   Two people were killed: a Huguenot High School graduate, Shawn  Jackson, and his stepfather, Renzo Smith. It is a tragedy that is  really having a deep, deep impact in my community.   I wanted to rise to speak about those who were killed and those who  were injured, trampled in the pandemonium, the Huguenot High School  community, the Richmond Public Schools community. The Altria center is  a beautiful entertainment and event venue on Monroe Park in downtown  Richmond. It was built in the 1920s and was built in the Moorish  architectural style and was given the name of the ``Mosque,'' and it  was called the Mosque for a very long time.   I was elected to the Richmond City Council in 1994, and members of  our Muslim community came to the Richmond City Council and said: We  understand that this building has a particular architectural style. And  we understand it may even be sort of a tribute to us to call this  building a mosque, but it is not a mosque; it is an entertainment  venue. There is alcohol served. There is dancing and other things that  wouldn't be appropriate. And our Muslim community asked, in a very  respectful way: Can you come up with a different name for this  facility? It was in my city council district, and we acted to change  the name of this facility to the Landmark. And then a number of years  later, Altria, a company headquartered in Richmond, agreed to help  renovate the facility, after nearly 100 years, and bring it to more  21st century use, and the name is now the Altria Theater.   I spend some time talking about this place because, Mr. President, I  imagine you have places like this in Hawaii. These are places where  everybody has gone for their entire lives for events like high school  graduation. Virtually every public high school in Richmond and many of  the private high schools in Richmond and the surrounding community, you  go to a graduation, and it is at the Altria Theater.   Of my three children, two of them graduated and walked across that  stage at the Altria Theater. As a mayor and then-Governor and now  Senator, I have spoken at many graduations right there on that stage at  the Altria Theater. My wife, a graduate of Richmond Public Schools, who  was the Secretary of Education in Virginia and First Lady of Virginia,  has also delivered graduation speeches right there. We have been to  concerts there and theatrical performances there. We know this building  in every last square centimeter, and we know what it is like when the  Altria Theater is filled with a crowd of people.   High school graduation. I mean, think about it. I am 65 years old.  Think about, over the course of a life, the happiest days of your life:  high school graduation, college graduation, your wedding day, births of  your children. I mean, over the course of a life, there are maybe 5 to  10 days that are universal experiences for American people where it  will be in the top 5 to 10 happiest days of your life. High school  graduation is that.   For Richmonders and people in the surrounding communities, you think  high school graduation, the odds are, you are walking across the stage  at that theater. These Huguenot High School graduates had walked across  the stage. The young man, Mr. Jackson, had shaken the hand of Jason  Kamras, the Richmond Public Schools principal, had received his  congratulations. He was a young man who had done well in the classroom  and had a lot of challenges--a lot of challenges--to get to that day.   Often a graduation is that. It is an opportunity to thank everybody  who helped you, but it is also an opportunity to reflect upon the  challenges that people have to get to that day.  [[Page S2022]]  Back in the day, the grandparents would tell us how they used to have  to walk 5 miles through the snow to get to school. That may not be the  case anymore, but an awful lot of our kids have to do the equivalent-- the kind of psychic equivalent--of a 5-mile walk through the snow  because they have to go through challenges. Whether they were homeless,  whether they got a cancer diagnosis through school, they faced  adversity and challenges.   Then they get to this day, and they are entitled--they are entitled-- to celebrate. That is what they were doing. Then, as they are exiting  the Altria Theater, which is right near the campus of Virginia  Commonwealth University, and crossing the street to a beautiful park,  Monroe Park, directly across, these gunshots break out, 20 shots in  succession: families scrambling, knocking over people; vendors who were  there, knocking over citizens; people scrambling in every direction. A  young kid got pushed out onto the street and got hit by a vehicle.  Thank goodness, she is going to be OK. Others sustained all kinds of  minor injuries. Even those who were not injured, they will remember  this and be scarred by it for the rest of their life because one of  these four or five or six pivotal days in your life--the happiest days  of your life--for them, will always be connected to seeing a classmate  killed and seeing this happy day turned into an unspeakable tragedy.    I know how I think about my high school graduation. It was one of the  happiest days of my life. Having been in that building, I know how the  Huguenot community for the class of 2023 will remember their high  school graduation day, and it is a tragedy that the memory is so  polluted by this epidemic of gun violence.   Mr. President, I had the opportunity earlier this year--and I have  spoken about it on the floor--to attend another school in Virginia,  Richneck Elementary School in Newport News. On January 6, a 6-year-old  brought a gun to school in a backpack. It was a student who had all  kinds of difficult, difficult challenges. As his compassionate and  brave teacher, Abby Zwerner, tried to deal with the situation, the  student shot her. Thank God, she is recovering. Thank God, no one was  killed that day.   But I had the opportunity to go down about 2 weeks after that to have  an off-the-record, no press, no administrators discussion with parents  and teachers at the school. The degree of trauma--the degree of  trauma--of this happening and the degree of fear: ``Every day I go to  work now, every day I go to work now, I am afraid this might happen.''  ``Every day I drop my child off in the morning, I drive away wondering  whether I am going to get a call'' or ``I am going to get an emergency  alert on my phone or if I pull up at the end of the day, am I going to  be able to pick up my child and will my child be safe?''   My kids all went to the Richmond Public schools, the same schools  that include Huguenot High School, and my youngest only graduated 10  years ago. But I will say, my wife and I, from pre-K to 12, in that 13  years for each of my three kids, never one day--never one day--never  one day did we drop our kid off at school and worry about whether they  would be safe at the end of the day.   The shooting at Sandy Hook happened right after my youngest child  graduated from high school. There had been shootings at Columbine High  School years and years ago. But the reality of my own children's public  education in an urban school setting was we weren't worried about them.   But just 10 years later, what parent in this country who takes a  child to school does not have a voice in their head with some worry  about what might happen to them when they are there? Even if you live  in a community where there has never been a school shooting, that fear  is not absent from your mind because you have seen it happen in every  region of the country. You have seen it happen in public schools. You  have seen it happen in the Covenant Christian School in Nashville, in  elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, colleges.   Maybe I am naive, but gun violence has been a reality of American  life for a very long time. To me, it seemed, as a 65-year-old, that  there have been some safe spaces. There have been some safe havens.  There have been some refugees. There are none anymore. A church is not  a refuge. A synagogue is not a refuge. A mosque is not a refuge. A  school is not a refuge. An event space that is beloved by the entire  community because everybody graduated from high school there for the  last 100 years is not a refuge. A public park where you can gather to  recreate with your family and friends is not a refuge. There is no  refuge from this epidemic.   We talk about American exceptionalism. Often, when we do, we are  talking about the things where we are exceptional in a positive way. It  is important to acknowledge those things and be proud of them.   But there is an American exceptionalism to this, the degree of these  mass shootings and the absence of any place--any place--that is a  refuge is something that is exceptional about us in a way that is very,  very painful.   As you know, because of my time in Central America, I have a  particular connection with a lot of folks from the Americas who work  here in the Capitol, and they often come up to me and we shoot the  breeze and we talk in my somewhat limited Spanish about what is going  on. And I had somebody, earlier in the year, after the shooting at the  Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, come up to me and say: You  know what--in Spanish--you know, El Salvador is one of the most  dangerous countries in the world, but there aren't shootings in the  schools.   The homicide rate may be higher than here, but there is a refuge.  There is an understanding that you do not strip young people of their  innocence and subject students and their families to the threat of gun  violence every day.   We live in a country of no refuge, and I just wanted to take the  floor to say to the family of Shawn Jackson and Lorenzo Smith, his  stepfather--Shawn's mother has had to deal with both her husband and  her son not just being taken away but taken away on the same day, on  what was supposed to be the happiest day of their life. And she has  been interviewed and talked about how hard it was for her son to get to  this graduation and what a meaningful milestone in his life it was to  be there on that day.   But the last thing that I would like to say is, it is easy to give up  and be hopeless. I mean, I find, having been a mayor in Richmond when  the homicide rate was the second highest in the United States and  having been the Governor when the worst shooting in the United States  happened at Virginia Tech, and how sad it is that I wish that would  always be the worst shooting--it is a weird thing to say about your own  State. But I hope there never would have been a tragedy that would have  eclipsed 32 people being killed at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007, and  yet there have now been many tragedies that have claimed more victims  than that, what had seemed like an unprecedented one.   It can seem hopeless. It can seem hopeless. I just want to say to  students and families, especially to young people who are kind of  trying to grapple with the reality of life in America circa 2023, and  they are seeing skies that look apocalyptic outside because of climate  issues, and they are reading stories about gun violence, and they are  worried about a whole variety of things that maybe I didn't have to  worry about when I was their age: We can't be hopeless because we can  make progress.   Last year, for the first time in 20 years, here in the Senate, we  passed a bipartisan gun safety bill. It didn't do everything that needs  to be done, but we showed--not easily, but we showed--that we could  act.   During my time as a public official in Virginia, we have finally  worked our way into the ranks of one of the 10 safest States in terms  of major and violent crime. We were never in the 10 safest for a very  long time, but, sort of toward the end of my time as Governor, we got  there, and we maintained that position. The Virginia General Assembly,  which had long, frankly, been enthralled to the National Rifle  Association, whose headquarters is in Virginia, in 2019 and 2020  finally embraced a set of gun safety measures that haven't eliminated  gun violence, just like seatbelts don't eliminate all traffic accident  death, but have helped make us safer. And if we can do it in Virginia,  though we have so much  [[Page S2023]]  more to do, we can do it here in the U.S. Congress.   Thank you for indulging me and letting me just share the personal  nature of this reflection in my hometown, in this place where we have  spent so much time and that Richmonders know in such an intimate way.   And this beautiful building, now 100 years old, where we have gone  for generations to celebrate, it has a bloodstain on it now. And I am  sure that stain is cleaned away, but we all will see it, and we all  will feel it forever--forever.   I yield the floor.
