 Mr. Speaker, today we are considering H.R. 2225, the NSF  for the Future Act; and H.R. 3593, the DOE Science for the Future Act.  Both are tributes to the thoughtful bipartisanship of the leadership  and the staff of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, on which  I have the honor of serving.   Last Congress, the Science Committee found itself in the remarkable  position of discussing dueling bipartisan proposals to essentially  double the science budgets, which, needless to say, represents a big  change from years past.   Out of that shared commitment to the future came the thoughtful and  bipartisan NSF for the Future Act and the DOE Science for the Future  Act. These bills, which represent significant and overdue increases to  the budgets for the NSF and the DOE Office of Science, are crucial to  ensuring that our Nation maintains its leadership in the science that  will continue to change the world.   H.R. 2225 was specifically written to ensure that the NSF will have  the funds to accept a much larger fraction of the qualified research  proposals that it receives every year, which is the single most  important thing that we can do to ensure the health of the science it  supports.                                time  1715    H.R. 3593 contains aggressive but feasible budget profiles for the  existing programs of DOE's Office of Science. It has specific language  to reexamine opportunities to expand these programs into new areas  under these more ambitious but now, hopefully, realistic budget growth  scenarios so that next-generation projects in fields like nuclear  fusion, bioinformatics, energy storage, basic energy research, and much  more can now be contemplated.   As the only Ph.D. physicist in Congress, I urge my colleagues to  support these bills, which I am proudly cosponsoring, to provide our  scientific researchers with the support that they need to lead us into  the future.
