 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  worsening humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern  border. In the past 6 months alone, over 200,000 migrants have been  detained by the Border Patrol, nearly twice as many as the previous  year.   Currently, caravans of migrants are headed north with little to no  opposition by neighboring governments. The U.S. must demand regional  cooperation. While fleeing their countries to escape poverty, gang  violence, and crime, they fall victim to coyotes and criminals on the  trek to our border, including women and children.   Our immigration facilities are too full to house, and our court  systems are too burdened to process, these cases. This results in  migrants being released into America, most never to be seen again.   We have a moral obligation to American families across this land to  close these immigration loopholes, secure our borders, and restore the  rule of law.   Congress must fix our broken immigration system, and we must do it  now.                            ____________________
