 Mr. Speaker, the past few months have witnessed  one of the most devastating natural disasters ever endured by our  country. They include hurricanes, voracious wildfires in my home State  of California that have killed at least 23 people, required mass  evacuations, and burned more than 170,000 acres and thousands of homes  and businesses.   By acting quickly on this emergency supplemental, we are sending a  strong message that we are here for disaster victims, including our  fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. But this is  just a downpayment. We still don't have the final damage estimates for  many of the affected areas.   In the coming weeks and months, we will need to once again support  FEMA's continued recovery efforts, including in Puerto Rico, despite  the President's threats to abandon the people there. There will be more  to do to address unmet needs through the Community Development Block  Grant program and other disaster relief programs.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for this bill.
