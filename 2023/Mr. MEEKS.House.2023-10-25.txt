 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this extraordinarily important  resolution written with my friend and colleague, Chairman McCaul.    Mr. Speaker, 18 days ago, the State of Israel suffered the greatest  mass murder perpetrated against the Jewish people since the Holocaust,  when Hamas terrorists invaded Israel by land, sea, and air.   Behaving just like ISIS, Hamas terrorists murdered and beheaded  soldiers and civilians alike. Babies were shot and burned in their  cribs and reduced to smoldering piles of ash--babies.   Children were murdered. Teenagers were murdered. Men and women were  murdered. Elderly people, including Holocaust survivors, were murdered.   Hamas has also taken 200 of those who survived into Gaza as hostages,  including unaccompanied children, Holocaust survivors, and many  American citizens.   Mr. Speaker, Hamas' attack was truly unprecedented. When you consider  the size of Israel's population, proportionately it would be like  30,000 people dying in New York on 9/11. Just let that sink in a  little.   We must all acknowledge that Hamas is a cutthroat terrorist  organization that exists solely to destroy Israel. Hamas' terrorism  does not help the Palestinians. In this moment, it is critical for  Israel to know that the United States of America stands firmly by its  side in this battle against Hamas.   Mr. Speaker, what I am about to say next is also very important.  There are innocent Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank who seek  normal and free lives and want nothing to do with Hamas or other  terrorist organizations.  [[Page H5055]]  We cannot lose sight of this. We must keep them--many of whom are also  children--and their safety and well-being in mind. In the immediate  term, we must find a way to ensure the safety of those innocents who  are in Gaza's war zone, and I support the Biden administration's  efforts toward that goal.   The United Nations estimates that thousands of Palestinians have been  killed since the terrorist attacks on October 7. We don't know for  certain how many of those killed were civilians, but here is what we do  know: We know that Hamas terrorists used Palestinians as human shields.  We know that every single one of them would be alive today if Hamas had  not launched its terrorist attack.   We must be aware and do all that we can to stop this war from  expanding beyond its current scope. The administration and our allies  are working around the clock to send messages and warnings to Iran and  Hezbollah to stay out. President Biden underscored this message during  his recent travel to Israel.   Do not test America's will. This Congress will have Israel's back as  it degrades and eliminates Hamas' terrorist infrastructure. We know  that it won't take a day. It will be difficult.                                time  1545    For too long, too many have been willing to contribute to the  delegitimization of the State of Israel.   It is deeply concerning that even global leaders are already  whitewashing one of the worst terrorist attacks in history while Hamas  and its allies blanket cyberspace with misinformation about this war.   Just yesterday, Turkish President Erdogan said: ``Hamas is not a  terrorist organization, it is a group of mujahideen defending their  lands.''   This from the mouth of a NATO ally who has his own concerns about  terrorists as an existential threat to his country.   President Erdogan's rhetoric is dead wrong. It is rank with  hypocrisy, and its timing is extraordinarily dangerous.   The resolution before us is a bright spot of bipartisanship today  during a very difficult time in American politics.   Mr. Speaker, 425 Members of this House of Representatives have  cosponsored this resolution. There is no question in my mind that it  will pass overwhelmingly, Democrats and Republicans alike. Most  importantly, the American people believe in the Jewish state and  believe in its survival.   In the days, weeks, and months ahead, I know the United States will  continue to stand steadfastly with Israel to assure its defense and its  long-term security.   We will also, as President Biden has outlined, remain committed to  ensuring that civilians in Gaza have access to safe areas and continue  to have access to food, water, medical care, and other assistance  without diversions by Hamas.   We must also stay keenly focused on working to get United States  citizens and their immediate family members to exit Gaza safely.   I conclude, Mr. Speaker, by raising an issue that the United States  and Israel must address: What does a successful ground operation in  Gaza look like, and how do we achieve the goal of leaving Gaza to a  responsible Palestinian Government if Israel's effort to remove Hamas  is successful?   One thing is for certain--the path to peace will require more Arab  States to recognize that Israel has the right to exist and that we hold  firm and will make sure that we could thereby have a two-State  solution.   If you say Israel does not have the right to exist, you are saying  that you do not want peace. I urge our Arab friends to join the Abraham  Accords and acknowledge Israel's right to exist because that is the  pathway to peace in the Middle East.   To the people of Israel, I hope you learn of the passage of this  resolution today and know that the United States Congress and the  American people have your back.   We mourn beside you and are working to provide the resources your  government needs to defend you. We have deployed powerful military  resources to the region to demonstrate just that support.   We are working all of our diplomatic channels to assure your success,  and we are in this together. We will not waver. We will not quit. We  will stand with our ally Israel.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me start off by thanking my friend and  colleague, the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr.  McCaul, for his friendship and for working collectively together to  make sure that the world knows that there is no daylight between us  when it comes to us standing with our friend and our ally the State of  Israel, and I appreciate you.   When we first started this, after this horrendous attack on October  7, we had a conversation. We said, let's make sure that we put out a  statement collectively, us giving our opinions as chair and ranking  member of this committee. Then immediately thereafter, we went to work  on a resolution so that the world would know where the United States'  House of Representatives stood.   We thought we would get it done earlier, but we knew that the first  bill, the first resolution that would come to the floor after the House  resumed its business, would be this bill because this bill is so  significantly important to state that we have the back of our friend  and ally, and we want to make sure that Hamas does not exist.   Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege and the opportunity to visit  Israel several times. I have been in some of those tunnels. I have  talked to the people, and when I have talked to the people of Israel,  all they say is that they want to live in peace. When I talk to the  Palestinian people in Gaza or in the West Bank, they say they want  peace, but the Hamas terrorist organization when you look at their  mandate, they say they want the destruction of Israel.   You cannot have peace. You can't even negotiate peace if one side  says you should not exist. How can you say that you want a better  relationship if you are saying that Israel should not exist?                                time  1645    You can't forget the horrific terrorist ISIS-like atrocities that  were committed on October 7. You cannot be silent. You can't sit back  and make believe that it didn't happen because it did.   Mr. Speaker, I say, as we end this debate, thank you to the American  people for standing with our friend and ally, the State of Israel.  [[Page H5061]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
