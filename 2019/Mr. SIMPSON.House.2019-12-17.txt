 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1865, the Further  Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2020, and particularly  division C, the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act.   Madam Speaker, before I get into the details of the bill, I would  like to thank several Members involved in this effort: my chairwoman,  Marcy Kaptur, and our Senate partners, Lamar Alexander and Dianne  Feinstein. The four of us have now worked several Energy and Water  conferences together, and I continue to appreciate the collegiality and  determination to advance national and constituent interests that my  colleagues bring to the discussions.   Madam Speaker, I would also like to thank our full committee  leadership, Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Granger here in the  House and Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy in the Senate, for  their leadership and support throughout this year's process.   As ranking member of the House Energy and Water Appropriations  Subcommittee, I believe this fiscal year 2020 Energy and Water bill is  a good bill, and I am pleased that so many House Republican priorities  are included in this final bill.   First and foremost, the bill strongly supports our national nuclear  security programs, providing a total $16.7 billion for the National  Nuclear Security Administration, including weapons activities, defense  nuclear nonproliferation, and naval reactors.   Weapons activities specifically is funded at $12.5 billion, an  increase of $1.4 billion above fiscal year 2019. Within this amount,  the bill fully funds the maintenance and modernization of our nuclear  weapons systems, including each nuclear weapon life extension,  alteration, and modification program, as well as activities to rebuild  production capabilities for strategic materials, such as plutonium  pits.   Next, the bill includes substantial investments in our Nation's water  resources infrastructure. The Corps of Engineers is funded at a total  of $7.65 billion, an increase of $651 million above last year.   Within this amount, an estimated $1.63 billion is for the Harbor  Maintenance Trust Fund activities. That level exceeds the annual HMTF  target. In fact, it represents 91.5 percent of the estimated revenues,  compared to the revenue fiscal year 2020 target of 80 percent  established in WRRDA in 2014.   Finally, one of my personal priorities, the bill promotes innovation  and growth in nuclear energy, funding research, development, and  demonstration activities at $1.3 billion, an increase of $160 million  above fiscal year 2019.   Within this amount, the bill establishes a new advanced nuclear  reactor demonstration program. The goal is to build two demonstration  reactors by the mid-2020s, in a move towards commercializing the next  generation of carbon-free nuclear energy technology to be deployed here  in the United States and around the globe.   I am also pleased to see several provisions included in other  divisions of this bill. Specifically, the Interior and Environment  Appropriations bill includes many important policies and funding  provisions to ensure that sage grouse remain off the endangered species  list.   The agreement could not be more important for rural counties thanks  to full funding for PILT and 2 years of SRS funding.   This agreement is historic because it will be the first time the  Forest Service and the Department of the Interior will have access to  budget cap adjustments for wildfire fighting. This allows wildfires  finally to receive equal treatment with other natural disasters and  allows our land management agencies to focus on prevention efforts to  get ahead of the issue.   In the Agriculture Appropriations bill, this agreement delivers vital  research funding for potatoes, grain, and other commodities, and it  signals an important step forward for the sheep station in Dubois,  Idaho, and acknowledges the diverse stakeholders who seek to  collaborate and grow future research at the station. I am eager to  continue the momentum to build capacity at Dubois.                                time  1245    Finally, and probably most importantly, I thank the staff of all of  our subcommittees, but particularly the ones I work with on Interior  and Energy and Water. They do a tremendous job for us. They are here on  weekends. They are here during holidays and other times behind the  scenes, actually putting together these bills. This is a job we could  not do without their support.   All in all, this appropriations package, including the Energy and  Water division, is a strong bill that incorporates many priorities, and  I urge my colleagues to support it.
