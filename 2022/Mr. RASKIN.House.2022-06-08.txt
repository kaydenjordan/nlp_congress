 Madam Speaker, the blood bath continues. Gun violence has  now become the number one cause of death of children in the United  States. We have rates of gun violence and gun deaths 20 times higher  than any other industrialized nations like France, the United Kingdom,  Japan, and Israel. No other nation comes close to what we are seeing.  That is 200 percent higher than our peer countries.  [[Page H5358]]    The American people want change and action, but the minority invites  us to believe that the bloody carnage piling up around the country from  Buffalo to Uvalde, from Newtown to Las Vegas is a necessary feature of  our Second Amendment.   We are invited to believe that all of the lost sons, daughters,  mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters of America are the necessary  collateral damage of their fidelity to the Second Amendment.   Our family members must be sacrificed to a completely false vision of  the Second Amendment. It is a lie. It is a lie based on a totally bogus  misreading of the Second Amendment and what the Supreme Court has  actually said about it.   Read Justice Scalia in Heller v. District of Columbia. No, he says,  the right to guns is not an unlimited right. No, he says, the Second  Amendment right is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever,  in any manner whatsoever, and for whatever purpose. No.   The Second Amendment is not the only right in the Bill of Rights that  is not subject to reasonable regulation in the interest of public  safety and public security. He specifically upheld reasonable gun  safety regulations, including bans on carrying a concealed weapon, the  possession of firearms by felons and other people who shouldn't have  guns; laws forbidding carrying firearms in schools and government  buildings; laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the sale and  purchase of firearms.   Stop hiding behind the Second Amendment. Take responsibility for your  irresponsible position.
