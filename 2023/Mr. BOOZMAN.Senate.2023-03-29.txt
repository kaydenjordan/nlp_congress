 Madam President, I rise today to recognize  Faulkner County, Arkansas's 150th anniversary. Founded on April 12,  1873, Faulkner County has a rich history that is as diverse and vibrant  as the rolling hills and farmland that make up its landscape. With the  establishment of a railway station in the county seat of Conway, people  started to settle in the area. Since then, thousands have come to know  the area as home.   Named after the legendary Sandy Faulkner who was instrumental in the  early development of Arkansas, Faulkner County has become a beacon of  culture and community in the heart of The Natural State. From the  official  [[Page S1046]]  state historic song, ``Arkansas Traveler,'' to the renowned Toad Suck  Daze festival, Faulkner County has been proud to embrace its heritage  and celebrate its unique identity.   With around 125,000 residents, Faulkner County is now the State's  sixth most populated county and home to a thriving economy that has  enhanced the quality of life. In Conway, also known as the City of  Colleges, students at the University of Central Arkansas, Hendrix  College, and Central Baptist College enrich its social life and culture  during the school year and long after graduation.   The county's proximity to Little Rock and major transportation routes  makes it an ideal location for industry and business, while Lake Conway  and Cadron Creek provide ample opportunities for recreation and  relaxation.   As we mark this historic milestone, we celebrate the generations of  families, workers, and leaders who have made Faulkner County the  wonderful place it is today. From the pioneering settlers who first  carved out a life in this beautiful land, to the innovative businesses  and industries that now call it home, Faulkner County has always been  defined by its spirit of resilience and determination.   Congratulations to the entire community on the 150th anniversary. I  applaud the Faulkner County Historical Society for planning  celebrations for all to enjoy and commemorate this occasion. I look  forward to continuing working with area leaders to support their vision  for future growth.                            ____________________
