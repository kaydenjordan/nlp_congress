 Mr. Speaker, this is about Members of Congress  doing their job.   The number one function of a Congress is to put out a budget. This  Congress spent the last 6 to 8 months giving away $2 trillion to the  wealthiest people in the country, and now we come to do a budget and  say: Well, we don't have any money.   We have priorities here, and it is about taking care of people who  are getting hurt.   It is about a gentleman who drove a truck for 40 years, missing  baseball games and soccer matches because he was on the road. Now that  he needs his pension, it is cut in half, and this Congress isn't doing  a damn thing about it.   It is about the coal miner who climbed into a dirty hole for 40 years  and now wants a pension. The Republican leadership here is absent.   It is about healthcare for kids, and it is about 11 million kids who  are going to law school, going to college, going to med school, and all  they want is a chance to sleep good at night.   This Congress needs to get back to work.                            ____________________
