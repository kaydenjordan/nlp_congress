 Madam Speaker, I rise with a sense of righteous  indignation to support this resolution.   I know racism when I see it. I know racism when I feel it. And at the  highest level of government, there is no room for racism. It sows the  seeds of violence and destroys the hopes and dreams of people.   The world is watching. They are shocked and dismayed because it seems  we have lost our way as a nation, as a proud and great people. We are  one Congress, and we are here to serve one House: the American House,  the American people.   Some of us have been victims of the stain, the pain, and the hurt of  racism. In the 1950s and during the 1960s, segregationists told us to  go back when we protested for our rights. They told ministers, priests,  rabbis, and nuns to go back. They told the innocent little children  seeking just an equal education to go back.   As a nation and as a people, we need to go forward and not backwards.   With this vote, we stand with our sisters. Three were born in  America, and one came here looking for a better life.   With this vote, we meet our moral obligations to condemn hate,  racism, and bigotry in every form.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time.  Let's do what is right, what is fair, and what is just.
