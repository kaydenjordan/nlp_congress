 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Nancy Lombardo on her well-deserved retirement.   Nancy is the executive officer for the Clearfield County League on  Social Services in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District. For the  past nearly 20 years, she has been instrumental in leading several  programs that the league provides for the betterment of local  communities.   Nancy manages several programs, including Child Care Information  Services of Clarion, Clearfield, and Jefferson Counties; Children  First, which is a seminar for divorced parents to help cope with  divorce and how it affects their children; Safe Haven, which provides a  safe meeting place for custodial parents to have their children visit  with the noncustodial parent; as well as the Child and Adult Care Food  Program.   Nancy has given her time to numerous boards to advocate for  children's needs, day care services, child advocacy centers, children  youth services, and more. She has been a valuable and dedicated leader  to the league for many years, and she will be missed.   On behalf of the Congress of the United States, I wish Nancy Lombardo  all the best in her retirement.                            ____________________
