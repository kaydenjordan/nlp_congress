 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am on the floor this afternoon to honor a  friend, a colleague, and the senior Representative from Kansas,  Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins, who has gracefully and honorably served  Kansas for two decades in both our State and here in the Federal  Government.   While I am going to talk a little bit about Lynn's history and past,  none of this should be taken just as something that is being read in  her honor. She is a very special person who has served Kansas so well,  and she brings such tremendous attributes to public service. We will  miss her greatly, and Kansans will have benefited from her service, but  she will also remain a role model for many who look for ways to make  America and to make our State more prosperous, with a brighter future.  [[Page S7640]]    Congresswoman Jenkins grew up on a farm outside of Holton, KS--a  small town just about 100 miles away from Kansas City, just north of  Topeka, where she learned the value of hard work and perseverance. You  cannot meet somebody who grew up working on a dairy farm without  determining that they have those attributes, and Lynn has exemplified  that in every endeavor.   She was taught that what needed to be done was something she would  do. When you do it, you do it right, and every day you need to step up  and do your job to make certain things get done. That is a dairy  farmer, and that is Lynn Jenkins as a Member of the U.S. Congress.   Before becoming a Member of Congress and before being elected in  Kansas, Lynn was a CPA--a certified public accountant. She recognized a  real need for financial reform as a result of that experience, and she  used her skills as a CPA to benefit Kansas.   In 2003, Lynn was elected the 37th Kansas State treasurer. Lynn then  took that same tax and financial experience to Washington, DC, where  she was elected the Congresswoman from the Second District of our  State.   After her election to the U.S. House of Representatives, Lynn quickly  rose to become one of the highest ranking Members of Congress, serving  today as the vice chair of the House Republican caucus; she served in  that capacity for 4 years. She is a senior member of the House Ways and  Means Committee.   It goes without saying that in addition to her background as a CPA,  her intellect, and her service-oriented mindset, Lynn is one of the  most beloved Kansans we have. We meet with many of the same groups here  in Kansas and in Washington, DC, and I know that visiting with Lynn is,  without a doubt, one of the highlights for Kansans who come to  Washington, DC.   Lynn also understands that while it may seem that this environment is  a loud and boisterous one and that making your appearances on national  TV is an effective way of serving as a Member of Congress, she knows  you can really serve your country, and especially Kansas, by rolling up  your sleeves and just getting to work. It has been a privilege to  witness this firsthand and to work on a number of issues with Lynn over  the years. Together we jointly introduced the fair tax legislation, we  worked together to protect rural healthcare in Kansas, we made certain  our veterans received the benefits they deserve, and we are both chairs  of our respective Hunger Caucuses. We are both lucky to have Bob Dole  as a mentor, and we have made it a priority to carry on his legacy to  end hunger in America and around the globe.    Lynn was also a champion of the Mental Health First Aid Act,  modernizing section 529 college savings plans, and was an integral part  of passing major tax legislation for the first time in 30 years.   Lynn and I often have shared flights back and forth from Kansas to  Washington, DC. She has, like I have, chosen to remain at home in  Kansas, and we are often on the same airplane. I could always count on  Lynn to have the conversation of what was going on in the House and for  her to explain to me what should be going on in the Senate that wasn't.  We were able to take care of our constituents' business by being  together on that flight to Washington, DC, and on the flight home.   It also goes without saying that Lynn will be sorely missed as a  leader and as a sensible voice in Congress and in our Kansas  delegation. Her role will be so difficult to fill, but I know she is  excited about spending more time with her kids, Haley and Hayden, in  that place we so proudly call home, the State of Kansas.   Lynn, I thank you for your many years of service and, on behalf of  all Kansans, I want you to know we appreciate, respect, and admire you.   Lynn, thank you for your friendship, advice, and your realness. I  wish you the best of luck and countless M&Ms in your retirement from  Congress, and in everything that comes next, may you have success and  may you have joy. Please know you will be missed, and we look forward  to spending time together as you tell me, still, what I should be doing  in the U.S. Senate.                            Tribute to Kevin Yoder    Madam President, I want to speak this afternoon about another  retirement from Kansas, Congressman Kevin Yoder, who has served the  Third Congressional District of Kansas for four terms. He is a solid  colleague and a good friend.   I met Kevin when he was an intern in our office when I was a Member  of the House of Representatives. I remember his tenacity, his spirit,  and his passion for serving Kansans, which he continued to feel long  after he was an intern in the Moran world.   Kevin went on to serve his fellow students as student body president  at the University of Kansas. He earned a law degree from the University  of Kansas School of Law. He then served the Overland Park community in  the State House of Representatives, and he became chairman of the House  Appropriations Committee.   As a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Kevin also served  as a member of the Appropriations Committee, and there he was, and has  been, a steward of Kansas taxpayers' hard-earned dollars.   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, Kevin has made  biomedical funding a top priority. I have enjoyed working with him as  we advocated for the National Institutes of Health and for the  University of Kansas Cancer Center, which was designated as a National  Cancer Institute in 2012. Kevin served as a real leader in Congress in  advocating for that designation, and it is a point of pride for our  State and the hope of many in our region.   He also serves as chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee  on Homeland Security, where he has worked to help protect our borders  and our homeland.   Kevin has been a steady leader in his support for Head Start,  understanding that education uniquely unlocks opportunity, and he has  worked to give underprivileged children a path to success at an early  age--an opportunity they unlikely would have otherwise.   Understanding the complex and outdated nature of our country's  immigration laws, Kevin has championed legislation that could garner  the support of both Republicans and Democrats that would end per- country caps on employment-based green cards, clearing the backlog of  Indian and Chinese immigrant green card applications, some of which  have been, unfortunately, sitting around untouched on a wait list for  decades.   Kevin also grew up in a small town in Kansas and was a farm kid, and  he also learned the value of hard work and the issue of being  responsible for the consequences of what you do. Kevin will be greatly  missed in our Kansas delegation and here in Washington, DC, and his  shoes will be hard to fill.   Kevin, I hope you are able to spend some well-deserved time with  Brook and your girls. I will miss our flights back and forth between  Kansas in which you were showing me photos on almost every trip of your  children. I wish the very best for Kevin, for Brook, his wife, and his  daughters as they enter this new chapter.   I also pay special tribute to Brook Yoder for her work side-by-side  with her husband. They, together as a team, made a tremendous  difference in Kansas and in Washington, DC.   So on behalf of all Kansans, Kevin, I say thank you for your  dedicated service to our State. Godspeed.
