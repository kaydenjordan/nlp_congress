 Madam Speaker, 44 years ago, the Supreme Court made an  important decision. It said that women have a constitutional right to  make decisions about their own health care and their own bodies, not  the government.   It was just a few days ago that millions of American women marched  all across the United States, reaffirming their opposition to efforts  to take away their rights. That is what this bill would do.   There has been a lot of discussion about taxpayers funding abortion.  That is not currently the law, not only in the Hyde amendment, but the  Affordable Care Act requires women who wish to have this coverage to  pay for it themselves.   We have heard a lot about alternative facts recently, but the fact is  there is no taxpayer money for abortion in the United States--there  hasn't ever been for many years--and that was also the accommodation  that the Supreme Court made.   Let's make sure that the constitutional rights of women to control  their own bodies is not attacked.
