 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my colleague  from New Mexico, Senator Udall, for his advocacy on behalf of the  pieces and parts of our healthcare system that are so important to the  State of New Mexico. Things like rural hospitals, opioid treatment,  Indian Country, he has been an incredible champion on those. That is  part of the reason why both of us come to the floor today, given what  is at stake.   Last month, President Trump and House Republicans rushed through a  disastrous healthcare bill that would leave average New Mexico families  paying thousands of dollars more for less healthcare coverage. It would  destroy the Medicaid Program as it currently exists in our State and  throw our entire healthcare system into chaos. Now Senate Republicans  are drafting their own version of a similar healthcare bill in complete  secret, behind closed doors, with absolutely no--none--bipartisan  input.   This lack of transparency and departure from regular order is  unacceptable and deeply irresponsible, especially when every single  American family's healthcare coverage is at stake if this bill ever  becomes law.   While we don't know for sure what the Senate Republicans' version of  TrumpCare will look like, media reports say it is shaping up to look  more and more like the train wreck of a bill that President Trump and  House Republicans celebrated in the White House Rose Garden just a  couple months ago, a bill President Trump reportedly said in another  closed-door meeting with Republican Senators last week was, in his  words, ``mean'' and cold-hearted.   The House-passed TrumpCare bill is devastating to low-income  families, to seniors, to Americans living with preexisting conditions.  This isn't so much a healthcare bill as it is a tax cut for the  ultrarich masquerading as healthcare reform. You don't have to take my  word for it. You can look at how the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  Office described its projected impacts of the House-passed TrumpCare  bill.   According to the CBO's analysis, TrumpCare would strip 14 million of  their health insurance next year and 23 million by 2026, all to give  tax breaks to the wealthiest of Americans. That is reckless, and  frankly it is inexcusable by any measure.   How would the bill do that? The House-passed bill, which again seems  to be the baseline for the ongoing secret negotiations here in the  Senate, would slash funding for the Medicaid Program by hundreds of  billions of dollars and end the need-based tax credits for individual  healthcare market plans under the ACA.   I have heard from so many New Mexicans who have told me how access to  healthcare coverage has helped their families and, in some cases, even  saved their lives.   I recently met with patients at the Ben Archer Health Center, a rural  health clinic in Hatch, NM, and heard firsthand how important Medicaid  coverage can be to families in Southern New Mexico. One of the New  Mexicans I met there was Anna Marie, a Las Cruces native who worked for  the Las Cruces public food service for 22 years.   Anna Marie's husband passed away in 2008, and when she found herself  unable to keep working following a minor stroke, she could not afford  healthcare coverage on her own. When she reached out to my office last  year, she had bronchitis and walking pneumonia. My staff helped her  enroll in Medicaid, and now she is able to get access to the care she  needs.   I want to take a moment to explain why the Medicaid Program is so  critical in my home State of New Mexico. As a Medicaid expansion State,  New Mexico has seen dramatic gains over the last 5 years in coverage  for the folks who need it the most. Stories like Anna Marie's  illustrate just how important Medicaid can be for hard-working New  Mexicans.   Medicaid currently provides affordable healthcare coverage to over  900,000 New Mexicans, including many schoolchildren, seniors in nursing  homes and long-term care facilities, people with disabilities, and  people who need treatment for mental health and addiction.   Just one example of the wide-ranging consequences of the Republican  healthcare plan's drastic cuts to the Medicaid Program would be the end  to any possible progress we have made so far in fighting the opioid and  heroin epidemic. The opioid addiction epidemic has been deeply felt in  communities across the State of New Mexico. For years, without adequate  treatment resources, our State has suffered through some of the highest  rates of opioid and heroin addiction in the Nation.   I would just note that today a story came out about how we  hospitalized in the ER long-term care or hospital care 1.3 million  Americans last year because of this epidemic. However, when provided  with an opportunity to receive comprehensive treatment and  rehabilitation, people who have suffered through the trials of opioid  addiction can and do turn their lives around.   Evidence-based treatment works, but it is only possible when we  devote real resources to pay for it. So much of that comes directly  through the Medicaid Program. As we can see on this chart, Medicaid  pays for 30 percent of opioid medication-assisted treatment in New  Mexico--30 percent. It is the foundation to build on for opioid  treatment.   In States like West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky, Medicaid pays for  nearly half of opioid treatment payments. This came up just last Friday  when the White House hosted its first meeting for President Trump's  Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. The  President's top advisers probably didn't hear what they would have  liked to from the advocates who have been on the front lines of  fighting the growing opioid crisis.   For example, Dr. Joe Parks, the medical director for the National  Council for Behavioral Health, told the President's Commission:         Medicaid is the largest national payer for addiction and       mental health treatment. Since the majority of increased       opiate deaths and suicide occur in young and middle-aged       adults, which is the Medicaid expansion population, the       Medicaid expansions must be maintained and completed.    It is nothing short of hypocrisy for the Trump White House to claim  it is taking steps to address the opioid epidemic when it is helping  Republicans in Congress push through legislation that would end the  Medicaid Program as we know it. Slashing hundreds of billions of  dollars in Federal funding from the Medicaid Program will ultimately  pass all of those costs on to the States. Let me give a sense for just  how big a burden that would be.   In New Mexico, it is estimated that our State government would have  to either come up with a way to raise $11 billion of new taxes over the  next decade or cut the equivalent amount of coverage for the hundreds  of thousands of New Mexicans who rely on the program. That is a hit to  the State budget of 1 billion-plus dollars a year. This would have an  especially hard impact on our State's rural communities.   When you go to small towns in New Mexico, like Clayton, Raton, and  Santa Rosa, as I did last fall on a rural healthcare listening tour,  you see right away the vital role hospitals play in rural communities.  In most cases, these hospitals are the only healthcare providers for  many miles in any direction.   Hospitals are also often the major employer in these small towns.  Rural healthcare providers face enormous challenges because it is  financially difficult to provide care to populations that live over  vast spaces and are, on average, older, less affluent, and more prone  to chronic diseases than those in more urban and suburban communities.   Medicaid expansion and the need-based tax credits for individual  healthcare market plans in the ACA have been critical financial  lifelines for rural healthcare providers. Thanks to the coverage gains  we have seen in New Mexico, instead of seeing uninsured patients coming  to the emergency room during expensive medical emergencies, our rural  healthcare providers are able to help New Mexicans live healthier lives  with primary care and a preventive medicine approach.  [[Page S3630]]    When medical emergencies do arise, New Mexicans have coverage that  helps rural healthcare providers cover those expenses. If President  Trump and Republicans in the Senate pass their healthcare bill, all of  that could go away, and some of our rural healthcare providers may very  well have to close up shop.   Right now, more than one-third of rural hospitals are already at risk  of closure. If you look at where the hospitals that have been forced to  shut down in recent years are located, they are almost all in States  that chose not to expand Medicaid. We should learn a lesson from that.   I know for a fact that if hospitals shut down, healthcare delivery in  rural New Mexico would be decimated and economic impact would be severe  in these small towns. It is estimated that when a single hospital  closes in a small rural community, nearly 100 jobs are lost, taking  more than $5 million directly out of the local economy.   A recent report by the Economic Policy Institute estimates that if  Congress passes TrumpCare into law, New Mexico alone would see a loss  of almost 50,000 jobs by the year 2022. Thanks in large part to the  major coverage gains that we have seen under the ACA, the healthcare  sector has been New Mexico's strongest area of job growth for the last  5 years. New Mexico added over 4,000 healthcare jobs in 2015 alone.   A couple of months ago, I met with students at Central New Mexico  Community College, CNM, in Albuquerque, who were training for those  healthcare jobs. These bright young people want to make careers out of  making their communities healthier and safer. With this dangerous  legislation moving through Washington, they are all worried about what  it might mean for their future career plans.   Why would we want to rip the rug out from under them by wreaking  havoc on the Nation's healthcare system? Again, you really have to ask  yourself why Republicans are so intent on rushing through a massive  piece of legislation before we can even understand its potential  harmful consequences.   As I said earlier, I have heard from literally thousands of New  Mexicans who have called in or written or come up to me on the street  to oppose this legislation. Many of them have told me how it will  directly impact their families. I could pick any one of these stories  to demonstrate what is at stake in this debate, but I will leave you  with just one.   Brittany, from Aztec, NM, wrote me about her two young children who  were diagnosed with a rare form of food allergies that created  absolutely unaffordable costs through her husband's employer-provided  healthcare plan.   Brittany said that she and her husband were averaging three doctors'  visits a week and were ``barely keeping [their] heads above water just  from paying co-pays.''   After applying for Medicaid, she and her husband have full coverage  for their children's medical costs. Brittany wrote to me and said:         For us Medicaid is literally lifesaving. Please do not take       away this program or any of the ACA! It may not be perfect       and could use some work, but taking it away altogether would       be catastrophic for so many people like my family.    That is what she wrote to me.   I want to urge President Trump and I certainly want to urge my  Republican colleagues in the Senate to listen to that urgent message.  It is time to turn the page on the disastrous policy path that is  ``repeal and replace'' so we can finally get to work on actually fixing  those things in the current healthcare system that we all agree need  work.   Our common goal--regardless of whether we are Republicans or  Democrats--that we should all be working toward is making quality  healthcare more accessible, more affordable for all Americans.   I would welcome a good-faith effort to tackle that challenge because  healthcare policies shouldn't be a political football. It should be  about giving peace of mind to the millions of Americans like Anna Marie  in Las Cruces, like Brittany in Aztec, who are only one diagnosis away  from a crisis if we don't get this right.   I reserve the remainder of my time.
