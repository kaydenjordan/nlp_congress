 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, as National Police Week gets underway and  we prepare for the coming days of solemn tributes and remembrances of  our brave men and women in blue and green here in our Nation's Capital  and across the country, it is more important than ever that we stand  here united as House Republicans and share our appreciation for all  that our heroes do every single day to keep us safe.   National Police Week is a time to remember and honor those who have  made the ultimate sacrifice for our safety and security and to express  our gratitude and support to those who continue to serve and protect  our communities across the country.                                time  2100    As the proud Representative of Florida's Third Congressional District  and the wife of a first responder, I have witnessed firsthand the  courage and dedication of our local law enforcement officers.   They are the ones who respond to emergencies, prevent crimes, and  uphold the laws in our communities. They are the ones who face danger  and uncertainty every time they put on their uniform. They are the ones  who leave their families behind not knowing if they will return home  safely.   Like so many spouses, when my husband puts on his SWAT medic vest for  a callout, I feel that twinge of uncertainty, and I hug him just a  little tighter.   It is a unique feeling to us--the people who love those who serve-- and, of course, we all pray that our loved ones return home safely.   Before my colleagues take the floor and share their appreciation for  our men and women in blue and green, I briefly want to share with you,  Mr. Speaker, some of the stories of the fallen heroes from my district  in Florida who have touched our lives and our hearts with their  service.   In Alachua County, we remember Deputy Sheriff Kenterrous Taylor who  was killed in a single-vehicle crash while responding to a domestic  violence call on March 12, 2020. He was only 27 years old and had  served with the Alachua County Sheriff's Office for less than 1 year.  He is survived by his fiancee, his son, his parents, and his siblings.   In Gilchrist County we remember Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy  Taylor Lindsey of the Gilchrist County Sheriff's Department who were  brazenly attacked and killed while on a lunch break in Trenton,  Florida, on April 19, 2018. Sergeant Ramirez had served with Gilchrist  County for 7 years and is survived by his wife and two children. Deputy  Lindsey, who was only 25, is survived by his parents and his  grandparents.   In Bradford County, we remember Sergeant David Lashon Goodson who  died from complications of COVID-19 on August 18, 2020. He was 48 years  old and had served with the Bradford County Sheriff's Office for 22  years. He is survived by his wife, his daughter, his son, his mother,  and his brother.   In Marion County, we remember Deputy Sheriff Craig Heeder Riley II  who died from complications of COVID-19 on December 16, 2020. He was 53  and had served with the Marion County Sheriff's Office for 25 years. He  is survived by his wife, his two daughters, his son-in-law, his  grandson, his parents, and his sister.   Finally, just this year, we lost Deputy Nick Tilliman. He was 30  years old and had served our Nation in both the Army and the Navy. He  was a friend to all and known as a goofball who could keep a smile on  your face. Tragically, the smile that he so frequently donned couldn't  hide the pain that he felt, and on February 15 of this year, he took  his own life.   It is not popular nor is it very easy to talk about the mental strain  on our first responders, but it must be said both here on the floor of  the United States House of Representatives and in the departments  around this country that mental health matters.   Our men and women in blue and green are responding to the most  violent, disturbing, and tragic scenes that not only stay with them for  the rest of their lives but force them to compartmentalize their work  for the rest of their time on the force and beyond.   No man or woman should have to bear that burden alone or in silence.  It is well past time we prioritize mental health training and treatment  for our LEOs and all of our first responders.   Again, I am proud not just as a wife to a SWAT medic but as a  Representative of some of Florida's finest.   We are here to honor those who have served our communities with  distinction as well as those who continue to do so. Today, Mr. Speaker,  you will hear the stories of many who have served.   I am especially honored to lead this Special Order along with my good  friend, Sheriff   John Rutherford, and giving thanks for recognizing  their service. These are just some of the names of the fallen heroes  from our districts. There are many more who have given their lives in  other counties and cities across our State and Nation.   Each one of them has a story to tell. Each one of them has a family  to mourn. Each one of them has a legacy it is our duty to honor. We owe  them a debt of gratitude that we can never repay, but we can do our  best to support their families and colleagues who are left behind. We  can do our best to ensure that they have the resources and equipment  they need to do their job safely and effectively. We can do our best  and will do our best to respect and appreciate their work and  sacrifice.   We can and we will stand up for our men and women in uniform in the  face of attacks from those who wish to vilify our hard working LEOs.  [[Page H2238]]    As we mark National Police Week 2023 and welcome the thousands of law  enforcement officers to our Nation's Capital--their Nation's Capital-- for days of ceremonies, tributes, and important conversations, let us  remember and honor the fallen heroes of law enforcement. Let us pray  for their families and friends who miss them dearly and let us thank  our brothers and sisters in blue and green who carry on the mission  today.   We will never forget that they gave their lives for us, and we will  never forget their names--all 246 who were lost in the line of duty  last year.
