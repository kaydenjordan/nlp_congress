 Mr. President, I rise today to honor and congratulate  Mayor Jill Boudreau on her retirement after 12 years of service as  mayor of Mount Vernon, WA. During that time, she has been an inspiring  and impactful public servant--leading a municipal government that has  been a model of efficiency, adaptability, dignity, and inclusivity. Her  leadership has been a guiding light through some of the city's most  difficult times, and her advocacy has helped Mount Vernon prosper over  the past decade-plus.   Mayor Boudreau was sworn into office in January of 2012 and quickly  launched ambitious initiatives to bolster economic development, make  the city's government more open and accessible to residents, and  improve public transportation. Over her three terms, she has been an  indispensable voice for the region--serving on countless boards and  commissions and championing voting rights, public art installations,  and civic engagement. Most recently, Mayor Boudreau has been the  driving force behind the Mount Vernon Library Commons, a transformative  project that will be one of the largest capital investments in Skagit  County history. When completed, the Commons will be one of Washington  State's most energy-efficient municipal buildings and will bring a  library, community center, commercial kitchen, transit center, and one  of our nation's largest electric vehicle charging stations all into one  facility. The Commons is the product of Mayor Boudreau's bold vision  and tireless efforts. Her extraordinary leadership on the Commons and  other projects has been recognized by the Association for Washington  Cities, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Ambassador to Uruguay.   I had the opportunity to work most closely with Mayor Boudreau on  flood protection projects along the Skagit River, and throughout those  discussions, it was clear to everyone just how deeply she cared about  her community. Her dedication and compassion are also evident in Mayor  Boudreau's leadership during challenging and stressful times, whether  it was the Skagit River Bridge collapse, the Cascade Mall shooting, or  the COVID-19 pandemic. I know the citizens of Mount Vernon are as  grateful as I am for her strength and hard work during these difficult  moments.   One of the things I admire most about Mayor Boudreau is her weekly  commitment to meeting with residents for ``Coffee Hours.'' She has held  more than 350 of these meetings during her administration, something I  have heard about from her constituents during our shared time in public  office.  [[Page S5990]]  This type of openness and accessibility to her community--and her  willingness to listen and really engage with her constituents--is part  of what makes Mayor Boudreau such an inspiring public servant. It has  been a real privilege to work with her over the last 12 years, and I am  tremendously thankful for her service to the people of Mount Vernon. I  wish her the very best in future endeavors.                            ____________________
