 Mr. President, I have the honor of recognizing  Charles Garland Schwab, a World War II Veteran, and a man who is ever  grateful to celebrate his 100th birthday on October 6, 2018. Charles  Garland Schwab was born to homesteaders in the Big Snowy Mountains,  southeast of Lewistown, MT. He grew up on that homestead, and in 1940,  he married his wife Thelma.   Charles was drafted into the U.S. Army in January of 1944. After  basic training and a bout with pneumonia, he joined his fellow soldiers  in France on the front lines during World War II. He was awarded the  Bronze Medal, the American Theater Service Medal, the European, Africa,  Middle East Theater Medal, a Good Conduct Medal, as well as several  ribbons, including the Army Occupation Ribbon.   Upon returning to the United States, Charles was honorably discharged  from the Army on May 2, 1946. Following his discharge from the Army,  Charles and his wife purchased and operated the Lake View Cabins near  St. Mary. During the off season, Schwab practiced his trade as an oil  field pipefitter throughout Montana. He and his wife moved to Missoula  in 1950, where they raised two daughters. He continued his pipefitter  career and was instrumental in the process of bringing natural gas to  the homes of the citizens of Missoula.   Charles' wife Thelma passed away after 55 years of marriage in 1995.  Although Charles sold the Lake View Cabins after 20 years and is now a  retired pipefitter, he continues to enjoy the company of his daughters,  children, grandchildren, and friends and remains active in the  community.   One of Charles's most treasured memories is that of the honor flight  he took to Washington, DC, during the government shutdown in 2013. He  will forever treasure the memories of that trip, his time as a private  first class in the U.S. Army, and the opportunity to defend our great  Nation during World War II.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing the Winnett Lion's Club for their impact on Petroleum  County and surrounding communities.   Over the past 3 years, the Winnett Lion's Club has serviced rural  communities through free visionary health screenings. This preventative  care aids in catching Ambylopia, an easily treatable disease during  childhood.   I just 3 years, the Winnett Lion's Club has served over 3,000  children and has traveled over 2,500 miles to help rural communities.  The Winnett Lion's Club has served children from Headstart, Child Find  programs, local public schools, colony-based schools, and business  fairs. They have gone above and beyond to support the children in their  surrounding communities.   I congratulate the Winnett Lion's Club for their dedication in  serving their community and for leaving a positive impact on Petroleum  County.                            ____________________
