 Mr. Speaker, the Republicans just voted to begin the  repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Their misguided and heartless effort  will not just affect thousands of insurance policies in Nevada, but it  will cost the State jobs, it will diminish access to health care, and  it will jeopardize lives.   Nevada had one of the highest uninsured rates in the country before  the ACA. Since then, we have cut the rate by almost 50 percent, and we  have created a system that now provides 400,000 children and adults  with coverage. But Trump and the congressional Republicans don't want  to hear about that.   Make no mistake, when they voted to repeal the ACA, they are revoking  vital programs that offer cancer screenings and mental health  assistance. They are rescinding provisions that prevent insurance  companies from charging women more than men, or from denying benefits  because of preexisting conditions.   This is unconscionable. Instead of repeal and replace, the  Republicans should just call their proposal ``destroy and delay,'' or  perhaps just simply ``scam and sham.''                            ____________________
