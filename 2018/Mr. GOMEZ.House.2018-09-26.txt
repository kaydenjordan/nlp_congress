 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would give inspectors general the ability to  subpoena witnesses to testify. This would be a significant new  authority.   Although I believe most IGs would act responsibly, it is important  that we include safeguards to protect against potential abuse of this  new authority.   This bill includes several such safeguards. The bill would require an  IG, before issuing a subpoena, to go through two reviews.   The first review would be conducted by the Council of Inspectors  General for Integrity and Efficiency. A panel of three council members  would have to approve the subpoena before the IG could issue it.   The second review would be conducted by the attorney general, who  would have the opportunity to block a subpoena if it would interfere  with an ongoing investigation.   The bill attempts to strike a careful balance in granting IGs the  authority to interview witnesses outside of the government while also  providing these important checks against potential abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we can all agree that agencies should be transparent  about what guidance is currently in effect for agency employees.   During committee consideration of this legislation, Democratic  members raised concerns that the bill should not be used for a purpose  other than simple transparency. Unfortunately, the Senate sponsor of  the companion legislation was quoted as stating that the bill could be  used to eliminate guidance issued during President Barack Obama's  administration by making those guidance documents available for  disapproval under the Congressional Review Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority for working with minority to  address the concerns expressed in committee. The majority agreed to  include a provision in the bill that clarifies that this bill will not  be used to influence whether guidance falls under the Congressional  Review Act.   The bill we are considering today states that ``Nothing in this Act  may be construed to affect whether a guidance document qualifies as a  rule for purposes of chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code.''   There are additional improvements I believe should be made to the  bill. For example, the definition in the bill of what would be  considered a guidance document remains very broad, and it is unclear  about who decides what is considered a guidance document.   The bill also makes no exceptions for national security or other  sensitive documents. However, I do not object to this bill moving  forward, but I do hope the majority will continue to work with all  Members as this legislation moves through the legislative process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking Representative Foxx  for her leadership on this important piece of legislation and working  closely with me. I also want to thank the staff, who spent countless  hours over the past months negotiating and drafting this legislation.   I know it might come as a surprise to see a working class progressive  Member of Congress from Los Angeles working with a conservative Member  from North Carolina. But with some common sense on both sides of the  aisle, we can come together to solve problems facing working families  across the country. So I hope that Congress can come together, as we  have, to make progress.   The GREAT Act is a straightforward bill that seeks to modernize the  grant reporting process by standardizing the information reported by  grant recipients.                                time  1915    By simplifying the grant reporting process, the GREAT Act will create  a more open and transparent grant process for all recipients. In Los  Angeles, that means greater opportunities for organizations working to  make government work better for my constituents.   When signed into law, this bill will help universities, city  departments, and other organizations automate their recording costs,  reduce compliance costs, and focus their energy where it belongs--on  maximizing millions in Federal grants to Los Angeles to make it a more  prosperous city.   By making grant reports machine readable and fully searchable, the  GREAT Act will also improve the performance of the grants process and  break down barriers to grants. Nonprofits and local groups will have  better access to Federal grants so they can leverage funds to maximize  their impact.   This bipartisan effort represents a major step toward ensuring  government works as efficiently as possible for all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with Representative Foxx and  others to continue our bipartisan efforts to help government work  better, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the GREAT Act, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4431. This measure would  authorize agencies to pay interest on military service deposits in  cases in which administrative error causes interest to be due.   Military servicemembers who transition to civilian service may elect  to have past military service factored into their Federal pensions by  making payments to the civilian retirement fund. These payments are  intended to align with the contribution to the pension fund the  employees would have made for their years of service in the military.   Unfortunately, current law requires these payments to be paid within  2 years of starting Federal service. After this date, interest is  assessed on any outstanding payments. Sometimes agencies make mistakes  calculating the deposit amount that is due. In these cases, it is only  fair that the agencies that made the errors should pay the accrued  interest. Under current law or regulation, not all agencies have the  authority to pay such accrued interest. This bill would close that  loophole.   I thank Representative Carter and Chairman Gowdy for working with us  after committee markup to add provisions in the bill that would make  similar changes to title 5 regarding the service and deposits for VISTA  and Peace Corps volunteers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support H.R. 4431, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5896 would address issues that arose from  implementation of the 2014 version of the bill by making technical and  clarifying changes. The bill would require that newly hired workers  receive the basic rate of pay until they complete initial training. It  would also allow workers to elect to perform 90 or 100 hours per pay  period and receive premium pay above their basic rate. This would help  incentivize workers to move into these important positions.   The bill would also remove the requirement that the agency limit a  worker's tour of duty to control retirement benefits. In exchange, it  would limit the amount of overtime treated as retirement-credible basic  pay during the period used to calculate annuities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, ZIP Codes organize the country to ensure the effective  and efficient delivery of mail for millions of Americans. The postal  service has the authority to establish ZIP Codes and adjust their  boundaries based on changes in delivery and on volume and operational  concerns. However, communities, businesses, and other local entities  can also voice their concern with ZIP Code boundaries and request  adjustments.   This bill would require the Postal Service to establish new ZIP Codes  for five communities that have each requested and been denied ZIP Code  changes. These communities base their ZIP Code requests on concerns  such as delay in mail delivery, emergency service response times, and  the denial or inconsistent application of services to community  members. These are important concerns and should be addressed  accordingly.   The Postal Service has worked with affected communities to find  solutions, and I commend those efforts. This bill would require the ZIP  Code changes requested by those communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us would make a technical correction to  the Real ID Act of 2005. The act incorrectly identified persons from  the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau as citizens of the Trust  Territory of the Pacific Islands, an entity that has not existed since  1994. This error has caused citizens of these trust territories  difficulties because they are often issued only temporary driver's  licenses. This, in turn, makes some employers reluctant to hire these  citizens and makes it difficult for them to access government services.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, urge my colleagues to do so as  well, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Hanabusa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
