 Mr. President, I rise today in support of the  Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure  [[Page S2325]]  Act, S. 914, introduced by my colleague Senator Duckworth. This bill  would provide much needed funding for drinking water and wastewater  cleanup across the country, addressing climate change and assisting  underserved communities.   Millions of Americans do not have access to clean water. In  California alone, it is estimated that nearly 1 million Californians do  not have access to clean water from their tap. California faces unique  water challenges, and in the face of climate change, drought per- and  polyfluoroalkyl substances contamination, and population growth, my  State's aging water infrastructure, like many others, is in need of  support.   The Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act authorizes more  than $35 billion for updating and repairing aging infrastructure, and  also assisting historically underserved and marginalized communities.   Communities of color and low-income communities are more likely to  lack the infrastructure to provide safe drinking water to households  and prevent water contamination. For example, the farming communities  of the San Joaquin Valley face a frequent danger of drought that  threatens to dry up their groundwater supply.   These predominantly Latino communities also face the threat of  growing nitrate levels in their ground water supplies, forcing families  to forego using tap water for drinking, cooking, and even showering.   This bill would fix these disparities by funding investments and  advancements in infrastructure to ensure that families have access to  clean water, no matter where they live.   I am pleased that my amendment to Section 203 was included in the  substitute bill. Section 203 of the base bill creates a new EPA grant  program for water recycling and other sustainable water supplies that  will complement the existing Bureau of Reclamation water recycling  program.   In the base bill, section 203 prohibits water recycling projects that  have received any Bureau of Reclamation funding from receiving EPA  funding. I think it is reasonable to prohibit water districts that have  received Bureau of Reclamation construction funding from also receiving  construction funding from EPA.   But the base bill would also prohibit water districts from applying  for EPA grants if they received even preliminary Reclamation funding  years ago for feasibility studies, planning, or design.   The new EPA program is needed precisely because there is a backlog of  $800 million to $1 billion for water recycling projects under the  Bureau of Reclamation's program.   I don't believe it makes sense to prohibit water districts from  accessing available EPA funding to build needed water recycling  projects just because they got a little Reclamation study funding years  ago.   My amendment, which Senators Padilla and Kelly cosponsored, would  ensure that water recycling projects that received Bureau of  Reclamation funding for studies would still be eligible to apply for  EPA funding.   I thank the bill managers for accepting this amendment into the  substitute bill.   I am also pleased to vote for Senator Shaheen's bill and thank the  Senator for her efforts to improve our nation's water infrastructure.    Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce bipartisan  legislation that would better align the Department of Housing and Urban  Development's (HUD) homeless assistance programs with other federal  agencies' homelessness programs and provide greater flexibility to  local communities to address youth homelessness.   According to the latest estimate from HUD, there are over 580,466  homeless individuals in the United States. This number includes an  estimated 161,548 individuals in California, including children and  youth.   However, if you compare that with data from other federal agencies, a  different story is told.   For example, the Department of Education identified 1.3 million  students experiencing homelessness during the 2018-2019 school year.  This includes an estimated 271,528 public school students in  California, almost double the total number of homeless individuals  (including adults) identified by HUD in California.   The disparity between the homeless numbers reported by HUD and the  Department of Education are not just mere statistical differences; they  have real consequences.   For instance, only those children and families considered  ``homeless'' under HUD's definition are eligible for vital homeless  assistance programs. Those children and families who do not meet HUD's  definition will therefore continue to fall through the cracks.   Our bill would allow HUD homeless assistance programs to serve  extremely vulnerable children and families, specifically those staying  in motels or in doubled-up situations because they simply have nowhere  else to go.   These children are especially susceptible to abuse and trafficking  because they are often not served by a case manager, and therefore  remain hidden from potential social service providers.   Communities that receive Federal funding through HUD's competitive  application process are also unable to prioritize or direct resources  to help children and families who don't meet the current definition of  ``homelessness.''   In addition to fixing the issue with competing federal definitions of  homelessness, our bill would provide communities with new flexibility  to use Federal funds the way they see fit to address local needs. Our  bill requires HUD to assess the extent to which Continuums of Care use  separate, specific, age-appropriate criteria for determining the safety  and needs of children and unaccompanied youth and divert people to  safe, stable, age-appropriate accommodations.   Finally, our bill would improve transparency and give a better sense  of the homeless crisis facing our country by requiring HUD to include  data on all categories of homelessness in its Point in Time count and  Annual Homeless Assessment Report.   Mr. President, we must do more to meet the needs of homeless children  and youth and stop the vicious cycle of poverty and chronic  homelessness. As the ongoing coronavirus pandemic threatens to push  more children, youth, and families into homelessness and continues to  pose potentially lethal health risks, it is imperative that we do not  impose more barriers for these children and families to access  services. I believe this bill is a commonsense solution that will  ensure that homeless families and children can receive the help they  need.   I would like to thank Senator Rob Portman for his support on this  critical issue and for joining me in introducing this bill, and I  implore our colleagues to support the ``Homeless Children and Youth  Act.''  [[Page S2361]]    Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Warren, Mr. Brown, Mr. Van Hollen,          and Mrs. Gillibrand):   S. 1474.
