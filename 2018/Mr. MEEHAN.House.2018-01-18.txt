 Mr. Speaker, I was not present for rollcall votes 27  through 30 because I was traveling to Pennsylvania with President  Trump. Had I been present, I would have voted ``Yea'' on rollcall No.  27, ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 28, ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 29, and ``Yea''  on rollcall No. 30.                            ____________________
