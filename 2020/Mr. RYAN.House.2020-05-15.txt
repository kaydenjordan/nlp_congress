 I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, this is absolutely  unbelievable. Just a few years ago, the stock market is at 25,000;  corporate profits are the highest they have been in decades; the rich  keep getting richer; and our friends on the other side say: What do we  do now? Let's do a tax cut where 83 percent of it goes to the top 1  percent of the wealthiest people.   Fast forward a few months: global pandemic; 36 million people  unemployed; 40 percent of families who have a worker who makes $40,000  a year or less lost their job last month; 4 million people didn't pay  their rent; and the Republican Party says: We don't have any money to  help you.   Are you kidding me? Where do you guys live? Food lines around the  blocks at our food banks in the United States of America, and one in  five kids are going hungry. Your party can't even get food to them.   This isn't a wish list. If it is a wish list, it is for the working- class people.   How about the Teamsters who are going to get a pension when this bill  passes? If we don't act, their pension gets cut in half.   This is ridiculous. The Republicans are turning their backs on the  American people. Let's be honest.
