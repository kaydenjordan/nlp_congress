 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8294, the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2020, and thank the gentleman for his  enormous leadership, as well as Chairwoman Susan Davis.   This legislation takes real meaningful steps to increase access to  registered apprenticeships, one of the most successful workforce  development programs we have ever had in our country, where 94 percent  of people who complete them actually earn an average salary of over  $70,000 a year.   As Representative of the cities of Toledo, Lorain, and Cleveland, all  of which boast a strong industrial and automotive heritage, it is  difficult to overemphasize the value that these apprenticeships have  for young people and adults starting careers in the industrial and  automotive trades.   Whether it is the expertise it takes to rebuild an engine or build it  to begin with, replace a battery in a hybrid vehicle or TIG weld the  rear quarter of an old Wagoneer, there will always be a market for  skilled craftspeople who can repair or restore modern and classic  vehicles. It is these curious minds and hands that are America's  inventors of the future for new power systems and new engines.   This legislation is estimated to create over 1 million apprenticeship  opportunities over the next 5 years and will strengthen our workforce,  ensuring businesses large and small can recruit the skilled workers  they need.   I include in the Record a letter from the National Task Force on  Tradeswomen's Issues that supports this legislation.                                                 National Task Force                                         on Tradeswomen's Issues,                                                  November 18, 2020.      Re H.R. 8294 Letter of Support, NAA Reauthorization.       To: Committee on Education and Labor      Chairperson Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott      Attention: Katherine McClelland.        The National Taskforce on Tradeswomen's Issues (TWTF) is a       coalition of tradeswomen organizations, advocates, allies and       individual tradeswomen. TWTF promotes public policies and       best practices towards equity in apprenticeship, training,       workforce development, career and technical education, and in       workplace experience in construction and other nontraditional       occupations for women. Women make up close to 50% of the       nation's workforce. Women occupy 2/3's of the minimum wage       jobs in this country. Yet, women comprise only 7% of our       nation's apprenticeship programs. Apprenticeship is a       critical component of our efforts to increase economic       opportunity for women, particularly women of color, in blue-      collar occupations.        TWTF very much appreciates the interest of the House of       Representatives Education & Labor Committee and its Higher       Education & Workforce Investment Subcommittee in       reauthorizing the National Apprenticeship Act in a way that       best protects apprentices and enhances their opportunities       for meaningful, well-compensated careers. TWTF is grateful       for the careful attention that the National Apprenticeship       Act of 2020, H.R. 8294, pays to ensuring that women and       people of color--populations that have historically been too       often unfairly denied opportunities because of their gender,       race, or ethnicity--can gain access to and retain high-skill,       high-wage jobs through registered apprenticeships, pre-      apprenticeships, and youth apprenticeships. Finally, we are       very appreciative of the open and consultative process that       you and your staff have engaged in to get public input as you       developed this bill, including allowing us to submit detailed       comments on a publicly available discussion draft, and your       staff's willingness to respond to questions and concerns on       an on-going basis. H.R. 8294 could well be a key piece to       remedy the enduring skills and pay gap as we move beyond the       ``She-cession.''        TWTF is pleased to support H.R. 8294. In particular, we       support the bill's incorporation of nondiscrimination and       affirmative action standards for apprenticeship programs       currently codified in 29 CFR part 30; the requirement that       funded entities devote a minimum of 5 percent of grant funds       to direct financial assistance to apprentices, pre-      apprentices, or youth apprentices for supportive services;       and the significant investments that the bill makes in       registered apprenticeship, pre-apprenticeship, and youth       apprenticeship programs and technical assistance to make       progress on equity and inclusion for women and people of       color. We look forward to continuing to work with your staff       to accommodate remaining concerns as the legislation moves       forward in the next Congress.            Respectfully,                                                Connie Ashbrook,                                                         Leah Rambo,                                                    TWTF Co-Chairs.
