 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am here to discuss the Defense  Department's financial audits--or, more accurately, the lack of  credible audits. My colleagues know that I am as stubborn as a mule  when it comes to my oversight work of the Pentagon's accounting  system--or lack of system.   I wish I could stop sounding like a broken record when talking about  the Pentagon's financial track record.   The fact is that the Pentagon is pigheaded when it comes to  accounting for taxpayer dollars. It keeps pouring billions of dollars  into an antiquated accounting system that doesn't work.   Late last year, I read an article that appeared in a national  security blog. The blog is called War on the Rocks. This blog article  is called ``The Pentagon Can't Count: It's Time to Reinvent the  Audit.'' It was written by Steve Blank, a business professor at  Stanford University.   As a former member of the Defense Business Board, the professor calls  for a whole new approach to defense auditing. The Pentagon is spending  $1 billion a year--and these are his quotes--``to get incrementally  better'' and still, according to him, clean opinions are nowhere in  sight.   He raises a legitimate question: Why is the Pentagon spending so much  money for so little results--meaning money on audits?   Thinking outside the box was not in the Defense Business Board's  charter,  [[Page S1432]]  but Professor Blank allowed himself the luxury of thinking outside the  box. He dreamed about doing the impossible, and he wrote this fairly  long quote:         What if we could invent the future? It dawned on me.    Continuing to quote:         If we tried to look over the horizon, we would discover       that the department could audit faster, cheaper, and more       effectively by inventing future tools and techniques rather       than repeating the past.    The professor envisioned a ``5th generation of audit practices'' to  break the cycle of audit failures at the Department of Defense.   I give the professor very high grades for creativity and his search  for new solutions but disagree with some of his thinking.   However, when it comes to pinpointing the root cause of unending  audit failures, the professor hits the nail on the head.   So I quote from him:         [The] Department of Defense needs to lead the audit       industry to create a 21st century integrated finance and       accounting system, including a U.S. Standard General Ledger       that provides reliable and complete data.    ``Integrated systems'' and ``reliable data'' are the magic words.   The experts, like the auditors, the financial managers, the inspector  general, have known this truth for 30 years or more. They dutifully  report it, wringing their hands in frustration, and then rinse and  repeat the cycle from 1 year to the next year.   Now, see here. We have the mighty Pentagon that develops the most  advanced weapons systems the world has ever known. Yet, when it comes  to deploying basic technology like an accounting system, it is  buffaloed--or is it? Maybe they want the system to work that way so  nobody knows what is going on and how the money is spent.   After hundreds of billions have been poured into patching up old  audit systems, the Department of Defense still can't perform the most  elementary accounting tasks in the book. They don't capture  transactions as they occur and post them to the correct accounts. So  just go figure what is wrong.   Well, there once was a true sage consigned to an attic cubbyhole at  the Pentagon who claimed to know the answer. That person was A. Ernest  Fitzgerald. We called him Ernie. Ernie was the Management Systems  Deputy of the Air Force in the Comptroller's office. He blew the  whistle on the C-5A cost overruns and, of course, got fired when  President Nixon didn't like what he testified to before the Congress of  the United States.   Some years after being restored to his post--and he was restored only  by court order--he was detailed to my staff for several years to lead a  joint review of the internal controls over vendor payments. Ernie  believed the Pentagon barons lorded over their financial fiefdoms for  one reason and one reason only: They did not want to see the status quo  go away. It is pretty simple. Keeping the books in disarray gives the  Department of Defense the so-called flexibility to hide overspending  and other financial shenanigans.   Once upon a time, a promising fix lent credence to Ernie Fitzgerald's  theory. It was called the Defense Corporate Database/Warehouse System.  It was at the threshold of success when it got torpedoed--and torpedoed  by whom? By the bureaucrats in the Defense Department. That system  could have been a building block for a modern accounting system that  might have delivered a victory to the American taxpayer.   If the brass were truly committed to cleaning up the books, it would  have happened long ago. The technology is there for the taking. To  break out of the cycle of failures, we need to step back, hit the audit  reset button, and chart a new course.   As a first step, Secretary of Defense Austin should hold the Chief  Financial Officer accountable for failing to have an accounting system  that meets statutory requirements. That is as simple as accounting 101  and accountability 101 in my book. If Secretary Austin holds the CFO's  feet to the fire, just maybe we will finally see a course correction.   As a lifelong family farmer, I can tell you that hope springs eternal  at the start of every planting season. After four decades of working to  weed out the fiscal mess at the Pentagon, it is a tall order to be  optimistic. I am not going to give up. I am not going to give up this  fight. With the help of a team of auditors under the leadership of the  Government Accountability Office's general counsel, Emmanuelli Perez,  and support from our allies, maybe together we can nudge the Department  in a new direction. Otherwise, expect more of the same--a colossal  waste on failed audits.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
