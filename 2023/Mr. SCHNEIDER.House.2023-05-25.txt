 Madam Speaker, we stand on the precipice of a self- inflicted crisis precipitated by Speaker McCarthy's loyalty to the most  extreme members of his caucus. These far-right members are refusing to  negotiate in good faith. They have continuously moved the goalpost time  and time again.   Now there is no time to spare. Seven days until we reach X-date. We  need an agreement now to raise the debt limit and to take it off the  table for future hostage holding.   We would all love to be with our families right now, to be home for  the weekend, celebrating and marking and observing the solemn occasion  of Memorial Day. Our constituents would like to see us there, but they  need us here.   Democrats stand ready to do what is necessary. Republicans have all  gone home.   As we mark the memories of those who served our country, who made the  ultimate sacrifice, let us think of the sacrifice we are willing to  make to put America's full faith and credit back in good standing.                            ____________________
