 Mr. President, I agree with the comments of my  colleagues on the need to pass S. 2361 during the 115th Congress. The  legislation is narrowly tailored such that it would provide the  opportunity for reapplication or continuation of FHLB membership only  for those captive entities that meet a series of criteria pertaining to  the mission of their parent companies to serve the residential mortgage  market. These captive members have proven track records of responsible  membership, have contributed to the system, and have invested their  capital in the respective FHLBs. Moreover, each and every captive that  would be affected by our bill are subsidiaries of financial  institutions that are aligned with the overall mission of the FHLBs.   I yield to my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin.
