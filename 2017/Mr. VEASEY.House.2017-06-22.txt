 Mr. Speaker, I am fortunate to represent the Dallas-Fort  Worth metroplex, where a blend of cultures has shaped our community,  from the food that we eat to the traditions that we celebrate. The  north Texas area has benefited from immigrants that now call the  Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex home. In fact, over one-third of the  district I serve was born outside of the United States.   It is the rich diversity found in Texas and across the country that  have helped make our country great. Immigrants bring their skills and  cultures and a belief in the American Dream that benefits each and  every one of us. They work alongside us, teach our children, worship in  parishes, and contribute to the innovation that has kept America on the  cutting edge for decades.   In honor of Immigrant Heritage Month, I remind my colleagues of our  [[Page H5099]]  country's legacy as a nation of immigrants. I urge each of you to keep  these ideas in mind as the month ends and as we promote policies that  directly impact our immigrant communities.                            ____________________
