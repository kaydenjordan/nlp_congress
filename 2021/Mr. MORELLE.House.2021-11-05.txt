 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished chair  of the Rules Committee and my colleague for his incredible work and  leadership.   Madam Speaker, today we continue to make good on our promise to  deliver real results for working families by moving another step  forward with the Build Back Better Act.    The pandemic put significant strains on my constituents, including  increased costs of childcare and healthcare, amid continued disruptions  in our labor markets. Today it is clear, we have their back.   This landmark legislation will help 163,000 people alone in the State  of New York gain much-needed health coverage, and save Monroe County  families hundreds of dollars on healthcare costs annually.   By lowering the cost of prescription drugs, like insulin, we can  ensure no one ever has to choose between putting food on the table or  paying for lifesaving medication.   We are making long overdue investments in infrastructure that will  result in good-paying jobs, upgrades to roads and bridges, broadband  internet, and public transit, all without raising taxes on working men  and women.   We are expanding access to high quality and affordable childcare for  over 1 million children, giving parents the resources they need to get  back to work while supporting their families.   These are real, impactful policies that will have a profound effect  on my district and support middle class Americans at a time they need  it the most.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to voting in favor of the rule, and I  remain focused on delivering real results to insure our families can  thrive and succeed.
