 Mr. Speaker, Republicans and Democrats agree  we need to invest in infrastructure, but today when our Nation is  running historically high deficits, when Democrats want to add  trillions of dollars to our debt, and inflation is nearly at the  highest it has been in 40 years, we need to ensure these investments  are paid for.   When it comes to this bill, the math simply does not add up. We are  told that this bill has $589 billion in offsets. In reality, the CBO  score shows just $180 billion in offsets, a $400 billion shortfall.   This bill does not pay for itself, not even close. The fact is, for  House Democrats, this bill was never about infrastructure. The Speaker  has had weeks to vote on it. Instead, she has turned a bipartisan  negotiation into a hostage negotiation.   In exchange for fixing our roads, bridges, highways, and dams, House  Democrats are demanding Congress pass the most expensive piece of  legislation in history along with the largest tax increase in history.  Unlike the infrastructure bill, which has a CBO score, less than 1  percent of their $4.3 trillion spending-and-tax plan is scored by CBO.   Republicans will not be bullied into paying a ransom to fix our  infrastructure.
