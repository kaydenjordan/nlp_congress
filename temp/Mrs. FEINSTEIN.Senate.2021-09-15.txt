 Mr. President, I rise today in support of the  ``Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego Protection Act,'' which I  introduced today with Senator Padilla.   This bill would protect the historic Marine Corps recruit training  base in San Diego and ensure that Marines have a world-class training  facility on the West Coast.   The base became operational in 1921 and began its mission of training  and ``the making of Marines'' in 1923. On January 1, 1948, Marine Corps  Base, San Diego was officially renamed Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San  Diego.   As needed, the base has increased the number of new Marine recruits  that it trains to ensure our readiness during periods of conflict.   For example, the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego augmented troop  training during the Korean War and expanded training during the Vietnam  War. In recent decades, the base has prepared Marines to fight in the  conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.   The installation's unique Spanish colonial design by Bertram Goodhue  adds to its historical richness. Twentyfive of the Depot's original  buildings have been deemed worthy of preservation for their historical  significance and are part of the National Register of Historic Places.   In May, the San Diego Depot celebrated its historic graduation of its  [[Page S6527]]  first gender-integrated class of new Marines, well in advance of the  requirement in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2020 for Marines to conduct integrated gender recruit training by 2028.   Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego accomplished that mission this  year, demonstrating the can-do spirit that has animated the base since  its establishment.   Our bill would prohibit the closure of the historic Marine Corps  Recruit Depot located in San Diego. It would protect regional jobs and  tourist revenue generated by the installation.   The bill would also eliminate the need for costly new military  construction if the training mission were relocated, and prevent the  disruption of families and training.   Lastly, the bill would guarantee the annual basic training for Marine  recruits at the place where their fellow Marines have trained for a  century. On the 100th anniversary of the installation, we must continue  this critical mission in San Diego and preserve its history.   It is imperative to maintain facilities that train and prepare our  Armed Forces to meet the challenges of tomorrow. The protection of the  Depot preserves an important legacy of the Marine Corps. The  installation also offers a strategic location to position forces in the  West.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill. Thank you  Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Paul, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Collins,          and Mr. Coons):   S. 2753. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to  authorize lawful permanent resident status for certain college  graduates who entered the United States as children, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.   Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``America's Children Act of  2021.''   This legislation would ensure that dependents of immigrants in the  green card backlog do not age out of their legal immigration status  when they turn 21 and provides a pathway to permanency for these  children and young adults.                            What the Bill Would Do    This legislation would provide a pathway to permanent residency for  dependents of nonimmigrant visa holders if they have been a dependent  for at least 4 years, have lived in the United States for 10 years and  have graduated from an institution of higher education in the United  States.   The bill fills an important gap in our legal immigration system,  since many immigrants and their families often have to wait decades to  receive a green card due to numerical limitations and per country caps.  The children who age out of dependent status have few options to stay  in the United States once they turn 21 and even fewer paths to  permanency even though many have only known the United States as their  home. It is unjust that these children and young people are at risk of  deportation to their birth countries simply because our legal  immigration system is outdated.                            Why the Bill is Needed    There are an estimated 255,000 children who are or were the  dependents of parents with lawful work visas, currently awaiting their  green card processing in the immigration backlog. All of these  individuals are at risk of deportation at age 21 if their applications  are not processed in time, or have already aged out of status.   This bill is a commonsense measure that ensures that children who  have grown up in our communities and wish to go to a university and  work in the United States have the opportunity to do so. Most of these  individuals do not have close ties in their birth countries and  removing them from the United States would mean separation from their  families and the life they have always known.   Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.                            ____________________
