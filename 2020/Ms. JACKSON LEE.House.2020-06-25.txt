 Madam Speaker, my friends on the other side of the  aisle are consistently being persistent in the language of why process  for them is more important than saving lives. I answer the question  with a little book called the Constitution of the United States, which  on this day we hope that we will make it holier and more potent for the  large numbers of African American men and women who have seen the brunt  of racial profiling and police brutality.   Now, let me be very clear. In the opening of this Constitution, it  tracks the language that says we are created for a more perfect union.  Centuries later, Dr. Martin Luther King asked the question of why we  can't wait to be allowed to be full citizens in this Nation as African  Americans. He also said now is the time.   So when a Member asked me about the moment of this bill, this day, I  said: There are few seismic moments on the floor of the House. There  are few catastrophic earthquake moments that change lives and save  lives. Today, we cannot wait. Amadou Diallo could not wait more than  20, 30 years ago. Now, we have legislation that will be a significant  civil rights moment in our history.    I am very pleased to have introduced the Law Enforcement Trust and  Integrity Act with my colleagues that does help police, that does  require the accreditation of 18,000 police departments. Maybe if the  officers in Minneapolis had been trained in human decency and the  stopping of excessive force and the duty to intervene, not only would  George Floyd's life been saved, but many others in times before.   But we have a bill that says that you have to require something. And  when I walked amongst the neighbors of George Floyd that grew up in  Cuney Homes near Jack Yates, they surrounded me, even in the midst of  COVID-19, and said: What is this bill going to do? Is it going to do  something?   This bill provides a direct requirement for accreditation, the  requirement to professionalize police. And, yes, it is racial  profiling, and it has teeth in it because it includes a prohibition in  profiling based on ethnicity, national origin, religion, and gender.  And it creates a cause of action by the Attorney General of any who are  injured. We have never had that before. And, yes, it adds a  modification of rollback on qualified immunity.   But I say to my friends, in rolling back qualified immunity, you have  due process. You are in the courthouse.   It limits the military hardware disbursements, use of force, and it  professionalizes the police.   Now, I want to answer the question of Philonise Floyd. He doesn't  want his brother to be on his shirt; he wants justice.   As I conclude, Madam Speaker, I just want to answer his daughter's  point. His daughter, Gianna, said: ``My daddy changed the world.''   We are changing the world. We can't wait, and now is the time--not  process, but reality, and making a bill that changes civil rights in  this Nation.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on  the Judiciary, as an original cosponsor of the legislation, and the  author of several of its key legislative provisions, I rise in strong  and enthusiastic support of H.R. 7120, the George Floyd Justice In  Policing Act of 2020, which marks a defining turning point in our  country.   By the millions, Americans have taken to the streets in protest to  affirm that no longer will the people of this country tolerate or  acquiesce in horrible policing practices that include excessive and  unnecessary uses of lethal force that has diminished community trust of  policing practices across the country and has angered and terrified  communities of color who are overwhelmingly and disproportionately its  innocent victims.   Mr. Speaker, the horrifying killing of George Floyd on May 25, 2020  by a Minneapolis police office shocked and awakened the moral  consciousness of the nation.   Untold millions have seen the terrifying last 8:46 of life drained  from a black man, George Floyd, taking his last breaths face down in  the street with his neck under the knee of a police officer who, along  with his three cohorts, was indifferent to his cries for help and pleas  that he `can't breathe.'   It direct response, for the past several weeks civil protests against  police brutality have occurred nightly in cities large and small all  across the nation.   These protests are a direct reaction to the horrific killing of  George Floyd but are most motivated by a deep-seated anger and  frustration to the separate and unequal justice African Americans  receive at the hands of too many law enforcement officers.   The civil disobedience being witnessed nightly in the streets of  America are also in memory of countless acts of the inequality and  cruelty visited upon young African American men and women no longer  with us in body but forever with us in memory.   Beloved souls like Breanna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky; Stephan  Clark in Sacramento, California; Eric Garner and Sean Bell in New York  City; Sandra Bland in Waller County, Texas; Jordan Baker in Houston,  Texas; 12-year old Tamir Rice in Cleveland; and Michael Brown in  Ferguson, Missouri, also, Pamela Turner, Sandra Bland, and Danny Ray  Thomas.   They remember as well the senseless killings of Ahmaud Arbery and  Trayvon Martin by self-appointed vigilantes, Robbie Tolan, shot by  police at his own home and he lived but was seriously injured.   And the continuing need for their activism is reflected in the most  recent outrage, which began on June 12, 2020 and ended in the senseless  slaughter of Rayshard Brooks, who was simply sleeping in his car at a  local Wendy's restaurant, by a uniformed officer of the Atlanta Police  Department.   Indeed, the history goes back much further, past Amidou Diallo in New  York City, past the Central Park Five, past Emmitt Till, past the  Racist abuse of law enforcement power during the struggle for civil  rights and equal treatment.   Mr. Speaker, the times we are in demand that action be taken and that  is precisely what my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, on  this committee, and Congressional Democrats did in introducing H.R.  7120, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020.   And we are taking the next bold action today in voting to pass this  legislation and send it to the Senate and on to the White House for  presidential signature and enactment.   I support this bold legislation not just as a senior member of the  House Judiciary Committee who also served on the House Working Group on  Police Strategies, but also a mother of a young African American male  who knows the anxiety that African American mothers feel until they can  hug their sons and daughters who return home safely, and on behalf of  all those relatives and friends who grieve over the loss a loved one  whose life and future was wrongly and cruelly interrupted or ended by  mistreatment at the hands of the police.   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020 is designed to  destroy the pillars of systemic racism in policing practices that has  victimized communities of color, and especially African Americans for  decades, is overdue, too long overdue.   This legislation puts the Congress of the United States, on record  against racial profiling in policing and against the excessive,  unjustified, and discriminatory use of lethal and force by law  enforcement officers against persons of color.   The legislation means no longer will employment of practices that  encourage systemic mistreatment of persons because of their race be  ignored or tolerated.   With our vote today to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act  of 2020, the government of the United States is declaring firmly,  forcefully, and unequivocally that Black Lives Matter.   It is true all lives matter, they always have.   But that Black lives matter too, and in so many other areas of civic  life, this nation has not always lived up to its promise but that the  promise is worthy of fulfilling.   Every African American parent, and every African America child, knows  all too well 'The Talk' and the importance of abiding by the rules for  surviving interactions with the police.   While many police officers take this responsibility seriously and  strive to treat all persons equally and with respect, their efforts are  too often undermined by some of their colleagues who abuse the enormous  trust and confidence placed in them.   And systemically racist systems and practices left in place can  corrupt even the most virtuous police officers.   So, the most important criminal justice reforms needed to improve the  criminal justice system are those that will increase public confidence  and build trust and mutual respect between law enforcement and the  communities they swear an oath and are willing to risk their lives to  protect and serve.   That is the overriding purpose and aim of the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act of 2020, which contains numerous provisions to weed out  and eliminate systemic racism in police practices.   Specifically, this legislation holds police accountable in our courts  by:   1. Amending the mens rea requirement in federal law (18 U.S.C.  Section 242) to prosecute police misconduct from ``willfulness'' to a  ``recklessness'' standard;   2. Reforming qualified immunity so that individuals are not barred  from recovering damages when police violate their constitutional  rights;   3. Incentivizing state attorneys general to conduct pattern and  practice investigations and improving the use of pattern and practice  investigations at the federal level by granting the Department of  Justice Civil Rights Division subpoena power;   4. Incentivizing states to create independent investigative  structures for police involved deaths; and   5. Creating best practices recommendations based on the Obama 21st  Century Policing Task force.   I am particularly pleased that the George Floyd Justice In Policing  Act includes the End Racial Profiling Now Act, which I introduced to  ban the pernicious practice of racial profiling.   In addition, I am proud that this legislation includes as Title I,  Subtitle B, the bipartisan and bicameral George Floyd Law Enforcement  Trust and Integrity Act, which I introduced as H.R. 7100.   This legislation provides incentives for local police organizations  to voluntarily adopt performance-based standards to ensure that  incidents of deadly force or misconduct will be minimized through  appropriate management and training protocols and properly  investigated, should they occur.   The legislation directs the Department of Justice to work  cooperatively with independent accreditation, law enforcement and  community-based organizations to further develop and refine the  accreditation standards and  [[Page H2491]]  grants conditional authority to the Department of Justice to make  grants to law enforcement agencies for the purpose of obtaining  accreditation from certified law enforcement accreditation  organizations.   As I have stated many times, direct action is vitally important but  to be effective it must be accompanied by political, legislative, and  governmental action, which is necessary because the strength and  foundation of democratic government rests upon the consent and  confidence of the governed.   Effective enforcement of the law and administration of justice  requires the confidence of the community that the law will be enforced  impartially and that all persons are treated equally without regard to  race or ethnicity or religion or national origin.   As the great jurist Judge Learned Hand said: ``If we are to keep our  democracy, there must be one commandment: thou shalt not ration  justice.''   Equal justice is the proud promise America makes to all persons; the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act will help make that promise a  lived reality for African Americans, who have not ever known it to be  true in the area of community-police relations.   And when Black Lives Matter, then and only then can it truthfully be  said that all lives matter.   Finally, let me say a few words in memory of the man whose sacrifice  of his inalienable right to life has galvanized the world and awakened  the sleeping giant of moral decency.   Mr. Speaker, in Acts 2:23 of the Scriptures it is written that ``This  man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge;  and you with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to  the cross.''   Duty calls us to improve the quality of policing in America.   We cannot agitate for change one day and then allow things to remain  the same, to allow wicked men to keep committing this crime against  humanity.   This behavior did not begin with George Floyd; there is a 400-years  of history here, from slave patrols, to Jim Crow to Bull Connor to the  modern day lynching of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek  Chauvin.   But the good news is that right is on our side; God has stepped in.   In John 1:46 it is said, ``can anything good come out of Nazareth?''   When he growing up I am sure there were people who saw George Floyd  and asked can anything good come out of the Third Ward of Houston?   We now know the answer is clearly yes.   George Floyd was here in service to God's divine plan.   And as his daughter Gianna said, her Daddy changed the world.   Thank you, George Floyd for what you have done for us, for helping us  find our voice and our resolve.   We will not let you down; we will finish the job.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the question: Where is the party of  Lincoln?   Where is the moment of courage when the slaves were freed in that  moment in 1863?   This Senate bill, the MTR, does not rise to the occasion of those who  are in the streets. It fails the moment. It does not require anything.  It does not ban, require, or create.   The Senate bill is threadbare and lacking in substance. It does not  even provide a proper baseline for negotiation. It does not contain any  mechanism to hold law enforcement officers accountable in court for  their misconduct.   It does not address mens rea, a standard that should be the basis of  due process. For too long, it has allowed law enforcement officers to  evade criminal liability for excessive force.   It is absolutely imperative that any meaningful policing reform  contain accountability. It fails the moment.                                time  1900    Tim Scott introduced the Walter Scott bill many years ago. It has yet  to see the light of day in the United States Senate.   Where is the party of Lincoln?   The JUSTICE Act has little to do with the urgent need, the cry of our  people, or those gathering around me in Cuney Homes who came to me,  friends of George Floyd, who knew Big Floyd, and said, ``What does this  bill do? Will it do anything?''   And as I told them about the bill, unlike this George Floyd Act,  which repurposes existing grant moneys, I let them know that this bill  will give money to community groups, not give bunches of dollars to  those who will continue the same patterns.   For too long, the disciplinary and misconduct records of officers who  pose a knowing threat to public safety have been shielded from the  public in a manner that has resulted in great harm to the communities  they are entrusted to. Our bill shines the light.   The Senate bill and the motion to recommit does nothing but closes  the door and says nothing about Black Lives Matter. In fact, it is a  system that encourages the collection of records. We can give him  credit for working in a hostile Chamber, but members of the CBC have  prioritized and made sure that the issues of today are important.   Let me be very clear. There are some notable distinctions between the  two proposals.   The House Justice and Policing Act vastly deals with a more systemic  approach to accountability by developing national policing standards  and requiring police departments to gain accreditation. It is a friend  of police. It gives and deals with professionalizations. It has a  national registry. It is not private. It is public. It is systemic  racism, and so we must be transparent.   This fails the moment. The Justice and Policing Act takes a  multiprong approach to eliminating the use of chokeholds. In this bill,  George Floyd would not have lived. In the Justice and Policing Act, we  could have saved his life and Eric Garner's.   How does the House bill ban no-knock warrants? We do it.   And the Senate bill, all it does is study. We have no time for  studying. It must be accountable time now. Now is the time.   Can you believe that the JUSTICE bill, Senator Scott's bill, this  bill does not have anything in it about use of  [[Page H2503]]  force? Nothing about banning or racial profiling, nothing to fix the  Federal criminal prosecution standards, nothing to roll back  unqualified immunity, and nothing on limitations of military hardware  and disbursements.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my brothers and sisters: Where is the party of  Lincoln?   Where is the party of the Constitution that says we create a more  perfect union to create justice?   Mr. Speaker, this bill here is the cry of those who have never been  heard. It gives us a pathway for success. I am glad to stand with the  Congressional Black Caucus and the Justice Department to say that this  bill has to pass, the Justice and Policing Act named after George  Floyd.    Mr. Speaker, I say to my community in Houston that I  know that they are celebrating the idea that the George Floyd Justice  in Policing Act has passed. I look forward to going home and engaging  with them and indicating that we are re-imagining police and that we  are building on police-community relations.   I also make mention of the fact that as I left Houston, the State of  Texas had 5,000 new COVID-19 cases. Today, we have counted 900 cases in  the Houston, Harris County area. People are dying. People are being  tested positive, and we need help.   Mr. Speaker, it is important that we pass the HEROES Act, but more  importantly, that we keep our testing open. On Saturday, I will open  another one-day testing site, my 11th, working with local health  professionals. The city of Houston and Harris County need our help, and  we must continue these testing sites. We must keep them open. I  encourage everyone in Houston, get tested. If you are positive, give us  your blood for antibodies after you have cured. But more importantly,  wear your mask, wash your hands, and socially distance. We have to save  lives.                            ____________________
