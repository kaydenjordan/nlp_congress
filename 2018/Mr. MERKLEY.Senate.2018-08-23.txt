 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about two  things. The first is that this Saturday will be the 1-year anniversary  of the beginning of a horrific genocide against the Rohingya in the  country of Myanmar.   This genocide was preplanned. All kinds of preparations were put in  place, as various independent investigations have established. It is  time for the United States to take a strong response as a statement of  global leadership on human rights on behalf of this horrific  circumstance. We have 350 or so villages burned, countless individuals  slaughtered as they ran from their villages, shot from helicopters,  systemic rape, and children tossed into burning piles. It doesn't get  much worse anywhere in the world at any time in history.   Now 700,000 refugees who escaped have found their way to Bangladesh,  but there is no room in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a country half the  size of Oregon. Yet Oregon has 4 million individuals, and Bangladesh  has 160 million individuals.   Here are some things the United States should do right away on or  before this Saturday. The State Department should release the report it  has been compiling on the factual circumstances. Second, they should  send this report to their legal counsel for an official determination  if this constitutes genocide. The third thing they should do is ask the  Senate to act quickly on the repatriation resolution that sets  standards for the return of these refugees back to Burma, back to  Myanmar. The fourth thing they should do is call on the Senate,  followed by the House, to pass the Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act,  which creates specific sanctions on those who planned and carried out  this horrific ethnic cleansing.   Elie Wiesel said: ``A destruction, an annihilation that only man can  provoke, only man can prevent.'' But if we do not respond clearly and  effectively when there is this type of ethnic cleansing, this type of  assault, then we are failing to prevent future assaults by those  leaders who will be so tempted to divide their country on ethnic or  racial lines, to take brutal action against a despised minority  community.   The seeds of this slaughter began with a military coup in 1962,  following which the military demonized this ethnic group year after  year. Not only should the United States respond with a State Department  report and a clear decision if this is genocide--and clear sanctions-- but it is time for the President of the United States to speak out  boldly and clearly on the international stage on this issue. A year has  passed, and we have not a single public statement from the leader of  the United States of America. So let that change.                        Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh    Madam President, the second issue I am here to talk about--and I am  going to keep this short because my colleague is here, prepared to  speak to his amendment--is the issue of whether the Senate proceeds to  have hearings on nominee Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S. Supreme  Court. The answer should be, by every Member in this Chamber, a  resounding no.    First, we have the Kagan standard that has been set by the Republican  majority, which states, when there is a Supreme Court nomination, it is  essential to have all of the facts, all of the records that have been  touched on, because only then will Senators be able to exercise their  responsibility under the Constitution for advice and consent. So, if  individuals want to exercise their responsibility effectively under  advice and consent on a nominee from a Democratic President, shouldn't  the same individuals make the same argument to exercise their  responsibility effectively when the nominee comes from a Republican  President?   The standard should be the standard. Let's stand up, out of the  partisan troughs that have been dug, and fight for the vision of a fair  and transparent and fully credible nomination process.   No hearing should be held until we have the full set of documents. It  escapes no one's vision in the United States of America that only a  fraction of the documents have been delivered. It escapes no one's  vision in the United States that even those documents have been vetted  by a Republican lawyer, a partisan lawyer, who has worked beforehand  for the nominee. That is not transparent; that is not fair; and that  does not allow us to have the full scope of the record.   Furthermore--and I will say this in just a summary format--there is  an enormous conflict of interest here by which the President is  attempting to print a ``get out of jail free'' card. Out of his 25  nominees who had been put forward from the list of names that had been  given to him from the Federalist Society, one of them had an expansive  view of the Presidency; that being that the President of the United  States cannot be indicted and that the President of the United States  cannot be investigated. That is the standard that says a President is  above and beyond the law.   I challenge every Member in the Chamber to pull out the Constitution  and find the provision that says our Founders established a kingdom and  a King because I think they are going to  [[Page S5885]]  find that is not the case; that there is no clause in our Constitution  that says the President is above and beyond the law.   As our oath of office requires, let's exercise our responsibility  appropriately with the advice and consent responsibility, and let's get  the full documents and resolve this conflict of interest before any  hearing is held.   I thank the Presiding Officer.    Mr. President, somebody once said: What is the use of a  house if you don't have a tolerable planet to put it on?   That is a question that we should all grapple with in this Chamber.  It is a question that propels my colleagues from the Environment  Committee to come to the floor and take note that the Trump  administration's plan to replace the Clean Power Plan with a dirty  power plan is one egregious step in damaging our planet. It is an  egregious step to increase carbon pollution.   Carbon pollution has all kinds of effects that we are seeing across  the country, from raging forest fires in the Northwest, with my State  covered in smoke, to the stronger, more powerful hurricanes that hit  the city of Houston of my colleague from Texas and the cities in  Florida of my colleague from Florida, to the impact across the country  on agriculture, to the impact with greater droughts in some cases and  greater floods in others. One of the single most effective steps that  can be taken is to reduce the amount of carbon pollution from  powerplants and transportation.    Let's be clear. This dirty power plan from the administration  increases the damage to the citizens of the United States, all just to  pander to polluters. We have seen so much of this in the last year and  a half.   I know that we are living in an era in which the administration has  created a parallel universe of alternative facts, where truth isn't  necessarily truth, as the President's lawyer said this past couple of  weeks. But let's remember that if you are outside that parallel  universe, if you are in the real world, there are real numbers.   By 2030, the Clean Power Plan would stop 870 million tons of  pollution from poisoning the air that you and I, our families, our  children, and our friends breathe. That is represented here by looking  at this blue line in the year 2030 and the descending line of carbon  pollution that is driven both by the fuel economy standards and the  electricity standards. What we see under the President's dirty power  plan is that, from here into the future, there is no further  reduction--essentially zero reduction--then, past 2030, an increase in  the carbon pollution that is doing all this damage across the country.   There is damage in every one of our States. This damage doesn't just  happen in blue States. Texas is not a blue State. Texas suffered  horrific consequences of this carbon pollution, so certainly  representatives from that State would want to do something about it,  and so on, through every single State. The amount of difference in the  carbon pollution between the Clean Power Plan and the dirty power plan  is equivalent to the pollution from 166 million cars on the road for a  year.   It isn't just the impact on forest fires and the impact on hurricanes  and the impact on drought, affecting agriculture, and the impact on  floods. It is also the impact on human health. The estimate is that, by  the year 2030, the difference between the Clean Power Plan and the  dirty power plan is 4,500 premature deaths. So this decision kills  people.   The difference between those two lines, by the year 2030, is 90,000  children's asthma attacks. The difference between those two lines is  1,700 heart attacks. Picture that many children with asthma attacks  going to the hospital, 90,000 children. Picture that many heart  attacks. Picture that many premature deaths. Aren't we here to make  America stronger and better, not to kill Americans, not to put  Americans in the hospital? Yet the President's plan does exactly that.   Those health problems result in a lot more expenses. The Clean Power  Plan could result in $54 billion in health and climate benefits, and it  creates a lot of jobs by driving renovation of the energy industry.  When you renovate a house, you create a number of jobs. When you  renovate an energy economy, you create a lot of jobs--millions of  jobs--millions of jobs in clean and renewable energy, in wind and solar  and geothermal.   The dirty power plan the President is putting forward says this:  Instead of having a plan, we will simply tell the States to develop an  idea of what they should do. In other words, the States have the  responsibility, but no requirements, to act.   There is a little bit in there about improving the efficiency of  coal-fired plants. But the idea is that if you extend the plants for a  couple of years by making them more efficient, then you will reduce the  adoption of renewable energy that is cheaper. So we are also talking  about more expensive power by keeping inefficient, expensive forms of  power, producing into the future.   These ideas that the administration has put forward about making the  plants work a little bit more efficiently come with the caveat that, if  you do that, you don't have to put the additional modernization  pollution controls on them. It means more fine particulates, it means  more sulfur, and it means more mercury--all things that damage human  health. So it all keeps coming back to this assault on the health of  Americans and on ag and on forests and on fishing. All three of those  are affected by carbon pollution and climate chaos. That is the basic  picture we are looking at.  [[Page S5898]]    Why don't we take a step back and just ask the simple question: What  is the best outcome for America? Is it the adoption of cheaper  renewable energy over more expensive fossil fuels? I would say: Yes,  let's adopt the cheaper energy.   Is it the adoption of cleaner energy over dirtier energy? Yes, let's  keep our air cleaner.   Is it doing what is right for the health of Americans? Yes, let's do  right by the health of Americans.   Is it taking and contributing to a strategy of driving carbon  pollution hopefully, eventually, down to zero? We want a plan that  drives carbon down, not a plan that drives it sideways--that is, no  change--or works eventually upward.   The question that David Thoreau put before us, ``What is the use of a  house if you haven't got a tolerable planet to put it on?'' includes  great significance for those American citizens who had their homes  burned down this year because of carbon pollution. It would certainly  be very relevant to those working in agriculture in America who are  losing their farms because of drought or floods. It would certainly be  relevant to those citizens living in Texas and Florida who have been  deeply damaged by the hurricane storms of last year.   So let's do right for Americans, and let's reject this dirty power  plan that will hurt us in every way possible.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Amelia Ziegler, have privileges of the floor for the balance of the  day.
