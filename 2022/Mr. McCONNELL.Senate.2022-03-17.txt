 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, next week, the Judiciary Committee  will hear firsthand from President Biden's Supreme Court nominee Judge  Jackson. It will be a serious and dignified process. The American  people need answers to more important questions than what somebody  wrote in the nominee's high school yearbook.   The Senate needs to examine Judge Jackson's qualifications, and we  need to examine her judicial philosophy and see if she will apply laws  as written and weigh cases without favoritism. And we need to explore  why the farthest left activists in the country desperately wanted Judge  Jackson, in particular, for this vacancy.   Judicial philosophy is a key qualification for the Supreme Court.  There are plenty of smart lawyers in the country, but they don't all  understand that a judge's proper role is to apply the text of the laws  neutrally. Some would rather start with liberal outcomes and reason  backward.   So it is unsettling that senior Democrats have lauded Judge Jackson  for the ``empathy'' they suggest shapes her judicial approach. So if  you are the litigant for whom the judge has special preexisting  empathy, well, it is your lucky day; but the other party is being  denied their fair day in court.   The Senate Democratic leader, the House majority whip, and multiple  legal academics all say Judge Jackson will rule with ``empathy.''  Helpfully, one professor clarified which kinds of litigants would  benefit from her empathy. He proposed that because of Judge Jackson's  ``ample criminal defense experience,'' she would ``bring a measure of  empathy to the criminal defense cases, the Fourth and Fifth Amendment  cases.''   So liberals are saying that Judge Jackson's service as a criminal  defense lawyer and then on the U.S. Sentencing Commission give her  special empathy for convicted criminals. Her supporters look at her  resume and deduce a special empathy for criminals. I guess that means  that government prosecutors and innocent crime victims start each trial  at a disadvantage.   That isn't my assertion. That is what the nominee's liberal  supporters are all saying. In fact, the nominee has all but said it  herself. Here is what the Washington Post reported last year when Judge  Jackson was nominated to the DC Circuit:         She and her allies credit her work as a public defender as       helping her develop empathy.    And here they quote the nominee herself:         There is a direct line from my defender service to what I       do on the bench, and I think it's beneficial.    So, look, nobody is saying that public defenders ought to be  disqualified from judicial service. It is an important role. But as the  New York Times reported this week, the Biden administration is on an  intentional quest to stuff the Federal judiciary full of this one  perspective. Even amid a national crime wave, a disproportionate share  of the new judges President Biden has nominated share this professional  background that liberals say gives judges special empathy for criminal  defendants.   Here is the New York Times:         It is a sea change in the world of judicial nominations. .       . . The type of high-profile murder cases handled by some of       Mr. Biden's nominees would have been considered disqualifying       only a few years ago; now the president . . . is actively       seeking to name more jurists who have such experience.    It is not just Judge Jackson.         At least 20 other lawyers with significant public defender       experience have been nominated by the Biden administration.    One soft-on-crime advocate marveled to the reporter:         We have never seen anything like this.    Such enthusiasm.   President Biden is deliberately working to make the whole Federal  judiciary softer on crime. Even liberals admitted as much. They  actually applaud it. But with murders and carjackings skyrocketing  nationwide, I doubt the American people feel the same way.   I look forward to learning more about how Judge Jackson believes her  service as a criminal defense attorney leads her to interpret the text  of our laws and our Constitution differently than other judges. If any  judicial nominee really does have special empathy for some parties over  others, that is not an asset; it is a problem.                                    Energy    Madam President, on another matter, as Democratic policies have  unleashed runaway inflation, families have felt particular pain at the  gas pump.   Since President Biden took office, gas prices have climbed nearly  $2--$2. The Biden administration wants to claim that a full year's  worth of price hikes were all caused by a war Putin started 3 weeks  ago. But this fictional version of events doesn't fool anyone.   Two years ago, then-candidate Biden told everyone he was ready to  wage war on the most reliable forms of American energy:         No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill,       period. [It] ends.    That is President Biden.   [[Page S1231]]              I guarantee you . . . We're going to end fossil fuel.    In other words, either the Biden administration has a shaky  understanding of supply and demand or soaring energy prices have been  baked into their agenda right from the beginning.   For 14 months now, energy policy has followed a disturbing pattern.  First, the Biden administration rolls out a direct attack on American  energy, then working families feel the pinch, and then Democrats try to  deflect the blame. Take the Keystone XL Pipeline. President Biden made  canceling it a day one priority. Then, as gasoline, diesel, and other  energy prices climbed, the White House justified itself by saying the  project would have taken years to affect prices anyway.   The problem is, back during the Obama administration, their own  analysis suggested the project would be fully operational by 2013. They  spent a decade fighting against a pipeline that would have taken a  couple of years to come online by complaining it was not immediate  enough.   That was their argument a decade ago, and it is their argument now.  The pipeline could have been built multiple times over in the time the  Democrats spent resisting it. Besides, if slow construction were really  the problem, the administration would be rushing to rein in their own  regulatory army that is handcuffing other new and existing pipelines  with mountains of extra bureaucracy.   Just weeks ago, while Putin was already amassing forces and trying to  make energy hostages out of Western Europe, the Biden administration's  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission went out of its way to make  permitting new American natural gas pipelines radically more difficult.   Here is yet another example. Last year, the Biden administration  directed the SEC to prioritize discouraging loans, capital, and  financing for fossil fuel energy projects. But now that a worldwide  scramble has sent prices sky-high, the administration blames the  industry and says it is ``time for oil and gas companies to work with  Wall Street to unleash our productive capacity.'' The administration  that campaigned on ending fossil fuels now claims the fossil fuel  companies are just layabouts who don't want to drill. It is enough to  make your head spin.   Oh, and President Biden rushed to lash America back to the mast of a  climate deal that actually gave China a pass to keep increasing their  emissions. As Germany prepared to give Putin an even tighter hold on  Europe's market for natural gas with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,  President Biden fought bipartisan efforts to stop the pipeline.   His response to soaring prices hurting families last year was to go  hat in hand and beg OPEC and Russia to produce more. And now that  Russia has invaded Ukraine, the Biden administration is reportedly  exploring more imports--listen to this--from Venezuela and Iran,  totalitarian regimes with contempt for human rights and the  environment.   So it turns out the Biden administration doesn't mind fossil fuel  production after all. They just don't want to ``Buy American.'' The  administration will buy oil from the Supreme Leader of Iran; they will  buy oil from Maduro. If North Korea had oil, they would probably try to  buy that, too. Anything--anything--to avoid keeping those jobs and that  energy independence right here in the USA.    Mr. President, due to the current events happening in  Europe, the Majority Leader and I have agreed to increase the  membership of the Senate NATO Observer Group by two additional  Senators. For the additional Republican Senator, I ask that Senator  Moran be added to participate in the group.                            ____________________
