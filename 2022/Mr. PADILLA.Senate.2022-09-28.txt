 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to Calendar No. 482, S. 3092.    I further ask that the Padilla amendment, which is at  the desk, be considered and agreed to, the committee-reported  substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended,  be considered read a third time and passed; and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I rise to discuss and explain the  matter we just took action on. It is relative to wildfires. All across  the Western United States, historic wildfires continue to grow both  more frequent and more severe. Every year, in recent years, entire  communities have been destroyed by wildfires in a matter of hours. We  have seen this in California, New Mexico, and Colorado. Families are  forced to flee with only the belongings they could quickly pack into  their vehicles.   Last year, I visited the incident command center in Quincy, CA, to  see firsthand the real-time response to the devastating Dixie fire.  Separately, I met with local leaders in Santa Rosa, CA, to hear about  problems with recovery from previous catastrophic wildfires.   So my bill--the bill we just took action on, the FEMA Improvement,  Reform, and Efficiency Act or the FIRE Act--will help ensure FEMA  better addresses the unique and increasing danger of wildfires.   FEMA's current procedures and requirements don't always work for  postwildfire recovery needs. And this bill will close those gaps.   I give a lot of credit to FEMA. They have gotten pretty good at  anticipating and responding to other types of disasters. We are seeing  it, as we speak, with the hurricane impact in Florida. They do the same  with tornadoes, floods, other disasters.   In all these scenarios, we know that it begins with preparation. The  FIRE Act will begin the process of allowing FEMA to predeploy resources  during times of extremely high risk. In the West, we know it as red  flag warnings.   When it is hot, conditions are dry, and the wind kicks up, it is a  recipe for disaster. And so to have FEMA be able to deploy in advance-- just as they do already during hurricane warnings, as we are seeing in  Florida at this very moment--is a smart thing to do.   Then, as communities rebuild after a devastating wildfire, this bill  will work to ensure that FEMA takes wildfire-specific issues into  account, like melted infrastructure and burned trees. It will also help  local governments work with FEMA to more effectively relocate critical  infrastructure away from fire-prone areas.   Now, in the aftermath of a fire, the bill will help provide better  housing assistance, case management, and crisis counseling for  survivors with a focus on equity for underserved communities and Tribal  governments. Oftentimes these underserved communities and Tribal  governments suffer the disproportionate impact of these wildfires.   So with the FIRE Act, we will be able to better prepare for and  respond to the unique challenges of wildfires in California and  throughout the Western United States.   The FIRE Act passed out of the Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Committee by a voice vote on February 2 of this year. And I  want to take a moment to thank both Chairman Peters and Ranking Member  Portman and their staffs who contributed to this bill, as well as our  partners at FEMA.   This is an overdue, commonsense bill to help communities on the  frontlines of our wildfire crisis. And I thank my colleagues for  joining me in supporting it.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Renewing  Immigration Provisions of the Immigration Act of 1929 Act.   There are currently 11 million noncitizens in the United States. It  is not feasible or productive to remove all them. The vast majority of  these noncitizens have established roots in the United States and are  law-abiding citizens. They have made contributions to  [[Page S5229]]  their communities and have served as essential workers during the  pandemic. Leaving them without a path to permanent residence denies  them the opportunity to become full participants in our society.   This legislation would ensure that long-term residents who have lived  in the United States continuously for at least 7 years are able to  apply for lawful permanent residence.   The Renewing Immigration Provisions of the Immigration Act of 1929  Act would amend the existing registry statue in the Immigration and  Nationality Act by establishing a rolling cutoff date of 7 years prior  to the date that an immigrant files an application to register  permanent or adjusted status.   This bill would ensure that long-term residents already in the United  States who have been waiting for a visa number to become available for  over 7 years can immediately file an application to register permanent  or adjust status.   This legislation also provides a much needed pathway to a green card  for Dreamers and forcibly displaced citizens, such as TPS holders, who  have been in legal limbo for many years.   Finally, the bill would preempt the need for further congressional  action by making the eligibility cutoff rolling, instead of tying it to  a specific date, as it is now.   Advancing the registry date is not unprecedented. Congress has  updated the registry in a bipartisan fashion four times since it was  first codified in 1929. As a result of the 1958 changes, the registry  mechanism became available to immigrants who had entered the country  improperly or who had overstayed or who violated the terms of a  temporary period of entry. With this change, Congress intended the  registry to be a mechanism for noncitizens to adjust to lawful  permanent resident status.   Currently, the eligibility cutoff date is January 1, 1972, more than  50 years ago. Fewer and fewer immigrants are able to meet this cutoff  entry date requirement, rendering this provision all but useless. From  2015 to 2019 only 305 individuals were able to adjust their status  based on the registry, down from 58,914 from 1985 to 1989.        It is imperative that we provide immigrants who have been       living with uncertainty about their futures a path to       permanent residence status.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Renewing  Immigration Provisions of the Immigration Act of 1929 Act.
