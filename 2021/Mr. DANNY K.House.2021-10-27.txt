DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   The COVID-19 pandemic hit all of our communities hard, but for  vulnerable youth in foster care, it was terrifying, especially for  those youth approaching the age of independence at which they lose  access to the supports that foster care provides.   When my good friend Congresswoman Jackie Walorski and I teamed up  last year to provide States with flexibility and funding to help these  youth, we hoped and expected that the pandemic would be over by now and  that these youth would be back on track, getting an education, starting  jobs, finding a place to live, and establishing independent lives.   Unfortunately, the delta variant hit hard, creating a new wave of  challenges for these youth. To the current and former foster youth who  reached out to us and our colleagues to share their stories, we hear  you, and we are committed to continuing to respect the lessons of your  lived experience in foster care.   The legislation we are considering today, the Continued State  Flexibility To Assist Older Foster Youth Act will restore and continue  key program flexibilities that allow States to provide greater  stability and certainty to current and former youth via the John H.  Chafee Foster Care Independence Program.   The bill will give States the flexibility to continue providing the  specific supports that older foster youth need to return to college,  training programs, and work. It will extend flexibilities to secure  housing, to gain independence through driving programs, and to allow  youth who would otherwise age out of eligibility for services a little  more support to weather the pandemic.   I firmly believe in the strong bipartisan partnership that  Representative Walorski and I have built over the years to help  vulnerable youth and families to improve our child welfare system.   We have a lot to do to help foster youth through this pandemic, and  this legislation to allow States to make better use of the funding we  provided is the first step.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentlewoman.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers.   I will simply say that I am very pleased that we are considering this  important legislation that would provide additional help to foster  children and give States the flexibility that they need to provide all  the assistance during this pandemic that foster children can make use  of.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking member tremendously for the  bipartisanship we have been able to effect, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
