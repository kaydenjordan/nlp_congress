 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Frederick William  Rusteberg of Brownsville, Texas.   Mr. Rusteberg served the majority of his professional career as the  original founding CEO and president of International Bank of Commerce  in Brownsville until his retirement on October 27, 2016.   In the early 1970s, Mr. Rusteberg served his country as an officer in  the United States Army.  [[Page H3455]]    After receiving the Army commendation medal and an honorable  discharge, he returned to his hometown of Brownsville. He helped  develop the area's future as assistant port director for the Port of  Brownsville.   Mr. Rusteberg began his 40-year banking career at Bank of the  Southwest. Shortly thereafter, he opened the first International Bank  of Commerce bank facility in Cameron County in 1984.   A champion of education, Mr. Rusteberg led successful efforts for the  Brownsville Independent School District to secure funding for our  schools. He and his family established the very first scholarship  endowment at the University of Texas-Brownsville, now University of  Texas Rio Grande Valley.    Mr. Rusteberg has been married to Frances Hill for 48 years and has  two children, William Rusteberg and Liz Rusteberg Hainley, and two  grandchildren, Jessie Hainley and Will Hainley. Fred and Frances have  been highly active in the community throughout the years and are  blessed to call Brownsville home.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to honor Frederick  William Rusteberg. His character and hard work make him a tremendous  role model for the citizens of Brownsville, and I am confident his  contributions will continue to guide south Texas in a positive  direction.   I ask my colleagues to join me, his family, and friends in commending  his life of service.                            ____________________
