 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, this week, the  [[Page H5833]]  House will raise the wages of 40 million Americans.   It has been 10 years--10 years--since the Federal minimum wage has  been increased. It has been stuck at $7.25 since July 24, 2009. During  that time, the cost of living has gone up 18 percent.   Today, a full-time worker earning the minimum wage working year-round  without even a week's vacation, they earn only $1,250 a month, or  $15,000 a year. It is far below the monthly expenses for the average  family of $3,000, which is what the monthly expenses are.   A new report from the Joint Economic Committee on which I serve as  vice chair shows that today's minimum wage doesn't even cover the cost  of housing for the typical American family. The minimum wage is far  from a living wage.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Raise the Wage Act  and increase it to $15 by 2024.                            ____________________
