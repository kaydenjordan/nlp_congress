 Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, friends and family will gather  to celebrate the extraordinary life of Steve Chazen. As they do, I  extend my deepest condolences to his wife, Pat, and his entire family.   The Steve I knew was a transformational leader, proud of his country  and devoted to his loving family and community. His impact on Kern  County and across America was enormous.   As a champion of American energy, he saw the value of investing in  the Kern County oil patch. In 1998, he organized a masterful deal to  purchase the Elk Hills Strategic Petroleum Reserve in my congressional  district in California. It was a huge gamble, but it paid off. Today,  Kern County is renowned for its energy production, largely because of  the hard work of our oil workers and our embrace of innovative  technologies.   The Elk Hills deal captures the essence of Steve's long and storied  career. He was a trendsetter, not a trend follower. Others took cues,  Steve took smart risks.   With his intellect and vision, his guts and wit, and his candor,  Steve transformed an industry and helped deliver American global energy  leadership.    I also appreciate that he didn't mince words. His quips were  legendary. He famously said, ``Houston had bad weather and good people.  L.A. has great weather.''   By the time we met, Steve was already a titan in industry, but I also  saw another important side of Steve. I saw his boundless generosity.  Here is the truth: Steve was a relentless philanthropist. When he  wasn't working, he was giving back to his community.   Education, medicine, and environment, these are just a few of the  many areas that benefited from Steve's unselfish support. His impact  was profound. The most notable part is, Steve didn't care about getting  the credit. He was a great leader, but an even greater person.   Finally, let me say a word about Steve's selfless patriotism. For  several years, Steve served his country as a canine handler in the  Vietnam war. He didn't talk about it much, but he was a decorated  veteran. In Vietnam, Steve and his scout dog would find and disable  land mines in front of the rest of his unit.  [[Page H8358]]    Dog handlers like Steve were so effective that they were special  targets for the enemy. Only 13 of the 113 brave soldiers who trained  with Steve returned home. Yet because of their courage, more than  10,000 American lives were saved. Imagine for a moment if the Vietnam  Memorial had another 10,000 names on it.   Whether it was his visionary leadership, his philosophy, his pride in  America, or his deep love for Pat, Steve was a great man. His life is  an enduring example of leadership and service, a reminder of our duty  to help one another.   As we celebrate his life and lasting impact, let's lift up Pat and  the entire Chazen family in our prayers, and let's dedicate ourselves  to continuing the lessons Steve instilled in us to improve our country.                            ____________________
