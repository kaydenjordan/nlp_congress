 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and his great leadership in regard to the issues that we are  dealing with today.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation.   Madam Speaker, our national debt rose $7.8 trillion under the last  President, a Republican President. My Republican colleagues voted for  that spending; raising the debt ceiling is about paying those bills.  But my Republican colleagues who claim to be the party of fiscal  responsibility don't want to pay their bills.   Well, the Republicans are risking economic Armageddon to score  political points against a Democratic President. If we don't pass this  bill, unemployment numbers will skyrocket, markets will tumble, Social  Security payments will be delayed, borrowing costs will go up, so that  means for car  [[Page H5529]]  loans, for home loans, for farm loans--all of that, because of their  irresponsibility--will be out of reach for most Americans. It will be a  catastrophe.   Madam Speaker, it is time to stop playing games, political games, and  raise the ceiling, as we have done many times before in a bipartisan  way.
