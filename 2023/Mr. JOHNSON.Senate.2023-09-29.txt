 Madam President, I am very glad that you have taken the  chair to preside because I want to talk about something I think is kind  of near and dear to your heart. This is something that I passed in the  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in the Senate back  in 2019, and this was passed with bipartisan support. I am talking  about a bill called the Prevent Government Shutdowns Act.   Following passage, I wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal. I  just want to read the first two paragraphs of that column, published on  September 22, 2019:         If the Legislature in my home state of Wisconsin fails to       pass the next year's appropriation bills, we don't shut       government agencies down. We fund them at the previous year's       appropriation levels. Doesn't that make sense?        That common-sense approach should apply in Washington, but       it doesn't. By the time I arrived in 2011, Congress's       appropriations process was completely broken.    It still is.         The United States has since had--    Again, this is as of September 2019.       --the United States has since had three government shutdowns,       passed 34 continuing resolutions to avoid shutdowns, raised       or suspended the debt ceiling nine times and--    Again, this was just 4 years ago.       --increased the federal debt $8.5 trillion.    So here we are, a couple days before the end of the fiscal year, 4  years later--our debt, by the way, has more than doubled; it stands at  $33 trillion now--and we are facing a shutdown.   Isn't this ridiculous? There is no reason for this.   Again, back in June of 2019, I tasked up my committee members. I  said: OK. I want to pass a bill that will end all government shutdowns  forever. Take it off the table.   Now, there have been a number of bills designed to do that offered in  both Chambers, both the House and the Senate.   I have three members of the committee--four members of the committee  have their own bills.   The bill I selected to debate, mark up, and pass was one offered by  Senators James Lankford and Maggie Hassan.   I chose that bill because--one bill actually increased spending; one  bill decreased spending. But the Hassan-Lankford bill did what we do in  Wisconsin: You don't shut an agency down; you don't shut the government  down; you just keep spending at last year's level until the legislature  can get its act together and appropriate the funds.   So that bill that I chose that we passed--by the way, on a bipartisan  basis. I believe every Democratic Senator on the committee voted for it  because Senator Hassan, Senator Lankford did a good job of coming  together in a bipartisan fashion. They put some disciplines in there.   But what it does, it just creates rolling 14-day CRs. With those  disciplines, Members can't travel back on the government dime. You only  have a 24-hour shutdown, I believe. There are other disciplines there  that put pressure on the process to get our act together and start  appropriating bills.   If you don't get it done in the first 14 days, you have another 14- day CR, you do another 14-day CR, until we complete the appropriations  process.   Again, not an efficient way of doing things. I think the reason most  Members say that they don't want to shut down the government is we  realize it is a very inefficient process, and it hurts people. It hurts  people.   So why haven't we passed this in the last 4 years? Why haven't some  of these other preventing government shutdowns acts passed in the past?  Why not? It is ridiculous we haven't done it yet.   The result, by the way, has been what this chart demonstrates. Again,  I already mentioned we are at $33 trillion in debt. It is very  important to recognize how out of control spending is here in  Washington, DC.   When we were debating the omnibus last year, I asked my Republican  colleagues at the Senate lunch: Does anybody know how much the Federal  Government is going to spend this year?   I didn't get any answers. Maybe somebody knew, but they didn't  volunteer to answer.   I went out and asked the Washington press corps, the folks who are  supposed to be reporting on this to our constituents and to the  American public: Does anybody know how much the government spent last  year?   Well, it is over $1 trillion. Well, that is true in terms of  discretionary spending--less than 30 percent of the budget.   By the way, I granted them immediate absolution. I said: I wouldn't  expect you to know how much the Federal Government spends in total  because we never talk about it.   Think of it. The Federal Government is the largest financial entity  in the world, and, in December of 2022, the people I was asking--the  people who should have known this--had no idea what in total the  Federal Government spent. Well, the answer was about $6.2 trillion.   Let me put that in context. That is what this chart shows. The  numbers are pretty small. So I will describe them. This column is  fiscal year 2019 spending. This is the fiscal year before the pandemic  and the pandemic recession.   This column is this fiscal year, fiscal year 2023 estimated spending.  We don't have hard figures yet, but we have a pretty good idea of what  we are going to be spending.   Just 4 years ago, in just the year 2019, total Federal Government  spending was $4.446 trillion--$4.4 trillion. Let me put that in  perspective. In 2002, it was the first time we passed the Rubicon of  spending over $2 trillion in total. Seventeen years later--it took us  17 years to more than double that to $4.4 trillion.   This fiscal year that we are closing out in a couple of days, we will  spend over $6.3 trillion. We are spending $1.9 trillion more this year  than we spent just 4 years ago. This is completely out of control.   By the way, if you put us on a baseline, based on just population  growth and inflation--in other words, take out the massive out-of- control spending during the pandemic and just put us on a reasonable  baseline--last year, we spent a little more than $5 trillion.   But in the debt ceiling deal--which, by the way, didn't raise the  debt ceiling by a given amount--but House conservatives basically gave  the Speaker to negotiate $1.5 trillion. We have done one of these  Washington games, which is suspending debt. It will probably result in  a debt ceiling of $4 trillion, which will accommodate this massive-- massive--deficit spending.   So again, just to repeat: 4 years ago, $4.4 trillion; 4 years later,  $6.3, almost $6.4 trillion. That is an increase of more than $1.9  trillion. And the deficit this year will be somewhere between $1.7 and  $2 trillion. We need to get this under control.   But I want to make an important point here. As dysfunctional as  Washington, DC, is--it is grotesquely dysfunctional. I come from the  private sector. This would not happen in the private sector. You  wouldn't take 72 or 73 percent of what you spend in your private sector  budget and say: That is on automatic pilot. We are never going to look  at that. We are only going to look at 27 percent of the budget and try  to control that. That is basically what we are doing here with  discretionary spending this year. Twenty-seven percent, we will focus  on that, and we will ignore 73 percent and let it grow out of control.   But again, this is a well-honed process. This isn't--it is  dysfunctional, but the process is in place, and it is a well-honed  process to mortgage our children's future, and we are witnessing that  process.   Again, this is my 13th year. I think every year, at least, a shutdown  has been threatened, as we are threatening this one--again, disquieting  people, worrying people, because if a shutdown does occur, people will  be hurt. We can avoid it.   But this well-honed process is playing out as it has ever since I  have arrived here. Basically, you don't do appropriation bills without  the House, without the Senate. You might start. You might start the  charade, like we did this year, and start passing them in this Chamber,  in September, a few weeks before the fiscal year. Obviously, you don't  have enough time to pass all of them. So then you threaten a government  shutdown.   You predict calamity, and then you load onto a continuing resolution  spending that may or may not be controversial. It is not where you  increase spending. It is not where you put supplemental spending. But  that is what  [[Page S4824]]  we do. So it becomes controversial, and, all of a sudden, here you are  threatening shutdown.   Now the proposal on the table right now in the Senate is: Let's do a  CR with some controversial spending, and we will have that CR end the  day before the Thanksgiving recess--a little pressure on our Members,  just in case we can get our act together to come up with a couple of  massive minibuses or just one massive omnibus to drop on everybody's  desk. And if they want to go home for recess, you had better pass that  now.   Now, my guess is we probably won't be able to get that done in time,  and so we will end up with another CR. This one will probably be  scheduled to expire--oh, I don't know, pick a date. My guess would be  December 23 and December 24--the same process. That is what happened  last year.   Then we get it, again, dropped on our desk--about a 2,000-plus page  bill. Nobody has time to read it, other than the people who wrote it.  And you get the Hobson's choice--vote yes or no. The problem with that,  in addition to just the grotesque dysfunction of it, is the individual  appropriation bills do not get the scrutiny that they deserve.    If you bring up every appropriations bill--12--you have got to start  somewhere around May. You bring up each individual appropriation bill.  Now you can actually scrutinize it. The public can see it. We can offer  amendments.   Again, it is not a panacea. I am not going to say it is going to  completely stop this runaway spending train, but it will be some  constraint. It restores some function to this very dysfunctional place.   So what I have been pushing for, for 4 years--and it is one of the  reasons I withheld my consent on the minibus. And I appreciate the fact  that the chairman and the ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee were willing to work with me and offer me an amendment on the  minibus to try and get a vote to maybe pass the Preventing Government  Shutdown Act, but other people are objecting, and we haven't got that  vote yet.   So here we are, a couple days before a shutdown, and we need to do  something. The House is having, obviously, a difficult time coming up  with a solution. The Senate may pass something that really has no  chance of passing in the House. I think we have to be honest about  that.   So, again, in order to prevent a government shutdown, what we ought  to do is do something that people agree on. You know, rather than  trying to use this moment to jam something through that people don't  all agree with, let's try and pass something people agree with, which  is a bill that will prevent a government shutdown.   Now, I chose a 14-day clean CR--because that is pretty much the  structure of the Prevent Government Shutdowns Act, rolling 14-day CRs,  giving both Chambers the time to act to start passing these bills with  a little bit more scrutiny than what minibuses or an omnibus would  afford. It is a very commonsense approach. It is something we all ought  to agree on. It would prevent a shutdown. It would prevent pain to real  people. And all we have to do is agree to do what we all say we want to  do, to avoid what we all say we want to avoid--a government shutdown.   So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed  to the immediate consideration of my bill, which is at the desk. I  further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed,  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.
