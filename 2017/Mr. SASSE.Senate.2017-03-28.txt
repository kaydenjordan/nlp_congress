 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to comment briefly on Russian  interference in the electoral processes in this country and across the  West and governments of many of Russia's own neighbors.   We are in the middle of a civilization warfare crisis of public trust  in this country. This isn't about the last 2 months. This isn't just  about the last Presidential election. This is fundamentally about the  last few decades of declining public trust in a broad range of our  institutions: the press, political parties, executive branch agencies,  the Congress, and beyond.   Russia is not unaware of our own distrust of each other. Russia is  not unaware of our own increasing self-doubt about our shared values.  Russia is today very self-consciously working to further erode  confidence in our self-government by pulling at the threads of our  public and civic life. Moscow's influence campaigns don't start by  creating wholly new problems out of thin air, but rather by exploiting  fissures that already exist in our civilization. The simplest way for  Russia to try to weaken us is by trying to exploit the places where we  are already weak, the places where we are already distrustful, and the  places where we are failing to pass along a shared understanding of  American values to the next generation.   The sad state of modern politics and the explosion of digital media  are proving to be ripe targets for many of our own internal doubts and  our own discord. We--all of us, Republicans and Democrats, the  legislature and the executive branch--are ill-prepared for the  challenges that are already on our doorstep, let alone what comes next  with the acceleration of these kinds of technologies.   Today in the Wall Street Journal, we in this body were rebuked-- rightly rebuked, I think, and rebuked in a bipartisan way by former  Congressman Mike Rogers. Chairman Rogers, a Republican, served as the  Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee from 2011 through 2015. I  am going to read his op-ed rebuke into the Record today, but I would  humbly ask that all 100 Members of this body calmly and self-critically  consider carefully Chairman Rogers' argument, for his argument is not  fundamentally against Republicans alone. It is not against Democrats  alone. He is offering double-barreled criticism of all of us in the  Congress--criticism of both parties. Why of both parties? Because  Russia's influence campaign is a really big deal. Are we Republicans  listening? Also, because our response to Russia's influence campaign is  not primarily about who you supported last November in the Presidential  election.   Listening to the Democrats, it is sometimes hard to understand if  that side of the aisle remembers that basic fact about what Russia's  influence campaign was up to. Russia's goals in our most recent  election were not initially about one candidate versus another  candidate. We need to underscore this. There are particulars that those  of us who spend time reading classified intelligence know we can't  discuss in this unclassified setting. But the big, broad point is  simple and needs to be shouted, and that is that Putin's fundamental  goals are about undermining NATO. Putin's fundamental goals are about  making us doubt our own values: freedom of speech, freedom of religion,  freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right of protest or  redress of grievances.   The Kremlin isn't attempting an influence campaign to make Americans  believe that the sky is green or the grass is blue. He is trying to  undertake an influence campaign to make us doubt our own First  Amendment values. The Kremlin wants us to believe that our society is  as corrupt as the thugocracy that Putin and his cronies are trying to  advance. That isn't true, but if you listen to us in this body, we  regularly do very little to restore the kind of public trust that Putin  is actively working to undermine.   So I ask that each Member of this body would humbly and carefully  consider Chairman Rogers' rebuke to the Congress this morning. This is  from the Wall Street Journal, Chairman Rogers; headline: ``America is  Ill-Prepared to Counter Russia's Information Warfare.''         When historians look back at the 2016 election, they will       likely determine that it represented one of the most       successful information operation campaigns ever conducted. A       foreign power, through the targeted application of cyber       tools to influence America's electoral process, was able to       cast doubt on the election's legitimacy, engender doubts       about the victor's fitness for office, tarnish the outcome of       the vote, and frustrate the new President's agenda.        Historians will also see a feckless Congress--both       Democrats and Republicans--that focused on playing partisan       ``gotcha'' and fundamentally failed in its duty to gather       information, hold officials accountable, and ultimately serve       our country's interests.        Whether or not the Trump campaign or its staff were       complicit in Moscow's meddling is missing the broader point:       Russia's intervention has affected how Americans now view the       peaceful transition of power from one president to the next.       About this we should not be surprised. Far from it.        Propaganda is perhaps the second- or third-oldest       profession. Using information as a tool to affect outcomes is       as old as politics. Propaganda was familiar to the ancient       Greeks and Romans, the Byzantines, and the Han Dynasty. Each       generation applies the technology of the day in trying to       influence an adversary's people.        What's new today is the reach of social media, the       anonymity of the internet, and the speed in which falsehoods       and fabrications can propagate. Twitter averaged 319 million       monthly users in the fourth quarter of 2016. Instagram had       600 million accounts at the end of last year. Facebook's       monthly active users total 1.86 billion--a quarter of the       global population. Yet each of these staggering figures       doesn't fully capture the internet's reach.        In February, Russia's minister of defense, Sergey Shoigu,       announced a realignment in its cyber and digital assets. ``We       have information troops who are much more effective and       stronger than the former `counter-propaganda' section,'' Mr.       Shoigu said, according  [[Page S2033]]       to the BBC. Russia, more than any other country, recognizes       the value of information as a weapon. Moscow deployed it with       deadly effect in Estonia, in Georgia and most recently in       Ukraine, introducing doubt into the minds of locals,       spreading lies about their politicians, and obfuscating       Russia's true intentions.        A report last year by RAND Corporation, ``The Russian       `Firehose of Falsehood' Propaganda Model,'' noted that       cyber propaganda is practically a career path in Russia       now. A former paid troll told Radio Free Europe that teams       were on duty around the clock in 12-hour shifts and he was       [personally] required to post at least 135 comments of not       fewer than 200 characters each.        In effect, Moscow has developed a high-volume, multichannel       propaganda machine aimed at advancing its foreign and       security policy. Along with the traditional propaganda       tools--favoring friendly outlets and sponsoring ideological       journals--this represents an incredibly powerful [new] tool.        Now [let's] extrapolate that one step further: Apply       botnets, artificial intelligence and other next-generation       technology. The result will be automated propaganda, rapid       spamming and more. We shouldn't be surprised to see [more] of       this in the future.        Imagine [if you will] an American Senator who vocally       advocates a new strategic-forces treaty with European allies.    Pausing from the article for a minute--it is interesting to note that  is the debate we are actually having in the Senate today. We are  talking about expanding NATO to include Montenegro.   Picking back up:         Moscow, feeling threatened, launches a directed information       campaign to undermine the senator. His emails are breached       and published, disclosing personal details and family       disputes, alongside draft policy papers without context.       Social media is spammed with seemingly legitimate comments       opposing the senator's policy position. The senator's phone       lines are flooded with robocalls. Fake news articles are       pushed out on Russian-controlled media suggesting that the       Senator has probably broken campaign-finance laws.        Can you imagine the disruption to American society? The       confusion in the legislative process? The erosion of trust in       democracy? Unfortunately, this is the reality the U.S. faces       [next], and without a concerted effort it will get [much]       worse.        Congress is too focused on the trees to see the frightening       forest. Rather than engaging in sharp-edged partisanship,       lawmakers should be investigating Russian propaganda       operations and information warfare. They should be figuring       out how to reduce the influence of foreign trolls, and       teaching Americans about Moscow's capabilities. This would go       a long way [toward saving] the republic.    That is the end of the op-ed. Again, this was Chairman Mike Rogers,  who led the House Intelligence Committee from 2011 to 2015, writing an  op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this morning.   Here is what he is really saying. What he is saying is that America  has a future in foreign policy and national security and global  security that is going to have a lot more propaganda, and a body like  this--the Congress generally, but the Senate in particular--has an  obligation to help make sure the American people understand Moscow's  capabilities and their intentions.   Their intentions are to make us doubt our values. Their intentions  are to make us doubt our investment in NATO, the most successful  military alliance of last 2,000 years. Their intentions are to exploit  the ways that we already distrust each other in ways that should be  Republican versus Democratic policy, fighting about particular forms of  government intervention and the economy, for instance, but that are  subordinate to fundamental American beliefs about who we are as a  people and the things that we believe together before we are  Republicans and Democrats.   But if you listen to this body right now, would you have much  confidence that the American people hear people who come together and  believe things that are prepolitical and prepartisan first? Do we have  shared American values that we know how to trumpet? Do we have ways to  celebrate the things that fundamentally make us Americans well before  we are Republicans or Democrats?   I worry that if you watch cable news any given night right now, you  would not, as an American citizen, have that as a takeaway. Instead,  you would hear Americans saying--American public listeners and viewers  to those radio shows and cable shows thinking that the great divide in  the world is between Republicans and Democrats. That is actually not  true.   By voting record, I am the third most conservative guy around here  out of 100, so I care deeply about Republican versus Democratic answers  to most of the policy fights we have. But those things are radically  subordinate to the things we believe in common about the dignity of  people who are created with rights. The government doesn't give us  rights. God gives us rights by nature, and we come together as a  government to secure those rights. The rights of free speech, press,  assembly, and religion are fundamentally American things well before we  get to any of our policy bickering.   Yet, if the Americans listen to us in the Congress most days or most  weeks or most months, I bet their takeaway is that Republican versus  Democrat is the great divide, and we shouldn't trust anybody across  that aisle.   Well, guess what. That is exactly what Putin is trying to do. His  fundamental objective is to make Americans doubt our own values and to  doubt our own civilization so that we fight with each other first,  instead of agreeing as Americans first then fighting about a bunch of  important policy things--but first agreeing who we are as Americans.   The future that we face is a future where there is going to be a lot  more propaganda that tries to exploit our internal divisions to begin  with. It makes it all the more critical that a body like this exists to  help 320 million Americans with a lot of diversity and a lot of  disagreement about really important things. They ought to trust that an  institution like this exists to restore some sense of those shared  values and exists to restore some of that shared trust. Right now that  is not usually what they take away from us in the Congress. So I call  on the 100 Members of this Senate to consider carefully Chairman  Rogers' rebuke of us this morning in the Wall Street Journal.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
