 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  career of one of Rhode Island's most respected ocean and coastal  experts, my friend Dennis Nixon. Throughout his career, he has  demonstrated a deep commitment to Rhode Island and ocean and coastal  issues more broadly.   Mr. Nixon first arrived at the University of Rhode Island in 1975 to  pursue his master's in marine affairs. Thankfully for us, he received  his degree and then decided to stay in the Ocean State as a professor  at the university. Since then he has been a mainstay on the University  of Rhode Island's campus, teaching courses in maritime and coastal law  and publishing over 50 articles and a casebook on the topic.   He served as associate dean of academic Affairs for the College of  Environment and Life Sciences and then for 4 years as associate dean  for research and administration at the University of Rhode Island's  Graduate School of Oceanography. In that position, Mr. Nixon managed  the school's beautiful Narragansett Bay campus and the 185-foot  National Science Foundation research vessel Endeavor. Mr. Nixon also  serves as the risk manager and legal advisor to the University National  Oceanographic Laboratory System, based at URI's Graduate School of  Oceanography, which coordinates among oceanographic universities for  research time on vessels like Endeavor.   His influence does not stop at URI; he has lectured on 6 continents  and in more than 25 States. Mr. Nixon was instrumental in the creation  of the unique dual degree program in marine affairs and law between the  University of Rhode Island's Department of Marine Affairs and Roger  Williams University Law School. Outside academics, he cofounded Point  Club, an insurance cooperative for fishing vessels.   I first encountered Mr. Nixon when the tanker World Prodigy crashed  into Brenton Reef, causing an oilspill. I was a young staffer in the  Rhode Island attorney general's office, and Mr. Nixon joined the team  as our maritime law expert. Later, I was U.S. attorney when the tug- and-barge Scandia/North Cape caused another massive oilspill, and I  turned again to Mr. Nixon's professional advice. We worked well  together and became friends.   In 2013, Mr. Nixon was appointed director of Rhode Island Sea Grant.  His deep connections to Rhode Island and expertise in ocean and coastal  issues have helped Rhode Island Sea Grant further its reach into the  State's coastal communities and raise its profile nationwide. Among its  priorities, the State's Sea Grant Program is currently supporting  research into the causes and consequences of harmful algal blooms and  the effects of the Block Island Wind Farm on fishing interests and home  values. Mr. Nixon's regard in the State was on display when he was  tapped to moderate the marine debris symposia put on in conjunction  with the Volvo Ocean Race's stopovers in Newport in 2015 and 2018.   His drive to ensure Rhode Island maintains its leadership in marine  scholarship, development, and conservation is evident throughout his  career. Mr. Nixon obviously cares deeply about ocean and coastal  resources and the fishermen, businesses, and communities that rely on  these resources. He is even a fairly presentable sailor himself. For  over 40 years, the Ocean State has benefited from Mr. Nixon's passion  and leadership, and for this sincere dedication to Rhode Island and  coastal communities around the world, I stand today to recognize and  salute him.   Fair winds and following seas, my friend.                            ____________________
