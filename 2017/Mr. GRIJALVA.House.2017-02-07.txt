 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to face the facts. Congressional Republicans  do not value our Nation's public lands the way everyday Americans do. I  know this because they opened the 115th Congress by adopting a rules  package that makes it easier to sell our national parks and national  forests to the highest bidder without pesky budget rules getting in the  way. That was just a start.   Last week, they voted to gut clean water and clean air protections in  coal country, suspended a rule requiring oil companies to disclose  payments made to foreign governments, and pulled a plug on a waste  prevention regulation that would have saved money and improved air  quality.   Today, their assault on the environment and our public land continues  with this misguided effort to scrap the Bureau of Land Management's  effort to update its planning rule. This resolution targets what is  commonly known as Planning 2.0, an initiative to make public land  management more transparent and efficient by enhancing opportunities  for public input and utilizing actual science.   The American public does not support erasing this new planning rule,  and they certainly don't support the broad antipublic land agenda being  pushed by the Republicans.   Our constituents are sick of seeing corporate interests, especially  big polluters, come first. They do not want their national parks and  cherished natural places turned over to industrial polluters. We have  seen this in the massive response to the Dakota Access pipeline,  heartbreak over what happened in Flint, Michigan, and the millions of  people who marched worldwide on the first full day of this new  administration.   Just last week, we saw how much Americans truly value their public  land. After a prominent Republican introduced a bill to sell off more  than 3 million acres of taxpayer-owned land, thousands of people picked  up the phone and called their Representatives to express their outrage.  Because of that passion and deep concern, the sponsor of that bill has  vowed to withdraw it from consideration for the first time in five  Congresses.   This is an important story because it speaks to our constituents'  true priorities. They sent us here to be responsible stewards of their  special places. They sent us here to protect their national parks and  public lands. They sent us here to make government work for them.   This resolution fails on all those tests.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas), a member of the Natural Resources  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer), a member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Torres), also a member of the Natural Resources  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Torres), also a member of the Natural Resources  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. McEachin), who is a new member of the Natural Resources  Committee.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, the BLM's Planning 2.0 initiative has made  important, overdue updates to our process for drafting resource  management plans.   These plans govern our use of more than 175 million acres of public  lands. The way in which we use those lands deeply affects the  environmental quality, public health, and all Americans' quality of  life. It is vitally important that we get our planning right.   This rule promotes transparency and consensus, creating more and  earlier opportunities for public involvement in the planning process.  It encourages greater use of high-quality scientific information, and  it provides for a big-picture, landscape-level response to challenges  like wildfire management and invasive species. The effect is to  strengthen, streamline, and democratize a process that had previously  bred litigation and delay.   Mr. Speaker, I have to wonder: Which of these changes does my friend  across the aisle oppose?   Mr. Speaker, in the last week, the House voted to disapprove three  other rules that protect public health and environmental quality. I am  disturbed by that pattern, and I am disturbed by the haste with which  we have moved, especially since all of these rules took years to create  and craft.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the majority to think of their  children, their grandchildren, and all the generations to come. They  deserve to inherit a rich, healthy, and sustainable world. If we  continue down this reckless path, I fear they will not.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, using the Congressional Review Act to nullify a Federal  regulation is indeed a radical move. It has only been done once before  this year, but now it has become a regular part of the Republican  playbook.   BLM's Planning 2.0 is not some midnight regulation that was rushed  through at the last minute. BLM went through a transparent rulemaking  process and responded to thousands of comments. We had two hearings  last year about Planning 2.0 in the Natural Resources Committee. BLM  was only invited by the majority to one of the hearings, but the agency  listened and made significant changes before publishing their final  rule. This rule took 2.5 years to develop. It is not anywhere near a  midnight rule.    It has been over 30 years since BLM updated the regulatory framework  governing its planning process. That  [[Page H1036]]  means we are relying on Reagan-era rules that were put in place before  the widespread availability of cellphones and digital mapping  techniques to oversee everything from energy permitting to cultural  resource management on over 250 million acres.   Everyone engaged in the management of our public lands wants to see  this process improved. Planning 2.0 is that opportunity. However, if  this resolution becomes law, BLM will never be allowed to evaluate and  modernize this process, and we return to management planning from the  1980s. That is not a good outcome for anybody. The resolution is  irresponsible and needs to be rejected.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when you don't look at the whole field, you make  mistakes. Without using their vision, quarterbacks throw passes into  double coverage and Presidents trigger angry protests of their ill- conceived policies. Seeing the whole field is what BLM 2.0 is all  about.   Instead of managing lands by looking at isolated units and only  soliciting the input of local governments, this new framework takes a  landscape view of BLM's multiple use mission. This update is absolutely  necessary if we expect BLM to address the problems we all acknowledge  the agency has. Climate change, wildfire, drought, and invasive species  are just some of the problems that need landscape-level solutions. On  the flip side, coordinating planning for outdoor recreation and  renewable energy development across multiple BLM units will help  increase the growth of these industries.    Rejecting landscape-level planning is like rejecting air traffic  control; you can do it, but the results won't be pretty. By repealing  this rule and locking a broken system in place in perpetuity,  Republicans hope to fulfill their own prophecy that BLM does a poor job  managing public lands. If enough people believe them, they think, then  maybe they will achieve their goal of giving away America's public  lands. The problem, though, is that not enough people believe them.  Those who do are shrinking every day, and the ones who don't are making  their voices heard.   People who care about sound management of BLM lands know that the  Planning 2.0 rule is an important step forward. They know it isn't an  abuse of executive authority or a government land grab, and they are  tired of hearing from discredited voices who say it is. These views are  backward looking and ignore the fact that these lands belong to a kid  from Chicago just as much as they do to an oilman from Wyoming.   Landscape-scale planning allows BLM, with the input of all  stakeholders, to manage across the lands. Under Planning 2.0, BLM State  offices and the scientists and the land management professionals they  employ are finally allowed to build a consistent land management policy  that doesn't stop at the State line.   Planning 2.0 helps our land managers see the whole field and looks to  the future. The majority wants to send us back to the past. We  shouldn't allow that to happen.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Arizona has 13\1/2\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, using the CRA to repeal this rule would freeze Federal  land managers and the places they manage in 1983. That is the year the  previous rule was written, and that is the rule we would be stuck with  if this resolution passes.   Voting for this resolution means voting for outdated science; it  means voting for a return to managing individual parcels with blinders  on to the larger landscape; and it means continuing to ignore our  changing climate.   Overturning BLM 2.0 means you are okay with ignoring the overwhelming  scientific and public support for the planning updates implemented in  the rule.   Don't get me wrong, Mr. Speaker. There were plenty of great things  from the early 1980s: movies like ``Return of the Jedi'' and those  early cell phones that were the size of bricks. And don't forget the  fashions of the 1980s. I am sure people thought they looked great in  parachute pants, but eventually we all updated our wardrobes.   We might have had early cell phones back in the 1980s, but we didn't  have modern computing, current technologies for mapping, or even GPS.  There is no doubt that it is time to update our land use planning to  take advantage of these technologies and respond to new challenges and  to current times.   So why are congressional Republicans so interested in blasting us  back to the past? Why are they so eager to throw away 2\1/2\ years of  public input into a modern, transparent, science-driven planning  process?   They allege some local counties aren't happy, but we have got letters  from counties saying that they support the rule, and thousands of pages  of comments from the agency demonstrating that they responded to any  concerns. This can't be the real motivation, Mr. Speaker.   No, the true purpose of this resolution is to tie the hands of  Federal land managers so they can't manage special places in ways that  might hinder pollution or cut down on private profiteering. Apparently,  congressional Republicans have decided to give Representative Zinke a  parting gift as he leaves to be Secretary of the Interior. That gift is  a pair of handcuffs.   If you have updated your wardrobe or your cell phone since 1983, or  if you enjoy the luxury of Google Maps or GPS, I urge you to oppose  this resolution because it fails to update our ability to protect our  precious public lands.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the BLM 2.0 rule represents the turning back of a clock  of ignoring science, ignoring the need for public participation.   Although Republicans claim they want to take power away from  government and give it to the people, why do they oppose every attempt  to actually do that?   They don't want the people to use citizen suits to hold polluters  accountable. They don't want the people to use the NEPA process to  ensure government actions aren't harming their communities. Today, they  don't want the people to have increased participation in managing our  public lands.   The reason, of course, is that Republicans don't want all people to  have a seat at the table. They only want certain people to be there.   In this case, the old BLM planning process gave local governments in  the West--many of which are cozy with mining, drilling, and grazing  interests--a privileged position in influencing land management  planning. Given that these public lands belong to all Americans and not  just those who happen to live close to them, that approach was wrong.   BLM's Planning 2.0 rule changes that, leveling the playing field and  allowing more stakeholders and interested parties to get involved  earlier.   Under BLM's new rule, tribes, local governments, and stakeholders  across the spectrum who care about these places where they work,  recreate, hunt, fish, and live are all now encouraged to provide input  at the outset instead of waiting until the bitter end. This will save  time and money, reduce litigation, and generally make government work  better.   So why would Republicans oppose it?   Hunters, anglers, and others who value the outdoors are asking the  same question and are lining up in opposition to this misguided  resolution and other bills that would reduce their access to public  land.   The people have grown wise to the Republican crusade to give away  ownership of and authority over their lands to States, localities, and  private interests. They have grown very weary of that. They understand  that this resolution is part of that crusade.   So Republicans have a choice. They can continue doing favors for the  dirty development interests of the past or they can embrace policies  like BLM 2.0 and use it to give a boost to the ongoing jobs boom in  sectors like solar, wind, and outdoor recreation. For the sake of  Western economies and landscapes, I hope they choose the latter.   Planning 2.0 finally recognizes the value of the public's voice in  the planning process. Let's not silence them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters in opposition to this  resolution. These letters come from a broad array of stakeholders,  including sportsmen, county commissioners, county supervisors, and  conservationists, highlighting the breadth and depth of support for  Planning 2.0.                                                   February 6, 2017.        Dear Representative: As organizations committed to       preserving our nation's historic and cultural resources, we       urge you to OPPOSE the Congressional Review Act resolution       (H.J. Res. 44) to nullify the Bureau of Land Management's       final planning rule, commonly referred to as BLM Planning       2.0.        The Congressional Review Act is the wrong tool to address       resource management planning. While no regulation is perfect,       using the Congressional Review Act to overturn the Planning       2.0 rule would have far-reaching implications for cultural       resources and management of our public lands. This resolution       of disapproval would prohibit the BLM from developing any       ``substantially similar'' regulation in the future. The       result would be to replace the new regulation with BLM's       prior planning rule, which is more than 30 years old and does       not incorporate current technology and streamlining practices       to maximize efficient and effective decision-making. Locking       in inefficient and outdated regulations does not serve any       users of our public lands.        The BLM's Planning 2.0 rule is designed to bring much       needed efficiency, predictability, and transparency to BLM's       management of multiple uses on public lands. The rule is       carefully crafted to collect state and local government,       tribal, and public input early in the planning process. In       addition to making BLM's planning more efficient, improving       available information allows project developers to consider       potential impacts to environmental, cultural, and historic       resources at the outset rather than being surprised by       stakeholder concerns and information identified late in the       process. The rule also improves the planning process by       reducing the need for costly and time-consuming supplements       that can delay decision-making and inhibit private sector       investment.        The BLM's Planning 2.0 rule updates procedures for       developing individual resource management plans that guide       actions and decisions on the nearly 250 million surface acres       and more than 700 million acres of subsurface mineral       resources that the agency manages. These lands contain the       largest, most diverse, and scientifically most important body       of cultural resources of any federal land management agency,       including well over a million historic, archaeological, and       other cultural sites. Our organizations remain committed to       promoting a responsible land management planning process that       enhances public involvement, improves transparency, and       promotes sound, efficient decision-making based on full       information, including better data on cultural resources on       our public lands.        If the resolution passes, it will make management of our       public lands less efficient and less effective. Again, we       urge you to OPPOSE the Congressional Review Act resolution to       overturn the BLM Planning 2.0 rule.

Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters, we urge you to Vote NO on H.J. Res. 44, the       Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to rescind the       Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Planning 2.0 regulation.       This resolution is an extreme and unnecessary response to a       sensible and overdue rule.        H.R. Res. 44 would invalidate a new, collaborative,       science-based approach to land use planning that boosts       public engagement, improves administrative efficiency, and       increases responsiveness in planning on our largest public       land system. It allows managers to move beyond an outdated 30       year-old process to better address pressing challenges posed       by critical issues, such as wildfire, invasive species and       increased demand for domestic energy. More specifically, this       new guidance:        Increases efficiency and public participation in planning.       The BLM rule will save taxpayer dollars, shorten planning       times, and avoid disputes by investing time upfront to       collaborate with locals and stakeholders on prospective       management strategies. Public voices will help develop plans       with improved opportunities for participation, new electronic       options for submitting input, and updated processes for       filing plan protests--improving the likelihood that the plans       meet Americans' broad array of conservation and resource       needs.        Preserves priority status for local government in planning.       The new rule carefully preserves a priority role for local       government and other cooperators in BLM planning processes as       directed by Congress, ensuring that final plans consider       local and regional perspectives and priorities.        Increases transparency in planning. The rule will prevent       closed door decision making between the BLM and special       interests by updating guidance that provides the American       people the ability to participate in the planning process at       all stages.        Improves science-based decision making in planning. High       quality data will be a foundation for BLM planning and       management. Planning 2.0 will incorporate current science,       geospatial data and technology to evaluate landscapes at the       regional level. These changes will enable faster response to       today's environmental, economic and social realities with new       evaluation markers and agency flexibility to plan across       traditional administrative boundaries, keeping our lands       great places to hike, hunt, and fish.        Supports sporting pursuits on BLM lands. Hunters and       anglers support Planning 2.0 because the rule takes steps to       ensure that important habitats, such as migration corridors       and other intact habitats, are identified early in the       planning process so these important areas can be managed and       conserved as the agency makes decisions about other public       land uses.        Overturning this common sense rule will relegate hundreds       of millions of acres of public lands to planning under an       out-of-date rule that has not been substantially changed       since 1983. The public will lose opportunities to participate       in how these public lands--owned by all Americans--should be       managed. Without the new rule, public land management will       continue to be contentious, inefficient and costly.        Finally, if the rule is struck down by the CRA, the BLM       could be prohibited from issuing a similar rule in the       future, preventing the agency from modernizing its land use       planning regulation to adequately address contemporary issues       like energy development, grazing, wildlife, mining,       conservation, recreation, cultural resources protection or       any of the many multiple uses that occur on our public lands.        Planning 2.0 is a sensible and much needed rule that       updates an antiquated process that limited management       decisions to outdated concepts of resource planning, and       instead creates a framework to support more inclusive,       comprehensive planning and management on our public lands. We       urge you to stand up to protect the new planning rule and to       Vote NO on H.J. Res. 44.

Neil Kornze,      Director, Bureau of Land Management,      Washington, DC.      Subject: BLM's Proposed Resource Management Planning Rules           (``Planning 2.0'').         Dear Director Kornze: Humboldt County includes over 86,000       acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) parcels, including       such special places as the King Range National Conservation       Area and Headwaters Forest Reserve. The stewardship of these       lands is very important to my constituents, other local       residents, and countless visitors to this region. It is a       matter of great concern to many of us when the BLM begins to       develop individual management plans for these parcels.        The BLM's Proposed Resource Management Planning Rule       described at 81 Federal Register 8674 (February 25, 2016),       commonly known as Planning 2.0, requires the agency to       involve the public, other federal agencies, state and local       governments and tribes as key partners early in the process       of developing local plans. Encouraging public involvement       early and often in the development of these plans is a very       positive step indeed. This is especially important given that       the BLM's Arcata Field Office will be using this new and more       inclusive approach to public involvement as it revises its       existing 1995 Resource Management Plan, I am therefore       pleased to offer my support for Planning 2.0.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                     Ryan Sundberg,      5th District Supervisor.                                   ____                                               Lewis & Clark County,                                   Board of County Commissioners,                                                    Helena, Montana.      Re the Bureau of Land Management's Proposed Resource           Management Planning Rules, 81 Fed. Reg. 8674 (February           25, 2016).       Neil Kornze,      Director, Bureau of Land Management,      Washington, DC.        Dear Director Kornze: The Lewis and Clark County Board of       County Commissioners offer this letter of support for       provisions of the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM's)       Proposed Resource Management Planning Rules, 81 Fed. Reg.       8674 (Feb. 25, 2016) (the Proposed Rules). We appreciate the       effort to improve opportunities for public involvement       earlier in the planning processes, including the chance to       review preliminary resource management alternatives and       preliminary rationales for those alternatives.        We value our relationship with our federal partners, and       our constituents are impacted greatly by actions taken by       your agency. Increasing access to the planning process and       targeting your efforts towards greater public involvement       enhances the relationship between the people and their       government, and we support your initiative.        Additionally, we note that the Proposed Rules also expand       opportunities for states and local governments to have       meaningful involvement in the development of BLM's land use       decisions. The Proposed Rules continue to provide for       coordination with state and local representatives in order to       ensure, to the extent available under federal law, that RMPs       are consistent with state and local land use plans, as       provided in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of       1976.            Sincerely.      Michael Murray, Chairman.      Susan Goad Geise,        Vice Chair.      Andy Hunthausen, Member.                                   ____                                    Board of County Commissioners,                                         Missoula, MT, May 23, 2016.      Re Proposed Resource Management Planning Rules, 81 Fed. Reg.                                                               8674.       Director Neil Kornze,      Bureau of Land Management,      Washington, DC.        Dear Director Kornze: We are writing you to commend you and       the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for your efforts to       improve BLM's planning process (Planning 2.0) and better       address the diverse interests found in Missoula County and       other communities across the western United States.        Missoula County is approximately 2,600 square miles in       size, and federal management in the county accounts for 52       percent of the land ownership. The BLM manages roughly 23,000       acres for the public in Missoula County and the sustainable       management of these public lands is vitally important to the       residents we represent. Our citizens and local economies       depend on state and federal lands for water quality and       quantity, as well as for multiple sustainable uses ranging       from outdoor recreation to livestock grazing to mineral       exploration and development. Consequently, we wish to thank       the BLM for proposing to address their land management       options from a landscape perspective. This approach       recognizes that the management of federal lands has a direct       impact on other properties well beyond those close to or       adjacent to BLM managed land.        We support the provisions of the BLM's Proposed Resource       Management Planning Rules, 81 Fed. Reg. 8674 (Feb. 25, 2016).       These rules provide additional opportunities for public       involvement earlier in the planning process, including the       chance to review preliminary resource management alternatives       and preliminary rationales for those alternatives. This early       public involvement will help resolve conflicts and produce a       Resource Management Plan that better reflect the needs of our       citizens as well as others who use the public lands and have       a stake in their future. Equally important is the improved       openness and transparency the rules bring to the process,       allowing any local government to actively participate and       share information on issues critical to local residents and       their elected representatives.        The proposed rules continue to provide for coordination       with state and local representatives in order to ensure, to       the extent allowable under federal law, that Resource       Management Plans are consistent with state and local land use       plans, as provided in the Federal Land Policy and Management       Act of 1976.        Thank you for considering our comments. If you or your       staff have any questions, please feel free to contact us.            Sincerely,      Board of County Commissioners,      Nicole Rowley,        Chair.      Jean Curtiss,        Commissioner.      Stacy Rye,        Commissioner.                                   ____                                                             The Pew                                               Charitable Trusts,                                   Washington, DC, February 2, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: Next week the House of       Representatives will consider H.J. Res 44, a resolution to       overturn the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) 2016 land-use       planning rule. The Pew Charitable Trusts opposes this effort       to reduce agency transparency and limit the public's ability       to have a say in how their public lands are managed, and we       urge you to vote against it.        BLM's rule, often called ``Planning 2.0,'' establishes       procedures for preparing, revising, or amending land use       plans, and provides new opportunities for stakeholders to       participate in the early stages of developing plans. This       means that states and counties, scientists, ranchers, hunters       and anglers, miners, hikers, boaters, the energy industry and       other users of the public lands will have more information on       what a plan will cover and will be able to express their       hopes and concerns about the plan.        Increased public participation will ensure that the BLM has       the best available information at the start of the planning       process, before issuing draft management plans. The broad       consideration of issues at this earlier stage is expected to       reduce controversy later in the planning process, and reduce       litigation after the plan is issued.        Planning 2.0 also includes steps to ensure that important       fish and wildlife habitats, such as migration corridors and       intact habitats, are identified early in the planning process       so these important areas can be managed and conserved as the       agency makes decisions about development, recreation and       other public land uses.        The rule also includes good government provisions such as       improved potential for better interagency communication, and       steps that increase efficiency and ease burdens on public.        Many concerns that were raised about an earlier draft of       the rule were addressed and corrected in the final rule. For       example, the public comment period once a draft plan is       released is now 100 days--more than the previous 1983       regulations or the original 2015 proposal allowed. The final       rule also takes meaningful steps to accommodate requests from       local governments and the public to improve the process,       preserving the special role of state, local and tribal       cooperating agencies, as specifically required by the Federal       Lands Policy and Management Act.        Passage of H.J. Res 44 would force BLM to return to its       previous, long-outdated planning rule, which was published in       1983. Of additional concern is that the Congressional Review       Act prohibits the agency from writing a new rule that is       ``substantially the same'' without additional legislative       action. As a result, many good aspects of Planning 2.0 would       be precluded from being enacted indefinitely, thereby       stripping incoming Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke of       his authority to reformulate the rule.        We strongly urge Members to work with the new       administration to make refinements to a planning process that       many stakeholders championed. If H.J. Res 44 is enacted, the       BLM would be forced to continue using outdated guidelines for       land-use planning, which keep the public and development       interests alike in the dark until very late in the planning       process.        If you would like further information regarding Pew's       position on this resolution, please feel free to contact me.            Sincerely,                                                          Ken Rait,                                        Director U.S. Public Lands.  [[Page H1040]]                                          ____      Chairman Rob Bishop,      Natural Resources Committee, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Raul Grijalva,      Natural Resources Committee, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: The       undersigned hunting, fishing, conservation, natural resource       professional and outdoor-industry organizations represent       millions of American sportsmen and women, and we are writing       to express our support for the Bureau of Land Management's       (BLM) recently revised land-use planning rule, also known as       Planning 2.0. The revised planning rule increases federal       agency transparency and incorporates best practices in land-      use planning, while maintaining the important cooperating       agency role of state and local governments.        Stakeholders from across the multiple-use spectrum agreed       that the previous BLM planning process could be improved.       Under the outdated process, opportunities for public       involvement were too few, and the public didn't learn about       agency plans until they were already proposed.        With the new rule, the BLM provides three additional       opportunities for cooperating agency and public involvement.       These extra steps enable the BLM to gather public opinion and       the best available information at the start of the planning       process, then vet preliminary alternatives before issuing the       draft resource management plan.        Further, the revised planning rule will identify important       areas for fish, wildlife and outdoor recreation well in       advance of plan development so that avoidance and       minimization of impacts to these vital areas can be achieved       as the agency plans for a range of uses of the land through       individual plans. Given advancements in wildlife science and       data collection since the previous planning rule was created       more than 30 years ago, these updates were sorely needed, and       the sporting and wildlife communities support this revision.        Finally, local, state, and tribal governments, including       county commissioners, will retain their preexisting       cooperating agency status and an elevated level of       involvement in BLM land-use planning as specifically required       by the Federal Lands Policy and Management Act. In fact,       significant changes were made to the final planning rule in       response to requests from cooperating agencies.        The new rule is the product of two and a half years of       collaboration and is a productive step towards improving BLM       planning. If additional improvements are necessary, the       undersigned organizations are committed to working with the       new Secretary of Interior, interested lawmakers and       stakeholders to make such adjustments. However, Congressional       actions to delay or dismiss the new BLM planning rule are       unnecessary and counterproductive.

Dear Member of Congress: Tomorrow, the House of       Representatives will vote on H.J. Res 44, to overturn Bureau       of Land Management's (BLM) new land use planning rule,       ``Planning 2.0'', established in 2016. Wild Connections       opposes this resolution and we urge you to vote against an       effort that will reduce agency transparency, limit the amount       of input that the public has on their public lands, and lose       strong management designations for wildlife and ecological       biodiversity. Wild Connections is an organization that has       been promoting landscape connectivity on a watershed and       ecoregion-wide basis for over 20 years and which has been       actively involved in the management plan revision for the       BLM's Royal Gorge Field Office, which is currently under way.       As a locally based conservation organization, we believe that       it is important for citizens to have opportunities to work       with the BLM to decide future management for these millions       of acres of public land. Planning 2.0 is a step in the right       direction.        BLM's Planning 2.0 makes BLM land use management planning       more collaborative and transparent. It offers more and new       opportunities for stakeholders to get involved, including       local governments, Indian tribes, and the general public.       Planning 2.0 engages the public earlier in the land       management planning process leading to more input into the       process, enabling the BLM with the best available information       at the onset of the planning process. More and earlier public       involvement will not only broaden the scope of the plan, but       will likely reduce litigation after the plan is enacted.        This new planning rule is also important for fish and       wildlife habitat. Migration corridors and intact habitats are       identified early in the planning process so that these       important areas can be managed and conserved as the agency       makes decisions about development, recreation and other       public land uses. Hunters and anglers support Planning 2.0 as       the rule offers wildlife corridors as a management       designation, for a key type of wildlife habitat or an area of       ecological importance.        As you know, the BLM's ongoing Eastern Colorado Resource       Management Plan Revision has incorporated parts of the       Planning 2.0 planning rule. Wild Connections and our members       have benefited from the ``envisioning meetings'' in 6 towns       and cities within the planning area, offering the public       opportunities to voice their concerns and comments in       preparation for the full planning effort. The BLM has       received positive comments from a diverse voice of users,       including outfitters, horse-packers, grazing lessees,       environmental organizations, wildlife groups, hunters,       anglers, snowmobilers, off-highway vehicle users, and mining       claimants.        If H.J. Res 44 is passed, the BLM would return to its long-      outdated planning rule, which was established in 1983. Of       additional concern is that the Congressional Review Act       prohibits the agency from writing a new rule that is       ``substantially the same'' without additional legislative       action. Thus many important aspects of Planning 2.0 would be       precluded from being enacted indefinitely in the       reformulation of the rule.        We strongly urge Members to work with the new       administration to make refinements to this planning process       that many stakeholders have championed. Please vote against       H.J. Res 44 so--that we do not lose these important BLM       planning aspects that were just carefully constructed under       Planning 2.0.            Sincerely,                                                 James E. Lockhart,                                                         President.     Congressional Republicans have a scorched Earth policy  when it comes to anything originated under President Obama. It is the  same approach with the Affordable Care Act. They want to completely  destroy it, regardless of any merits.   The majority is not spending all this time and effort simply to  repeal this planning rule. This is one of the steps in their massive  campaign to convince Americans that Barack Obama wasn't a good  President. They simply can't stand to allow the accomplishments of the  previous administration to stand, so they reflexively strike out to  destroy anything President Obama supported.   This is not legislating. It is certainly not public service, and it  isn't even smart. To paraphrase a former Speaker of the House, Sam  Rayburn: anybody can kick down a barn; it takes a carpenter to build  one.   This isn't how our government is supposed to work. It is especially  counterproductive when it comes to something like Planning 2.0, which  is specifically designed to make a Federal agency more efficient and  more transparent.   The BLM rule is about bringing our land use plans into the 21st  century. It is about local input. It is about using the best available  science. The majority wants to return to 1983 so that polluters and  developers are the only ones with a seat at the table.   We should support BLM 2.0, reject this resolution, and I urge my  colleagues to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
