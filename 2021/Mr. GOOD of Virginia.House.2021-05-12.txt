 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the  incredible lifesaving care provided by pregnancy resource centers  across the country.   Thanks to the 2,700 pregnancy resource centers in the United States,  mothers looking for help, hope, and healing have a safe place they can  turn to.   In my own district, Virginia's Fifth Congressional District, we have  10 outstanding centers where lives are saved and mothers are given new  hope.   To recognize the exceptional work they do, I have introduced a  resolution designating the week of November 8 as  [[Page H2207]]  National Pregnancy Center Week, highlighting the vital role that  pregnancy resource centers play in helping mothers and families.   As a result of their work, young lives will be given the opportunity  to live, grow up, and work in our great Nation.   Despite there being over three times as many pregnancy resource  centers as abortion centers in the United States, sadly, most Americans  are more familiar with the anti-life groups like Planned Parenthood  because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stumble over each  other to throw taxpayer money in their direction.   Without pregnancy resource centers, millions more babies would be  murdered by the scourge of radical anti-life groups under the guise of  family planning.   To all those who selflessly serve in pregnancy resource centers, I  thank you for your lifesaving work.   Mr. Speaker, no more fundamental right than the right to life exists  in our country and in our world today, and there is no more fundamental  responsibility of government than the responsibility to defend the most  vulnerable among us, and that includes innocent, precious life in the  womb.   Everyone knows abortion is wrong. The clear science shows us that it  is the taking of innocent life in the womb. The only question is what  priority we will give that unborn, precious life in the womb.   Thankfully, our country has an admirable history of correcting civil  and social injustice. The glaring exception is the ultimate injustice  of abortion.   I pray that we will soon correct this injustice, and I believe that  history will rightly condemn those who stood on the wrong side on this  issue. I pray that we will correct the injustice of abortion, which has  tragically taken the lives of some 70 million unborn children.                            ____________________
