 Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the motion to  recommit. As a veteran and as an American, I urge all of you to put the  political games aside, put our troops and our country first, and pass  this defense bill.   For 58 years straight, this Congress has come together across party  lines to pass a bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act. This  critical piece of legislation ensures Congress has a say in the mission  of our military, the policies of our Department of Defense, and the  safety and security of our women and men in the field.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to serve on the House Armed Services  Committee, and I thank the chairman, the ranking member, all the  leaders, and all of my colleagues for their dedication to our military  and to our national security.   As a U.S. Navy veteran who served for almost 10 years, I am proud to  be part of the new class of veterans and national security  professionals who  [[Page H5763]]  have worked on this bill in committee. We know what it is like to rely  on Congress to execute our mission and to keep our country safe, so we  must pass the National Defense Authorization Act in this House. We must  make sure that the vitally important priorities included in this House  bill make it to the President's desk, and we must show the country that  our disagreements are nothing compared to our tradition of crossing  party lines and supporting the National Defense Authorization Act.   And don't take my word on the importance of this bill. Take it from a  Republican and a fellow Naval Academy graduate, who said:         How do we explain to Americans who are risking their lives       for us that we could not summon the courage to take some hard       votes?        How do we explain that we could not come together and work       together when it mattered most?        The fundamental purpose of this legislation, which has       united Members from both sides of the aisle, is to provide       our Armed Forces what they need to do the jobs we ask of       them.    Madam Speaker, John McCain knew this must be an area of bipartisan  support, and this MTR is an attempt to strip away that bipartisanship,  to inject the broken politics of Washington into a bill that should be  bigger than your political party.   The NDAA fully funds a 3.1 percent pay raise for U.S. military  personnel, exactly what the President asked for. Madam Speaker, this is  the largest pay increase since 2010, the last time the Democrats were  in power.   My colleagues had almost 10 years and, more recently, 21 hours of  markup and 28 hearings to discuss this very issue, but not one of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle brought this issue up in  committee. This last-second partisan motion undercuts the hard work of  the House Armed Services Committee, which passed the largest pay raise  for our troops in years.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
