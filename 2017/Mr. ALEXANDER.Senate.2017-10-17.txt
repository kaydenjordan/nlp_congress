 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 10 minutes, followed by the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, to  speak for up to 10 minutes    Mr. President, later this week, Senator Murray and I,  with other Senators, will introduce bipartisan legislation to give  States additional flexibility to create more choices of health  insurance policies in the individual market and to extend cost-sharing  reduction subsidies during 2018 and 2019. These subsidies pay for  copays and deductibles for millions of low-income Americans who buy  health insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Our goal is to  stabilize and then lower the cost of premiums and to enable all  Americans to have access to health insurance.   Our legislation will be based on the four hearings and other meetings  that the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee held  last month. I am chairman of that committee, and Senator Murray is the  ranking Democratic member. These hearings and meetings were bipartisan.  They were lengthy. They were remarkable in this sense: They engaged  nearly 60 Senators from both political parties in extensive  discussions. We not only had the four hearings, which involved the 23  members of our HELP Committee, but we invited any other Senator who  wished to come to a committee meeting ahead of time to meet the  Governors and the State insurance commissioners and others who were  testifying, and 37 did. So we have had extensive participation by 60  Members of the U.S. Senate through four hearings and a variety of  committee meetings in the process that developed this legislative  proposal that Senator Murray and I have agreed upon.   According to witnesses at our hearings, according to the  Congressional Budget Office and Congress's Joint Tax Committee, without  these cost-sharing payment reductions, premiums will rise, the Federal  debt will increase to pay for the higher subsidies by $194 billion over  10 years, and up to 16 million Americans may find themselves living in  counties where no company sells insurance in the individual market.   Imagine yourself as a 45-year-old songwriter in Tennessee who loses  her job, has three kids, goes to the individual market, and finds that  she can't buy health insurance; no company is offering it because we  did not act. Those are the consequences we are talking about.   Witnesses also testified that one way to lower costs for consumers is  to give States more flexibility than the Affordable Care Act now allows  to design health insurance plans that give consumers more choices.   We have purposefully limited our proposal to two themes: first, 2  years of temporary cost-sharing payments and, second, amendments that  would give States meaningful flexibility in using the section 1332  innovation waiver, which is already a part of the Affordable Care Act.   The problem with the waiver is that while it was designed to give  States the opportunity for innovation, it has been very restrictive. It  limited the number of opportunities States could use. It would be like  saying to someone: You can drive anywhere you want to in the United  States as long as you end up in New York or in Nashville or in  Birmingham, AL. Our goal is still to protect patients but to give  States more flexibility in offering more choices.   There are, of course, many other good and useful ideas that would  improve Federal laws regulating health insurance. There are many on the  Republican side, and there are many on the Democratic side. There are  probably even ideas that both of us would agree on, but Congress has  been stuck for 7 years in a partisan stalemate over the Affordable Care  Act. Most of that stalemate is about the individual insurance market.   Most people get their insurance from the government, Medicare, or  Medicaid. Most of the rest of the people get their insurance from their  employer on the job; that is 50 or 60 percent of Americans. Only 6  percent of Americans get their insurance in the so-called individual  market. It is about 350,000 people in Tennessee. Every single one of  them is very important, and every single one of them is terrified by  the skyrocketing premiums in that market and by the possibility that  they might not be able to buy insurance at all in that market if we  don't act.   We concluded that the best course would be to take this limited,  bipartisan first step, which would avoid the chaos that could occur  during 2018 and 2019 if premiums continue to skyrocket and millions of  Americans find themselves without a way to purchase health insurance.  Once we complete this limited first step, then we can take the second  and the third steps.   I want to undersell this proposal rather than oversell it. It has  significant advantages in terms of cost-sharing reductions, which make  it more likely that premiums will stabilize in 2018 and actually go  down in 2019. It has significant advantages in changing the law so that  States will have more flexibility in offering choices, which is another  way to lower costs, but it is only a limited first step.   Senator Murray and I hope that by the end of the week we can present  Senate leadership--Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer--with the  support of a significant number of Republican and Democratic Senators.  We then hope the Senate will pass the legislation, the House will agree  to it, and the President will sign it.   During the last several days, I have had encouraging discussions with  President Trump, who called me on two different occasions, encouraging  me to work with Senator Murray to come to a bipartisan agreement. I am  grateful to him for that encouragement, and I am grateful to her for  her patience and for working on this so diligently for such a long  period of time. I see she has just come to the floor.   I think one other thing Senator Murray and I can agree on is that we  hope our next legislative assignment is easier than this one. I think  we both also agree that the sooner we act, the better, so Americans  will have the benefit of lower premium costs and the peace of mind of  knowing that they will be able to buy insurance for themselves and  their families.   I would like to say through the Chair to Senator Murray that I asked  for 10 minutes to speak, and then I asked for 10 minutes for her to  follow me. I am about finished, and when I am through, then she has the  floor, according to my request.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a brief summary  of the agreement that Senator Murray and I have.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     lower premiums, more state flexibility, zero score, avoid chaos in                                 2018, 2019              Make Section 1332 State Innovation Waivers Work         Amend law to provide meaningful flexibility for health plan       designs        --Example: Iowa waiver        --Example: higher co-pay opioids, lower co-pay statins        --Example: Medicaid savings for Sec. 1332 costs (NH)        --Repeal 2015 Regulation and Guidance        ``Alaska for All'' (Maine, Minnesota)  [[Page S6433]]         --State-based program to cover very sick        --20% premium decrease for everyone        --NO new federal spending; savings help pay for the fund        Streamline approval process        --Governors apply for waiver        --Federal waiver approval time in half        --Fast-track approval for emergency situations        --Fast-track approval for ``me too'' waivers        --Waivers can last longer (6 years)        --Harder for future administrations to cancel waiver        --Model waivers help states get approved faster              New Copper Plan: Catastrophic Insurance All Ages         Interstate Health Insurance Compacts: Texas Public Policy     Redirect Existing User Fee Funding to States for Consumer Outreach     2 Years Funding Cost Sharing Reduction Subsidies (Zero score), No                   Double Dipping by Insurance Companies                Chaos Without Cost Sharing (CBO, JCT, CMS):         --20% average premium increases in 2018        --$194 billion new federal debt over ten years        --50% counties with one insurer today--would get worse        --Up to 16 million Americans with zero insurance options on       exchanges        --Four-lane highway to single payer solution     Mr. President, I have said repeatedly over the last  several weeks that while it is important that the two of us, as the  chairman and the ranking member of the HELP Committee, come to an  agreement, that is not nearly enough because our real job was and is to  see if we can find, among a significant number of Republicans and a  significant number of Democratic Senators, a consensus that will cause  this to be enacted, will cause the Senate to pass it and the House to  pass it and the President to sign it. In my opinion, we wouldn't have  come to an agreement ourselves unless we thought that was likely.   I will not go into the specific provisions that are in this, except  to briefly summarize them. The first group of them makes the section  1332 innovation waivers work by giving more flexibility. In New  Hampshire, for example, the State would like to use Medicaid savings to  help pay for the cost of its Affordable Care Act waiver, and this would  allow that. In Maine, for example, the State has applied for a waiver.  The waiver has been approved, but the use of the funding has not been  approved. This would allow that. Alaska, Oklahoma, Iowa, for example,  all have waivers in line that they would like to submit to give a  greater variety of choices in their States and hopefully lower premium  costs, but it is too restrictive under the current conditions.   About the only sort of waiver that the current Director of the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can approve is the Alaska- type waiver, which is a good idea. Alaska created a reinsurance fund,  which helped the very sick Alaskans, immediately lowered premiums 20  percent for all other Alaskans, and then used the savings from the  lower subsidies as a result of the lower premiums to pay for 85 percent  of the cost of the fund. Minnesota has tried a similar thing. Maine did  that on its own a few years ago. We have streamlined the approval  process for those waivers, so that can be done more easily.   I would emphasize that a number of these, while they are limited  proposals, could not be done in a budget reconciliation process. They  had have to be done with 60 votes.   The proposal also includes what we call a new copper plan,  catastrophic insurance for all ages. We still keep the patient  protections; that is, preexisting conditions, et cetera. We still keep  the essential health benefits, but we allow someone who is healthy and  young, for example, to pay a higher deductible and a lower premium if  that is what they choose to do. We direct the Department of Health and  Human Services to go ahead and write regulations to encourage  interstate health insurance compacts. We compromised on the outreach  funding and agreed that we will spend about twice as much as or more  than President Trump wanted to expend, but we will do most of that by  grants to the States. And of course we agree on 2 years of funding for  the cost payments.    Finally, I would say that if we do not do this, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Tax Committee, and CMS, premiums  next year will increase 20 percent, there will be a $194 billion  increase in the Federal debt over 10 years, and up to 16 million  Americans might find themselves unable to buy insurance through the  individual market. In my view, this agreement avoids chaos, and I don't  know a Democrat or a Republican who benefits from chaos.   I thank President Trump for his encouragement to me and to Senator  Murray to try to succeed on this. I thank Senator Schumer, the  Democratic leader, for creating an environment in which we could get to  this point. I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell--despite his  focus on tax reform--for allowing us to work together and try to do  this. I especially thank Senator Murray, who, whenever she sets about  to get a result, I have found, she usually gets one. I could not have a  better partner to work with on difficult issues in the Senate. In fact,  the one thing we probably most agree on, we found the most difficult to  solve; that is, in 2018, we want to make sure that the cost-sharing  payments go to the benefit of consumers, not the insurance companies. I  want that. Senator Murray wants that. The President wants that. My  Republican colleagues want that. And I know Democrats want it. We  believe we have strong language in our proposed agreement to do that,  but we are going to make sure that it is the strongest possible  language.   I thank the Presiding Officer. I look forward to working with Senator  Murray over the next few days to see if we can find a consensus among  Republicans and Democrats to present to the Senate leadership. I hope  that we can then pass it, the House will pass it, and the President  will sign it.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
