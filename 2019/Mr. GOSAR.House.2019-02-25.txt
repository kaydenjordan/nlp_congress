 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Washington, for organizing this important Special Order on the Green  New Deal.   Mr. Speaker, America's energy renaissance is the backbone of our  economy. It is a story of freedom, prosperity, and opportunity.   After decades of reliance on other countries to meet our energy  needs, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that America  will export more energy than it imports starting in 2020. We are no  longer dependent on volatile foreign sources produced in Russia or  Saudi Arabia.   Recent innovation and technology improvements associated with  fracking and horizontal drilling have allowed shale resources,  previously deemed uneconomical, to be developed, and are the main  reason the U.S. was the world leader in carbon emissions reductions in  2015, 2016, and 2017.   That is right. Fracking, demonized by environmental extremists  without justification, has proven to be the best energy solution for  our environment.   Abundant oil and natural gas has reduced electricity bills, kept gas  prices low, and provided the largest share of U.S. electric power  generation in recent years.   The oil and gas industry supports more than 10.3 million jobs and  nearly 8 percent of our economy.   The United States is the world's top energy producer, and the  American Dream is thriving.   January 2019 saw the hundredth consecutive month of positive jobs  growth in America, the longest period of continuous jobs growth on  record.   The U.S. job market is strong, and in December, employers posted 7.3  million open jobs, a new record.   Now, despite America's energy renaissance and the aforementioned  emissions reductions, we continue to hear hyperbolic statements about  pending climate catastrophe and the need for radical change to stave  off future disaster.   The Democrat socialists pushing the Green New Deal want to get rid of  all energy sources except wind, solar, and batteries by 2030. How are  we going to do that when wind and solar only produced 7.6 percent of  our electricity in 2017?   The Green New Deal would drive energy production and jobs to  countries like China and India that have much worse environmental  standards. Global greenhouse gas emissions will increase as a result,  in direct contradiction to the main talking point of the Green New  Deal.   The socialist Green New Deal says it will provide higher education,  higher quality healthcare, and affordable, safe, and adequate housing  to all.                                time  2015    The Mercatus Center estimates that the cost of the single-payer  healthcare provision alone would cost $32 trillion in the first 10  years, something that I think is probably on the low side.   The Green New Deal is an alarmist pipe dream that seeks to  fundamentally transform America without a blueprint. This socialist  manifesto changes by the day, and important details on how a transition  of the Green New Deal's magnitude will occur are missing, including how  we will pay for this pie in the sky aspiration.   If one needs to have more evidence that the Green New Deal is not  plausible, look no further than the country of Australia where  electricity prices are the highest in the world and the Aussies'  obsession with renewables has destroyed their electric grid. Mass  blackouts and mass power cuts are the new norm, and a massive Tesla  battery backup system ran dry this past month as the Aussie power grid  crashed in summer temperatures. Ninety thousand Aussie homes had no  air-conditioning for the next 2 weeks of blistering heat.   Let's learn from Australia's mistakes. Let's not repeat them.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to enlightening everyone on this  legislation further in the coming days.
