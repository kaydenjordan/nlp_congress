 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues to  support H.R. 1.   It is no coincidence that the largest freshman class since Watergate  will also be the one to pass H.R. 1 this week. We are a class that is  born of voters' frustrations with a broken system.   Americans have seen this Chamber pass bills that hurt the middle  class, raise prescription drug prices, gut consumer protections, and  fail to act on climate change. Why? Because the special interests have  more power than the American people. It is the exact opposite of what  should happen in the people's House.   In the Army, I was taught the values of servant leadership. As a  captain, that meant leading by example. I jumped out of the plane  first, and only then would my soldiers follow.   As a Member of Congress, it means we hold ourselves to the highest  standards of ethics, accountability, and transparency. Servant leaders  don't hold a tight grip on power; they empower those around them. The  first step to doing that is to pass H.R. 1 and return power to the  people who sent us here.   Let's show America that we are their Representatives, and that we are  elected to serve them, not the mega-donors and not the special  interests.                            ____________________
