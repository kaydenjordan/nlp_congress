 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the pending business  on the floor.   The Presiding Officer and I both arrived in the Senate at the same  time 10 years ago. When you and I had barely been here a few days, the  country was shocked with a tragic shooting, the Sandy Hook shooting in  Newtown, CT, when a deranged monster came in and murdered little  children--elementary school children. Everyone across the country was  horrified; and over the past decade, we have seen that pattern repeat  itself over and over again.   Tragically, my home State of Texas has seen more than our fair share  of horrific crime, of mass murder, most recently in Uvalde. I was there  in Uvalde the day after the shooting where a deranged monster murdered  19 little children and 2 teachers.   Before that, I was in Santa Fe where yet another deranged monster  murdered schoolchildren.   I was in Sutherland Springs, the worst church shooting in U.S.  history. I stood in that sanctuary the day after the shooting, a  beautiful, small country church. The pews had been flung aside in the  chaos. There was shattered glass. There was a cell phone with a  shattered screen covered in blood.   And I saw the pool of blood where an 18-month-old child was  systematically murdered by that psychopath. I was in El Paso; I was in  Midland-Odessa; I was in Dallas. Over and over again, we have seen the  face of evil. We have seen horrific crimes. And let me be the first to  say there are too damn many of these. And we need to stop them.   Unfortunately, I have also seen what inevitably follows these  horrific crimes, which is a political debate that breaks out within  seconds of the crime occurring.   There are two principal approaches one can take to try to prevent  crimes like this. One is to target the bad guys, to focus on criminals,  to focus on felons, to focus on fugitives, to focus on those trying to  illegally buy guns, to put them in jail, to lock them up, to get them  off the street so that they cannot terrorize and murder innocent  people. That is the approach that actually works. That is the approach  that is actually successful. That is the approach that is most likely  to prevent subsequent mass murders.   There is a second approach, which is an approach that is disarming  law-abiding citizens. Inevitably, Democratic members of this Chamber,  minutes after an attack, move towards wanting to disarm law-abiding  citizens. That approach is, I believe, No. 1, unconstitutional; but,  No. 2, it doesn't work. It is ineffective.   Put simply, taking guns away from law-abiding citizens--disarming you  or disarming me--is not going to stop a mass murder. And we know this.  If you look across the country consistently, the jurisdictions with the  strictest gun control laws over and over again have among the highest  crime rates and among the highest murder rates.   When you disarm law-abiding citizens, what happens is the people who  follow the law disarm. That is almost by definition if they are law- abiding citizens. But the criminals don't follow the laws.   And if you disarm all the victims, the result is it is easier for the  criminals to commit their acts of mayhem.   Let me point out a statistic that many Americans don't know. It is a  statistic that comes from the Barack Obama White House, so it is hardly  a rightwing source. According to the Barack Obama White House, every  year in America, firearms are used defensively to stop a crime between  500,000 and 1 million times each and every year.   What does that mean? That means that if Democratic proposals to  disarm law-abiding citizens succeed, the result will be even more  crimes. The result will be those 500,000 to a million crimes that are  right now stopped every year won't be stopped.   That means more assaults. That means more sexual assaults. That means  more murders. That means single moms riding home on the train, if they  are not able to have a revolver in their purse to defend themselves  from marauding criminals, then they are left defenseless.    In debates over how to approach violent crime, that 500,000 to a  million people each year who are using a firearm to stop a crime, they  get left out of a lot of these discussions. But they would be victims  if Democratic Senators succeed in taking away their right to keep and  bear arms.   When the Presiding Officer and I were brand new here in the wake of  Newtown, CT, there was a Democrat majority in this body at the time.  Harry Reid was the majority leader. Barack Obama had just been  reelected President. And you will recall well Senate Democrats were  exultant. Senator Schumer was on TV saying we were in the sweet spot to  finally pass far-reaching gun control.   And I will tell you the colleagues on my side of the aisle were  discouraged and demoralized, and many thought there was nothing we  could do to stop the agenda that was being pushed forward.   Well, I can tell you, I didn't believe it then, and I don't believe  it now. And so I sat down and drafted legislation designed to actually  do what every person in this Chamber, I believe, really wants to do,  which is stop violent crime, stop these murders, stop the next lunatic  who would shoot up a school or shoot up a church or shoot up a mall or  shoot up a grocery store.   The legislation I drafted was called Grassley-Cruz. I teamed up with  my colleague, the senior Senator from Iowa, Chuck Grassley. Grassley- Cruz focused on several things. First of all,  [[Page S3133]]  it focused on strengthening the background check system. It required  the Department of Justice to conduct an audit of every Federal agency  to make sure that any felony convictions are reported to the background  check system.   It provided funding and incentives for States to report felony  convictions to the background check system. Interestingly, many States  have a lousy record of reporting felonies to the background check  database. Ironically, many of those are blue States led by Democrats  who talk about gun control, and yet the State governments and local  governments often fail to report felony convictions to the database.   Grassley-Cruz provided strong incentives to get those felony  convictions in the database. Secondly, Grassley-Cruz provided funding  for prosecutors to prosecute those who commit violent crimes with  firearms and put them in jail.   Third, Grassley-Cruz provided funding for the Department of Justice  to create a gun crime task force to prosecute felons and fugitives who  try to illegally buy guns.   Many people don't know this, but it is actually quite shocking. The  Department of Justice has a consistent pattern of refusing to prosecute  felons and fugitives who illegally try to buy guns.   In the year 2010, roughly 48,000 felons and fugitives tried to  illegally purchase firearms. Of those 48,000, the Obama Justice  Department prosecuted 44 of them--not even 50--44 out of 48,000. I  think that is completely unacceptable.   So Grassley-Cruz provided funding and directed the Department of  Justice: Prosecute them and put them in jail. And on top of that,  Grassley-Cruz created grants for schools to enhance school safety, to  enhance security, to make our schools and make our kids safer.   So what happened? Well, Grassley-Cruz, we voted on it here on the  floor of the Senate. And Grassley-Cruz received a majority vote on the  Senate floor, 52 Senators voted in favor of Grassley-Cruz, including  nine Democrats. Remember, this was a Democrat Senate. Democrats had a  sizable majority, and yet nine Democrats--we got the most bipartisan  support of any of the comprehensive legislation that was considered on  the floor.   So why didn't Grassley-Cruz pass into law? We got a majority vote in  the Senate. Well, the answer is simple: Grassley-Cruz didn't pass  because Senate Democrats filibustered it. They demanded 60 votes; and  so even though it got a majority, it didn't get 60, and it didn't pass.   I am going to share something that is deeply frustrating.   There is a powerful argument that had Grassley-Cruz passed, had  Senate Democrats not filibustered it, that multiple of these mass  shootings in Texas could have been prevented.   Let's start with Sutherland Springs. Sutherland Springs should never  have happened. The shooter was doubly ineligible to buy a firearm. He  had a felony conviction. He had a domestic conviction. So under Federal  law, existing Federal law, it was illegal for him to buy a gun.   So how did he get his gun?   Well, the Air Force, in the Obama administration, failed to report  his felony conviction to the background check database. It wasn't in  there.   So the shooter went to buy a gun. He filled out the background check  form, and he lied. He lied on the form. The form asked: Do you have a  felony conviction? He said: No.   The form asked: Do you have a domestic violence conviction? He said:  No.   They ran the check, and it came up clean because the Obama Air Force  never reported the felony and so it wasn't in the database and so it  came up clean.   He bought that gun, and he used it to murder those innocent people in  that beautiful sanctuary.   If Grassley-Cruz had passed, presumably, the mandated Department of  Justice audit of every Federal Agency would have caught that felony  conviction. The whole purpose of the audit was to make sure we catch  every felony conviction that is out there, which would have meant his  conviction would have been in the database, but that is where the  second part of Grassley-Cruz matters because when he went in and lied  on that form, he committed two more felonies. When he checked ``I don't  have a felony conviction,'' that is the felony. Lying on that form is a  felony. It is a crime.   When he checked ``I don't have a domestic violence conviction,'' that  is the felony. And Grassley-Cruz would have directed the Department of  Justice: Prosecute him, and put him in jail. And that monster would  have been locked in a 6-by-8 concrete cell instead of murdering  innocent people in the wonderful community of Sutherland Springs.   You also look at Santa Fe and Uvalde, and there is a possibility that  both of those crimes could have been prevented by Grassley-Cruz.   Part of Grassley-Cruz was funding to enhance school security--grants  to go to schools. One of the things that is frustrating about these  school shootings is they follow predictable patterns.   In Parkland, FL, the shooter jumped over a fence and came inside. In  Santa Fe, the shooter went in an unlocked side entrance.   Afterward--you know, the Santa Fe High School is less than an hour  from my house. I was at home that morning, the morning of the shooting.  I was on that campus about an hour after the shooting occurred. It was  horrific. It was tragic. I grieved and cried with the parents who lost  their children that day.   I remember sitting down afterward at a roundtable with the parents  from Santa Fe and parents from other mass shootings that occurred and  talking about what are the solutions we can do. How can we prevent  this?   One of the solutions we discussed was best practices. How do you make  a school safer? One of those best practices is limiting the number of  entrances to a school--ideally, bringing it down to one single main  entrance, the front entrance.   Now, that doesn't mean, as some on the Twittersphere have said, that  you have no fire exits. Of course, you have fire exits. It means you do  what we do in many other places--in Federal buildings, in banks, in  courthouses. It is a standard security step to have one major entrance  to a building if that building is at risk of violence, and that one  main entrance is then much, much safer if you have armed police  officers at that entrance.   When you go into a bank, there is a reason you see an armed officer  at the entrance. When you go into a courthouse, there is a reason you  see an armed officer at the entrance. When you go into the U.S.  Capitol, there is a reason you see an armed officer at the entrance.  Our kids are at least as valuable.    If the Santa Fe High School or the Robb Elementary School had been  able to get a school funding grant to enhance security, those crimes  could have been prevented because, I will tell you, when I was in  Uvalde the day after the shooting, what was so infuriating is that  monster got in the exact same way--through an open back door. Just like  in Santa Fe, he got in through an open back door; he got into the  classroom; and he began murdering children long before he encountered  anyone from law enforcement.   If, instead, that door had been locked, if he had been forced to come  around to the front main entrance, if at the front main entrance there  were armed police officers, they could have shot that monster dead  outside, and 19 children and 2 teachers would still be alive.   So, like millions across this country, I am angry. I am angry that  these horrific crimes keep happening.   But I am also angry that this august Chamber plays political games.  The bill that is before this body is being heralded in the press as a  bipartisan bill because it has got every Democrat and some Republicans.   I think the chances that this bill will do anything meaningful to  actually prevent the next mass murder are very low. That is not what  this bill is designed to do.   This bill is designed, among other things, to satiate the urge to do  something. After every one of these, the call comes out: Do something.  I agree. Do something. But do something that works. Do something that  will stop these crimes. This bill ain't that.   But it does have provisions that are troubling. It does have  provisions that  [[Page S3134]]  satisfy the Democratic political priority to go after the Second  Amendment right to keep and bear arms of law-abiding citizens.   Most troubling in this bill is the funding of so-called red flag  laws. Now, these so-called red flag laws have been implemented in  multiple States, and they enable the State to take away the right to  keep and bear arms from law-abiding citizens.   They render you vulnerable; that if you have a disgruntled coworker,  if you have an angry ex-boyfriend, an angry ex-girlfriend, they can go  and give the State the power to strip you of the right to keep and bear  arms--not if you are a criminal, not if you have committed crimes, not  if you have been adjudicated to be a danger to yourself or others. All  of those are existing law. Red flag laws lower the threshold and make  it easier to take away your right to defend yourself.   And in too many of these States, these provisions have little to no  protections of due process.   If the Senate passes this bill, Federal dollars will be used to  encourage more States to enact laws like this. That means Federal tax  dollars will be used to implement programs that will strip away  Americans' constitutional rights.   And mark my words, people will lose their lives over this; that we  will see red flag laws that are abused and citizens who are disarmed-- and, tragically, we are going to see a citizen who is disarmed who is  subsequently murdered.   Look, the right to keep and bear arms--it is not about hunting. It is  not about skeet shooting. Those can be a lot of fun to do, but that is  not why it is in the Constitution. The Bill of Rights does not have an  amendment devoted to recreational shooting.   The reason the Second Amendment is in the Bill of Rights is because  you and I and every American have a God-given right to defend our life.  There is no right more fundamental than the right to defend your own  life and the right to defend your family. If a criminal comes into your  house at night seeking to do harm to your children, you and I have a  right, I believe that derives from God Almighty, to defend our kids,  and whether any individual Member of this Chamber agrees with that  right or not doesn't really matter because it is right there in the  Bill of Rights. So the Constitution protects it whether you agree with  it or not.    And the reason I say these red flag laws, we are going to see people  lose their lives over it, is because often when people go and buy a  firearm, it is because they are afraid. It is because maybe they have  got an angry ex-boyfriend, an angry ex-girlfriend. Maybe they have got  a neighbor whom they are scared of. Maybe they have got someone  threatening them. And we are going to see these laws abused to disarm  someone who is subsequently made the victim of a violent crime.   And none of the politicians in this Chamber who vote for this bill  will take any responsibility for the people's lives that will be lost  because of it.   You might say: Well, look, that is all fine and good, but if you  don't like this bill, what should we do?   Well, it so happens I have an answer to that. This week, I filed  legislation, along with Senator John Barrasso from Wyoming. The Cruz- Barrasso legislation builds on what already received a majority vote in  this Chamber, the Grassley-Cruz legislation of a decade ago.   Let me tell you what Cruz-Barrasso does. It focuses on actually  stopping this problem. So Cruz-Barrasso funds the Department of Justice  to prosecute violent criminals who use firearms.   Mr. President, you are from the Commonwealth of Virginia, a wonderful  State. As you know well, some of the most important work stopping  violent crime and gun crime was pioneered in the Commonwealth of  Virginia. During the Bill Clinton Presidency, an initiative was started  called Project Exile in the Western District of Virginia. The U.S.  attorney there laid out a policy that if anyone commits a crime with a  firearm who is illegally possessing that firearm, meaning likely they  are a felon in possession, that the Feds were going to prosecute them,  put them in jail, and they are going to face mandatory minimum crimes.   And the U.S. attorney passed out to local prosecutors laminated cards  saying: Here are all the Federal prohibitions on gun possession. They  put up ads. They put up billboards in Richmond, VA. Richmond tragically  had an incredibly high murder rate. They put up billboards: Carry a  gun, do hard time.   And Project Exile worked phenomenally. The murder rate in Richmond,  VA, plummeted, and we began hearing stories of criminals--criminals who  would come to knock off a liquor store, criminals who would come to do  a home burglary, who would leave their gun at home. They would say: Do  you know what? Look, if I break into this house and I have got a gun  with me, I am doing hard time in Federal prison. I think I will just go  there without a gun. It worked.   What does Cruz-Barrasso do? It takes Project Exile national. It  provides funding for U.S. attorneys to prosecute. If you commit a crime  and you have got a gun, you are off the streets.   You want to stop these crimes? That is the step that will stop these  crimes.   What else does Cruz-Barrasso do? It creates a gun crime task force at  the Department of Justice to prosecute the felons and fugitives year  after year after year who try to illegally buy a gun and whom DOJ won't  prosecute right now.   If Cruz-Barrasso passes, the next Sutherland Springs can be stopped.   You know, there are some Democrat officials who say: We don't have  time to prosecute people who try to illegally buy guns. I repeatedly  heard testimony from Democratic witnesses on the Judiciary Committee  saying that.   Let me tell you something right now. If a murderer or a felon is  trying to illegally buy a gun, I don't think that is a paperwork  offense; I think they should be prosecuted and put in jail.   What else does Cruz-Barrasso do? It provides major funding to make  our schools safer. It provides much more funding than the Democrats'  bill. All told, there is $36 billion in this bill.   It provides funding to double the number of police officers in  schools across America--to double them. If you want to keep kids safe,  the single best step you can do is have police officers on campus so  that our children have the same protection that Members of Congress do;  so that our children have the same protection that courthouses do; so  that our children have the same protection that banks do.   Cruz-Barrasso will double the number of police officers in schools  across America--not only that, let's talk mental health. We all know  there is a problem. These deranged shooters over and over again follow  similar patterns of being isolated, angry loners with a long pattern of  struggling with mental health, often making multiple threats before  they carry out a horrific crime.   Cruz-Barrasso provides $10 billion in funding for mental health  counselors in schools across the country to help identify troubled  youth and to stop them before they commit a crime like this.   (Mr. OSSOFF assumed the Chair.)   Now, earlier today, there had been discussion that Majority Leader  Schumer would schedule a vote on Cruz-Barrasso. Right now, it appears  that may not happen. We are going to vote one way or another, and if I  have to exercise the procedural avenues available to me as a Senator to  force that vote, I am more than happy to do so. But let me tell you  actually why we are not seeing the vote so far--because my amendment is  drafted as a substitute. In other words, it would replace the pending  bill on the floor, and an awful lot of Senators don't want to have to  vote on that.   Now, I challenge any Senator in this Chamber to try to make the case  that this Democrat bill on the floor would be even half as effective in  stopping violent crime, in stopping mass shootings, in stopping  criminals from murdering children in schools, as my legislation would  be. The Democrat bill has a fraction of the funding for police  officers. It has a fraction of the funding for mental health. The  Democrat bill doesn't provide that violent felons who use guns should  be prosecuted. The Democrat bill doesn't provide that people who  illegally try to buy firearms, who are felons and fugitives, should be  prosecuted. The Democrat bill is not focused on criminals. It is not  focused on bad guys. It is focused on the Democrat priority of  disarming law-abiding citizens. That is a political priority that too  many Senate Democrats value more than keeping kids safe.   So if we don't see a straight-up vote on my amendment, it is because  too  [[Page S3135]]  many Senators in this Chamber don't want to vote on a head-to-head  choice between actually keeping kids safe versus achieving the  political agenda of the left of disarming law-abiding citizens. That is  wrong. It is cynical.   I have to say that in these debates--listen, this is a topic that is  emotional. It is a topic that is personal. It is a topic where  inevitably the rhetoric gets overheated. It gets overheated on both  sides.   Some years ago, I found myself, curiously enough, in a Twitter debate  with Alyssa Milano, the actress from Hollywood, the leftwing activist,  over the question of guns. We began going back and forth over gun  control and the Second Amendment, and at some point, she said something  to the effect of, you wouldn't dare sit down and have this conversation  with me in person. I said: Of course I would. I invited her to come to  my office, and she did. She came to my office, and what proceeded is we  had a 90-minute discussion and debate about violent crime, about gun  control, and about the Second Amendment. We live-streamed it, so anyone  who wants to see it can go and watch a 90-minute discussion. I will  say, I commend Ms. Milano. I think the two of us managed to have a much  more civil conversation on this than most of the interlocutors on this  topic.   One of the things I said to her at the start of that discussion was,  I said: Listen, if we start from the premise--if we sit in this room  and look at each other and we both assume the other is evil, the other  is lying, the other seeks to do harm, we are not going to have a very  productive conversation. If each of us thinks of the other ``You want  children to die; you want people to be murdered,'' you know what, that  is not going to lead to a very productive conversation.   I suggested to her--I said: Why don't we start from the proposition  that you and I both would like to see innocent people protected and  safe; that you and I both, like anyone sane and rational, are utterly  horrified at the depraved monsters who murder innocent people and  especially those who murder children?   There is a special circle of Hell for the people who hurt kids.   If we start from the premise that even though we are of different  political parties and even though we may believe different things  politically, we both want to see human life preserved, then maybe we  can have a productive discussion about what steps can be taken to be  most effective in saving human life.   We agreed that we both want to prevent future murders, that we both  want to protect our kids and your kids and kids across America. Then we  can have a real discussion that is factual, that is empirical, that is  based on evidence, that is based on data, as to what policies are  actually effective in stopping violent crime.   There was a time when this august Chamber had discussions like that,  had debates.   I would note, this particular bill--there have been no committee  hearings on it. There has been no meaningful debate. This is an  exercise of partisan power and political objectives.   So we are not engaged in a meaningful discussion of what policies are  actually effective in stopping crime, preventing mass murder, and  protecting children. If we were, I would challenge any Democrat in the  Chamber to stand up and explain how on Earth this Democrat bill could  be even half as effective in preventing school shootings as the Cruz- Barrasso bill. By any measure, the legislation that I am fighting for  is stronger, it will put more violent gun criminals in jail, and it  will double the number of police officers in schools across America. It  will make our children safer.   If we were willing to have a discussion about substance, about the  merits, that should be a pretty easy discussion, but, sadly, too many  in this body immediately play politics and also give in to the  overheated rhetoric on this issue.   Those who advocate gun control inevitably say: If you support the  Second Amendment, blood is on your hands.   Well, let me tell you something: If you oppose the Second Amendment  and you disarm people who become victims of violent crime, blood is on  your hands.   Rather than either of us saying language like that, it seems to me we  should come together and say: How do we stop the bad guys? What works?  What is effective? What can we do together to make sure to maximize the  chances that we prevent another Uvalde, another Santa Fe, another  Sutherland Springs, another El Paso, another Midland-Odessa, another  Dallas?   The stakes are too serious for political games.   The Presiding Officer wasn't serving in this body 10 years ago when  we voted on Grassley-Cruz, but at the time, nine Democrats voted for  it. It received the most bipartisan support of any of the comprehensive  legislation before this body. It got a majority vote in the Harry Reid  Democrat Senate, where the Democrats had a substantial majority.   I would urge you, Mr. President, and every other Democrat to  demonstrate the same principle and the same courage that those nine  Democrats did a decade ago.   Let's vote for legislation that will actually solve the problem, that  will actually stop violent criminals, and that will actually keep our  kids safe. Let's resist the political urge to try to attack and  undermine the Second Amendment, to try to disarm law-abiding citizens.   I can tell you, as long as I am serving in this body, I will fight  with every breath I can to defend the constitutional right to keep and  bear arms of every American. It is in the Bill of Rights. It is a  foundational right.   We can do both. We can stop criminals and protect the Second  Amendment. This bill on the floor, the Democrat bill, does not. So I  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass Cruz-Barrasso and  abandon the Democrat legislation that doesn't stop violent crime but  does infringe on the Second Amendment.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this body has a choice before it: Do we pass  legislation that will be ineffective in stopping violent crime, that  has very little prospect of preventing the next mass shooting, that  will do very little to make schools safer but, at the same time, will  undermine the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens? That is  the Democrat bill that is currently on the floor.   Or do we, instead, move to pass real legislation that will stop  violent crime, that will put gun criminals in jail, that will prosecute  felons and fugitives who try to illegally buy guns, and that will  provide serious funding for school safety?   The Cruz-Barrasso legislation provides funding to double the number  of police officers in schools across America so our kids can be kept  safe--$36 billion total in funding, repurposed from unspent Democrat  emergency funds. This bill also provides $10 billion in funding for  mental health counselors in schools to stop troubled teens before they  go down a horrible road.   The Democrat bill has much smaller funding for cops and schools, much  smaller funding for mental health, but much more infringement of the  Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.   So it is a choice all of us have: Do we want to stop these crimes, or  do we want to play politics?   And I would note, Mr. President, that the proponents of this bill at  the outset swore up and down: There will be amendments. We will have  amendments on this bill.   Well, right now, the majority leader wants no amendments. And how do  we know that? Because the majority leader has filled the amendment  tree, has blocked amendments.   This morning, the majority leader was saying that he would allow a  vote on Cruz-Barrasso, a straight-up vote. But, for whatever reason,  that has changed; and so, right now, amendments are blocked. But,  fortunately, it is the right of any Senator to move to table that  blocking amendment, and that is what I will do momentarily. And the  reason I am moving to table this blocking amendment is to take up Cruz- Barrasso.   And so this vote is a straight-up vote: Do you support serious law  enforcement? Do you support prosecuting violent criminals who use guns  in their crimes? Do you support prosecuting and sending to jail felons  and fugitives and those with serious mental illness who try to  illegally buy firearms? And do you support getting serious about  [[Page S3137]]  protecting our schools? Do you support doubling the number of cops in  our schools so that our kids are safe? Do you support funding mental  health counselors so our kids are safe?   This is an opportunity for every Senator to decide if they support  doing something that actually fixes the problem or if they put a higher  priority on partisan politics. On the merits, this vote should be 100  to 0. We will see what the vote is in reality.                               Motion to Table    Mr. President, accordingly, I move to table amendment No. 5100, and I  ask for the yeas and nays.
