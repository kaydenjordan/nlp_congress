 Mr. President, first, I associate myself with the  remarks that we just heard from the distinguished Senator from  Missouri, who made some wonderful points about how important the bill  that we are discussing on the floor continues to be. I appreciate his  remarks and his leadership in this body.                              Government Funding    Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss a different topic,  which is that the government has reopened for 3 weeks. It is welcome  news that President Trump has signed the stopgap funding measure and  has fully paid furloughed Federal workers.   There was an important workforce story that, I believe, was lost over  the last couple of weeks during the shutdown--the story about the great  news of the American economy. I certainly feel it at home. I know the  Presiding Officer does in Utah, as do others, as we head home and see  the ``help wanted'' signs that are up and the people who are looking to  hire more people.   This economy continues to fire on all cylinders. It is fueled,  certainly, in part by what Republicans have been able to accomplish due  to our policy, which is a pro-job policy of tax cuts and regulatory  relief. Since the tax cut law that was signed a year ago, this economy  has created 2.6 million American jobs in the last year. There is  additional good news. I hear it in Wyoming, I heard it last weekend,  and I expect to hear it this weekend. Americans are seeing that there  is actually more money in their paychecks. There is more money for a  couple of reasons. One is that wages are up, and the other is that  taxes are down. Last month, there was a 3.2-percent year-over-year  increase in average hourly wages. It matched October as the biggest  increase since 2009. This wage increase was even stronger for  production workers and non-managers, who saw an additional increase in  year-over-year growth.    The economy is working well. It is producing more jobs. For 9  straight months now, there have been more available jobs in this  country than individuals looking for work. Last week, we saw jobless  claims drop to the lowest level since November of 1969--1969, the year  we put a man on the Moon and the year of Woodstock. That was 50 years  ago. It was the lowest since then. That is half a century.   Now that this partial shutdown is over, I believe we need to refocus  our attention on continuing to grow the economy, continuing to increase  wages, and continuing to create more high-paying jobs for American  workers. Meanwhile, Democrats seem to want to put the brakes on the  economy. They are proposing higher taxes and expansive new regulations.   We still have our work cut out for us. This excellent economic news  underscores the need for us to work together to resolve our differences  on important government funding legislation. Let's keep in mind that 70  percent of the government is already funded all the way through the end  of the fiscal year. Congress still has the job to do of funding the  remaining 25 percent, and we need to do that by the middle of  February--by February 15.   By signing the 3-week continuing resolution, the President has given  Congress the opportunity to come together to secure the southern border  and to fund the government. During the shutdown standoff, Democrats  repeatedly called for the President to reopen the government. They  asked for 3 weeks so they could seriously negotiate, they say, on  border security. Well, we now have a 3-week agreement, but time is  going to tell whether Democrats are serious about solving this border  security crisis and protecting the American people.   A full-year spending deal has to include significant funding for a  comprehensive border security package. We need more personnel, we need  more technology, and we need more physical barriers.   Security barriers are not the sole solution, but they are an  essential part of the solution. That is why the last four Presidents  built 650 miles of physical barriers along our 2,000-mile border with  Mexico. Democrats, including Speaker Pelosi, voted for all this  construction. In fact, the Speaker's home State of California has a  physical barrier on the border with Tijuana, Mexico.   Like his four predecessors, President Trump has listened to the  security experts. Those four were President Obama, President Clinton,  President George W. Bush, and President George Herbert Walker Bush.  Four Presidents prior to President Trump listened to the experts.   The experts today say we need 200 more miles of physical barriers  strategically located where illegal traffic is surging. Despite the  experts' support, Democrats have abruptly changed their position on  barriers--changed completely--and they have denied the President the  funding he has requested.   Given that Democrats had supported 650 miles of the physical barriers  we  [[Page S759]]  currently have, why are they opposing the next 200 miles, strategically  placed where illegal traffic is surging? To me, it seems personal, and  it seems aimed at President Trump. The American people expect us to  solve problems not as Democrats and Republicans but as elected  representatives of the people.   The priority is to move full-year Homeland Security Department  spending legislation through Congress that provides wall funding.  Today, House-Senate negotiators are working to produce a compromise  package that can pass with the other six bills and get it done by  February 15. This conference committee--a committee of the two Houses-- will be meeting later today. Conferees may also add other provisions,  including immigration reforms.   Already, the President has offered to extend protections for the  Dreamers, who were brought here as children, and immigrants whose  temporary visas are expiring. So the President has offered an  opportunity and a solution. These modest proposals are an immigration  policy bandaid. Yet they could be the start of broader bipartisan  immigration talks. From a policy perspective, I believe we are not that  far apart.   Americans agree that border security is important and that our  immigration system does need reform. The country's safety and security  must always come first.   In my opinion, the President is open to reasonable changes to his  plan. I believe he has been very willing to compromise. As long as  Democrats define victory as blocking President Trump, however, on his  key priority, everyone loses, and that includes Federal workers, the  American people, and immigrants.   The American people expect us to work together to resolve our  differences. This isn't a winner-take-all political game. It never  should be. Members of both parties must be flexible. Once Congress  passes a full-year spending bill, we can move on to other priorities  facing us as a nation.   President Trump has incredible determination to build physical  barriers where Border Patrol tells us they are most needed, and the  President is right when he says walls work. Democrats supported  construction before President Trump took office; they should support it  now. The President has presented a path to compromise. Now Democrats  should follow suit. All we need to succeed is cooperation. The best  position on this negotiation highway is the middle lane. It is time to  move to the middle and move forward on border security. By working  together, we can produce a winning solution for America.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
