 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about North Korea,  the most urgent national security challenge for the United States and  our allies in East Asia.   Secretary Mattis has said North Korea is ``the most urgent and  dangerous threat to peace and security.'' Admiral Gortney, the previous  commander of U.S. Northern Command, stated that the Korean Peninsula is  at its most unstable point since 1953, when the armistice was signed.   Last year alone, North Korea conducted two nuclear tests and a  staggering 24 ballistic missile launches. This year, Pyongyang already  launched 18 missiles, including the two recent tests of  intercontinental ballistic missiles that are reportedly capable of  reaching the U.S. homeland.   President Trump has said that the United States will not allow this  to happen, and I am encouraged by the President's resolve. Patience is  not an option with the U.S. homeland in the nuclear shadow of Kim Jong  Un. Our North Korea policy of decades of bipartisan failure must turn  to one of immediate bipartisan success, with pressure and global  cooperation resulting in the peaceful denuclearization of the regime.   As Vice President Pence stated during his recent visit to South  Korea:         Since 1992, the United States and our allies have stood       together for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. We hope to       achieve this objective through peaceable means. But all       options are on the table.    But time is not on our side. I believe U.S. policy toward North Korea  should be straightforward. The United States should deploy every  economic, diplomatic, and, if necessary, military tool at our disposal  to deter Pyongyang and to protect our allies.   However, the road to peacefully stopping Pyongyang undoubtedly lies  through Beijing. China is the only country that holds the diplomatic  and economic leverage necessary to put the real squeeze on the North  Korean regime.   According to the South Korean state trade agency, China accounts for  90 percent of North Korea's trade, including virtually all of North  Korea's exports. From 2000 to 2015, trade volume between China and  North Korea has climbed more than tenfold, rising from $488 million in  2000 to $5.4 billion in 2015. Beijing is the reason the regime acts so  boldly and with relatively few consequences.   China must now move beyond a mere articulation of concern and lay out  a transparent path of focused pressure to denuclearize North Korea. A  global power that borders this regime cannot simply throw up its hands  and absolve itself of responsibility.   The administration is right to pursue a policy of ``maximum  pressure'' toward North Korea, and we have a robust toolbox already  available to ramp up the sanctions track--a track that has hardly been  utilized to its fullest extent and a track made even more complete last  week with additional sanctions on North Korea.   Last Congress, I led the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement  Act, which passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 0. This legislation was  the first stand-alone legislation in Congress regarding North Korea to  impose mandatory sanctions on the regime's proliferation activities,  human rights violations, and malicious cyber behavior.   A recent analysis from the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies  says:         North Korea sanctions have more than doubled since the       North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act came into       effect on February 18, 2016. Prior to that date, North Korea       ranked eighth, behind Ukraine/Russia, Iran, Iraq, the       Balkans, Syria, Sudan, and Zimbabwe.    Even with the 130-percent sanctions increase after the North Korea  Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, North Korea is today still only  the fifth most sanctioned country by the United States. North Korea is  far from being sanctioned out.   So while Congress has clearly moved from the Obama administration  inaction to some action, the Trump administration has the opportunity  to use these authorities to build maximum leverage with not only  Pyongyang but also with Beijing. I am encouraged by the actions the  administration took last month to finally designate a Chinese financial  institution, but this should be just the beginning. The administration,  with congressional support, should now make clear to any entity doing  business with North Korea that they will not be able to do business  with the United States or have access to the U.S. financial system.   A report released last month by an independent organization known as  C4ADS identified over 5,000 Chinese companies that are doing business  with North Korea. These Chinese companies are responsible for $7  billion in trade with North Korea. Moreover, the C4ADS report found  that only 10 of the 5,000-plus companies control 30 percent of Chinese  exports to North Korea. So of 30 percent of Chinese exports, 10  companies are responsible for that number in 2016 alone. One of those  ten companies alone controlled nearly 10 percent of all imports from  North Korea. Some of these companies were even found to have satellite  offices in the United States.   According to recent disclosures, from 2009 to 2017, North Korea used  Chinese banks to process at least $2.2 billion in transactions through  the U.S. financial  [[Page S4637]]  system. This must stop now. The United States should not be afraid of a  diplomatic confrontation with Beijing for simply enforcing existing  U.S. and international law. In fact, it should be more afraid of  Congress if it does not. As for any prospect of engagement, we should  continue to let Beijing know in no uncertain terms that the United  States will not negotiate with Pyongyang at the expense of U.S.  national security and that of our allies.   Instead of working with the United States and the international  community to disarm the madman in Pyongyang, Beijing has called on the  United States and South Korea to halt our military exercises in  exchange for vague promises of North Korea suspending its missile and  nuclear activities. That is a bad deal, and the Trump administration  was right to reject it.   Moreover, before any talks in any format, the United States and our  partners must demand that Pyongyang first meet the denuclearization  commitments it had already agreed to in the past and subsequently chose  to brazenly violate.   President Trump should continue to impress to President Xi that a  denuclearized Korean Peninsula is in both nations' fundamental long- term interests. As Admiral Harry Harris rightfully noted, ``we want to  bring Kim Jung Un to his senses, not to his knees.'' But to achieve  this goal, Beijing must be made to choose whether it wants to work with  the United States as a responsible global leader to stop Pyongyang or  bear the consequences of keeping him in power.   Two weeks ago I introduced legislation with a bipartisan group of  cosponsors called the North Korean Enablers Accountability Act. This  legislation takes the first steps toward imposing a total economic  embargo on North Korea, including a ban on any entity that does  business with North Korea or its enablers from using the U.S. financial  system and imposing U.S. sanctions on all those participating in North  Korean labor trafficking abuses.   My legislation specifically singles out those 10 largest Chinese  importers of North Korean goods and sends a very clear message: You can  either do business with this outlaw regime or do business with the  world's largest economy. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation and our continued efforts to stop Pyongyang's further  development of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles  to bring peace to the peninsula and to denuclearize peacefully the  North Korean regime.   In order to put real pressure, this administration must act, and it  must act on the regime and its enablers wherever they are based.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The deputy majority leader is  recognized.
