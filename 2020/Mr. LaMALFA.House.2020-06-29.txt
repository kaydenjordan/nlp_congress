 Mr. Speaker, needle exchange and distribution programs  are doing nothing to get people off drugs, and our neighborhoods are  suffering as a result.   There is a facility in my district in Chico that distributes needles  at local parks where families with children normally congregate.   Now, on top of that, as a result of coronavirus, they have also  started to deliver them directly to addicts' homes.   We deserve better than a government that indiscriminately panders to  addicts, so today I introduced the MEND Our Neighborhoods Act, a bill  that would reinstate the Federal funding prohibition on needle  distribution programs.   Law-abiding citizens should not have to deal with the fact that they  may be exposed to a used dirty needle in our parks, on our sidewalks,  or virtually anywhere that an addict can sit down and shoot up.   Enabling drug users should not take precedent over the health and  safety of our areas and our parks, so that families can enjoy normal  outdoor activities in our public places and in our parks.                            ____________________
