 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the passing of  Rick Antle, an absolute legend of the agriculture industry in our  Salinas Valley and all across our great Nation.   Rick was the president and CEO of the produce giant, Tanimura &  Antle. T&A's success was due to Rick's and his family's stewardship of  the environment, as well as his employees. For the farmworkers, who he  called the backbone of his business, he provided state-of-the-art  healthcare and housing, and invited all of his employees to join a  stock option program so that they could become owners of the company.  The way he ran T&A was a testament to his caring personality and his  political philosophy.   Yet, for Rick, nothing was more important than family. A beloved son,  a devoted husband and soulmate to his wife, Tonya, a doting  grandfather, and a dedicated father, Rick's love for his family,  generosity to his employees, and contributions to the agriculture  community and to our community will never be forgotten.   That is why I will never forget his son, Brian, recounting the best  piece of advice Rick ever gave him, which was that ``the best  fertilizer a farmer can ever use is his shadow.'' To me, that  philosophy sums up Rick and the Antle family, and that is why he will  always be there, and that is why Rick Antle will always be with us.                            ____________________
