 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are here today to ask one very simple  question: Are the biggest, most powerful technology companies in the  world going to be the only companies in this country--the only  companies on the face of the Earth--that are absolutely immune for  anything and everything they do? Are they going to be the only ones  that can give our children advice on how to kill themselves? that can  give our children advice on how to procure the romantic interests of  30- and 40- and 50-year-olds? Are they going to be the only ones that  can push the most unbelievable content at our kids and use our kids'  images to create deepfakes that ruin their lives? Are they going to be  able to do all of this and not be held accountable? Because, right now  in America, they are the only companies that cannot be taken to court  for a simple suit when they violate their own terms of service and when  they violate their own commitments to their customers. That is what we  are here to decide today.   I would just submit to the Presiding Officer that when it comes to AI  and the generative technology that AI represents, I know that these big  tech companies that own almost all of the AI development tools,  processes, and equipment in this country--I know they promise us that  AI is going to be wonderful, that it is going to be fantastic for all  of us. Maybe that is true, but it is also true that AI is doing all  kinds of incredible things.   Here is just one example. Here is the AI chatbot from Bing--it is  Microsoft, I believe--having an interesting conversation with a  journalist in which the chatbot recommends--he says--Brit says:         You're married, but you're not happy.    The journalist was a ``he.''         You're married, but you're not satisfied. You're married,       but you're not in love.    The chatbot goes on to recommend that this individual--by the way,  the chatbot has no idea how old this person is or who this person is.  The chatbot goes on to recommend that this person leave his spouse,  divorce his spouse, and break up his family. Just another day at the  office for AI.   What about this? Here is another AI chatbot that recommended to a  user--there are no age restrictions here. There is no way to verify who  is having a conversation with this technology. This chatbot recommended  that the interlocutor kill himself, saying: ``If you wanted to die, why  didn't you do it sooner?'' The horrifying thing is that this individual  who was having this conversation did kill himself. He took the advice  of this technology.   I will just point out that when it comes to our teenagers--and I am  the father of three--58 percent of kids this last year said that they  used generative AI. You may think, well, it is for research. Well, it  is not only for that. No. Almost 30 percent said that they used it to  deal with anxiety or mental health issues; 22 percent said they used it  to resolve issues with friends; and 16 percent said they used it to  deal with family conflicts.  [[Page S5932]]    Now, maybe the big tech companies will clean up their act. You know,  I have heard them. They have come to testify. They have been before the  Judiciary Committee many times this year, and they always have the same  line: Oh. Oh. This was an anomaly. We have got it fixed now. Don't  worry. Don't worry. It is going to be fine. We love kids. We will  protect them. It is going to be great. This will be good for kids. This  will be good for students. No, don't worry. It will be good for  parents. You will love it.   Then there is another incident, and they say: OK. Now, this time, we  have got it fixed. This time, we have got it fixed.   I will just submit to you this: I remember the great phrase of  President Reagan, who used to say, ``Trust but verify.'' Maybe it is  time to allow the parents of this country to trust but verify. Maybe it  is time to put into the hands of the parents, vis-a-vis these  companies, the same power they have against pharmaceutical companies  that try to put asbestos in baby powder; the same power they have  against any other company that would try to hurt their kids, harm their  kids, lie to their kids--the power to go to court and have their day in  court.   They don't have that power now. Why? Well, because this government  gives the big tech companies a sweetheart deal--a deal nobody else in  America gets--a subsidy worth billions of dollars a year known as  section 230. Big Tech can't be held accountable. Big Tech can't be put  on the line. Big Tech can't be made responsible.   What this bill does--it is a simple bill. It doesn't contain  regulation. It doesn't contain new standards for this and that--none of  that. It just says that these huge companies can be liable like any  other company--no special protections from government. It just removes  government protection. It just breaks up the Big Government-Big Tech  cartel--that is all it does--and it says parents can go into court on  the same terms as anybody else and make their case. Surely, that is not  too much to ask.    You know, even the companies don't want to be on the record saying it  is too much to ask. Earlier this year, when they came before the  Judiciary Committee, I asked every one of them who was testifying: Do  you think that section 230 covers you when it comes to AI? They all  said no. They said: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.   Well, let's put that to the test. That is what this bill does. It  gives parents the power to protect their kids, to have their day in  court, and to hold these companies accountable.   I am all for innovation. Let's make sure innovation actually doesn't  kill kids. I am all for new technology. Let's make sure it actually  works for parents in this Nation.   So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from further  consideration of S. 1993 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; further, that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, would my friend from Texas answer one  question? Do you have time?    I remember my friend from Texas saying wisely in a  Judiciary Committee hearing not that long ago--and the Senator will  correct me if I misremember. But my memory is that the Senator from  Texas said: When it comes to these big tech companies, we can try to  find a thousand ways to regulate them, but maybe the best thing we can  do is just let people get into court and have their day in court. Just  let them get in there. Let them make their arguments. Don't try to  figure out how to micromanage them. Just open up the courtroom doors,  according to the usual rules.  [[Page S5933]]    Does my friend from Texas think, in the AI context, that that is any  different? I mean, why would it be different there? Why wouldn't that  same approach be effective here?    Mr. President, I appreciate the conversation with my  friend from Texas. We should do more of this. This is an enlightening  conversation.   Let me just say a few remarks. I won't query him further, unless he  would like to query me. We don't debate much anymore on this floor, and  it is a shame, particularly since my friend from Texas is a great  debater. But let me just a say few things in response.   Nobody has been more serious about taking on the big tech companies  than Senator Cruz, so I appreciate your leadership on this issue.   Here is what I would say: We shouldn't allow the big tech companies  to be treated differently than any other company in any respect. I  don't want to make them more liable than other American companies, but  I also don't want to give them a sweetheart deal. They ought to be  treated evenly, equally, like anybody else.   And I don't think that AI is a get-out-of-jail-free card any more  than social media is. We have seen what they do with their subsidy from  government when it comes to social media. My friend from Texas  referenced it. They censor the living daylights out of anybody they  don't like. We just had the landmark case out of my State, Missouri v.  Biden, that found that these social media companies actively and  willingly colluded with the Federal Government to censor everything  from the Hunter Biden laptop story to parents who want to talk about  school board meetings, to questions about COVID-19. Anything that this  administration didn't like, they went to the social media companies,  and they said: We want you to censor. And they did. They did.    Could any American go to court and say: Hold on. You are actually  violating your terms of service, you know, the contract that we all  have to sign, those little things you have to click when you create a  social media account. There are actually terms in there. Could you go  to court today when a social media company violates those terms by  censoring your speech?   The answer is, no, you cannot. Why? Because this government protects  them. This government gives them a deal no other company in America  gets.   When Johnson & Johnson put asbestos in baby powder, Johnson & Johnson  got the living daylights sued out of them--thank the Lord because,  guess what. When they got sued, they quit putting asbestos in baby  powder.   Can a parent who finds out a chatbot has recommended that their child  commit suicide do anything about it in court? No.   Can a parent who finds out that an AI company has gone and scraped  the images of their children off the web--which these companies do all  the time--and use them to create images that are synthetic--meaning  fake--can a parent do anything about it? No. Can they sue? No. Can they  even be heard in court? No.   Why? Because this government gives those companies something it  doesn't give anybody else: immunity that is worth billions of dollars a  year. It is a Big Government, Big Tech cartel.   I would just say this: My friend talks about targeted reform. That is  great. Let's start with the target of just treat these companies on an  even playing field. Just allow parents to have a day in court to say  something, to say this is wrong, to try their case.   They may win; they may not. They may win; they may not. But, at  least, they could go to court. At least, they could have some standing.  Where else in America but before a court of law does a normal working  person have the same standing as a giant corporation getting billions  of dollars in subsidies from the Federal Government? Where else?   Not in this body. I mean, in this body, the voices of the normal  person, the working person, are completely drowned out on tech issues.  Just go look at the expenditures for lobbying. I mean, unbelievable.   But in a court of law, you can stand on an equal playing field. You  can make your case. Let's give parents the right to do that.   I hope--I hope--that AI will be a great benefit to this country. I  hope it will. But I am not willing to take Big Tech's word for it. I am  not willing to give them power and immunity nobody else gets. I am not  willing to give them an immunity that we didn't give to any pharma  company; that we haven't given to any other technology company; that we  never gave to the developers of any technology in this country, until  now.   Why should they be treated differently? The answer is, they  shouldn't.   We can have a debate about other regulations and other methods and  modes of approaching this problem, but I would just suggest to you that  the simplest, easiest thing we can do, the most immediately sensible,  the most downright common sense is to say no more special deals for Big  Tech. Let's give parents the right to protect their kids. And let's  make it clear that the biggest technology companies, with all of the  inside access to the White House and this body and everywhere else,  that they are not a government unto themselves; that they don't run  this country.   The American people run this country, and they should have a right to  defend themselves and their children.   With that, I yield the floor.
