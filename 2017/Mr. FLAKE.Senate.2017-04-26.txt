The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, Arizona is home to more than a half million  veterans. They have served in every conflict from World War II to  present-day operations in the Middle East. Nothing makes me prouder  than to shake the hand of one of these veterans and to call them an  Arizonan.   Fortunately, many of these veterans have the support of friends and  family, as well as their fellow veterans with whom they served, but far  too many who have served our country lack a support system that can  help them successfully make the transition back to civilian life.   For those who have post-traumatic stress or traumatic brain injury,  this could be particularly difficult. Studies have shown that veterans  often do not seek out medical health treatment due to concerns about  stigma, negative career prospects, lack of awareness, or logistical  challenges in accessing care. For those who go without treatment, it  can lead to substance abuse and, in some cases, run-ins with the law.   While there is no justification for criminal behavior, it is  important to recognize when certain actions may be symptomatic of the  harrowing experiences a veteran has endured during years of service.  This is something the criminal justice system often fails to deal with.  By not providing treatment that actually addresses a veteran's  underlying service-connected issues, our criminal justice system  sometimes creates a vicious cycle. It overcriminalizes service- connected mental illness, undertreats incarcerated veterans, and  increases recidivism.    To address the problem, the VA created the Veterans Justice Outreach  Program in 2009. The program was established to remove veterans from  the regular criminal justice process and to provide specially tailored  treatments to address many of these underlying issues. These veterans  treatment courts have a proven record of preventing initial  incarceration and reducing recidivism.   The lifeblood of the program is the veterans justice outreach  specialists, VJO specialists, who link veterans to available court  services. These outreach specialists identify veterans in jails and  local courts, they assess their health status, and they help them  develop the rehabilitation treatment program specific to each of their  needs.   I recently had the opportunity to observe the veterans docket and  meet with some of these dedicated specialists while visiting the Mesa  Municipal Court earlier this month. Let me tell you, there is no  substitute for seeing this firsthand. Even though it is a courtroom  setting, there is a comradery and collaboration that you don't see in  traditional courtroom proceedings. I was amazed at how many  [[Page S2556]]  organizations there are to help these veterans--to help them  successfully transition and help them with treatment.   The collaboration I am talking about comes from having a judge and  hard-working staff who have served in the military themselves. They  understand the hardship of multiple deployments for servicemembers and  their families. They understand the mental and physical tolls of  combat. They understand that the transition back to civilian life can  mark the beginning of a new battle for veterans.   The program has experienced remarkable success. The unfortunate  reality is that the VA doesn't have enough outreach specialists to  ensure access to already available treatment for justice-involved  veterans. Demand for VJO specialists is outpacing the program's ability  to serve eligible veterans. This means future veterans treatment courts  can't be established, existing courts will go understaffed, and  veterans will go unserved. That is not right.   That is why today I am introducing the Veterans Treatment Court  Improvement Act to ensure our veterans receive swift and appropriate  access to justice. This legislation will provide 50 additional VJO  specialists for veterans treatment courts nationwide. By increasing the  number of dedicated specialists at these facilities, Congress can  ensure that more veterans have access to the treatments they have  earned with their service. This is bipartisan legislation. I will work  to inform my colleagues about the need for this program and additional  VJOs in the coming weeks and months.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Bennet, Mr.          Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Mr. Franken, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Leahy,          Mr. Markey, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Peters, Mr. Reed, Mr.          Schatz, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Warren, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Van          Hollen, and Mr. Menendez):   S. 948.
