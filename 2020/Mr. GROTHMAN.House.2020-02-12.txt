 Madam Speaker, today I would like to address one more  time what I think is the most important issue facing the country,  because it deals so much with the country's future and who will be  living in the country 10, 20, or 30 years down the road: And that is  immigration.   To a large extent we haven't addressed this issue as we should have,  I think, in part, because we are spending a great deal of time on  impeachment, and that kind of sucked the air out of other critical  issues facing the country. I think even conservative media, be it talk  radio or other media, have not dealt with what is going on with  immigration, have not pointed out the progress that President Trump has  made, but also have not highlighted the things that have to be done if  we are going to assure in the future the people living in this country  are people who are going to make a positive contribution to the Nation.   President Trump on his own, through a variety of efforts, has reduced  the number of people who are coming in this country from over 140,000  people processed last May--a time in which at least 90,000 people were  placed in the United States somewhere--to well under 50,000 with under  1,000 people in January being placed in the United States. Dropping  from over 90,000 to under 1,000 is the type of progress you rarely see  anywhere in government.   First of all, I thank President Trump for the things he has done. We  now have the Mexican military patrolling the southern border, so it is  not just our border patrol minding things.   Even more significantly, the Mexican Government has agreed to hold  people who are seeking asylum. Prior to this, people seeking asylum-- and anybody can seek asylum--were placed with a social services agency  in the United States, frequently Catholic Social Services, placed  somewhere in the United States pending a hearing and frequently never  showing up for that hearing. Now they are held in Mexico, which is a  big benefit and also will discourage people from coming here  unnecessarily. And I think the vast majority of people that were  seeking asylum in the past were not even really subject to any fear or  any possible danger in their home country.   Just as significantly, President Trump has reached agreements with  Central American countries to hold people down there who are seeking  asylum from further down south. It should go without saying that if I  leave Venezuela because I feel a threat to myself, I would probably  stay in a country relatively near Venezuela. If I am going all the way  to the United States and having passed through five or six other  countries, my primary goal is probably to improve my economic  condition, not just escape danger in my homeland. President Trump's  efforts with Central American countries to hold more people are also  bearing fruit.   However, we also have to talk about what has to be done in the future  and what should be done by Congress, commonsense things--now, I am one  of those Congressmen using the phrase ``commonsense,'' it is kind of  overused--but commonsense things I think the vast majority of Americans  would agree with.   First of all, the Flores settlement right now requires having to  release families after being held for 20 days. That obviously should be  extended, and it creates a very difficult situation for the United  States Government.   Secondly, President Trump is trying to crack down on people getting  welfare payments if they are coming here as immigrants. Obviously, we  have no problem taking care of Americans who are going through a tough  time, but we take immigrants here--given that we have a trillion-dollar  debt--who can take care of themselves. It would be a big mistake, both  cost wise and as far as the future of people who are coming here, to  allow people to come here if they will be taking advantage of our  generous welfare system.   In particular, we have to do something with what some people want:  Free medical care for people coming here as immigrants. I have been  down to the border several times, and it is something that frustrates  the Border Patrol.   So, many Americans right now have large deductibles and have to  hesitate before they go to the doctor or hesitate before they have a  procedure done. That is not true of people who come here illegally. And  the Border Patrol believes that right now some people are coming to the  country primarily for the free medical care that is being offered. That  is something we have to get rid of.   President Trump continues to build the wall as quickly as he can,  given the way government operates. I am glad that President Trump was  able to find money in the Defense Department to help along the wall.   I want to point out that every Border Patrol agent that I have talked  to, and I must have talked to dozens, believe the wall is a good idea.  I realize there are people who haven't gone to the border or dealt with  the experts down there, but unless you secure that southern border, you  have a tremendous problem. And part of that problem, by the way, is the  danger people trying to come here face.   Somebody is going to control that southern border; it is either going  to be the United States or the Mexican drug cartels. If the Mexican  drug cartels continue to control the border, it means that some people  are going to wind up dehydrating in the desert, it means some people  are going to wind up drowning in the Rio Grande, and it means the  people who come here are frequently going to be subject to the whims of  the Mexican cartels. Sometimes that means sexual assault. Sometimes it  means their relatives back home are going to be threatened. But we want  to be the ones controlling the border and who comes across. Again, if  we don't determine it, the Mexican drug cartels determine it.   I have to point out that we believe that over 1,000 gang members were  caught last year. Among certain drugs, over 90 percent, of course  according to the DEA, have gotten into this country by going through  the southern border. We really can't say we are serious about  addressing the opioid crisis until we do something at the southern  border.    The next thing we should be addressing is sanctuary cities. Sanctuary  cities are an invitation for people to break American law. It is hard  to say we have a serious immigration system when, on the other hand, we  have individual, local government people, in essence, saying come here,  we will not enforce our law.   Another huge problem with sanctuary cities is it makes it difficult  to deport the criminals. Obviously, we don't want the next generation  of Americans to be criminal in nature, and the only way to deal with  that, I believe, is to get rid of the sanctuary cities. Last year,  68,000 people died of various drug overdoses in this country.   The next thing that should be done is we should be doing something  about birthright citizenship. When I was down at the border, it was  very apparent there were women coming here, and not a few, who were 7  or 8 months pregnant. In other words, they are coming here, not because  we handpick them, they are coming here because they realize that their  children become citizens, and largely, if their children become  citizens--and we are not for breaking up families--the parents will be  able to stay here, too.   The United States is only one of two of the 45 wealthiest countries  in the world which allows birthright citizenship. It is obviously  something that we ought to get rid of, and this is another thing that  Congress ought to do.   In the upcoming budget bill, having talked to the Border Patrol and  having talked to ICE, it would be a good idea to get more dogs on the  border, not just to detect things coming into the country but to detect  cash going out of the country.                                time  1845    Dogs today can do something about that, can detect cash. It would do  a lot, I think, to stop the drug cartels from using our border.   In any event, these are some of the suggestions that I hope Congress  takes up.   I think it is such an important decision, because we know that very  frequently when somebody comes to this country, they are not leaving.   If we are picking good people--and under President Trump in the last  few years, the number of people sworn in legally has gone up. We are  now over 650,000. So nobody says President  [[Page H1123]]  Trump is anti-immigrant. We are getting more people here legally.   But we have got to prevent people from coming here illegally. By  continuing to do this, we will continue to create a situation in which  the future of America will look more bleak because the type of people  coming here are not the type of people who are handpicked.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
