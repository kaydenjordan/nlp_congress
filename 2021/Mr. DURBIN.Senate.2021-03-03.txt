 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, history was made on Monday. Judge Merrick  Garland finally got a vote before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It  was a long time in coming. His nomination was approved by a bipartisan  vote of 15 to 7. I am not surprised. He is superbly qualified to be the  next Attorney General of the United States.   With experience, judgment, and integrity, he checks all the boxes. He  served with distinction on the DC Circuit Court for 23 years and, in  that time, developed a reputation for fidelity to the rule of law, a  strict adherence to judicial independence, and a commitment to treat  people with fairness, dignity, and respect. It is no surprise that he  has been endorsed by 60 former Federal judges and by judges, of course,  who have been appointed by Presidents of both political parties. In  addition to his experience on the bench, he is a longtime veteran of  the Department of Justice, where he served before he ascended to the DC  Circuit.   He is uniquely qualified at this moment in history to lead the  Department and to investigate and prosecute, for example, the January 6  insurrection--the mob that invaded this Capitol Building. The reason he  is qualified is that he led the investigation and prosecution of the  Oklahoma City bombing. We remember that very well. That was clearly a  case of domestic terrorism. His work on that project won praise from  across the political spectrum.   He also personally understands the Department's role in protecting  civil rights. I believe he is the person to restore honor and dignity  to this Department. He has support from every major law enforcement  organization in the country, from 150 former Justice Department  officials of both parties, from the Nation's leading civil rights  organizations, and from many others--left, right, and center. His  credentials are second to none, and his character--in particular, his  selflessness--is a model to us all.   When we held the markup on his nomination in the committee, the most  significant witness may have been a lady by the name of Mrs. Tucker.  She testified on the second panel. She is the mother of two DC public  school students who were tutored and mentored by Judge Garland. After  the first child had received his helping hand for several years, the  second child asked if she could be included in the next round, and then  they both won the help of Judge Garland. Doesn't it speak volumes of a  man who has reached that station in life that he would be so humble as  to sit down and help children whom he had never met before find their  way through life? It was a touching moment when she testified. It  really was an insight into his character.   So you would think, with a 15-to-7 vote, you would think with all of  these endorsements, and you would think that the fact of there being  four members on the Republican Senate side of the Senate Judiciary  Committee behind him that this would be a nomination of an Attorney  General so important to this Nation that it would be given expedited  treatment on the floor of the Senate. No. Unfortunately, there was an  objection to expediting his nomination so he could get to work for the  Department of Justice, and, as a consequence, we face the Senate  procedure, which means that it could be days, maybe even into next  week, before he can take the job. That is unfortunate. We need him now  more than ever. Even Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has said he  would support him. Chuck Grassley, my friend and the ranking member of  the Senate Judiciary Committee, voted for him.   There is just no reason the Senate should not immediately hold a vote  for Merrick Garland's nomination. He is the last remaining member of  President Biden's national security team to be chosen. It is time for  him to take this job. The Attorney General is needed to fight the  threat of domestic terrorism, which the FBI Director spoke to yesterday  in the Senate Judiciary Committee, to reorganize this Department and  get it moving in the right direction, and to face the many challenges  when it comes to national security and the administration of justice.   We should confirm Merrick Garland immediately. I sincerely hope that  whoever is holding his nomination on the other side can be persuaded to  give him his chance                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a different subject, I listened to the  speeches of Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell about the American  Rescue Plan--Joe Biden's proposal, his initial proposal as President-- to deal with the pandemic, the state of the economy, and many other  aspects of American culture and life that need to be addressed.  Clearly, there is a difference of opinion.   I couldn't help but think, as Senator McConnell was recounting our  experience last year, that when it came to the CARES Act a year ago-- the $2 trillion plan to respond to the state of the pandemic and the  economy, the plan that was engineered by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, a  member of the Trump administration, who argued and negotiated with  Republicans and Democrats alike--that, when they finally agreed, the  vote was 96 to nothing in this Chamber. Every Democrat voted for the  proposed CARES Act that was engineered by the Trump administration.  Party was pushed aside because the priority was our Nation. It happened  again in December of last year. In President Trump's administration,  with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin at the table and with Democrats and  Republicans bargaining, the final vote was 92 to 6 in the Senate--not  bad--and the 6 noes were all Republicans. Again, the Democrats stepped  up and said: We will support this bipartisan effort because that is why  we are here. The American people sent us here to do a job.   Now comes the new President, Joe Biden, who says: Good work last  December, but that was temporary, and that was supposed to be a special  effort. Now we have to finish the year. We have some deadlines coming.  Just 2 weeks from now--or in less than 2 weeks--the unemployment  insurance programs will be running out for millions of Americans, and  the rental assistance program as well. Some will face eviction, and  some will not have enough money to feed their families. So get to work.  Pass the American Rescue Plan on a bipartisan basis.   We have yet to hear from one Republican Senator who will support  President Biden's plan. Some of them have  [[Page S1003]]  legitimate differences with his policy, and I wish they would come to  the table and be a part of the conversation, but none of them has  really stepped up and said: We are in for the big effort that the  President is calling for. That is what it will take. Unfortunately,  because of that, in a 50-50 Senate, we will need every Democratic  Senator to support the President's plan and to pass a version of what  the House is sending over to us. We will go through an exercise called  ``reconciliation'' in just a few days. It is not a pretty scene if you  follow legislative history, but it is long overdue.   Do you know the one thing that should drive us on? It is not only the  obvious need for this but the fact that the American people  overwhelmingly support what President Biden has proposed. The American  people believe, as he does, that we should be investing billions into  more vaccines and more people to administer them. The American people  believe that a cash payment to families is essential in some parts of  this country. They would like to see the $600 in last December's bill  complemented with the $1,400 in this proposal. They would like for us  to put money on the table for people who are unemployed so they can put  food on that same table, and they would like for us to get the schools  ready to deal with reopening and classes that are safe for the kids and  the teachers. There is no argument about that.   While 20 percent of the people may oppose it, 80 percent support it.  Yet we can't find one Republican Senator to support President Biden's  plan. They say it costs too much. Well, the Chairman of the Federal  Reserve, Mr. Powell, a conservative Republican economist, has told us  to be careful that you do too little. This economy is fragile. It needs  to be strengthened. We need to inject into this economy enough of our  resources so that people are back, purchasing again, and businesses are  reopened. He has warned us, if you do too little and if you cut it off  too soon, you are going to pay for it for years to come with  unemployment and problems with the sluggish economy.   My Republican colleagues say it is just too much money. Well, I think  they are wrong, and at this moment in history, I am prepared to err on  the side of investing in the American people and American businesses  and making certain that we have a fighting chance to put this behind  us.   Our constituents know about the cost of this situation. They want us  to provide the solutions. They want results from Congress. If we were  to delay this payment, people would see their unemployment insurance  lapse and hardships continue.   We shouldn't play politics with it either. In the two big bills last  year, the Democrats were on board for plans engineered by the Trump  administration. Economists believe that we need to move and move  decisively.   According to an analysis by the Brookings Institution, passing a  comprehensive plan like the American Rescue Plan could produce a 4- percent growth in U.S. GDP this year.   Moody's estimates that passing the same plan would create 7\1/2\  million American jobs. How about that?   We got good news over the weekend with the arrival of another safe  and effective vaccine. This is the third one, the Johnson & Johnson  vaccine, in our arsenal--perhaps more to follow. It holds the promise  of finally getting America inoculated, vaccinated, and breaking the  back of this pandemic.   This new vaccine prevents hospitalizations and deaths, stored at  normal temperatures, a single shot--all good news.   But we need more than a promise of a vaccine. We need a plan. These  vaccines are of no good to us sitting on a shelf or not being produced  in volumes necessary.   President Biden's rescue plan, which not a single Republican  supports, would provide 100 and--I think I have got the number right-- $160 billion in resources for the production of vaccines and the  distribution. If we ever needed it, this was the moment.   Thankfully, President Biden's leadership has led to allocations to  Illinois of vaccines that have increased by 70 percent since he took  over as President. We still have our challenges at the local level.   I want to salute the Governor, JB Pritzker; the mayor of the city of  Chicago, Lori Lightfoot; the Cook County Board President Preckwinkle;  and all the others who are doing their best.   I announced with Senator Duckworth just last Friday that we are going  to put a new facility in the parking lot of the United Center, where  the amazing Chicago Bulls play basketball from time to time, and it is  going to be able to vaccinate thousands of people every single day.   It is Federal assistance that is making it happen, and it happens to  be in a neighborhood where African Americans and Latinos are nearby,  and we need to protect them with even more effectiveness than we have  to date. They account for 33 percent of the population of that area,  and only 16 percent have been vaccinated.   The American Rescue Plan provides $20 billion to expand our vaccine  distribution capacity. You would think that that would maybe attract  one Republican supporter. It should. There are certainly some who argue  against all vaccines and spending any money for it and all the rest,  but they are such a small minority. The vast majority of Americans of  both political parties understand that we have got to go to  vaccinations as quickly as possible. The Biden rescue plan does that. I  wish they would join us in supporting it.   There is also a need for money for education. There is $128 billion  in this bill for additional education funding K-12, and there have been  arguments made on the floor here by the Republicans that we just don't  need it. They point to data showing that the school districts haven't  spent the money that we provided in previous relief packages. Well,  just talk to the principals and the teachers in your home State about  that conclusion. You will find the money is desperately needed and that  the money that has been appropriated before will be spent in an orderly  way and not shoveled out the window.   We are looking ahead to the entire year and making certain that we  have a real school year--perhaps the remainder of this year but  certainly for next year. Illinois needs these funds and America does.   When it comes to State and local support, I have to tell you, we have  paid a heavy price in our State of Illinois and our major cities. We  have seen expenses go up and we have seen revenue go down and we need  help, not unreasonable.   This helping hand will save jobs that are necessary for us--some of  them healthcare jobs, some of them security and safety jobs, but they  will save jobs, and that is why the State and the local resources  included in this bill are so important and timely.   Over the past year, States and localities have lost 1.3 million jobs  of their payrolls, far more than the 750,000 lost in the great  recession. There is needed help from the Federal Government, and it is  needed now.   We have recovered just 12 million of the 22 million jobs we have lost  since the start of the pandemic.   According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, more than 8  million rental households and 2 million homeowners were behind on  housing payments at the end of last year. The burden is tough, and for  those of us lucky enough to have escaped it, we may not know the  feeling, the empty feeling of eviction or the loss of a home that you  have paid a mortgage on for years.   I am going to close. I see one of my colleagues on the floor  preparing to speak, but I would like to close with the story of Galen  Hensen from Midlothian, IL.   For 34 years, Galen has supported touring artists through his work in  live concert production for some of America's most iconic musicians.  When the American economy was upended by the pandemic, his industry  froze to save other lives and to avoid crowds.   Like so many others, Galen went on unemployment. Yet, even with the  Federal $600 supplement to State unemployment, he had only half of his  regular income replaced. He struggles--still struggles to make ends  meet. He wrote to me urging that we put aside our partisan differences  and pass the American Rescue Plan. Let's listen to Galen, and let's  listen to many others like him. They are counting on us.   I hope when all is said and done after all the speeches, that just as  we came together on a bipartisan basis to pass the rescue plan twice  last year--96 to  [[Page S1004]]  nothing, 92 to 6--under the Trump administration, with all Democrats  supporting it, wouldn't it be great if we showed that same  bipartisanship again   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from  further consideration of S. 164 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.
