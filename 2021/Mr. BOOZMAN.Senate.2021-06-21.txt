 Madam President, I rise in support of S. Res. 268 and of  our Nation's dairy farmers, processors, and consumers as we celebrate  National Dairy Month.   This National Dairy Month is especially important. This time last  year, the country was still shut down. The economy was in the middle of  a major shock, and the dairy sector, like so many others, had to  persevere. Dairy farmers bore the brunt of very low prices resulting  from the COVID-19 pandemic. Dairy processors had to pivot their entire  supply chain to meet new and unique demand for their products. While  managing these challenges, dairy processors continue to address food  insecurity caused by the pandemic by donating billions of dollars of  nutritious milk, cheese, yogurt, and butter to needy Americans.   Despite unthinkable pressures, the industry continues to hold on. By  no means are we out of the woods yet. Dairy farmers across the country  continue to face pricing challenges. This National Dairy Month and  every month, I encourage my fellow Members of the Senate and all  Americans to keep these hard-working farm families in your mind and  their products in your grocery basket.   Milk provides several essential nutrients and is the No. 1 source of  calcium, potassium, and vitamin D for Americans. Yogurt and cheese are  top sources of protein, magnesium, phosphorous, vitamins A and D, and  calcium. And my personal favorite dairy product--ice cream--is a  delicious, nutrient-dense treat that hits the spot during hot summer  days in Arkansas.   National Dairy Month is a wonderful annual tradition highlighting an  important sector and its contribution to the American economy and  dinner plate. I want to thank Senators Roger Marshall, Kirsten  Gillibrand, and others for bringing this resolution to the Senate floor  and for their steadfast service on behalf of U.S. agriculture.                            ____________________
