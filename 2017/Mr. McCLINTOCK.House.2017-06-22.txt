 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his leadership on the Water, Power, and Oceans Subcommittee.   Mr. Chairman, droughts are nature's fault; they happen. But water  shortages are our fault. Water shortages are a choice that we made a  generation ago when we stopped building new reservoirs to meet the  needs of a growing population.   The unvarnished truth is we will not solve our water shortages until  we build more reservoirs, and we cannot build new reservoirs until we  overhaul the laws that have made their construction endlessly time- consuming and, ultimately, cost-prohibitive.   For years, the Natural Resources Committee has heard testimony from  frustrated water districts unable to navigate the Byzantine maze of  regulations and the phalanx of competing, overlapping, duplicative, and  often contradictory Federal agencies.   After years spent trying to satisfy one agency, another suddenly pops  up to claim jurisdiction with an entirely new set of demands in an  often endless permitting process, despite the fact they are studying  the same project in the same location with the same data. The burden  this places on our ability to deliver water for the next generation is  crushing.   The leader mentioned the High Savery Dam in Wyoming--14 years to  permit, only 2 years to actually build. The Federal Government has  literally studied four storage projects in California nearly to death.  One project, the Sites Reservoir, had over 50 alternative  [[Page H5085]]  locations studied, and there is no end in sight for the feasibility  process on that potential reservoir. Similar delays have prevented the  expansion of the Shasta reservoir for 39 years.   Mr. Huffman tells us that no dam permits have been denied because of  this. The problem is very few dam permits have been approved because of  this. And the costs are caused by cost-prohibitive delays in time that  run up millions and millions of dollars in costs until the agencies  simply throw up their hands and give up.   H.R. 1654 will bring order from this bureaucratic chaos. It  establishes a framework in which Federal agencies with permitting  responsibilities for the construction of new reservoirs must work  together, coordinate their schedules, share data and technical  materials, and make their findings publicly available. The end result  will be fewer delays, more efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and,  ultimately, more abundant water supplies.   It is modeled on the Obama administration's approach to constructing  new electric transmission lines to accommodate its reliance on wind and  solar generation. There is nothing new in this process. In October of  2009, the administration formed the Interagency Rapid Response Team for  Transmission, a consortium of nine Federal agencies to coordinate a  single unified environmental review document for each project analysis.   It is also modeled on provisions sponsored by House Democrats that  expedited improvements on the Hetch Hetchy dam serving the San  Francisco region. This bill simply says, if there is a potential  project on Interior or Agriculture Department lands, then the Bureau of  Reclamation will be the coordinating agency for the permits. That is a  one-stop permitting agency.   It will call together all of the agencies, the local and State  jurisdictions and tribal governments of our Indian nations, establish a  timeframe for studying decisionmaking, and then coordinate all the  reviews and analyses and opinions and statements and permits or  licenses and other Federal approvals required under Federal law.   It also requires transparency, assuring that all data is available to  the public online so the science guiding these decisions can be  rigorously scrutinized by all interested parties.   It also allows water agencies to fund the review process if Federal  funding isn't provided, removing one of the excuses that Federal  agencies have made in slow-walking or stalling project reviews.   I want to make this very clear: It does not bypass or alter or waive  any environmental or safety laws. It doesn't waive CEQ or ESA or NEPA  or any other law. It simply says the process needs to be more  efficient, and the government agencies should coordinate and cooperate  with each other rather than talking past each other as isolated and  often inscrutable fiefdoms.   Five years of drought in California brought entire cities within  months of exhausting their water supplies. The epic drought has now  been followed with the wettest year on record, and we have helplessly  watched our dams spilling millions of acre-feet of water to the ocean  because we have no place to store the excess for the next drought.   Perhaps that is nature's way of reminding us that, if we didn't store  water in wet years, we won't have it during dry ones, and the economic  and social devastation have been immense.     Mr. Chair, if you want to misuse our environmental  laws to block any new water storage, well, then you should vote against  this bill. We will continue to see increasingly severe water shortages  and spiralling water and electricity bills.   But if you want to preserve our environmental laws, you ought to be  supporting this bill because it places those laws back within a  workable and practical framework, and it places our society back on the  road to an era of abundance where our children can enjoy green lawns  and gardens, brightly lit homes, and abundant and affordable groceries  from America's agricultural cornucopia.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, first I would point out to my friend  from California, if the climate continues to warm, we are not going to  be able to store as much water in our mountains as snow, and we are  going to need much more surface water storage reservoirs than the laws  have allowed us to build because of the delays they have imposed in  planning and construction.   The gentleman's amendment gives the Secretary of the Interior the  ability to ignore this streamlining law if he determines it could  ``cause harm to commercial fisheries.''   Well, now, remember, this bill makes no changes to any of our  existing laws or regulations. It makes no changes to the licenses and  permits required for a project or the criteria for obtaining those  licenses and permits. It makes no changes to any law or regulation that  could affect commercial fisheries or, for that matter, anything else.   It simply says that the agencies and jurisdictions involved with  these projects have to cooperate and coordinate and communicate with  each other, and it requires the science guiding these decisions to be  available to the public to review and scrutinize.   So why the amendment? Well, for one reason and one reason only, I  think, because for the last 8 years, we have had an administration that  was actively hostile to constructing new reservoirs. That  administration has used the fragmented nature of the approval process  as a way to delay projects indefinitely. That is what this proposal  corrects.   Mr. Lowenthal's amendment would allow any administration so inclined  to make a specious finding as an excuse to ignore this law. Project  applicants would not know from one election to the next whether their  millions of dollars of studies and investments would suddenly come to  naught, and projects already well along in the planning and approval  process could find their efforts coming to a screeching halt.   For our laws to work, they must be predictable and fair. Mr.  Lowenthal's amendment is a poison pill to render this law unpredictable  and capricious.   The irony is this: the gentleman's constituents in southern  California have the most to lose from his amendment because southern  California depends on surplus water from northern California. And let  me make this very clear to the gentleman and his constituents: northern  California has first claim on northern California water.   If we can't store the extra water in the north, there is no surplus  for the south, and the gentleman's constituents can look forward to  dead lawns and gardens, brown parks, empty swimming pools, astronomical  water and electricity prices, spiraling grocery prices, and a future  where they will have to ration and stretch every drop of water and  every watt of electricity in their parched and sweltering homes. They  might want to ask him about that some day.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Chairman, I would first point out that commercial  fisheries are controlled and regulated by the Secretary of Commerce,  not the Secretary of the Interior, and yet it is the Secretary of the  Interior to whom the gentleman would give the power to ignore this  streamlining law and impose endless, repetitive, and duplicative delays  in the consideration of these projects.   I would again point out that all of the considerations that are given  to fisheries, that are given to environmental laws, that are given to  engineering laws, everything that goes into the planning process in our  dams under  [[Page H5091]]  our laws and regulations is fully respected under this measure.   All that it does is say that the agency, that the Bureau of  Reclamation, when an application is provided, will pull these agencies  together, and all of the jurisdictions and all of the affected parties  establish a timetable according to their best judgment of what is  necessary, have them talk with each other, and then stick to that plan.   That is what the bill does, and that is why it is so desperately  needed in a State that has not built a major reservoir of over a  million acre-fee of storage since the New Melones was completed in  1979.    Mr. Chair, by that token, I will include in the  Record the support of the United States Chamber of Commerce as well as  the Family Farm Alliance and others in support of this bill and the  jobs that will expand as a result of its adoption.                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                      Washington, DC, June 20, 2017.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce urges you to approve H.R. 1654, the       ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act,'' which would       streamline the permitting process for new surface water       storage projects. The Chamber may consider including votes       on, or in relation to, H.R. 1654 in our annual How They Voted       scorecard.        H.R. 1654 would establish the Bureau of Reclamation as the       lead agency for coordinating environmental reviews and       permitting new or expanded non-federal surface storage       facilities. The bill also would allow the Secretary of the       Interior to accept funds from non-federal public entities and       to use those funds to expedite the permitting process for       designated projects. This type of coordination and       streamlining is essential to the development and construction       of much-needed water storage projects.        The structure of H.R. 1654 tracks the permit streamlining       provisions contained in Title 41 of the Fixing America's       Surface Transportation Act, which was passed during the 114th       Congress. The Chamber urges you to approve H.R. 1654.            Sincerely,                                                   Neil L. Bradley,      Senior Vice President & Chief Policy Officer.                                   ____                                             Family Farm Alliance,                                   Klamath Falls, OR, March 8, 2017.      Hon. Tom McClintock,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman McClintock: On behalf of the Family Farm       Alliance (Alliance), we write to express our support for your       ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act''. This important       legislation would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to       coordinate Federal and State permitting processes related to       the construction of new surface water storage projects on       lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior       and the Secretary of Agriculture and to designate the Bureau       of Reclamation as the lead agency for permit processing, and       for other purposes.        The Alliance is a grassroots organization of family       farmers, ranchers, irrigation districts and allied industries       in 16 Western states. Several of our members are mutual ditch       and irrigation districts. The Alliance is focused on one       mission: To ensure the availability of reliable, affordable       irrigation water supplies to Western farmers and ranchers.        The ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act'' provides a       critical first step towards addressing current regulatory and       bureaucratic challenges that many times will delay or even       halt the development of new water supply enhancement projects       in the Western United States. The recent drought has ramped       up much-needed Congressional interest to enact legislation       that will allow Western water providers to better manage and       prepare for future dry times. Now, the heaviest rain in a       decade has overwhelmed parts of the West Coast, underscoring       the critical importance of having modernized and enhanced       water storage infrastructure in place to optimize water       resources management for the future.        Family Farm Alliance members rely on the traditional water       and power infrastructure built over the last century to       deliver irrigation water supplies vital to their farming       operations. Our membership has been advocating for new water       storage facilities for over twenty years, and we have       provided specific recommendations to Congress and the White       House on how to streamline restrictive federal regulations to       help make these projects happen.        As you are aware, developing new water storage projects is       much easier said than done. For many reasons--political,       economic and social--the construction of traditional surface       water storage projects is undertaken on a much more limited       basis than in decades past. Even if federal authorization and       funding, or funding from non-federal sources, is secured for       a new storage project, the existing procedures for permitting       the development of additional water supplies can make project       approval incredibly burdensome.        By the time project applicants approach federal agencies       for permits to construct multimillion dollar projects they       have already invested extensive resources toward analyzing       project alternatives to determine which project is best       suited to their budgetary constraints. However, current       procedure dictates that federal agencies formulate another       list of project alternatives which the applicant must assess,       comparing potential impacts with the preferred alternative.       These alternatives often conflict with state law or are       simply not implementable in the first place yet valuable       resources are required to be expended to further study these       additional alternatives in the federal permitting process.        Thus, we strongly support your bill. We look forward to       working with you, the 115th Congress and other interested       parties to build a consensus for improving the federal       regulatory and permitting process. If we don't find a way to       restore water supply reliability for Western irrigated       agriculture through a combination of new water supply and       management infrastructure, other water supply enhancement       efforts and demand management--our country's ability to feed       and clothe itself and the world will be jeopardized.        This bill takes an important step towards addressing this       critical need. I encourage you or your staff to contact Dan       Keppen if you have any questions.            Sincerely,      Patrick O'Toole,        President.      Dan Keppen,        Executive Director.  [[Page H5093]]                                          ____                                          Association of California                                                  Water Agencies,                                                      June 19, 2017.      Re Support for H.R. 1654.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The       Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA) is pleased to       support H.R. 1654, the ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination       Act''. ACWA's 450 public water agency members supply over 90       percent of the water delivered in California for residential,       agricultural, and industrial uses.        As demonstrated by California's recent historic drought, it       is important that Congress take actions now that help ensure       California has sufficient water supplies for the future. Had       the streamlining provisions contained in H.R. 1654 been in       effect prior to the drought, California's water       infrastructure and water supplies could have been improved to       help mitigate much of the current personal and economic       suffering that occurred.        Moreover, H.R. 1654 is consistent with policy principles       ACWA has formally adopted embracing environmental and       economic sustainability as co-equal priorities for water       management in California.        Thank you for this opportunity to express ACWA's support       for H.R. 1654.            Sincerely,                                                    David Reynolds,      Director of Federal Relations.                                   ____                                                  Voith Hydro Inc.                                            York, PA, June 20, 2017.      Hon. Tom McClintock,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman McClintock: On behalf of Voith Hydro, I am       writing today to extend our strong support for H.R. 1654, the       Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act. Voith Hydro is a       manufacturer of hydroelectric equipment and technology based       in York, Pennsylvania. Additionally, we have Voith Hydro       Services facilities located in Chattanooga, Tennessee and       Springfield, Oregon. Voith Hydro currently employees       approximately 680 workers across the United States. Water       storage issues are critical to our ability to provide both       the energy and jobs that sustain a nation.        As you are well aware, water provides multiple benefits to       communities across the country. Without an abundant supply of       water storage in the United States, hydropower production       cannot reach its full potential. These same communities have       been able to thrive in large part due to abundant water       supplies and the production of renewable hydropower,       especially in your home district in Northern California.       Increasing water storage throughout the country will allow       for better management during drought conditions, and thus       prevent power outages to communities reliant on       hydroelectricity.        Streamlining the permitting process to expand and develop       new water storage throughout the United States is critical to       increasing and upgrading our Country's infrastructure. I am       pleased to see that Congress continues to consider bills       targeted to improve the permitting processes and hope that       other infrastructure permitting streamlining continues,       especially as it concerns hydropower development.        I encourage the passage of the Water Supply Permitting Act       this week in the House of Representatives and look forward to       working with you on similar issues in the future. Thank you       for your leadership on water storage and other critical       issues.            Sincerely,                                                   Robert J. Gallo,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                            Municipal Water District                                                of Orange County,                                  Fountain Valley, CA, May 30, 2017.      Hon. Tom McClintock,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman McClintock: The Municipal Water District       of Orange County (MWDOC) is pleased to support your measure,       H.R. 1654--``The Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act.''       We applaud your efforts to streamline the permitting process       that relates to the construction of new surface water storage       projects on lands. This coordination is long overdue and will       ultimately benefit the entire state.        The rains this past winter emphasized the critical need       California has for surface water storage. We cannot let this       resource slip out to the ocean due to lack of places to put       it. Allowing the Bureau of Reclamation to be the coordinating       agency for projects on Interior or Department of Agriculture       lands will make the process more efficient and speed up the       process for critical water infrastructure projects in our       state.        The Municipal Water District of Orange County (MWDOC), a       water agency serving the needs of more than two million       residents and 28 retail water agencies, voted unanimously to       support your legislation and to assist with its passage.        On behalf of the MWDOC Board of Directors, we are pleased       to support H.R. 1654 and sincerely thank you for your efforts       to address the ongoing water infrastructure needs in       California.        Should you have any questions regarding this matter, lease       feel free to contact either Jim Barker, our advocate in       Washington, or MWDOC General Manager, Rob Hunter.            Sincerely,                                                  Wayne S. Osborne,                                                   Board President.     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
