 Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to the chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus, I appreciate this honor and this  opportunity, as well as all the other Members, for giving me this  opportunity to kick off the second session of the Congressional Black  Caucus Special Order hours.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, including any  extraneous material, on the subject of this order.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues, as I  said earlier, for this opportunity. This is truly an opportunity for a  young man who comes from the city of Philadelphia, who grew up in the  streets of Philadelphia, and who had the opportunity to be a product of  the public school system, a product of community college and La Salle  University, standing here today in the seat with many of my  predecessors, five African Americans from the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania, starting off with Robert N.C. Nix.   Our theme tonight is the history of the CBC and the legacy of Martin  Luther King. Next week we begin the celebration of the birthday of  Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King.   Dr. King was not only a great man but a great patriot, who loved  America and the ideas of the underpinning of our democracy.   To kick off our discussion, I want to open up with two Dr. King  comments that really capture our current political climate and what is  at stake. The first quote is: ``We may have come over here on different  ships, but we are all in the same boat now.'' Dr. King.   The second quote is: ``Of all forms of inequality, injustice in  healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane.'' Dr. Martin Luther King.   When we think about this great Nation and our leaders before us like  Dr. King, who came together to lay a framework for equal pay, fair  wages, healthcare, equality in housing, so much more we are reminded of  what is at stake and how much we have to lose in this current political  climate. We have a lot to lose under the current administration's  destructive policies.   Dr. King would be greatly disappointed at many things going on in  this country right now that affects all of our communities.   We are in the business of doing no harm, but we must continue to  fight to show results and solutions to help move our neighborhoods  forward. Dr. King fought to move our neighborhoods forward when the  odds were stacked against him. There are many examples of his life,  legacy, and lasting impact in the city of Philadelphia, which is in the  Second Congressional District.   Take, for example, the Dr. King memorial and mural at 40th and  Lancaster Avenue--he had a rally of 10,000 people when Dr. King was  there--and the yearly luncheon that the late C. Delores Tucker  sponsored in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King.   It is important to recognize his connection to Pennsylvania and the  divinity school in Chester in Delaware County.   Dr. King came many times to the city of Philadelphia and to the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He had a huge influence on a lot of us.    On this April 4, 50 years later, when I was in junior high school,  entering high school in 1968, he had a huge affect on me. He was  someone who walked with kings and queens. He demonstrated to all of us  with that message of peace. He was relentless in terms of standing up  for freedom and justice. He showed all of us what it is to be a leader.   You will hear, over the next 60 minutes, a number of my colleagues  who have all either directly or indirectly been connected with Dr.  Martin Luther King and what he has meant.   We need to conduct this as a large teach-in. That is what this should  be. This should be a teach-in so we can share with everybody in this  country what Dr. King was about and the importance.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond),  the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our chairman, and that is why  he is our chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, because you just  heard him so eloquently express his thoughts and his feelings. He has  done a fantastic job as the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus,  and I thank him. I always recognize the importance of what he brings to  all of us.   The gentleman is correct about the next person. I want to add my  voice to what he just said. I was 11 years old when he went across the  Edmund Pettus Bridge. I recall seeing it on CBS. I did not understand  it, but, now, like the chairman, I serve in this body with him. I am a  part of this body. And as I watch him and as I listen to him, all of  the drive and the energy that he has--and he is always extremely  positive. I have not met a person who is more positive and optimistic  about the future of this country as he says and talks about walking in  his shoes. I remember that he said that.   I remember that opportunity when I was down in Alabama on that Edmund  Pettus Bridge--along with him and my good friend and colleague from  Alabama, Terri Sewell--that I thought to myself, I said: ``Self, here I  am with Congressman Lewis.'' He is someone who is renowned in this body  and in this country and around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Speaker, I hope that what we just heard, and to our  chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, that we can, either through  social media or whatever way, share that that was a learning experience  that just took place. To have Congressman Lewis, who was there, who was  on the front lines, who is not talking about something he read but  something he has demonstrated through his own experience, that all of  us--not just the Congressional Black Caucus, but this entire House-- should thank him for his service and for being a patriot and for what  he has expressed.   So I personally want to thank the Honorable John Lewis for taking  that opportunity just to educate us, because we all need education, and  we are never too wise to think we don't need someone to talk to us.   Speaking of education, another good colleague from the great State of  Texas--I know a little bit about that State. Everything is big in that  State, they tell me. She is in a seat that Congresswoman Jordan used to  hold, and Mickey Leland, and she, in her own right, is doing a lot. I  have watched her in the period of time I have been here, just a year.  She is a fantastic person, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, from the  18th Congressional District of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?                                time  1945     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, the next person I would like to yield to, my  colleague from Texas gave a great lead-in for her, from the great State  of California, as Dr. King stood up against the Vietnam war. She knows  a little bit about standing up.   If you know anything about Honorable Barbara Lee from the 13th  Congressional District, you would know she doesn't mind being by  herself.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the great State of  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms.  Sewell). I just had the pleasure of really meeting her this year. She  has a lot of energy and a lot of drive. She got me to go to Alabama,  and I had never been to Alabama before. But after her personality, her  drive, and her intellectual curiosity, and between her and John Lewis,  what could I say?    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Payne). Congressman Donald Payne is a neighbor across the Walt Whitman  Bridge or the Ben Franklin Bridge. I have known him and his father, and  he has done a great job in the Garden State.    Mr. Speaker, we had the gentleman from the East. Now we  will go to the West, to someone whom I have watched. She is an educator  and is always teaching.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), who  is from the Third Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, thank my colleague for those eloquent  words and those comments which were very succinct and provided a lot  for us.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus  for allowing me to have this opportunity to speak, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 23 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, January 9, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
