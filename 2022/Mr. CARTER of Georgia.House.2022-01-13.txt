 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Clarence Morgan the longtime county recreation director for  Effingham County.   Clarence started with the department in 1980 and worked until he was  promoted to director in 2001. His passion for health and wellness,  including promoting an active lifestyle for community members,  culminated in his development of the Effingham County Recreation  Department.   With limited resources and hard work, Clarence managed to grow the  program into one of the top programs in the State. In 2020, the brand  new, state-of-the-art gym was opened and named in his honor.   Known by all for his integrity and great strength of character,  Clarence dedicated his life to ensuring a brighter, healthier future  for Effingham County residents. The department that he re-ignited is a  testament to his life's work. Our State and our community will forever  remember the life and legacy of Clarence Morgan.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family and his friends as we  mourn the loss of this great Georgian.                            ____________________
