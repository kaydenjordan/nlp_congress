 Madam President, I wish to commend the Senator from Indiana  for bringing our attention to this important subject. It is important  in all of our States. Career technical education is an incredibly  important part of helping to grow our economy, so I wish to express my  appreciation to the Senator from Indiana for his leadership on this  issue.                                  Healthcare    Madam President, I rise to speak about a different issue; that is,  healthcare and what is happening to the Affordable Care Act and to the  availability of healthcare and health insurance in our society.   I rise genuinely puzzled about what appears to be an obsession or a  mania with removing health insurance from  [[Page S5405]]  people, with keeping people from having health insurance. I just don't  get it.   The data is very clear over the years that having health insurance  saves lives. There can be debate about exactly how many, but the  reality is--and it is perfectly logical--if you have health insurance,  you are more likely to be treated, you are more likely to be treated  earlier, and you are more likely to survive, particularly with regard  to diseases like cancer, where early detection and treatment is the  best defense against this dread disease.   I just don't understand why we cannot face the reality that health  insurance or health coverage or access to healthcare is a fundamental  right. It is a fundamental part of being a human. The idea of rationing  healthcare by wealth just doesn't make sense, particularly in a country  committed, as we are, to equality and equal justice under law.   The other reason I am surprised at this continuing effort to  undermine the Affordable Care Act is that its eventual sabotage will  only lead to greater demands for some kind of more intrusive change to  our healthcare system--a single-payer system or healthcare for all.  There are already millions of people in this country building a  political movement to support Medicare for all, which is essentially a  single-payer system. So those who are trying to cripple the Affordable  Care Act, which really was a conservative proposal from the 1980s and  1990s, are only paving the way for a much more radical transformation  of our healthcare system than they would ever desire.   The ACA simply builds upon the current system we have of private  health insurance and provides health insurance to those who aren't  fortunate enough to work for a company that provides a subsidy for  health insurance or provides health insurance to its employees. That is  all it is. It is really an effort to fill the gap in this country  between those who have insurance through their employer or through  Medicare or through Medicaid and those who have no insurance.   The ACA was a remarkable success for a period of years because it  vastly cut the number of uninsured people in this country. So why we  are trying to kill it, to strangle it, to mug it, to sabotage it just  doesn't make sense from any point of view--either from the point of  view of providing healthcare and health insurance to people, which  saves lives, or the point of view of trying to maintain the semblance  of the current system.   So here we are in the midst of an ongoing attempt to basically  sabotage this system. Back in October of 2017, the administration said  they are no longer going to make cost-sharing reduction payments to  help insurance companies provide lower copays and deductibles to low- income individuals. Premium increases. I sat on this floor and listened  to Members decry premium increases because of the Affordable Care Act.  This is an action which is sure to provide premium increases, and it  was a voluntary action of the administration taken last fall.   Back in January of 2017, within weeks of taking office, one of the  first things the new administration did was cut advertising to notify  people of the availability of reasonably priced insurance under the  Affordable Care Act--an initial step to cut access.   Of course, leading up to the tax filing deadline in 2016, for 2016  returns back last year, the administration said the IRS was no longer  going to enforce the individual mandate.   Then, of course, this body, in a provision which I can only deem as  cruel because of the effect on insurance premiums and the effect on the  insurance market, generally, eliminated the individual mandate as part  of the tax bill last December.   In 2018, the open enrollment period was reduced from 12 weeks to 6-- cut in half. No reason was given. Let's cut it in half so fewer people  can sign up. Interestingly, almost the same number of people signed up  because they realized how important this is.   Then, last winter, during the open enrollment season, HHS, on  Sundays, shut down the website where people can sign up, ostensibly for  maintenance. It happened to be the 12 hours on a Sunday when most  people would have an opportunity to navigate the website.   Speaking of navigation, in, I think, what is one of the most blatant  attempts to sabotage and undermine people's ability to gain this most  basic and important health insurance--to provide them with healthy  lives--CMS recently announced they are cutting grant funding for  navigators, the people who help people get the coverage. They cut it  dramatically. It has gone from $62.5 million to $36 million, to $10  million.   This is complicated stuff. I have gone on the website myself in order  to get my coverage. As the Presiding Officer knows, we are in the  Affordable Care Act. We have to go on the website. We have to get our  care through it. If you have done it, you know it is hard. It is  complicated. You are comparing policies. You are comparing deductibles.  You are comparing premiums. It is a difficult, complicated process. The  navigators I know in Maine have been enormously helpful in just guiding  people through the process so they don't give up, and they end up  getting healthcare and health insurance for the first time in their  lives. The amount of funding available in Maine has been reduced from  $550,000 to $100,000. It was cut by 80 percent. This is just arbitrary  and cruel because the result is--which is, I guess, what they want-- that fewer people will be able to access coverage.   It also said the navigators no longer need to be based in the State  where they are working. That means you can't go to on-the-ground  efforts or face-to-face efforts, and that is what often makes the  difference.   The Department of Justice last month said they are not going to  defend the patient protections in the Affordable Care Act--particularly  preexisting conditions. This has enormous ramifications for the people  of this country. About half the people in the country have preexisting  conditions. Under the old law--not in Maine, I might add; Maine dealt  with this issue years ago. Under the old law, in most of the country,  an insurance company could either deny you outright for a preexisting  condition--which is basically any time you had been sick previously in  your life--they could either deny you coverage or charge you an  outrageous rate, which is, in effect, a denial of coverage for so many  people.   Finally, the administration is now pressing what they are calling  short-term association plans, which are really largely junk insurance-- insurance that is hardly useful, doesn't cover everything, has very  high deductibles, and really gives people a feeling that they have  insurance, but when it comes time to use it, it will not really provide  coverage.   I would like to conclude with this picture of these wonderful people  from Maine whom I was with last week. I don't know who this guy in the  middle is, but these are the people who staff something called the  Leavitt's Mill Free Health Plan. Every single person in this picture,  with the exception of one part-time administrator, are volunteers.  These are people coming in and volunteering. They are nurse  practitioners, physicians who come in and volunteer for a couple of  hours a week to provide healthcare to people who don't have insurance.   I just talked to the director, Patsy Levin. She repeated what she  said to me when I was there last week: They want to go out of business.  We can't provide healthcare to the millions of uninsured people of this  country by volunteers. It is wonderful, what they are doing, but it is  impossible. This is like having bake sales to support the Air Force.   We have to provide health insurance to people. We will have a  healthier country. We will have a more productive country. We will have  a more economically successful country. We will have a more humane  country.   These people are fantastic. I spent time there. I visited with one of  their clients. He has to go to town assistance to buy his insulin. That  is wrong. He needs it. He is a diabetic. It is part of what he has to  have to survive, and he is having to go for general assistance to the  town to provide the lifesaving insulin that he needs.   These are wonderful people. They are doing great work, but we  shouldn't have to rely on people taking their own time, their own  energy voluntarily, to come in. It is wonderful for this region where  it exists. There are several of these around Maine and they are  terrific, but they can't fill the need. They can't fill the need for  the millions of  [[Page S5406]]  people who are uninsured in this country.   We have a responsibility. We have a responsibility when we see a  problem to fix it. I know the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. I  know it has problems. I know it has limitations. We should be fixing  it, not sabotaging it.   As I said at the beginning, if the sabotage is ultimately successful,  the result will be heightened demand for more radical restructuring of  our healthcare system in this country because, ultimately, people are  going to rightfully demand that they have a right to health insurance  and to healthcare coverage and access to healthcare that is not  dependent upon their income.   So I call on the administration to stop these petty efforts to  undermine this law that has done so much good, and let's come together  and talk about what the problems are. I know Members on this side are  absolutely ready to do so.   Let's talk about fixing it, not continue to undermine it--to what  purpose? To a purpose of diminishing healthcare access to millions and  millions of Americans, not only those at the low end of the income  spectrum but particularly those in the middle income who aren't  fortunate enough to have coverage through where they work.   We can do better. I believe we will. I hope the administration will  join us in this effort instead of continuing its efforts to  systematically undermine the law that is working for the American  people.   I yield the floor.
