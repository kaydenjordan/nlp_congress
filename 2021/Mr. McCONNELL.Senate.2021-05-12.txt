 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a one-party takeover of our political  system--that is what Senate Democrats brought to the Rules Committee  just yesterday, their side's top priority for multiple years now.  [[Page S2465]]    The supposed rationales for the bill continue to change. A few years  ago, when majorities of Democrats were mistakenly convinced that  foreigners had hacked voting machines and tampered with tallies in  2016, this was marketed as an election security bill. But it keeps  morphing to suit new headlines. Lately, it has been called a racial  justice bill. Some Senators say it is really a response to some recent  State-level legislation, even though their bill predates those bills by  multiple years.   A partisan power grab in search of a justification--that is what we  have here. Voter turnout last November was the highest in decades.  African-American turnout was twice as high in Mississippi as it was in  Massachusetts. Democrats' hysterical attacks against the new election  law in the State of Georgia have been dismantled even by typically  left-leaning fact checkers.   There is no crisis. Our Democratic friends just want the power to  rewire our democracy on a partisan basis. S. 1 would take the Federal  Election Commission--the bipartisan panel that regulates elections and  private citizens' speech--and make it a partisan body run by the  Democrats.   It would let Washington Democrats act like a nationwide board of  elections on steroids, neutering popular things like voter ID and  forcing legalized ballot harvesting onto all 50 States. This bill would  let bureaucrats snoop around more in free speech; attack citizens'  privacy so dramatically that even the liberal ACLU is unhappy; and even  send public funds--get this: public funds--directly to politicians.   Republicans put forward amendments to fix those things. If Democrats  had wanted real, bipartisan solutions, Republicans were there, right at  the table, and ready, but Democrats voted us down. They wouldn't even  let us redirect any of that public money to the opioid crisis. They  wanted that cash for their own campaigns.   This partisan power grab failed to advance out of committee for the  same reason it must never ever become law as currently written. It will  shatter public confidence in our democracy if the Democratic Party  decides it can rig the rules                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a different matter, yet again,  air raid sirens have been sounding in Israel. Israeli civilians have  been huddling in basements, shelters, and hospital stairwells. Hamas  rocket attacks are lighting up the skies, hitting buildings, and  terrorizing, injuring, and killing innocent people. Of course, Hamas  and Palestinian Islamic jihad receive significant support from Iran.   Fortunately, a remarkable percentage of the incoming rockets have  been intercepted in midair by Israel's Iron Dome system. Americans  should take some pride of our own in defending our friends with these  high-tech defenses, which we have helped Israel bring online and have  advanced our own joint missile defense efforts at the same time.  Missile defense is expensive but vital. It is yet another reason I am  concerned with this administration's intention to underfund defense.   Whatever complaints Palestinians have with Israel's Government,  wanton violence against civilians is completely and totally  inexcusable. This is barbaric terrorism, not a legitimate protest; nor  is it legitimate for Israel's obsessive critics to suggest any  equivalency whatsoever between these inexcusable attacks and Israel's  measured and quite targeted response against terrorists.   Yesterday here in Washington, street protesters screamed--listen to  this--``Israel is a terrorist state.'' On the streets of Washington,  they screamed: ``Israel is a terrorist state.'' Some Democratic Members  of Congress echoed that rhetoric almost exactly.   Look, the State of Israel has every right of self-defense. Its  national security leaders have continued to display restraint and  invest so much in precision and avoiding civilian casualties. That has  been the approach of the Israeli Government.   Israel must know that their friends and allies here in the United  States stand with them as they seek to restore deterrence, that we  support their right to peace and security, and that we will not relax  our efforts to hold terrorists and terrorists' supporters to account.                            ____________________     Now one final matter, Mr. President. This morning, I  will be joining three other congressional leaders to meet with  President Biden at the White House. There is certainly no shortage of  important business to discuss.   The President campaigned on a promise that his agenda would unite a  divided nation. And he inherited a favorable situation. Vaccines were  flooding America. Science had proven schools can reopen. Job openings  were beginning to pile up.   Republicans sought to continue the 2020 bipartisan streak on COVID  relief, but our new President and our Democratic colleagues preferred a  one-party approach. They used the end of the pandemic to pass what the  President's own staff admitted--admitted--was ``the most progressive  bill in American history.'' Not exactly shopping for consensus.   Republicans were upfront with our concerns. We said these old liberal  ideas would slow rehiring, slow down the reopening, and stoke  inflation. Of course, just a few minutes ago, the Bureau of Labor  Statistics published the most dramatic monthly inflation report in more  than a decade. Many of the things American families buy have grown more  expensive at a dizzying pace. Last week's incredibly disappointing jobs  report showed what happens when Washington taxes working people to pay  other people more to stay home.   I am going to discuss these and other concerns with the President  today, but I also hope we can begin to come together on pressing issues  that should actually unite us.   The last time Congress took comprehensive action on surface  transportation infrastructure, 83 Senators signed on. By the way, that  bill was produced by Senator Boxer, myself, and Senator Inhofe--a  totally bipartisan effort across broad ideological lines. The last time  we drilled down on water resources, the margin was 92 to 6.  Infrastructure can and should be a bipartisan issue; the same for  supporting working families; the same for supporting our national  defense.   If the President can remember that he promised to govern for all  Americans, not just the far left, if my Democratic friends can remember  they have just a 50-50 Senate and a closely divided House--not exactly  a sweeping mandate for a socialist agenda--there is much we can deliver  together for the country.   I hope today marks the start of a new course correction from this  White House and a more successful dialogue across party lines. That is  what Americans need, and that is what they deserve.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
