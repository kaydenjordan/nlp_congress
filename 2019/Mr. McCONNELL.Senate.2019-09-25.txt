 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday evening, Speaker Pelosi  announced that the House of Representatives will begin what she called  ``an official impeachment inquiry.'' But, really, we know that House  Democrats have been indulging their impeachment obsession for nearly 3  years now--a never-ending impeachment parade in search of a rationale.   The very day President Trump was inaugurated, the Washington Post ran  a news story with this headline: ``The campaign to impeach President  Trump has begun.'' That was the day of his inauguration. Later that  year, there were articles of impeachment introduced over the  President's language. So clearly, this has been an ongoing project for  House Democrats since practically the moment that Secretary Clinton  lost the election.   For months, Democrats insisted that Special Counsel Mueller's  investigation or the work of the Senate Intelligence Committee would  prove their theories about a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and  Russia. It didn't happen. The facts disappointed them, but the  impeachment parade kept marching along.   Yesterday, even though a bipartisan committee investigation into the  new whistleblower allegations is underway--and just hours after the  President offered to publicize the details of his phone call with the  President of Ukraine--the dam finally broke. Speaker Pelosi couldn't  hold back the far left any longer. Before any of us even had the facts  in hand, she caved to the left and announced an impeachment inquiry.   If this all sounds familiar, that is because at the time--literally,  1 week ago--the same Democrats were shouting about impeaching Justice  Kavanaugh. That rush to judgment was based on a sketchy story in a  major newspaper that promptly had to publish an enormous correction.  But 1 week later, here they go again, threatening impeachment without  the facts in hand.   Senate Republicans support the established proper procedures for  considering this whistleblower report. In the meantime, while our  friends across the Capitol rush to judgment and dive  [[Page S5674]]  deeper into their nearly 3-year-old impeachment addiction, we will stay  focused on the American people's business.                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier this year, President Trump led  the Federal Government to recognize our insecure southern border for  what it is: a national emergency, a humanitarian and security crisis.  Congress had heard plea after plea for more border security funding. We  heard from senior leaders and career Border Patrol officers. We heard  about all the surging illegal crossings, the unprecedented numbers of  family units, and the strain on our facilities.   Yet Washington Democrats decided that giving this very real crisis  the resources it required might anger the far left, which wants them to  oppose President Trump at any cost. So the President tapped into a  longstanding, 40-plus-year-old Presidential authority and reprogrammed  a narrow set of funds to address the urgent crisis.   I have never been shy about my commitment to the institution of  Congress and its unique authorities, not the least being the  appropriation of taxpayer dollars. But we are talking about 40-plus- year-old Presidential authorities in current law. Unlike President  Obama, who vaguely shrugged off the Federal Code when he established  his DACA policy, President Trump's decision was squarely within  existing law. Nevertheless, our Democratic colleagues made the Senate  vote to undo the President's declaration back in March. Their  resolution fell far short of earning a veto-proof majority.   Now, still unwilling to work with the President and Republicans on a  long-term bipartisan solution for border security, Senate Democrats are  making us repeat the same show vote again.   I would urge all colleagues to once again vote for border security  and vote against the Democrats' resolution when it comes up later  today.   I understand the Democratic leadership would like to invent a false  choice between border security and other important military  construction projects. They want to tell the American people that we  can either have border security or these other important projects, but  for some reason, we can't have both.   There are two problems to that argument:   Problem No. 1 is that it is a false choice of Democrats' own  invention. The only reason there could be any tradeoff between border  security and these other priorities is their refusal to support  commonsense border security. The only reason there is any tradeoff is  that Democrats have refused to work with the President.   Problem No. 2 of their argument is that Congress has the full power  to ensure that all of the military construction projects are fully  funded. Work is ongoing on appropriations and the NDAA. It would be  easy to ensure that these projects get all of the money they need.   Later today, the Senate will vote on exactly that. We will vote on  several motions to instruct our NDAA conferees. One of those motions  will be a Republican proposal that we insist on fully funding these  projects for our own servicemembers.   With the Kentuckians I represent, this is pretty simple. Kentuckians  want our Nation to have a secure southern border. Kentuckians want full  funding for the middle school at Fort Campbell--funding they have been  waiting on for years, which is funding I proudly secured in the first  place. Kentuckians know perfectly well that with everything the United  States of America spends money on, there is no earthly reason the  Democrats should force us to have one or the other. They don't want to  be used as pawns in the Democrats' political games.   Even my Democratic colleagues who don't support the administration's  border security agenda should not take out their frustrations on our  Armed Forces. Every single Member of this body should be able to  support the measure to fully fund military construction. I would urge  all of my colleagues to vote yes on that motion later today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 450.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  disposition of the resolutions to instruct on S. 1790, the Senate  proceed to executive session and vote on the motions to invoke cloture  on the Hyten and Scalia nominations in the order filed; further, that  the mandatory quorum calls be waived.    Mr. President, great works of artistic expression are  so much more than something simply to look at or listen to. They are  often a reflection of the artist, her community, and a unique culture.  Kentuckian Cornelia Dozier Cooper recognizes the encouraging effect of  creative works, and she has spent her lifetime promoting them in  eastern Kentucky. It is a privilege to recognize my dear friend  Cornelia, who was recently selected to receive our Commonwealth's  highest artistic honor: the Milner Award. In tribute to her  accomplishment and philanthropy, I would like to extend my sincere  congratulations for this well-deserved honor.   Born in Madisonville, KY, Cornelia developed a passion for the arts  at an early age. Supported by her parents and a fostering education,  she grew her skills in both visual and musical arts. She was quickly  recognized for her talent and studied English watercolor at the  prestigious Oxford University. I have had the privilege to visit  Cornelia's home, where I admired her beautiful watercolors up close.  Her own artistic works, in which she hopes to display the glory of  God's creation, were just the beginning of her contributions to  Kentucky.   With her husband, Richard Cooper--brother to another outstanding  Kentuckian, Senator John Sherman Cooper--Cornelia's devotion to the  arts extended far beyond her own brush and canvas. She sought to give  her fellow Kentuckians the opportunity to create great works of art and  to be inspired by them in their communities. Cornelia worked with  several organizations, including as a founding member of the Kentucky  Arts Council, promoting aspiring talents in her home of Pulaski County  and throughout the Commonwealth. She also established the Cornelia  Dozier Cooper Endowment Fund for the Arts, providing grants to support  a variety of eastern Kentucky artists. The endowment is funded, in  part, by the proceeds from the sale of her own watercolors.   At a ceremony in the Kentucky Capitol Rotunda, surrounded by artistic  works celebrating the Bluegrass State's illustrious history, Cornelia  received her Milner Award. Even at the age of 93 Cornelia still brings  the same enthusiasm to promoting young artists. To many throughout  Kentucky, she is a mentor and a creative inspiration. Her selfless  philanthropy will certainly continue to encourage young artists to  develop their talents and follow their passions. I am grateful to  Cornelia for her friendship and her lifetime spent enriching our home  State. She has certainly earned this distinction. I ask my Senate  colleagues to join me in congratulating this remarkable Kentuckian,  Cornelia Dozier Cooper.                            ____________________
