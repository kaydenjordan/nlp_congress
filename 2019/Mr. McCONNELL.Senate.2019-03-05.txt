 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday the Senate voted to advance  the nomination of Allison Jones Rushing to serve on the Fourth Circuit  Court of Appeals.   As I noted yesterday, Ms. Rushing comes with significant appellate  experience and has filed 47 briefs in the U.S. Supreme Court. It is  clear to me, as it was to a majority of our colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee, that she would make a fine addition to the Federal bench. So  I will support her confirmation later today, and I recommend that each  of our colleagues do the same.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Readler nomination expire at 4 p.m. on  Wednesday, March 6; further, that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, this year, the University of  Pikeville in my home State will mark its 130th year of service to  students in the mountains of central Appalachia. For more than half of  that time, a member of the Baird family has served the school, its  community, and most importantly, its students. After three decades of  service, Bill Baird recently retired from the UPIKE board of trustees.  In recognition of his legacy of leadership, mentorship, and  accomplishment, UPIKE President Burton J. Webb awarded my friend with  the inaugural Baird Family Service Award. So, I would like to take a  moment today to pay tribute to Bill Baird and his family for their  steadfast contributions to eastern Kentucky.   Bill's family is deeply rooted in this region with history going back  nearly a century. His father, William J. Baird II, grew up on a farm in  the Bluegrass State before attending Berea College. In 1947, William  hung a shingle, founding Baird & Baird law firm. Outside of his  professional success, William dedicated much of his life to  philanthropy and leadership, serving on the board of trustees of  Pikeville Community College for nearly three decades. In gratitude for  his service to the Pikeville community and the central Appalachian  region, William received an honorary doctor of humanities degree in  1977 from Pikeville College, UPIKE's name until 2011. Bill's mother,  Florane, attended the Pikeville Collegiate Institute, a high school  that later became part of the modern UPIKE. Through her care and  compassion for the community, Florane also received an honorary  doctorate from Pikeville College. Bill lovingly remembered them both as  service-oriented people, and their influence, paired with a deep faith,  inspired his work for the Pikeville community and the school.   Working in the mines while studying at Pikeville College, Bill  graduated in 1966. He later earned admission to the bar and served our  country in the U.S. Army. Reentering private life, Bill worked at the  family law firm and was eventually joined by his brothers, Charles and  John, and members of the family's next generation.   Even as he worked full time at Baird & Baird, Bill seemed to find  extra hours in the day for his community. With leadership roles at  UPIKE, in his church, and at Westcare of Kentucky--a substance abuse  treatment facility--Bill constantly gave of himself to others. He  coached the local high school's softball team for nearly two decades  and the UPIKE team from 1994-2004, even receiving admission into the  university's athletic hall of fame. After he retired from the practice,  Bill hardly slowed down. He did so much pro bono work that he quipped,  ``Some people say I'm the only retired person they know who comes in to  the office every day.''   When asked about his impact on the school, the chairman of UPIKE's  board said Bill gave ``of his time, talent, and treasure to the  university at a level few have ever given, and he has done so with an  unmatched sense of love and care.'' A great deal of Bill's support  focused on first-time college students from the local community to  foster the potential of Pikeville families. In addition to creating the  award named in the Baird family's honor, the board of trustees also  unanimously voted to establish the Bill Baird Family Scholarship to  improve student retention and to help provide for students who may  struggle to afford their education.   Bill's not the only impressive member of his household. Kaye, his  wife, spent much of her career contributing to the community, helping  lead organizations like the chamber of commerce, the school board, and  the Christian Appalachian Project. Excelling as an educator, she  touched the lives of numerous eastern Kentucky children and earned her  place in the inaugural class of UPIKE's Distinguished Educators Hall of  Fame.   Bill and Kaye have done so much for their community, with compassion,  philanthropy, and leadership. I am so proud to pay tribute to the Baird  family. They have earned our thanks and have made a lasting impact on  this region. I am glad the Baird family name has rightfully earned a  place of honor at UPIKE, and I ask each of my Senate colleagues to join  me in congratulating Bill and Kaye for a lifetime of dedicated service  to Kentucky.   The UPIKE Magazine published a profile on Bill's contributions to the  school. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    [From the UPIKE Magazine, Fall 2018]   The Baird Family Legacy: Bill Baird Honored for Embodiment of Service                             (By Mark Baggett)         ``Our dad was a great teacher in treating people right,''       says Bill Baird about his father, William J. Baird II, and       about the heart of the Baird family's long legacy of support       for UPIKE students.        Among the many stories of the family's support, a       remarkable statistic stands out: A Baird has been serving at       UPIKE for over half of the 129 years of its existence. During       the 2018 opening convocation ceremony, President Burton J.       Webb, Ph.D., honored UPIKE Trustee Emeritus Bill Baird with       the inaugural Baird Family Service Award, in recognition of       his remarkable impact on the lives of others through       steadfast service to the university, to the Appalachian       region and to all humanity.        ``In 2019, we will celebrate 130 years of service in the       mountains of Central Appalachia,'' says Webb. ``During that       span of time few families have impacted the college more than       the Baird family. Bill Baird has taken the legacy of servant       leadership from his mother, father, and brother even further.       He has been a softball coach, a friend of the university and       an ardent supporter of the university for decades.''        After more than 30 years of distinguished service Bill       Baird retired from the UPIKE Board of Trustees, which was       also served by Bill's father and brother, Charles. In       recognition of Bill Baird's indelible contributions, the       board voted unanimously to establish and fund the Bill Baird       Family Scholarship to improve student retention by filling       financial gaps for students.        ``You pick up the need down here,'' says Bill Baird.       ``There is a gap between the educated part of the community       and the working class such as the retired coal miners or       people on fixed incomes.''        UPIKE Board Chairman Terry L. Dotson has witnessed the       fruits of Bill Baird's selflessness for decades.        ``The entire Baird family is a treasure to Eastern Kentucky       and to the University of Pikeville,'' Dotson says. ``Bill is       an exceptional person in every way. He is someone every good       person strives to be. Bill cares about all things--his       church, family and community. He has been a special board       member who has fully given of his time, talent and treasure       to the university at a level few have ever given, and he has       done so with an unmatched sense of love and care. Bill is my       friend and has served our board with distinction.''        Dotson's sentiments are echoed by UPIKE Trustee Richard A.       Sturgill. ``Bill Baird has been an inspiration to me and many       others in the UPIKE community. His unwavering positive       attitude, his willingness to encourage and mentor the       students and his ability to always stand up for what is right       has been steadfast. I am thankful to call him my friend,''       says Sturgill.        Bill Baird says the university and medical and optometry       colleges are ``miracles.''        ``UPIKE is a light on the hill to this city, the region and       even nationally. To me, what we are is the answered prayers       for the many people who laid the foundation for this place by       praying for years. These are people who have sacrificed and       dedicated themselves to the university.''        Humbly, Bill Baird deflects the spotlight to his parents.       His father, who died in 1987, was raised on a Kentucky farm       and was a graduate of Berea College and Duke Law School (a       classmate of Richard Nixon). He also founded in 1947 the       Baird & Baird law firm in Pikeville where Bill Baird and his       brothers (Charles and John) as well as children,       grandchildren and in-laws also practice. Bill Baird's mother       Florane Justice Baird, who died in 2011, also had strong       Pikeville roots: She attended the Training School for grades       1-8 in Pikeville (which operated in the original college       building) and then the Pikeville Collegiate Institute for       high school, before going to the University of Kentucky.        ``My parents were very service-oriented people,'' says Bill       Baird. ``They were giving, caring people who gave back to       their community.''        Bill Baird started at Duke University as an undergraduate       and says he ``made an A in fraternity and an A in football,''       and soon he  [[Page S1656]]       returned to the Pikeville area and worked in the mines,       graduated from Pikeville college in 1966. He was admitted to       the Kentucky bar in 1969 and served in the U.S. Army from       1969-1971.        A life-transforming event happened to him in the spring of       1973 when heard the Rev. Ben Sheldon, who was then a       Presbyterian pastor in Washington, D.C., preach in Pikeville.        ``He started preaching the gospel of God's love,'' Baird       says of Sheldon, who later became a pastor in Pikeville. ``I       felt a personal love that He died for me. It was God's       timing.''        Baird went on to practice law in Pikeville, joking that       ``in Hatfield and McCoy country, folks can be litigious       here.'' He now describes his role as a ``sometime'' attorney,       not full-time nor part-time, who does pro bono work and helps       fill in for other attorneys at court appearances. ``Some       people say I'm the only retired person they know who comes in       to the office every day,'' he says.        He followed up on his short ``athletic'' career at Duke by       coaching softball at Pikeville High School from 1986-2004 and       at the university from 1994-2004. Today one of the family's       scholarships is dedicated to athletics, and Bill Baird       himself is a member of the university's Athletic Hall of       Fame.        Much of the family's UPIKE support is described by Bill       Baird as meeting the needs of first-time college students who       come from the community. He says he hopes the scholarships       will address larger gaps as well.        To meet additional need in his region, Bill Baird has been       actively involved in several faith-based groups and community       support programs. He has supported the Fellowship of       Christian Athletes program, provided devotional Bibles to       coaches and is Board Chairman of WestCare of Kentucky, Inc.,       which is involved in treatment of substance abuse.        Today, the Baird Family Circle is one of the granite inlays       of Benefactor's Plaza on campus. Acknowledging the recent       service award and scholarship fund honoring him at UPIKE,       Bill Baird says, ``Christ made the difference in my life. He       gave me an opportunity to serve in this way.''        He praises this year's fellow recipients of the Baird       Family Service award, UPIKE Trustee Gregory Pauley and his       wife, Kathryn, characterizing them as ``wonderful, caring       people,'' whose mobile home park neighborhood ministry is       just the kind of generosity and service embodied by the Baird       legacy.
