 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor Mujeres  Latinas en Accion on their 50th anniversary of serving and empowering  Latinas and their families in Chicago.   When it was founded in 1973 to offer support to domestic violence  survivors, there were no other services like this for Spanish-speaking  women in Chicago. Today, Mujeres Latinas en Accion helps women find  pathways to safer and healthier lives by providing wraparound,  bilingual, and culturally sensitive domestic violence and sexual  assault services, including a 24-hour hotline for crisis counseling and  advocacy efforts.   However, the support does not stop there. Their program, Empresarias  del Futuro, trains women interested in starting and expanding small  businesses. By obtaining financial independence, they can break the  cycle of codependency from their abusers.   Mujeres Latinas en Accion is a force of change. I congratulate and  thank them for serving our community with compassion, care, and courage  these past 50 years.                            ____________________
