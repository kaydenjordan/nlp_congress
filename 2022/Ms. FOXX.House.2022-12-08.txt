 Mr. Speaker, there are many wonderful people who work in  and around the House to help us do the people's business. Some are very  visible, and some are less so. Often the less visible are some of the  most valuable in many ways.   One of those people is Patricia Smith, Pat, who is a true patriot and  works hard every day to serve others. Ms. Pat prepares and serves food  in the Republican Cloakroom. She is unfailingly sweet and caring, not  only to Members but to everyone.   In addition to her service in the House, Ms. Pat serves at her church  and volunteers on weekends, feeding the homeless. She lives her faith  every minute of every day.   As Saint Francis said: Preach a sermon every day. When necessary, use  words.   Ms. Pat does not need to use words. She lives the Gospel every day.  She will soon be retiring, and she will be greatly missed.   Congratulations, Ms. Pat, on a life well lived. I will miss you and  your example more than you can know.                            ____________________     As we say here sometimes to save time, I certainly  associate myself with the very eloquent words of Congressman Kelly. He  is so good. You see that he needed no notes. He can just come up here  and speak without anything.   This is a tough day for me to come in and talk about your leaving,  Congressman Keller, but we want to let you know how much we appreciate  you. That is why we are here.   One thing I have learned about Representative Fred Keller while  serving with him in Congress is that he is someone who always shows up  prepared to work on behalf of job creators and workers, and he is  committed to upholding the Constitution.   I am so glad your staff and family are there in the gallery with us  today because I know they have heard positive things about you before,  but I think it is helpful for them to hear us come here today in this  special place to say these things to you.   I have greatly appreciated and admired Fred's strong commitment to  conservative principles. As a businessman and job creator himself, he  knows the free market works and is dedicated to protecting it.   It is clear why Fred recently received the Guardian of Small Business  Award from the National Federation of Independent Business.   His stalwart defense of limited government and fiscal responsibility  will serve as an example to current and future lawmakers alike.   Fred has been an important leader on the Education and Labor  Committee. As the Republican leader on the Subcommittee on Workforce  Protections, Fred worked hard to protect the rights of workers and job  creators.   He was well suited for this function because he has real-world  experience in business. Managing a plant of 250 people for 25 years  gave Fred the experience needed to serve our country's workforce. The  committee and this Congress have benefited from his insight and wisdom.   I have also admired Fred's commitment to the sanctity of life, which  has been second to none in this body. I will never forget the story  Fred told during a hearing that none of us had ever heard before and  were not expecting to hear.   The story was about his son, Freddie, who suffered a traumatic brain  injury at a young age. Doctors told Fred and his wife that there was  zero chance his son would recover. Despite pressure from doctors, Fred  and his wife refused to take their son off life support. Freddie  recovered and is now in his thirties, working for the healthcare  industry. What a victory for parents' love for their son and the  principle of life.   Fred's commitment to life didn't end back in his son's hospital room.  It is something he has been dedicated to throughout his life.   No matter where he goes, Fred wears a pin on his collar that  represents the exact size and shape of baby's feet at 10 weeks after  conception. It is a daily reminder that life is sacred, and it is our  duty to protect the most vulnerable.   It is no surprise that Fred received an A-plus rating on the Susan B.  Anthony List National Pro-Life Scorecard.  [[Page H8862]]    As he said on the House floor: If my time in Congress is to be  remembered for one thing, let it be that I fought to defend the  sanctity of life.   You have certainly done that, Fred.   Congressman Keller, we will remember. We will remember that you stood  against the Democrats' radical pro-abortion agenda. We will remember  that you stood up for the conscience, rights, and religious freedoms of  healthcare workers. We will remember that you gave a voice to the 63  million unborn babies killed in the womb before they had voices.   Today, when our first freedoms are called into question, we need  leaders who will take a stand without wavering and defend our  constitutional rights. That is exactly what Fred did when he introduced  the Restoring Academic Freedom on Campus Act. Defending the freedom of  expression on college campuses is imperative, and I appreciate Fred's  work on this issue.   The freedom to speak and think freely comes from God. Students should  not have to sign away their First Amendment rights after enrolling in  college, especially if those institutions accept taxpayer funds. It is  time for colleges and universities to be held accountable when they  refuse to protect the free speech of students and faculty.   I also greatly appreciate how Fred led the Congressional Review Act  resolution against OSHA's tyrannical vaccine mandate. Fred used every  legislative avenue to help nullify President Biden's emergency  temporary standard that would have forced millions of workers to get  the COVID-19 vaccine or face losing their jobs.    His commitment to protecting the individual liberties of every  American stands out. When OSHA finally withdrew this authoritarian  measure after losing at the Supreme Court, Fred and I celebrated.   This is a lesson to us all. Even when the hill is steep, we must  fight on. In this case, standing up for the Constitution saved so many  Americans from being coerced into making a medical decision they were  uncomfortable with. We need leaders who have the courage of their  convictions. Fred is such a leader.   Being a leader means having the prudence also to know which hills to  fight on, which hills to abandon, and which hills are worth dying for.  I believe Fred and I agree that the preservation of our God-given  rights is worth any and every sacrifice, and that is why it has been an  honor to serve alongside him.   Common cause always creates uncommon bonds, and I will miss you as a  partner.   Lastly, Fred has something that far too many of our national leaders  lack: humility. Fred has always cared more about service than the  spotlight.   Saying Fred will be missed is an understatement. He is what every  statesman should be: prudent, decisive, and gracious.   Congressman Keller, we wish you the best in your future endeavors,  knowing that whatever you do next will be in further service to the  American people.   From a grateful country and from someone who is honored to call  herself your friend, thank you for all you have done to protect freedom  and constitutional government. You will be missed.                                time  1515
