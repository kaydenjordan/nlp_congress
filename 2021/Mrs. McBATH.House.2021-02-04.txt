 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from  Florida.   Mr. Speaker, in 2 weeks, I celebrate the birthday of my son, Jordan.  Every year since he was murdered, his birthday brings joyful memories  but profound sadness.   Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, my pain on his birthday turned to horror  and grief as I watched students in Parkland, children the same age as  my son, run terrified out of their high school.   I watched parents read texts from their kids that said: Mom, if I  don't make it back, thank you for everything that you have done for me.   I watched as 17 families realized that their lives are never going to  be the same.   Mr. Speaker, throughout history, words have shown and have had the  power to unite this Nation with unity and hope, or the power to divide  with bigotry and hate. Words have an impact on everything that we do  here in this Chamber, on this Hill, in this body. Every action that we  take makes life better for the American people.   This today is about a Member's words and actions that are beneath  this body, beneath the American people that we have sworn to protect.   This is about a Member stalking the children of tragedy, attacking  survivors, and threatening violence. This is about a Member denying the  existence of dead children at Sandy Hook Elementary and Marjory  Stoneman Douglas High School. This moment is about parents across  America who now celebrate their child's birthday just like me.
