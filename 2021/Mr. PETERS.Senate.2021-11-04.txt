 Objection.    Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.   This bill would be a step backwards in our country's fight against  the COVID-19 pandemic.   Across this country, we have seen over 45 million cases of COVID-19  and almost 750,000 deaths. Communities--and particularly communities of  color--have been hit hard by this virus.   But, luckily, we have a safe and effective way to help prevent the  spread of the virus: vaccines.   So far, almost 60 percent of U.S. population has been fully  vaccinated. However, the virus continues to spread. The Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention classified over 70 percent of our  counties are having high transmission rates. Conversely, less than 2  percent are classified as low transmission. In order for us to beat  this virus, we need to reach higher levels of vaccine rates and put a  stop to community spread.   This bill would bar executive agencies from being able to mandate  that individuals receive the COVID-19 vaccine or even mandate that an  individual agree to undergo periodic testing for COVID-19 in lieu of a  vaccine.   The science is clear: Vaccines are safe, they are effective, and they  save lives.   Rather than wasting time on partisan bills that make our country less  safe, we should be finding ways to ensure an equitable recovery for all  of our communities and preparing for the next public health emergency.   I object.    Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of  Robert L. Santos to be the Director of the Census Bureau.   Mr. Santos is uniquely qualified to lead the Census Bureau as it  carries out its important work serving as the leading source of quality  data about the Nation's people and economy. He brings over 40 years of  experience in both the public and private sectors as a manager and  expert in the field of survey design and statistical research.   Throughout his career, Mr. Santos has interacted closely with the  Census Bureau as a researcher, a stakeholder, and an expert adviser,  serving on the Census Advisory Committee and National Academies panels  on Federal statistics. He has a deep understanding of the Census  Bureau, its data, and its stakeholders.   Throughout the nomination process, Mr. Santos has demonstrated a firm  commitment to upholding the Bureau's mission of producing the essential  high-quality data that our communities, our businesses, and people all  across our Nation rely on.   As the Census Bureau completes the 2020 census, plans for the 2030  census, and administers the Bureau's crucial demographic surveys, it is  absolutely critical for the Agency to have a qualified Senate-confirmed  leader at the helm.   I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the confirmation  of  [[Page S7777]]  Robert Santos as Census Bureau Director.                          Vote on Santos Nomination     I ask for the yeas and nays.   Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.
