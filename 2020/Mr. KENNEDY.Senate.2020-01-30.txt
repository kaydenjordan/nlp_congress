 Your Honor.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Louisiana.    Thank you, Your Honor. On behalf of myself and Senator  Ernst, I send a question to the desk for Mr. Nadler and Mr. Philbin.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Kennedy and Senator  Ernst to both parties, and the House managers will be first:         If the president asks for an investigation of possible       corruption by a political rival under circumstances that       objectively are in the national interest, should the       president be impeached if a majority of the House believes       the president is in it for the wrong reason?    Mr. Manager NADLER. The President, of course, is entitled to conduct  foreign policy; he is entitled to look into corruption in the United  States or elsewhere; he is entitled to use the Department of State or  any other Departments in that effort. He is not entitled to target an  American citizen specifically, nor did he do so innocently here. It was  only after Mr. Biden became an announced candidate for President that  he suddenly decided that Ukraine ought to look into the Bidens.   And he made it very clear--he made it very clear--that he wasn't  interested in an investigation; he was interested in an announcement of  an investigation just so the Bidens could be smeared.   So it is probably never suitable for a President to order an  investigation of an American citizen. If he thinks there is general  corruption and there is an investigation ongoing, the Justice  Department certainly can ask the foreign government to assist in an  investigation. But that wasn't done here. The President specifically  targeted an individual with an obvious political motive, and I would  simply say that that is so clear that there is no question that it was  a political motive against a specific individual.   There are about 1.8 million companies in Ukraine. The estimates were  that about half of them were corrupt. The President chose one--the one  with Mr. Biden.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question.   I think the short answer is no; the President should not be  impeached. And I think what the focus of the question is getting at is  to the situation of mixed motives, which has come up a couple of times  here.   If the President, as chief law enforcement officer, head of the  executive branch, is in a situation where there is a legitimate  investigation being pursued and he indicates that it should be pursued,  is it possible that he should be impeached for that if there is some  dispute about his motives, whether there is a legitimate basis for that  conduct? The answer is no, and the House managers themselves, in the  way they framed their case, recognized this.   In the House Judiciary Committee report, they repeatedly say that the  standard they are going to have to meet--they are going to have to show  that these are sham investigations; these are baseless investigations  that they are alleging that the President wanted to initiate; and they  had no legitimate--there was not any legitimate basis for pursuing the  investigation. I am pretty sure that is page 5 of the House Judiciary  report.   They use that standard and they talk about there not being a  scintilla of evidence about anything that anyone could reasonably want  to ask about related to the Bidens and Burisma because they know they  can't get into a mixed-motive scenario, because if you have a  legitimate basis for asking a question about something, if there is a  legitimate national interest there, it is totally unacceptable to start  getting into the field of saying: Well, we are going to impeach the  President and remove him from office by putting him on the  psychiatrist's couch to try to get inside his head and find out was it  48 percent in this motive and 52 in the other--or did he have some  other rationale? No. If it is a legitimate inquiry in the national  interest, that is the end of it, and you can't say that we are going to  impeach the President, remove him from office, decapitate the executive  branch of the government, disrupt the functioning of the government of  the country in an election year by trying to parse out subjective  motives and which percentage of the motive was a good motive or some  other motive--something like that. If it is a legitimate inquiry in the  national interest, if that possibility is there, if the national  interest is there, that is the end of it. Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   I haven't specified this before, but I think it would be best if  Senators directed their questions to one of the parties or both and  leave it up to them to figure out who they want to go up to bat, rather  than particular counsel.   The Senator from Illinois.    Your Honor, I send a question to the desk for counsel  for the President.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Kennedy is for counsel for the President:         Has the House of Representatives, in its impeachment       proceedings or otherwise, investigated the veracity of the       statement by former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Victor       Shokin that Mr. Shokin ``believes his ouster was because of       his interest in [Burisma Holdings], and his claim that had he       remained in his post, Shokin said he would have questioned       Hunter Biden,'' as reported on July 22, 2019 in an article in       The Washington Post entitled ``As Vice President, Biden said       Ukraine Should Increase Gas Production. Then His Son got a       job with a Ukrainian Gas Company,'' by Michael Kranish and       David L. Stern.    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, thank you for that  question.   The answer, to the best of my knowledge, is no, the House of  Representatives did not investigate the veracity of the truth of that  reporting about Prosecutor General Shokin. In fact, that was part of  the point.   As Manager Schiff was saying here, again, the House Democrats'  position is that everything related to the entire incident of the  Bidens and Burisma and what was going on with the prosecutor--it is all  debunked. There is nothing to see there. Move along. Don't ask about  it. But they didn't investigate it, and they can't point to anyone who  has investigated it. They can't point to anyone who has really looked  at it.    As I said a minute ago--and I will not belabor the point--every  witness who was asked said that they thought, yes, there was at least  the appearance of a conflict of interest there. At least one witness-- and there is a public reporting of another person, whose name is  Hochstein, in the Obama administration--raised the issue with Vice  President Biden's Office, but nothing was done about it.   There have been questions about whether Vice President Biden sought  or received an ethics opinion. We don't know--not that I have heard of,  not that I have seen anywhere. It is just something that no one has  actually inquired into.   There have been questions raised about ``Why now?'' ``Why are they  being raised now?'' The implication the House managers have tried to  make is it is just because Joe Biden decided in April he was going to  run for the Presidency.   As I explained the other day, Rudy Giuliani, as the President's  private counsel, was exploring matters in Ukraine starting in the fall  of 2018. He had tips because he was interested in finding out-- remember, the Mueller investigation was still ongoing at that point. It  wasn't clear what the outcome of the Mueller investigation was going to  be. He was trying to find out what were the origins of Russian  interference, of the Steele dossier, of allegations of collusion by the  Trump campaign. That led, in part, to Ukraine, and he got information  that led him to various strands to pursue. One of them became the issue  of the Biden and Burisma incident.   He prepared a little package on that based on interview notes on  January 23 and January 25 of 2019. Months before  [[Page S728]]  Joe Biden announced that he was going to run for the Presidency, Rudy  Giuliani was interviewing Shokin and Lutsenko and wrote down in the  interview notes stuff about the Biden and Burisma incident and the  firing of Shokin. He put it all in a package, and he delivered it to  the State Department in March--still before Joe Biden said he was going  to be running for President. That didn't happen until April 25. It was  all done--all put in a package, all delivered.   That is public now because that little package that he sent to the  State Department was released, I think it was, under the FOIA  litigation, but it has been released publicly, and the notes that he  took, his interview notes, were released publicly.   So the timing dates back to when Rudy Giuliani was pursuing that,  starting back in the fall of 2018 with his taking time to pursue leads.  He was trying to get Shokin to come to this country to interview him.  He couldn't get him a visa and had to interview him by phone. Lutsenko  was in New York, and he prepared this package. That is why there is  that timing.   Then there were public articles published about the Biden-Burisma  affair. One of them was just mentioned in the question--a Washington  Post article, July 22, 2019, specifically about it--about the firing of  Shokin 3 days before the July 25 telephone call. It was in the news. It  was topical.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Michigan.
