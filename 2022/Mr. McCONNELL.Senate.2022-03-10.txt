 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Washington Democrats are trying to  pull off a political spin job for the ages. Everyone knows that gas  prices and energy costs have been soaring sharply for many, many  months. Working families know all too well that gas prices and utility  costs have been rising throughout President Biden's tenure.   Just this morning, we learned that inflation set yet another modern  record last month. Prices skyrocketed another 0.8 percent in February  alone. That comes out to 7.9 percent inflation year on year, the worst  inflation in 40 years. And it keeps getting worse, not better.   This has been a painful pattern throughout President Biden's tenure.  We have now had 9 straight months of inflation higher than 5 percent.  And remember, 3 weeks ago, before the crisis in Europe, Democrats were  already in a political panic over gas prices and desperately talking  about a gas tax holiday. Three weeks ago, before the crisis in Europe,  the average price of a gallon of gas had already shot up more than a  dollar from when President Biden was sworn in.   Now, you would think the Democrats would have been proud of this.  Hostility to fossil fuels and homegrown American energy is precisely  what President Biden campaigned on. Here is what our President said on  the campaign trail in 2020--a direct quote:         No more subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. No more       drilling on Federal lands. No more drilling, including       offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to       drill, period. [It] ends.    That was the President in 2020. Here is what he told an activist:   [[Page S1071]]              [L]ook at my eyes. I guarantee you . . . we are going to       end--    End--       fossil fuel.    Now, President Biden spent 2 years campaigning on hostility to  American energy. Now he has spent 14 months putting that hostility  right into action, and Democrats' reckless spending that has fueled  across-the-board inflation has made Americans' pain at the pump even  worse.   But in the last few days, the Biden administration has tried to  invent some laugh-out-loud--laugh-out-loud--revisionist history. They  are trying to rebrand the entire increase in gas prices on their  watch--listen to this--as an effect of Putin's recent invasion of  Ukraine. So they want to blame 14 months of gas price increases on the  last 2 weeks of turmoil.   Washington Democrats' war on domestic energy long, long predates  Putin's war on Ukraine. So let me say that again. Democrats' war on  domestic energy long predates Putin's war on Ukraine.   Now, I strongly support America stopping our purchases of Putin's  oil, but Democrats' 14-month war on our own production will make that  necessary action more painful for American families than it had to be.  If the Biden administration had spent 14 months promoting American  energy instead of attacking our production and fueling inflation, we  would be better positioned to push back on Putin at a less painful cost  to American families.   The President's team wants to pretend this lengthy problem only  started 2 weeks ago, but American families have been paying for  Democrats' bad policies for a lot longer than that.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, yesterday, the  House passed a bipartisan, bicameral government funding agreement that  will enable crucial investments in our national defense. Putin's war on  Ukraine is just one manifestation of the major long-term threats to  American security and American interests posed by major competing  powers like Russia and China.   So, absolutely, we must rapidly fund the urgent assistance that  Ukraine and our allies along NATO's eastern flank need right now, but  we must also make the investments in military modernization that will  equip America to achieve peace through strength for years and decades  to come.   Our military commanders have clearly and consistently told us they  cannot rebuild and modernize our military to meet the growing threats  if Congress lets defense funding sleepwalk from one continuing  resolution to another. The world is a dangerous place. It is growing  more dangerous every day. The road to peace runs through American  power. We all know it is true, so we have to budget accordingly.   Our recent negotiations put us Republicans in the surreal position of  having to push a Commander in Chief's party into giving his own  commanders the funding they need. But, over many Democrats' objections,  Republicans made sure this deal gets the job done for our Armed Forces.   The compromise product provides significantly more money than the  Biden administration had requested for defense and significantly less  than they requested for nondefense.   Until 24 hours ago, this compromise was also going to reprogram money  away from Democrats' wasteful spending spree that neglected COVID needs  and reallocate it to vaccines and treatment for the American people,  but House Democrats mutinied against Speaker Pelosi. The far left would  rather preserve State and local bureaucrats' giant slush funds than  fund vaccines and therapeutics for our citizens, so the COVID component  has fallen out.   Overall, this agreement checks the three boxes I laid out months ago.  The bill maintains parity between defense and nondefense spending  growth. It maintains longstanding bipartisan policies, such as  protecting taxpayers against funding abortions and being politically  targeted by the IRS. And new far-left poison pills were cut out. But  more urgently, amidst this war in Europe, this agreement delivers aid  the Ukrainians need right now and a downpayment on our commitment to  keep defending America and global peace in the years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, over the last  few days, the Biden administration's confusing mismanagement and mixed  signals surrounding the Ukraine crisis and the West's response have  again spilled out into open public view.   Here is the pattern. Time and time again throughout this crisis and  in the months preceding it, the administration's first instinct has  been to resist strong and decisive steps. The President and his team  initially take a pass on strong steps when they could have been put  into place proactively and had a real deterrent effect, but then, after  sustained public pressure, they buckle and implement the steps anyway,  often too late. This ``leading from behind'' leaves us in a lose-lose  scenario.   The pattern has played out yet again with this bizarre argument over  MiG airplanes that President Biden's team has carried out in public  with our Polish allies.   The mere fact that Biden administration officials are contradicting  not only each other but also our NATO allies in public like this  evidences a severe lack of the coordination and proactive leadership  that we should be--us, Americans--should be providing. This isn't  limited to just these Polish planes; there are all manner of different  systems, tools, and arms that our eastern flank allies and partners  could be providing more readily to the brave Ukrainians. This would  take American leadership and coordination and an American commitment  that we will help them replace their Soviet-era stocks with American  and Western military technology.   The loan guarantees we included in the supplemental appropriations  bill will give the administration a tool to do just this--help eastern  flank NATO partners use their own money to modernize their defensive  capabilities. This would be a win for Ukraine, a win for us, and a win  for NATO.   These kinds of steps should be no-brainers for a confident,  assertive, and decisive American administration. Instead, it repeatedly  seems like the administration's first instinct is to flinch--to  flinch--wait for international and public pressure to overwhelm them,  and then take action only after the most opportune moment has nearly  passed us by.    Nobody wants an escalation, but if the administration keeps repeating  this pattern of self-deterrence, of convincing itself that any  proactive step would be irresponsible, they are just internalizing  Putin's false premise and amplifying Putin's false equivalence.   Remember this: Strength is not a provocation. The world needs  President Biden and his team to be leading, taking the initiative, and  shaping circumstances calmly, soberly, but with confidence and  decisiveness. They seem to be trapped in a cycle of passivity,  indecision, self-deterrence, and then, finally, reaction. The world  needs the Biden administration to be flying this plane. Too often, it  feels like the plane is flying them.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
