The majority leader.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I need to catch my breath, so much has  happened.   A few hours ago, on the West Front of this citadel of democracy, Joe  Biden and Kamala Harris were administered the oaths of Office to the  Presidency and Vice Presidency of the United States. We have turned the  page to a new chapter in the history of our democracy, and I am full of  hope.   I would challenge anyone not to feel hopeful today after listening to  Amanda Gorman, the amazing 22-year-old poet, wise far beyond her years,  who told us that:       Somehow we've weathered and witnessed      a nation that isn't broken      but simply unfinished    The hope she spoke about--the strong and happy hope--the hope we feel  today, is a hope, of course, that is tempered by reality. This was an  inauguration unlike most others. The crowds that customarily line the  National Mall were absent, a reminder that our Nation is still in the  throes of a deadly pandemic.   The presence of thousands of National Guardsmen, police, and Secret  Service was a reminder that 2 weeks ago, in this very room and on those  very steps where President Biden took the oath, a mob of violent  criminals tried to dismantle our democracy--our sacred democracy--brick  by brick and would try again if they could.   But, as President Biden said a few hours ago, today, democracy has  prevailed, the will of the people was heeded, and the peaceful transfer  of power fulfilled. It takes a lot more than a band of hooligans to  bring our grand democracy down.   Let it be a message to our friends and adversaries around the world  that our democracy, though it has been tried and been tested, shall  long endure. And let it be a message to those terrorists who desecrated  this temple of democracy that they will never prevail.   Joe Biden is now the 46th President of the United States. Kamala  Harris is now the 49th Vice President of the United States. But, of  course, in more ways than one, she is not the 49th but the first--the  first African-American woman, the first Asian-American woman, and the  first woman, period, to hold the Office of Vice Presidency in our  Nation's history.   Today, the threat to our democracy from the Presidency itself has  ended, but the challenges we face as a nation remain. In the wake of  violence and division, hatred and mistruth, in the shadow of disease  and economic hardship, a warming planet and unequal society, we begin  the work of the 117th Congress.   In his inaugural address, President Biden spoke to this moment--a  moment of great challenge--and told us two simple truths: One, that our  responsibilities are numerous, and, two, it will take unity--unity of  spirit, unity of purpose--to fulfill them.   President Biden, we heard you loud and clear. We have a lengthy  agenda, and we need to get it done together.   President Biden pointed the way to our Nation's recovery and renewal.  He reminded us of who we are and where we need to go, but we must now  turn the spirit of his words into action.   The Senate must immediately set to work on the mission President  Biden described--restoring the greatness and goodness of America. This  will be an exceptionally busy and consequential period for the U.S.  Senate. There is much to do, and we are ready to get to work.   Now, not to upstage our new President and Vice President, but theirs  has not been the only swearing in today. A few moments ago, the Senate  welcomed three new Members to this Chamber. I can now happily and  proudly call them Senator Padilla, Senator Ossoff, and Senator Warnock.  They join Senators Kelly, Hickenlooper, and Lujan as part of a six- Member class of Democratic Senators and a new Democratic Senate  majority.   I mention the historic nature of Vice President Harris' ascendance,  but let's not forget that her successor, Alex Padilla, is the first  Latino Senator to represent California; that Rafael Warnock, born while  Georgia was represented in this Chamber by two staunch segregationists,  is now the first African-American Senator Georgia has ever elected; and  that John Ossoff is the first Jewish Senator from his State, sworn in  today on a book of Hebrew Scripture once owned by the rabbi, who,  decades ago, formed a bond between the Jewish and African-American  communities of Georgia.   As President Biden said in his inaugural address, ``don't tell me  things can't change.'' With the swearing in of these three Senators,  the Senate will turn to Democratic control, for which I deeply thank my  colleagues. We will return to Democratic control under the first New  York-born majority leader in American history--a kid from Brooklyn, the  son of an exterminator and a housewife, and a descendant of victims of  the Holocaust.   That I should be the leader of this new Senate majority is an awesome  responsibility--awesome in the Biblical sense, as the angels that  tremble in awe before God. Today, I feel the full weight of that  responsibility, a sense of reverence and of awe at the trust placed in  me. I intend to honor that trust with all of my energy and with joy.   And as the majority changes in the Senate, the Senate will do  business differently. The Senate will address the challenges our  country faces head on and without delay, not with timid solutions but  with boldness and with courage. The Senate will tackle the perils of  the moment, a once-in-a-generation health and economic crisis, and it  will strive to make progress on generations-long struggle for racial  justice, economic justice, equality of opportunity, and equality under  the law.   And make no mistake, the Senate will forcefully, consistently, and  urgently address the greatest threat to this country and to our planet:  climate change.   This Senate will legislate. It will be active, responsive, energetic,  and bold.   And to my Republican colleagues, when and where we can, the  Democratic majority will strive to make this important work bipartisan.  The Senate works best when we work together. We have no choice.   The challenges we face are great. The divisions in the country are  real. We have no choice but to try to work together every day to reward  the faith the American people have placed in us. So let us begin.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.  [[Page S66]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore.
