 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the significant  struggles facing working families across America, struggles that have  been exposed and exacerbated by the COVID pandemic.   That is why, through the American Rescue Plan, we took action to  expand the child tax credit, helping to uplift families and reduce  poverty. In my community, more than 40,000 households will receive an  average benefit of nearly $3,000 that will begin being disbursed in  just a few short weeks. This is projected to lift 8,200 children out of  poverty in my district alone.   When we talk about transformative investment to support working  families, this is exactly what we mean, and it is why we need to make  the expanded child tax credit permanent, to put kids and parents on the  path to success, because when we ease the financial burden on families,  they have the security and flexibility to contribute to the workforce,  strengthen our economy, and set our children up for a stable and  successful future.
