 Madam Speaker, I rise to object to the  administration's threat to issue a national emergency declaration and  reprogram money that has been allocated for Hurricane Harvey.   I join a bipartisan group of Texas legislators in opposition to this  diversion,  [[Page H583]]  including my former colleagues from the Texas Senate. This  administration is seeking any funds or any means to go around Congress  to build his wall.   Congress is a coequal branch of government, Madam Speaker, with a  duty to appropriate funds for Hurricane Harvey. Any action to delay or  divert those funds puts lives at risk and potentially displaces people  from their homes, many in my own district in Houston.   We must do more to mitigate the damages caused by flooding. Diverting  disaster funds to pay for a wall will not accomplish that goal.   I am proud of the bipartisan opposition to this effort, and I hope  that we can work together in that same spirit to end this Trump  shutdown.                            ____________________
