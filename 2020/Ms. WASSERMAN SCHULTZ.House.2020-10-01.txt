 Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I  rise to recognize the remarkable career of Carol Brick-Turin.   After 12 years, Ms. Brick-Turin is retiring as the executive director  of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation's Jewish Community Relations  Council.   Carol originally moved to Washington, D.C., to join the U.S.  Department of Agriculture, where she worked on public policy issues for  more than a decade. A graduate of Cornell University with a bachelor of  science degree in agricultural economics, she was recruited to join the  Foreign Agricultural Service and served as a diplomat in Brussels,  Belgium, in the U.S. Mission to the European Community.   She was the first married female to serve as an agricultural attache  in the history of the FAS.   Carol attended the Foreign Service Institute, completed a study  program taught by faculty of the Jewish Theological Seminary, and  attended the University of Tel Aviv in 1973, both before and after the  Yom Kippur War.   Having raised her children as Zionists, she now has three  grandchildren who were born in Jerusalem, in addition to her two  granddaughters in Miami.   As the JCRC's executive director, Carol has adroitly mobilized and  energized Miami's Jewish community on many levels. She has led our  citizen activists in building relationships with Members of Congress on  both sides of the aisle, key to the success of the pro-Israel movement  and the national agenda supported by the Jewish Council for Public  Affairs.   We have worked together to address a multitude of issues facing our  community, from the surge of anti-Semitism and senseless gun violence  plaguing our schools and places of worship to ensuring we maintain our  strong U.S.-Israel relationship.  [[Page H5116]]    Carol's commitment to Miami's Jewish community and the State of  Israel is exemplary, and I am proud to call her my very dear friend.   I will miss her guidance and wisdom, but our loss is her husband,  Alan, and her family's gain.   I wish her a hearty mazel tov on her retirement, and I am grateful  for her invaluable work and her dear friendship.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, after four, long painful months, Senate Republicans  continue to block the House-passed Heroes Act to provide coronavirus  relief to the fed-up American people. Since May, thousands more  businesses have folded, millions remain jobless, and U.S. deaths  doubled to 200,000.   Democrats have been negotiating in good faith. We were at $3 trillion  for our original Heroes Act. We have asked the Republicans who were at  $1 trillion to meet us halfway, and here we are, with them still stuck  in the mud, refusing to do what the American people need us to do, to  help make sure they can recover from this deadly viral pandemic.   Sadly, Republicans think we are being too generous with the American  people, so many of whom are struggling to stay healthy amid a global  pandemic and pay their bills since the worst recession since the Great  Depression. My Governor just let a moratorium on evictions expire. He  just reopened the State to 100 percent capacity, as if the virus is not  still rampaging through our State.   Democrats offered this updated Heroes Act to defeat this virus and  put money in the pockets of stressed Americans. It is way past time for  Republicans to meet us halfway.    This bill improves the Paycheck Protection Program for small  businesses and non-profits and provides billions to local governments  and schools.   This bill funds testing and tracing, provides $1,200 in direct  payments to Americans, extends $600--not $400--of Federal unemployment  payments, and extends the vital Payroll Support Program for airline  workers, thousands of whom were laid off starting today.   It also funds daycare, spreads Affordable Care Act coverage, and  bolsters housing and food assistance, while protecting our elections by  strengthening the Census and the Postal Service.   It does not go as far as Democrats would like--that is because we are  here to compromise, because we know the American people need us to do  that--but it goes a long way to offer what Americans desperately need  right now. Republicans need to stop standing in the way of relief and  come to the table so that we can send home a package that is going to  take care of the American people in this dire time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a fearless  visionary woman who has transcended  [[Page H5438]]  generations with her legal mind, compassion, and wit.   As a Jewish woman, she was a personal inspiration to me, my  daughters, and millions of others who follow in her footsteps and are  guided by the same values of justice and tikkun olam.   In Hebrew, there is a saying: ``May your memory be for a  revolution.'' And that aim is our promise to Justice Ginsburg.   Around this country, access to vital reproductive healthcare is  hanging on by a thread.   Yesterday marked the 44th anniversary of the Hyde Amendment.   Low-income women and women of color are forced to make tough economic  decisions every day that often put their own lives and that of their  families at risk because of their inability to access critical family  planning.   Just Ginsburg fought for these women. For all women. She was a  tireless defender of our Nation's promise of freedom, justice, and  equality for all.   Yet with her passing, we find ourselves in a push to subvert  reproductive rights and dismantle healthcare protections that 135  million people, including me, with a preexisting condition, rely upon.   Justice Ginsburg passed on Erev Rosh Hashanah, the start to the  Jewish new year. They say that those who die on this day are a tzadik,  or a person of righteousness. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was certainly that  and more.   May Justice Ginsburg's memory be a blessing and her example a  righteous inspiration for us all.                            ____________________
