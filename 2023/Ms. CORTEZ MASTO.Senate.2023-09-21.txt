 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  legacy of McAvoy Layne. Mr. Layne has dedicated 35 years of his life to  promoting art and literature to audiences across Nevada. After more  than 4,000 performances as one of the premier Mark Twain impersonators,  Mr. Layne will share his legendary charm with audiences for one last  time at Piper's Opera House, in historic Virginia City, NV, on  September 30, 2023.   As a lifelong Nevadan, I always appreciate our State's history and  those who tell and preserve it. Samuel Langhorne Clemens became Mark  Twain while residing in Nevada between the years 1861 and 1864. It was  in this 3-year span that Mark Twain's career set off, writing for  ``Territorial Enterprise'' in Virginia City and inspiring the novel  ``Roughing It,'' which helped introduce Nevada to the world.   McAvoy Layne moved to Tahoe's North Shore 40 years ago when he was  offered a job at Diamond Peak Ski Resort. He has lived there ever  since, and it was there he discovered his calling to impersonate and  educate people about one of America's best-known authors, Mark Twain.   Mr. Layne began his career as a Twain impersonator at Piper's Opera  House in Virginia City, NV, performing two shows a day, 6 days a week  in the summer of 1988. Over the years, he specialized in school  programs, visiting schools across the United States, Europe, and  Russia. He would sometimes visit 10 schools a week, performing for  students of all ages. Countless Nevadans can recall stories of Mr.  Layne visiting their school as Mark Twain.   Highlights of Mr. Layne's career include winning the Nevada Award for  Excellence in School and Library Service, playing the ghost of Samuel  Clemens in the Biography Channel's episode on Mark Twain, and  participating in the Discovery Channel's Cronkite Award-winning  documentary, ``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.''   Mr. Layne is not just an actor but a writer, educator, storyteller,  and a Nevada icon. September 30 will mark the end of an era as he takes  the stage one last time in the place where it all began. It is  important to ensure future generations understand Nevada's history, and  I would like to thank Mr. Layne for his service in educating us about  the legendary Samuel Clemens.                            ____________________
