 Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington, Senator  Murray, has a question for the House managers.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         At 6:01 p.m. eastern time on January 6, President Trump       tweeted:        These are the things that happen when a sacred landslide       election victory is so unceremoniously and viscously stripped       away from great patriots who have been badly and unfairly       treated for so long.        Adding for rioters to ``go home with love and in peace.''        What is the relevance of this tweet to President Trump's       guilt?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House managers are recognized for up  to 5 minutes.   Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. Senators, this was a key quote and a key  statement by the President that day--that horrific day.   Remember, the Capitol had been stormed. It had been attacked. People  had yelled, ``Hang Mike Pence.'' People had gone after Speaker Pelosi.  People brought baseball bats and other weapons. Many Members of  Congress in the Senate and the House were fearful for their own lives.   The President didn't call the National Guard. His own administration  didn't list him as somebody who they had spoken with to activate the  Guard. And he said:         Remember this day forever.    So if he was not guilty of inciting insurrection, if this is not what  he wanted, if it wasn't what he desired, by that time the carnage had  been on television for hours. He saw what was going on. Everybody saw  what was going on.   If it wasn't what he wanted, why would he have said, ``Remember this  day forever''? Why commemorate a day like that, an attack on the U.S.  Capitol, for God's sake? Why would you do that, unless you agreed that  it was something to praise, not condemn; something to hold up and  commemorate?   No consoling the Nation, no reassuring that the Government was  secure, not a single word that entire day condemning the attack or the  attackers or the violent insurrection against Congress.   This tweet is important because it shows two key points about Donald  Trump's state of mind. First, this was entirely and completely  foreseeable, and he foresaw it, and he helped incite it over many  months.   He's saying: I told you this was going to happen if you certified the  election for anyone else besides me, and you got what you deserve for  trying to take it away from me.   And we know this because that statement was entirely consistent with  everything he said leading up to the attack.  [[Page S690]]    Second, this shows that Donald Trump intended and reveled in this.  Senators, he reveled in this. He delighted in it. This is what he  wanted. ``Remember this day forever,'' he said--not as a day of  disgrace, as it is to all of us, but as a day of celebration and  commemoration, and if we let it, if we don't hold him accountable and  set a strong precedent, possibly a continuation later on.   We will, of course, all of us, remember this day but not in the same  way that Donald Trump suggested. We will remember the bravery of our  Capitol and Metro police forces. We will remember the officer who lost  his life and sadly the others who did as well, and the devastation that  was done to this country because of Donald Trump.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following committee rules be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS                            Patty Murray, Chair             RULES OF PROCEDURE (AS AGREED TO FEBRUARY 11, 2021)         Rule 1.--Subject to the provisions of rule XXVI, paragraph       5, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, regular meetings of       the committee shall be held on the second and fourth       Wednesday of each month, at 10:00 a.m., in room SD-430,       Dirksen Senate Office Building. The chair may, upon proper       notice, call such additional meetings as she may deem       necessary.        Rule 2.--The chair of the committee or of a subcommittee,       or if the chair is not present, the ranking majority member       present, shall preside at all meetings. The chair may       designate the ranking minority member to preside at hearings       of the committee or subcommittee.        Rule 3.--Meetings of the committee or a subcommittee,       including meetings to conduct hearings, shall be open to the       public except as otherwise specifically provided in       subsections (b) and (d) of rule 26.5 of the Standing Rules of       the Senate.        Rule 4.--(a) Subject to paragraph (b), one-third of the       membership of the committee, actually present, shall       constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting business.       Any quorum of the committee which is composed of less than a       majority of the members of the committee shall include at       least one member of the majority and one member of the       minority.        (b) A majority of the members of a subcommittee, actually       present, shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of       transacting business: provided, no measure or matter shall be       ordered reported unless such majority shall include at least       one member of the minority who is a member of the       subcommittee. If, at any subcommittee meeting, a measure or       matter cannot be ordered reported because of the absence of       such a minority member, the measure or matter shall lay over       for a day. If the presence of a member of the minority is not       then obtained, a majority of the members of the subcommittee,       actually present, may order such measure or matter reported.        (c) No measure or matter shall be ordered reported from the       committee or a subcommittee unless a majority of the       committee or subcommittee is physically present.        Rule 5.--With the approval of the chair of the committee or       subcommittee, one member thereof may conduct public hearings       other than taking sworn testimony.        Rule 6.--Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and       matters before the committee or a subcommittee if the absent       member has been informed of the matter on which he is being       recorded and (1) has affirmatively requested that he be so       recorded. While proxies may be voted on a motion to report a       measure or matter from the committee, such a motion shall       also require the concurrence of a majority of the members who       are actually present at the time such action is taken.        The committee may poll any matters of committee business as       a matter of unanimous consent; provided that every member is       polled and every poll consists of the following two       questions:        (1) Do you agree or disagree to poll the proposal; and        (2) Do you favor or oppose the proposal.        Rule 7.--There shall be prepared and kept a complete       transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record       the proceedings of each committee or subcommittee meeting or       conference whether or not such meetings or any part thereof       is closed pursuant to the specific provisions of subsections       (b) and (d) of rule 26.5 of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       unless a majority of said members vote to forgo such a       record. Such records shall contain the vote cast by each       member of the committee or subcommittee on any question on       which a ``yea and nay'' vote is demanded, and shall be       available for inspection by any committee member. The clerk       of the committee, or the clerk's designee, shall have the       responsibility to make appropriate arrangements to implement       this rule.        Rule 8.--The committee and each subcommittee shall       undertake, consistent with the provisions of rule XXVI,       paragraph 4, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, to issue       public announcement of any hearing or executive session it       intends to hold at least one week prior to the commencement       of such hearing or executive session. In the case of an       executive session, the text of any bill or joint resolution       to be considered must be provided to the chair for prompt       electronic distribution to the members of the committee.        Rule 9.--The committee or a subcommittee shall require all       witnesses heard before it to file written statements of their       proposed testimony at least 24 hours before a hearing, unless       the chair and the ranking minority member determine that       there is good cause for failure to so file, and to limit       their oral presentation to brief summaries of their       arguments. Testimony may be filed electronically. The       presiding officer at any hearing is authorized to limit the       time of each witness appearing before the committee or a       subcommittee. The committee or a subcommittee shall, as far       as practicable, utilize testimony previously taken on bills       and measures similar to those before it for consideration.        Rule 10.--Should a subcommittee fail to report back to the       full committee on any measure within a reasonable time, the       chair may withdraw the measure from such subcommittee and       report that fact to the full committee for further       disposition.        Rule 11.--No subcommittee may schedule a meeting or hearing       at a time designated for a hearing or meeting of the full       committee. No more than one subcommittee executive meeting       may be held at the same time.        Rule 12.--It shall be the duty of the chair in accordance       with section 133(c) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of       1946, as amended, to report or cause to be reported to the       Senate, any measure or recommendation approved by the       committee and to take or cause to be taken, necessary steps  to bring the matter to a vote in the Senate.         Rule 13.--Whenever a meeting of the committee or       subcommittee is closed pursuant to the provisions of       subsection (b) or (d) of rule 26.5 of the Standing Rules of       the Senate, no person other than members of the committee,       members of the staff of the committee, and designated       assistants to members of the committee shall be permitted to       attend such closed session, except by special dispensation of       the committee or subcommittee or the chair thereof.        Rule 14.--The chair of the committee or a subcommittee       shall be empowered to adjourn any meeting of the committee or       a subcommittee if a quorum is not present within fifteen       minutes of the time schedule for such meeting.        Rule 15.--Whenever a bill or joint resolution shall be       before the committee or a subcommittee for final       consideration, the clerk  [[Page S696]]       shall distribute to each member of the committee or       subcommittee a document, prepared by the sponsor of the bill       or joint resolution. If the bill or joint resolution has no       underlying statutory language, the document shall consist of       a detailed summary of the purpose and impact of each section.       If the bill or joint resolution repeals or amends any statute       or part thereof, the document shall consist of a detailed       summary of the underlying statute and the proposed changes in       each section of the underlying law and either a print of the       statute or the part or section thereof to be amended or       replaced showing by stricken-through type, the part or parts       to be omitted and, in italics, the matter proposed to be       added, along with a summary of the proposed changes; or a       side-by-side document showing a comparison of current law,       the proposed legislative changes, and a detailed description       of the proposed changes.        Rule 16.--An appropriate opportunity shall be given the       minority to examine the proposed text of committee reports       prior to their filing or publication. In the event there are       supplemental, minority, or additional views, an appropriate       opportunity shall be given the majority to examine the       proposed text prior to filing or publication. Unless the       chair and ranking minority member agree on a shorter period       of time, the minority shall have no fewer than three business       days to prepare supplemental, minority or additional views       for inclusion in a committee report from the time the       majority makes the proposed text of the committee report       available to the minority.        Rule 17.--(a) The committee, or any subcommittee, may issue       subpoenas, or hold hearings to take sworn testimony or hear       subpoenaed witnesses, only if such investigative activity has       been authorized by majority vote of the committee.        (b) For the purpose of holding a hearing to take sworn       testimony or hear subpoenaed witnesses, three members of the       committee or subcommittee shall constitute a quorum:       provided, with the concurrence of the chair and ranking       minority member of the committee or subcommittee, a single       member may hear subpoenaed witnesses or take sworn testimony.        (c) The committee may, by a majority vote, delegate the       authority to issue subpoenas to the chair of the committee or       a subcommittee, or to any member designated by such chairman.       Prior to the issuance of each subpoena, the ranking minority       member of the committee or subcommittee, and any other member       so requesting, shall be notified regarding the identity of       the person to whom it will be issued and the nature of the       information sought and its relationship to the authorized       investigative activity, except where the chair of the       committee or subcommittee, in consultation with the ranking       minority member, determines that such notice would unduly       impede the investigation. All information obtained pursuant       to such investigative activity shall be made available as       promptly as possible to each member of the committee       requesting same, or to any assistant to a member of the       committee designated by such member in writing, but the use       of any such information is subject to restrictions imposed by       the rules of the Senate. Such information, to the extent that       it is relevant to the investigation shall, if requested by a       member, be summarized in writing as soon as practicable. Upon       the request of any member, the chair of the committee or       subcommittee shall call an executive session to discuss such       investigative activity or the issuance of any subpoena in       connection therewith.        (d) Any witness summoned to testify at a hearing, or any       witness giving sworn testimony, may be accompanied by counsel       of his own choosing who shall be permitted, while the witness       is testifying, to advise him of his legal rights.        (e) No confidential testimony taken or confidential       material presented in an executive hearing, or any report of       the proceedings of such an executive hearing, shall be made       public, either in whole or in part or by way of summary,       unless authorized by a majority of the members of the       committee or subcommittee.        Rule 18.--Presidential nominees shall submit a statement of       their background and financial interests, including the       financial interests of their spouse and children living in       their household, on a form approved by the committee which       shall be sworn to as to its completeness and accuracy. The       committee form shall be in two parts--        (I) information relating to employment, education and       background of the nominee relating to the position to which       the individual is nominated, and which is to be made public;       and,        (II) information relating to financial and other background       of the nominee, to be made public when the committee       determines that such information bears directly on the       nominee's qualifications to hold the position to which the       individual is nominated.        Information relating to background and financial interests       (parts I and II) shall not be required of nominees for less       than full-time appointments to councils, commissions or       boards when the committee determines that some or all of the       information is not relevant to the nature of the position.       Information relating to other background and financial       interests (part II) shall not be required of any nominee when       the committee determines that it is not relevant to the       nature of the position.        Committee action on a nomination, including hearings or       meetings to consider a motion to recommend confirmation,       shall not be initiated until at least five days after the       nominee submits the form required by this rule unless the       chair, with the concurrence of the ranking minority member,       waives this waiting period.        Rule 19.--Subject to statutory requirements imposed on the       committee with respect to procedure, the rules of the       committee may be changed, modified, amended or suspended at       any time; provided, not less than a majority of the entire       membership so determine at a regular meeting with due notice,       or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose.        Rule 20.--When the ratio of members on the committee is       even, the term ``majority'' as used in the committee's rules       and guidelines shall refer to the party of the chair for       purposes of party identification. Numerical requirements for       quorums, votes and the like shall be unaffected.        Rule 21.--First degree amendments must be filed with the       chair at least 24 hours before an executive session. The       chair shall promptly distribute all filed amendments       electronically to the members of the committee. The chair may       modify the filing requirements to meet special circumstances       with the concurrence of the ranking minority member.        Rule 22.--In addition to the foregoing, the proceedings of       the committee shall be governed by the Standing Rules of the       Senate and the provisions of the Legislative Reorganization       Act of 1946, as amended.    Guidelines of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions With Respect to Hearings, Markup sessions, and Related Matters                                   hearings         Section 133A(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act       requires each committee of the Senate to publicly announce       the date, place, and subject matter of any hearing at least       one week prior to the commencement of such hearing.        The spirit of this requirement is to assure adequate notice       to the public and other Members of the Senate as to the time       and subject matter of proposed hearings. In the spirit of       section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the       committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the       development of hearings:        1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of       each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in       the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement       of such hearing.        2. At least seven days prior to public notice of each       committee or subcommittee hearing, the majority should       provide notice to the minority of the time, place and       specific subject matter of such hearing.        3. At least three days prior to the date of such hearing,       the committee or subcommittee should provide to each member a       list of witnesses who have been or are proposed to be invited       to appear.        4. The committee and its subcommittee should, to the       maximum feasible extent, enforce the provisions of rule 9 of       the committee rules as it relates to the submission of       written statements of witnesses twenty-four hours in advance       of a hearing.        Witnesses will be urged to submit testimony even earlier       whenever possible. When statements are received in advance of       a hearing, the committee or subcommittee (as appropriate)       should distribute copies of such statements to each of its       members. Witness testimony may be submitted and distributed       electronically.            EXECUTIVE SESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKING UP BILLS         In order to expedite the process of marking up bills and to       assist each member of the committee so that there may be full       and fair consideration of each bill which the committee or a       subcommittee is marking up the following procedures should be       followed:        1. Seven days prior to the proposed date for an executive       session for the purpose of marking up bills the committee or       subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide written notice       to each of its members as to the time, place, and specific       subject matter of such session, including an agenda listing       each bill or other matters to be considered and including:        (a) a copy of each bill, joint resolution, or other       legislative matter (or committee print thereof) to be       considered at such executive session; and        (b) a copy of a summary of the provisions of each bill,       joint resolution, or other legislative matter to be       considered at such executive session including, whenever       possible, an explanation of changes to existing law proposed       to be made.        2. Insofar as practical, prior to the scheduled date for an       executive session for the purpose of marking up bills, the       committee or a subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide       each member with a copy of the printed record or a summary of       any hearings conducted by the committee or a subcommittee       with respect to each bill, joint resolution, or other       legislative matter to be considered at such executive       session.                            ____________________
