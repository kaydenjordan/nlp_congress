 Mr. Speaker, as we begin the new year and a new decade,  let's all commit in this House to doing the job that the people sent us  to the people's House to do. Let us remember the words of Alexander  Hamilton: ``Here, sir, the people govern; here they act by their  immediate Representatives.''   Let us commit to working every day 9 to 5 on delivering real results  on the issues that matter to our constituents and our country.   These include working to reduce the cost of healthcare, including  ending surprise billing, decreasing the cost of prescription drugs,  ending prohibitions on association health plans, and ensuring there is  no loss of insurance for preexisting conditions.   Also, continuing to ensure that veterans receive the care they  deserve and  [[Page H244]]  have earned. As well as having the backs of our troops by keeping our  forces strong and prepared.   Fixing our broken illegal immigration process, first by securing our  border and then reforming our laws with a focus on high fences and wide  gates.   Making the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent for families and small  businesses. Driving workforce development by partnering with the  private sector, our schools, career and technical centers, and  apprenticeship programs.   Supporting trade agreements that create reciprocal trade and open  markets for our U.S.-made products and agricultural goods.   Help assure our students have affordable and accountable educational  opportunities.   Continue to grow our domestic energy industry including all-of-the- above and all-of-the-below: clean coal, low-carbon natural gas, and  regulated and responsible oil production. We can accomplish this like  no other nation on Earth.   We will work to develop and pass a transportation infrastructure bill  to keep our roads and bridges safe, to modernize our highway system,  and build America for the 21st century.   Finally, we will be fiscally responsible with the people's money on  all spending and work to reduce our deficit.   On the district level, we plan to maximize Opportunity Zones to  revitalize our small cities, focus on workforce development to match  the enhanced demands of the 21st century workplace, maximize the  economic opportunities of our area which will create good-paying jobs,  improve our flood mitigation without putting it on the backs of our  taxpayers, supporting police and first responders to maintain a high  level of public safety, and continue to work to wipe out the terrible  epidemic of drug addiction.   Mr. Speaker, if we can accomplish these goals, we will have an  incredibly successful 2020 and pave the way for a great American  decade.   Let's stop confusing activity with accomplishment. Let's keep our  eyes on the prize with clear 20/20 vision to get things done for the  American people.                            ____________________
