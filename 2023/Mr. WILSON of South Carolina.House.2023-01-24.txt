 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, last year was difficult  for the American family. Under disastrous policies of Biden and the  Democrat-led Congress, inflation reached 40-year highs, causing  everyday prices to skyrocket.   December marked the 21st straight month that inflation was higher  than real wages. As a result, Americans are relying on credit cards as  payment, and nearly half are carrying debt from month to month, up 39  percent from last year, according to Bankrate.   Credit card balances increased 15 percent versus last year, the  largest increase in more than 20 years, according to a recent quarterly  report of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.   When Biden took office in 2021, inflation was 1.4 percent, but it has  risen nearly 14 percent since then, destroying jobs.   The House Republican majority is committed to fighting inflation and  lowering the cost of living, creating jobs.    In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Our sympathy to the family of Tom Young, Sr., of Aiken, South  Carolina.                            ____________________
