 Madam President, I rise today in opposition to Republican  efforts to nullify the Department of Labor's rule that protects  retirees and affirms decades of precedent. This rule allows those  investing retirees' savings the freedom to direct those funds where the  retirees want them to go. It lets them protect those funds from costly  risks posed by worsening environmental disasters or unsafe and unfair  working conditions and seek out promising, sustainable, long-term  investment opportunities.   Republicans' latest front in their wholly made up culture war is an  attack on ``woke capitalism,'' and American retirees are apparently  their targets. In particular, Republicans have set their sights on  retirees who choose to invest their money with environmental, social,  and governance--ESG--factors in mind.   Now, investors have actually been doing this for decades. The  Department of Labor has repeatedly said that under the Employment  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA, retirement plan  managers may consider all--all--relevant economic factors when making  investment decisions if it is in the best interest of the plan's  participants. That includes ESG factors, like how a company treats its  workers or whether the company is sufficiently protected from climate  risks and whether the company respects human rights.   It turns out, investors really want to know these things. You don't  need to be a financial wizard to realize that whether a company invests  in its workers or is vulnerable to climate risks might be relevant to  the company's long-term prospects and the potential returns on your  investment.   But the Trump administration put blinders on investors when, in 2020,  it finalized a rule limiting that and made it harder for retirees to  invest with ESG considerations in mind. In 2022, the Biden  administration Department of Labor rightfully removed these roadblocks  and affirmed that retirement fiduciaries have the option to consider  ESG factors when making investments on behalf of retirees.   Let's be very clear about what this rule does not do. It does not  mandate anything. It does not require that fiduciaries invest or not  invest in certain funds. It does not tell fiduciaries to consider or  not to consider certain factors. There is nothing new here and  certainly nothing extreme.   Let's be clear. By overturning the Department of Labor's rule,  Republicans want to tie investors' hands and override the free market.  This fight isn't about protecting and strengthening Americans'  retirement security. It is not about ensuring that retirement plan  fiduciaries are making sound financial investments. And it sure as heck  is not about capitalism. It is politics, plain and simple.   How do I know that? Well, Republicans clearly believe that investment  decisions should be made with consideration of ESG factors so long as  they are ESG factors that the Republicans support. My colleague Senator  Rubio has championed legislation that would prevent Federal Government  employees' retirement assets from being invested in Chinese and Russian  companies.   At the same time, Republicans also seem to believe that government  shouldn't restrict investors' ability to put their money wherever they  want. In response to the Department of Labor's very sensible guidance  warning about the financial risks of investing in crypto scams, my  colleague Senator Tuberville introduced a bill that would prohibit any  guidance that would limit the type of investments that workers can  make. He said:         The government has no business standing in the way of       retirement savers who want to make their own investment       choices.    So add up what the Republicans have already told us with the  legislation they are sponsoring. Retirees should have the freedom to  invest their hard-earned money in crypto scams, but they should not  even be allowed to consider whether a company relies on child labor or  is polluting the planet or is underpaying its workers when deciding  whether or not an investment is sustainable. It just doesn't make any  sense, and it is not supposed to.   There is a bigger picture here that Americans need to understand.  Republicans know that President Biden will veto this resolution the  minute it hits his desk. They know it won't succeed in nullifying the  Department of Labor's rule. So what is the point of doing this?  [[Page S552]]    Well, Republicans have been explicit that the goal of this exercise  is to help their buddies in the courts. President Trump appointed  judges across the country who are now engaged in a disturbing assault  on the regulatory state and are hell-bent on kneecapping any effort to  make markets fairer, to make workers safer, and to make the environment  cleaner. This resolution is just one more attempt by Republicans to  give an assist to these extremist judges and make it easier for the  courts to overturn the rule and undermine the law.   Let's call this attack on the Department of Labor's rule what it  really is--a wholly invented grievance to advance corporate special  interests, not the interests of retirees.   Democrats need to stick together on this and reject these cynical  efforts to undermine investor protection and empower extremist  Republican courts.   I yield the floor.
