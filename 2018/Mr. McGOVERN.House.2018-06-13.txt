 Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring attention to a recent  study published by Kranti Mulik and Lindsey Haynes-Maslow in the  Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior. Their research confirms  what we already  [[Page H5098]]  know about SNAP and what the Agriculture Committee has discovered  during our thorough review of the program; and that is, that current  benefits averaging only a $1.40 per person per meal are not enough to  cover the cost of a healthy diet.   Drs. Mulik and Haynes-Maslow set out to explore how much it costs  families to follow the MyPlate dietary guidelines set by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture, and then estimated the additional resources  families on SNAP would need to follow these recommendations for a  healthy diet.   They discovered that a family of four with two adults and two  children between the ages of 8 and 17 needed between $1,109 and $1,249  a month to follow USDA's recommendations for a healthy diet, including  the time to prepare nutritious meals. The research found this type of  family, a family of four with two older kids, would need an additional  $627 per month to eat a nutritious diet.    Overall, the research determined that current SNAP benefits only  cover about 43 to 60 percent of the food budget needed to follow  MyPlate recommendations. These findings underscore the need for  Congress to protect SNAP and further expand access to nutritious food  by increasing benefits. This is especially important as we continue to  learn more about the negative health impacts exacerbated by hunger and  a lack of access to nutritious food.   Unfortunately, some in this House have turned efforts to help our  constituents put food on their table when times are tough into an  ideological crusade and, quite frankly, it is unconscionable. Food  ought to be a fundamental right for every single person.   Republicans on the House Agriculture Committee and in the Republican  leadership of this House advanced a farm bill last month that would  have done irreparable harm to our anti-hunger safety net. It relied on  negative stereotypes and incorrect assumptions about the hardworking  American families who rely on modest SNAP benefits. It would have  slashed SNAP by $23 billion, which would cause millions of Americans to  see their benefits reduced or eliminated entirely.   And not only did this terrible bill single out those vulnerable  adults who are having a difficult time finding stable employment, it  also targeted working families, older adults, and children.   In the United States of America, the richest country in the history  of the world, no person should go to bed hungry or wondering where his  or her next meal is coming from. This Congress ought to be focused on  helping our constituents with a hand up when times are tough, instead  of demonizing the poor and ignoring their struggles.   Now, I am encouraged that the Senate Agriculture Committee is marking  up a bipartisan farm bill today that protects SNAP from harmful cuts  and makes investments in the program to help increase access to healthy  foods. My Republican friends in the House should follow their example.   As we continue through this year's farm bill process, I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject cuts to SNAP benefits  and oppose efforts to reduce access to this critical food assistance  program.   As research has long confirmed, SNAP helps to reduce food insecurity,  promote access to nutritious foods, and improve health. We know that  SNAP benefits must be increased to cover the costs associated with a  nutritious diet. I encourage my colleagues to consider this important  new information and to join me in working to end hunger now.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Bonamici for  yielding time.   First, let me say how proud I am to have introduced the House  companion to an important bipartisan, bicameral bill.   Madam Speaker, one of the most heartbreaking aspects of the opiate  epidemic is that a tremendous strain is placed not only on those who  are struggling with addiction or dealing with substance use disorders,  but also on their families, their friends, and their support networks.   Oftentimes when parents are struggling with addiction and unable to  raise a child, that responsibility falls to a grandparent. Right now,  as has been said, over 2.5 million children are being raised by their  grandparents, and we only expect that number to grow.   These grandparent-led households often face unique challenges. They  may not have time to plan financially for raising another child. They  may not have the resources to ensure their home or their car is ready  to raise a child. There may be barriers for them to access the child's  medical or school information. It may be difficult for them to navigate  the complex school  [[Page H5133]]  requirements in many communities to ensure that their grandchild does  not fall behind during a move. They may need to spend down their  savings or refinance a home in order to provide for their  grandchildren, putting their own financial future in jeopardy.    This bill, the Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act,  will help us bring to the forefront the resources that grandparents  need to raise their grandchildren. It will create an important new  Federal advisory council focused on developing and disseminating  information designed to help grandparents.   The advisory council would examine information about how to address  mental health issues, how to navigate school systems, and how to build  social and support networks that create the best possible environment  for children.   Madam Speaker, we are so grateful that these grandparents have  stepped in to care for grandchildren, and we need to do everything we  can to support and sustain them.   Madam Speaker, I thank especially Senator Susan Collins of Maine for  her leadership on this issue, along with Senator Casey from  Pennsylvania, and I am grateful to my colleague, Congressman Peter King  of New York, for his work and help getting this legislation passed.   As we deal with the opiate crisis, we have to deal with many  different issues. There is not just one issue. There are multiple  issues, and this is one of them.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the bipartisan support for my bill, and I  appreciate the gentlewoman for yielding me the time.
