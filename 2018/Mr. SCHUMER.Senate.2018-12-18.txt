 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, with only 4 days remaining until a  lapse in government funding, Democrats still have not heard back from  President Trump about whether he is willing to accept either of our  offers to keep the government funded. For that matter, Republicans in  Congress--both the House and Senate--have been almost entirely silent  about what plan they might support to avoid a shutdown. They say that  they want to avoid a shutdown, but our Republicans in the House and  Senate have no plan. Senate Republicans were telling reporters they had  no idea what the White House's plan was or even if it had one.   Let me remind my Republican colleagues and President Trump that  Democrats have put two reasonable ways to avoid a shutdown on the  table: the six appropriations bills plus a 1-year CR for homeland  security or a CR for all seven bills to fund the government.   Neither proposal contains a single Democratic demand. No Democrat is  pounding a fist on the table, saying that we have to shut down the  government unless we get our way--the way President Trump is. We only  want to fund the government. If President Trump were to accept either  proposal, it would sail through the House and Senate, and we could  conclude the Nation's business before the Christmas holiday.   The only proposal that cannot pass is the President's demand for an  unnecessary, ineffective, exorbitantly expensive border wall. So if  President Trump throws a temper tantrum and clings to his position on  the wall, he will not get a wall, but he will cause a Trump shutdown  over Christmas.   With only a few days to go until appropriations lapse on Friday at  midnight, President Trump needs to come out of hiding and accept one of  our proposals to keep the government open. Either will get a majority  of votes on the floor of the House and the Senate                            ____________________     A ruling last Friday from a Federal judge in Texas has  put the future of the Affordable Care Act in doubt. Every American  should be aware of the fact that if the rule is upheld, the entire law  will come crashing down, including health insurance for 20 million  Americans, protections for 130 million Americans living with  preexisting conditions, parental health coverage for millions of  Americans under the age of 26, and essential benefits like maternity  care, mental health treatment, preventive screenings, money for opioid  treatment.   It would cause nothing short of chaos in our healthcare system and  calamity for millions of American families if this court case were to  prevail.   We don't believe the ruling should stand or will stand, but the  danger it poses is so great that we can't simply hope for the right  result. We should do something quickly to allow the Senate to be heard  and to persuade the courts not to tear down the healthcare law.  [[Page S7739]]    Senator Manchin has a resolution to authorize the Senate legal  counsel to defend the Affordable Care Act on behalf of the Senate. We  intend to force a vote on his resolution as soon as possible.   Every Republican who claims to be for protections for preexisting  conditions ought to vote aye on that resolution. It is the quickest and  best way to ensure that the court case against the Affordable Care Act  does not remove these protections and the rest of our healthcare law.   Legislation--some of my colleagues are seeking refuge: Well, we will  just pass legislation to tweak this or tweak that. Legislation would be  difficult and slow and, frankly, unnecessary at this stage. We know how  hard it is to do any healthcare legislation in this body.   Unfortunately, a good number of Republicans and President Trump, by  their actions, have shown they want to cut healthcare. We are never  going to get a deal with Democrats in the Senate--or the House  Democrats who are going to be in charge--on doing that.   Senator Manchin's proposal is the best and first way to go. I urge my  friends on the other side--all who talked about preexisting conditions:  Put your money where your mouth is and support Senator Manchin's  solution. To Leader McConnell, who says he wants to protect preexisting  conditions: Bring the Manchin resolution to the floor.                            ____________________     Later this afternoon, the Senate will likely vote on a  package of amendments and then final passage of bipartisan criminal  justice reform. I wholeheartedly support the bill and intend to vote  yes on final passage later today.   Among other important changes, the legislation will give judges more  discretion in sentencing for low-level, nonviolent drug offenders who  cooperate with the government. It will provide more support and new  incentives for prisoners to participate in programming or other  productive activities that will better prepare them to return to  society as productive individuals, and it will effectively end the  practice of juvenile solitary confinement and the cruel shackling of  pregnant prisoners.   Despite what some of the opponents of the bill claim, the legislation  is certainly not a ``get out of jail free'' card for violent criminals  or sex offenders. That is simply not true.   Rather, the bill makes smart changes to our criminal justice system  in ways that make it more fair, more humane, and more just. Individuals  serving time in prison for these low-level prison crimes--nonviolent  drug offenders--will eventually be released.   It is in the interest of both currently incarcerated individuals and  the communities to which they will eventually return to ensure we are  doing everything in our power to set them up for successful  reintegration into our society so that they don't commit another crime.  It is very important and the right thing to do. We need workers. We  need productive citizens. We can't take 5 percent of America and just  write them off. This bill says that we can't.   I want to commend so many people who did such good work on this bill.  I want to thank my colleague Senator Durbin. This has been a passion of  his for many years. I want to thank Senator Booker, who was principled.  He knew when to hold, knew when to fold. That is why we have such a  good bill. I want to thank Senator Whitehouse, who worked really hard  to make sure those in prison would get the kind of training and drug  treatment they need so that they can be successful and productive  citizens when they get outside.   I want to thank some of our Republican colleagues--the Senator from  Iowa and the Senator from Utah--who had the courage to stand up and do  the right thing here. There will be those on either side who object to  things that were left out or included in the bill. As I say often, that  is the nature of compromise. You can't let the perfect be the enemy of  the good.   This bill, with strong bipartisan support, should pass this afternoon  with strong bipartisan majorities.                            ____________________     Finally, on a matter near and dear to my heart, the  great Senator from the great State of Indiana--unfortunately, we are  going to be saying goodbye to Members of our caucus who won't be  returning to the 116th. This morning, I want to share some words about  the senior Senator from Indiana, my dear friend Joe Donnelly.   Most folks don't know this, but Joe is actually a native New Yorker.  Maybe it is because of his affable personality, his agreeableness, his  midwestern decency that folks don't think he came from New York, and  they are surprised to learn it.   After falling in love with Indiana after college, Joe is now fond of  saying: ``You can pick where you live, but you can't pick where you're  born.'' Joe, on behalf of all New Yorkers, I officially forgive you for  saying that.   But like all of the young Irish Catholic kids from Long Island, Joe's  dream was to go to Notre Dame. Joe likes to say that all good Irish  Catholic kids are handed an application to Notre Dame, along with their  baptism, and go to Notre Dame Joe did, where his long career and life  in the State of Indiana began.   Something about Joe's inherent decency drew people toward him. His  first foray in politics came when he received a phone call from a local  official in the Democratic Party. Joe thought he was calling to ask for  a donation, but the official instead asked him if he would like to run  for the State legislature. Joe responded: ``OK, I'm eating my cereal;  I'll get back to you on that.'' The people of Indiana and the people of  America are glad Joe finished that bowl of cereal and decided a career  in public service might suit him.   It didn't happen right away though. Joe lost that first race. A few  years later, he found himself coaching the son of his opponent from  that race in a local basketball league. At the first practice, sensing  trepidation in the young man, Joe hugged him and said: Don't worry. It  won't affect your playing time.   That is the kind of little story that shows the decency of Joe  Donnelly--what a good man he is, how he cares about other people's  feelings, how he holds no grudges or resentments and always gives his  political opponents and, in this case, their children the benefit of  the doubt.   He always tried to see things from other people's perspective. That  quality is what made him such an effective and well liked Member of  this body. It is hard to be both effective and well liked here. Joe is  both.   And, of course, he hustled. A Donnelly day in Indiana is legendary  among his staff. It begins before sunrise and ends long after the sun  has set.   I travel to every county in my State every year, which is 62. Joe, of  course, outdid me. He makes it to each of Indiana's 92 counties every  year. When he offers an opinion on where to find the best gas station  or fried chicken in Indiana, you know it is coming from real authority.   Joe's dad was a small business owner on Long Island who used to tell  him as a boy: Joe, just do the work. That is what Joe Donnelly did. He  did the work. And because he did the work, even in this divided  Congress and this divided partisan era, Joe got a whole lot done. He  passed right-to-try legislation, which, according to Republican Senator  Ron Johnson, ``would not have happened without Joe Donnelly.''   There are going to be people who live decades from now because of his  hard work and passion on that bill. Joe worked tirelessly on behalf of  veterans as a member of Armed Services, and he passed legislation to  reduce the number of military suicides. Again, there are going to be  families who don't have to live with suicide of a family member,  service member because of Joe's hard work and dedication and political  skill in getting this passed.   Joe worked across the aisle with Senator Young, his colleague, to  pass a bill that would improve mental health assistance for our police  because he knew, coming from a family of police officers, the daily  strain that officers undergo in risking their lives for our safety.   I could go on, but suffice it to say that Joe Donnelly will leave  this Chamber with an outstanding bipartisan legacy in his wake.   So at a time when our politics is so angry and divisive, losing  someone like  [[Page S7740]]  Joe Donnelly is a real loss. It is a loss for this body, a loss for the  State of Indiana, and a real loss for America. He is an independent man  and an honest person, and in a politics that is far too short on both,  we will miss his steady hand here in the Senate, but also at first  base, where he was relied on in the Congressional Baseball Games year  after year.   We thank Jill, his lovely wife, whom he met in Indiana. Maybe she was  the first reason he never went back to New York. We thank his children,  Molly and Joe, Jr., for letting us borrow him these past 6 years.   Joe and I are friends for life. This election result will not break  that friendship and that bond.   Iris and I and all of the Members of this Chamber wish Joe and his  family the very best. Since there are no New York schools in the  college football playoffs, this Senator will be rooting for Joe's  beloved Fighting Irish.   I yield the floor.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senator be given 3  minutes.    You have 3 minutes.    Look over there.
