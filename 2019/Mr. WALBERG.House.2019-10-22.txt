 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 552 and  call on the Russian Government to provide evidence of wrongdoing or to  release United States citizen Paul Whelan.   I thank my colleague Congresswoman Haley Stevens for her untiring  work on this important issue. Paul Whelan is a veteran. He is a  Michigan resident, who has been held in Russian captivity for nearly 10  months without charges. And I repeat, he has been held in Russian  captivity for nearly 10 months without charges.    Throughout his entire time, Paul has not been given due process. He  has had multiple pretrial hearings in which his detainment has  repeatedly been extended without the production of any new or credible  evidence. While in captivity he has been in need of serious medical  attention, and his health has deteriorated. It is unacceptable for an  American citizen to be detained for any length of time without charges  and without proper medical care.   Paul's entire family, including his parents who live in my district  in Manchester, Michigan, are deeply concerned about his health and  safety, as they should be. I met with members of the Whelan family on  many occasions, and they have been pillars of strength, but also have  endured much agony.   We stand united today saying this is not a partisan issue. It is an  American issue.   As Republicans and Democrats we are committed to raising awareness  about Paul's case and advocating for his freedom. And we stand to send  a strong and powerful message today by passing this resolution. I  encourage my colleagues to stand together and pass this resolution and  tell Russia it is wrong as to what they are doing.    Madam Speaker, our duly elected President took office,  and even before that, House Democrats have been calling for his  impeachment.   The rationale may keep changing, and it will, but their quest for  impeachment has been never-ending. Yet for some reason, this  impeachment inquiry is being conducted behind closed doors, leaving  many Members of this body and the American people, most importantly, in  the dark.   Is that fairness?   They are even refusing to take a formal vote here on the House floor.  A fair and open process appears to be the least of their concerns.   Instead of wasting valuable time with this baseless inquiry, there is  so much more we could and should be doing.   We could be ratifying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to  help manufacturers and farmers in my district in Michigan and across  the country.   We could be working in a bipartisan fashion to lower healthcare  costs, to continue growing a healthy economy, and to rebuild our roads  and bridges.   Let's stop the impeachment theater and get back to the pocketbook  issues that our constituents care about.                            ____________________
