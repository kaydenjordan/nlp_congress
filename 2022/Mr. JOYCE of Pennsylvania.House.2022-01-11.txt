 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the drug  crisis that is decimating communities and destroying families.   Earlier this month, the CDC released data showing that fentanyl  overdoses are now the number one killer of Americans ages 18 to 45:  number one killer. This data is tragic. No family should have to deal  with the sudden loss of a loved one.   Fentanyl is often ingested unknowingly, and a dose smaller than the  size of a penny can be lethal.   In 2021, President Biden swung open the doors to our southern border,  and the impact of that continues to be negative. That decision invited  drug traffickers into our country. Last year, Border Patrol agents  seized enough fentanyl to kill every man, woman and child in my home  State of Pennsylvania.   We cannot solve this crisis while our borders remain open. We cannot  solve this crisis while the Biden administration fails to act.   This deadly drug will continue to pour into our country if we fail to  build the wall. It will continue to pour into our country if we do not  get the border agents the support and the tools that they need.   This issue is far too important to continue to ignore. Our  communities continue to suffer. Congress should act now to make  fentanyl analogs a schedule one narcotic.   The Biden administration must secure our southern border. Our  communities, they are counting on us to act. We can no longer continue  to let them down.                            ____________________
