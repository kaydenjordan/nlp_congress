 Madam Speaker, I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As a  child, I was always so proud of Milwaukee. You would look at the crime  records or the crime numbers in the biggest cities around the country,  and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, along with San Diego, year after year had the  lowest murder rate in the country.   It is, therefore, very disappointing to find out that at the end of  last year Milwaukee, one more time, set their all-time record for  murders, at 197. This is caused, I think, in no small part by  politicians who scream racism and cause disrespect for the Milwaukee  Police Department, and, therefore, the Milwaukee Police Department has  to back off and not be aggressive, as Milwaukee continues to become  more and more dangerous.   I can only hope in the future that politicians looking to make cheap  points do not further denigrate the Milwaukee police and do not further  cause Milwaukee to hit another record this year in total murders.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, as has just been said, I think the first  year of this administration has been about as disastrous as it could  possibly be.   I will focus on the COVID pandemic. Over 300,000 people had died when  President Biden took office, nevertheless, things in a way were looking  up. Donald Trump had been given a combination of monoclonal antibodies  and several other things in a cocktail in which he was cured just a few  months before President Biden took office.   One would have thought all one had to do was follow down the path of  treatment that Donald Trump received and it would be the end of the  pandemic. Instead, we are over a year after him taking office, and at  least in Wisconsin we don't have enough monoclonal antibodies to deal  with the people who are sick today.   Even though ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine have also shown  promise, the CDC and NIH under President Biden have not shown a  leadership role and encouraged more doctors to use them. Vitamin D can  do a tremendous job in reducing the number of people who succumb to  this disease, but again, a complete lack of leadership out of  Washington, some people feel a complete lack of leadership because  there is not enough money to be made in Vitamin D by the drug  companies.                                time  1945    We recently had calcifediol imported into this country from other  countries, and it has not been anywhere near publicized as it should  be. It is time for President Biden to step up, to make sure monoclonal  antibodies are available to everybody and put an end to the pandemic. I  have had my own staffer use monoclonal antibodies, and it turned him  around from being quite ill within 24 hours just fine.   Madam Speaker, it is time to look at things other than just making  money for the drug companies. It is time to solve this problem.
