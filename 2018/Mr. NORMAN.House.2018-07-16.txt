 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the great  news that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act continues to deliver for the people  and small businesses of the Fifth District of South Carolina.   It has been almost 7 months since tax reform, and our economy is  booming. People have a renewed hope and sense of security in their  futures again.   Firsthand, I see small businesses in my district expanding and  creating more jobs. New hires are at the highest level in 17 years.  Small-business optimism is the highest in decades. Consumer confidence  is at its highest in 2 decades.   I have directly heard from families who are seeing more hard-earned  dollars remaining in their pockets. Because of our pro-growth policies,  our economy, our families, and our businesses in my district and across  the Nation will have strong futures.   Thanks to tax reform, South Carolinians and Americans are better off  now.                            ____________________
