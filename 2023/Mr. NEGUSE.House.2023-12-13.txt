 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Ranking Member for yielding  time.   Republicans have had the majority in this House for 11 months, and  what do they have to show for it? Nothing--no efforts to grow the  middle class, no efforts to lower costs, no efforts to build safer  communities; instead, an effort to default on our Nation's debt, two  attempts to shut down the government, vacating their own Speaker, and  now a baseless impeachment that they are pursuing for one reason and  one reason alone--because former President Trump ordered them to do so.   Ask them to articulate what crime they are investigating, and they  can't give you an answer. Ask them to identify any evidence of  wrongdoing by President Biden--crickets.   Mr. Speaker, the American people, I can assure you, are deeply  disappointed in the actions that House Republicans have taken for the  better part of the last year, and this action is no different.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this farce of a process.  Let's get back to doing the important work that the American people  expect us to do.
