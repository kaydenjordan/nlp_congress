 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chair, this amendment goes backwards in an area where we have  gone forward. This amendment takes us in the wrong direction. For  years, we have had people serving in the military who are openly gay,  lesbian, and transgender, and they have served, and served this country  well.   For a lot of years, we did not allow them to do so openly. We finally  repealed that for lesbians and gays, and now, just last year, we had  the Department of Defense say we are going to do the same thing for  transgender. So the people who have been fighting and protecting our  country will be allowed to do so openly. It does not harm readiness at  all. These people have served in  [[Page H5800]]  the military, served it honorably, and served it well.   As far as the costs, the military pays for people who have  addictions, who have alcoholism, who smoke. They pay for a lot of  things that are contained within the military.   This amendment would target one specific group, and very unfairly.  And most unfairly, it wouldn't just, first of all, target transgender  surgery, it would target some of the hormone drugs, which cost, like,  $100 a year, cost absolutely virtually nothing to the military.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself an additional 30  seconds.   Most importantly, this wouldn't just impact transgender people who  are serving, it would impact their children. If you are serving in the  military and you happen to have a child who is transgender, you would  now be cut off from this military service. All these other things,  alcoholism, drug addiction, smoking, all manner of different problems  would be served, but transgender people would be targeted to not be  allowed to provide healthcare for their children.   This isn't going to help readiness. This is a social agenda that has  no business being in the Defense bill. We didn't have it in committee,  we shouldn't have it here on the floor.   Let's focus on the threats that Mrs. Hartzler talked about, not make  this into a social agenda based on the ignorance of what transgender  truly is.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, there is no study whatsoever that  shows this is going to cost $3.7 billion. And this amendment is not  just about transgender surgery, it is about any treatment. Let's keep  that in mind.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the distinguished minority leader.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney).    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished minority  whip.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I really want to follow up on  the committee chairman's remarks. He is absolutely right. In 2011 and  2012, I was actually very intimately involved in the process of trying  to update the AUMF, and I have all the bruises and scars to show for  it. It is a very difficult process.   The main thing I want to accomplish in my 2 minutes here is to  explain to everybody why we haven't updated it, because there are  actually very clear reasons. I am not sure they are good reasons, but  they are very clear. Everyone sort of acts like: Well, we just haven't  done it. Why are we twiddling our thumbs?   The reason is because, well, lawyers and how words are interpreted.  As we went through and tried to word it exactly correctly, and as we  negotiated with the Senate, we discovered that basically no matter how  you word it, two groups are going to oppose it for diametrically  opposite reasons. One side is going to say that it is too broad; it  gives the President way too much power for too long a period of time  and gives him too open a hand. Other groups will look at that exact  same language and say that this unfairly restricts the President; it is  going to make it more difficult.   You have these conversations those of us on the committee have with  the Pentagon as they are trying to figure out--I haven't had as many  conversations with the current administration as with the previous, but  I talked at length with the Obama folks about deciding what could they  do? Where could they commit a strike? Against which groups? It was a  very lengthy process to go back through and try to figure out whether  or not it was under the law allowed.   So if we change this, the lawyers on both sides are going to go  bananas saying that this new language proves that you can't do that or  it is too broad.   Now, all of that is not to say that we shouldn't do it. We should.  But I just want people to understand the difficulty of it and for our  House to actually be willing--and the Senate--to do the work we should  do.   Don't kid yourself that this is something, well, gosh, we could just  do it, it would be easy, and if everyone understands it, we are just  ducking it for no good reason.   It is going to be really, really hard. It is going to take  bipartisan, bicameral cooperation. But it is way past time for us to do  it. Yeah, when we do it, lawyers will interpret it, and there will be  some uncertainty. But there is uncertainty now as they try to, as the  chairman described, bootstrap the 2001 AUMF on to a whole bunch of  other things. We have an obligation to do this even if it is difficult.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment basically  unnecessarily ties the hands of our administration in terms of choosing  how best to spend Defense dollars.   Now, the gentlewoman mentions that this does not say anything about  reducing our submarine force or reducing our bomber force. It does,  however, lock in a certain amount of ICBMs that we have to have, and,  in that sense, it does impact all other choices in terms of our Defense  policy not just within the nuclear framework.    But within the nuclear framework, there is, as I keep emphasizing and  people keep resisting, a finite amount of resources available to fund  the Department of Defense. In fact, that is the central problem with  this whole bill, as I have mentioned.   We don't have a budget resolution. This is $72 billion over-the- budget caps that the House has shown no willingness to vote to lift. So  here we have $72 billion that we are just kind of hoping is going to be  there. So at some point we are going to have to make some choices. I  keep saying that. We keep delaying it--doing CRs. We even shut down the  government once.   We continue to sort of stumble forward with no clear plan, but  amendments like this are just another example of how we lock in a lack  of flexibility in terms of how we spend our money.   What is the best approach to our national security?   Now, it has been mentioned and I keep harping on the fact that we  don't have a national security plan yet. And it has been mentioned,  well, Presidents usually take awhile to deliver them. And okay, fine,  we will, you know, sometime in the next year hopefully get that plan.  But amendments like this trap that plan, restrict the ability of the  President to deal with a finite amount of resources to come with what  is the best approach.                                time  1845    And there are a lot of arguments that ICBMs are not the best approach  to nuclear deterrence. Do we need an absolute fixed amount? I don't  think so. I think we need greater flexibility, particularly as we await  the findings of the Nuclear Posture Review to figure out what our best  strategy going forward is.   So we have all these little parochial pieces where we make sure that  the piece that is closest to us, you can't touch that. We have to have  exactly the same number. That is not in the best interests of a  comprehensive National Security Strategy.   We need flexibility in this budget. We are not going to have as much  money as everybody seems to think that we are going to have. That is  just the fact. We are $20 trillion in debt, running up deficits of $700  billion a year. We have the budget caps. At some point, we are going to  have to start making choices. This amendment does not help in that.    As I like to quote: ``Gentlemen, we are out  of money; it is time to think.''   We are, in fact, running out of money--that is a Winston Churchill  quote, by the way--but we appear to not be willing to do the thinking  part about making choices on where we should not and should spend our  money.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 4  minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers,  and I urge adoption of the amendments en bloc.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I agree with the chairman. I  support the en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time.
