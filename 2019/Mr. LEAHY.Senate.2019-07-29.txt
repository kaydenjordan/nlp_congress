 Today I am introducing, along with 45 Democratic and  Republican cosponsors, the Freedom for Americans to Travel to Cuba Act  of 2019. Identical legislation was introduced on July 25th by  Representatives Jim McGovern and Tom Emmer in the House.   We are introducing this bill for one reason: so Americans can travel  to Cuba in the same way that they can travel to every other country in  the world except North Korea, to which President Trump banned travel by  executive order. Based on my conversations with other Senators, I am  confident that if we were afforded the opportunity to vote on this  bill, more than 60 Senators would support it.   It is indefensible that the Federal government restricts American  citizens and legal residents from traveling to a tiny country 90 miles  away that poses no threat to us. At a time when  [[Page S5147]]  U.S. airlines are flying to Cuba, does anyone here honestly think that  preventing Americans from traveling there is an appropriate role of the  Federal government? Why only Cuba? Why not Venezuela? Or Russia? Or  Iran, or anywhere else? It is a vindictive, discriminatory, self- defeating vestige of a time long passed.   This bill would end these Cold War restrictions on the freedom of  Americans to travel. It would not do away with the embargo.   Americans overwhelmingly favor travel to Cuba. The last poll I saw, a  CBS poll, found that 81 percent of Americans support expanding travel  to Cuba. Officials in the White House, however, have a different  agenda, driven by purely domestic political calculations. They have not  only rolled back steps taken by the previous administration to  encourage engagement with Cuba, they have gone further by imposing even  more onerous restrictions on the right of Americans to travel. As a  result, the number of Americans traveling to Cuba this year is  projected to plummet by half, due to the policies of their own  government. And the thousands of private Cuban entrepreneurs, the taxi  drivers, the Airbnb renters, restaurants, and shops that depend on  American customers are struggling to survive. It is a shortsighted,  anachronistic policy that is beneath our democracy.   I and others, including Republicans, have traveled to Cuba many times  over the past 20 years, met with Cuban officials, with Cubans who have  been persecuted for opposing the government, and with many others.  Every one of us wants to see an end to political repression in Cuba.  The arrests and mistreatment of dissidents by the Cuban government  should be condemned, just as we should condemn such abuses by other  governments including some, like Egypt and Turkey, whose leaders have  been welcomed at the White House and the State Department. Americans  can travel freely to Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, but not to Cuba.   The issue is how best to support the people of Cuba who struggle to  make ends meet, and who want to live in a country where freedom of  expression and association are protected. Anyone who thinks that more  economic pressure, or ultimatums, will force the Cuban authorities to  stop arresting political dissidents and embrace democracy have learned  nothing from history. For more than half a century we tried a policy of  unilateral sanctions and isolation, and it achieved neither of those  goals. Instead, it is the Cuban people who were hurt the most. And it  provided an opening in this hemisphere for Russia, China, and our other  competitors.   Change is coming to Cuba, and we can help support that process. Or we  can sit on the sidelines and falsely claim to be helping the Cuban  people, while pursuing a failed policy of punitive sanctions. The  bipartisan bill I am introducing is about the right of Americans, not  Cubans, to travel. Every member of Congress, especially those who have  been to Cuba, should oppose restrictions on American citizens that have  no place in the law books of a free society.                            ____________________     Today I am introducing, along with 45 Democratic and  Republican cosponsors, the Freedom for Americans to Travel to Cuba Act  of 2019.
