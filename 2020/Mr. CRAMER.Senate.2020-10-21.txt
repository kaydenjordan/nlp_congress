 Thank you, Mr. President, for the recognition, and thank  you also for your excellent tribute to Senator Mark Andrews and his  amazing life of service to North Dakota and to our country. Also, thank  you for switching places with me for a few minutes so I can spend some  time remembering my friend and mentor and our predecessor.   This COVID thing really kind of stinks, all in all. There are lots of  things about COVID-19 that are awful, but one of the biggest things is  so often, many people have been robbed of the opportunity to provide an  appropriate sendoff to a hero, to the heroes whose lives are worthy of  a more noble celebration than what social distancing and small crowds  offer.   As former Grand Forks Herald editor, publisher, and sometimes  political commentator and observer, Mike Jacobs wrote in the Grand  Forks Herald: ``Mark Andrews deserves better.''   I ask unanimous consent to have the Jacobs story printed in the  Record, along with the official obituaries of both Mark and Mary  Andrews   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         Obituary for Mary Andrews         Mary Andrews was born February 10, 1927 in Marshall,       Missouri. She died peacefully on July 16, 2020 surrounded by       family and friends, including her best friend and husband of       seventy-one years, Mark Andrews.        Mary was the only child and the light of the lives of       George and Lucille Willming. They moved to Fargo in 1940 when       Mary was in seventh grade. The Willmings attended Gethsemane       Cathedral on Ninth Street South and so did Mark Andrews'       family. Their friendship began there when the two (neither of       great voice) were asked to fill chairs in the choir.        Mary joined a wonderful potluck in high-school and gained       lifelong friendships there. She went on to graduate with a       degree from Smith College in political science. Mark often       commented that his political success was all due to Mary.       They were a great team--both loved serving the people of       North Dakota.        Mary was active in PEO, Homemakers, her church, The       International Club, and she was president of Junior League       and President of the Congressional Club. She was blessed with       many wonderful friends.        Mary married her best friend, Mark, on June 28, 1949. Mark       and Mary were able to be together to celebrate their 71st       wedding anniversary a little less than three weeks before       Mary's death.  [[Page S6361]]         Mary was a wonderful mother to Mark III (Sue), Sarah (Doug       Herman), and Karen. Mary was a loving grandmother and great-      grandmother to: Mark Andrews IV; Katie and Aaron Locke and       their children: Lucy and Staton; Matt and Poli Herman and       their children: Henry and Caroline; Sam and Mia Herman and       son: Gage; and Joe and Kristin Herman.        Mary and her family were blessed by many excellent       caregivers, including: Bethany at 42nd and Gracepoint, Ethos       Hospice, and especially Missy and Elaina.                                   ____                         Obituary for Mark Andrews II         Mark Andrews II was born May 19, 1926, in Fargo, North       Dakota. He died on October 3, 2020. He was 94.        Mark II was the son of his namesake, Mark Andrews I, also       known as the singing sheriff because he sang with the       Metropolitan Opera in New York before returning to the family       farm near Mapleton, North Dakota and meeting and marrying       Mark II's mother, Lillian Hoyler, a Kindergarten teacher from       Escanaba, Michigan. As a young boy, Mark II lived in the       Sheriff's house, a large brownstone behind the Cass County       Courthouse in Fargo.        Mark's life abruptly changed when his father was seriously       injured during a high speed chase of boot leggers and then       died. Young Mark was twelve when he and his mother and sister       moved to the Siegel Apartments in Fargo. Fortunately although       they had very little, his mother always made her children       feel secure.        In 1939 Mark was in 8th grade at Agassiz Junior High when       he met his best friend, Mary Willming. They married on June       29, 1949, and celebrated their 71st wedding anniversary (81       years of friendship) less than three weeks before Mary's       death on July 16, 2020.        Mark served in the United States Army 1944-1946 as a cadet       at the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York,       until receiving a disability discharge in 1946. He then       returned to North Dakota and attended NDSU where he was proud       to be a Sigma Chi and graduated in 1949. He married his best       friend and took over management of the family farm,       eventually purchasing the land and operating a cattle feed       lot.        Mark served as a director of the Garrison Conservancy       District 1955-1964 and was a member and past president of the       North Dakota Crop Improvement Association.        Mark's degree from NDSU was in agricultural science. Mary's       degree from Smith College was in political science. Soon       politics became an interest. Mark was a Republican National       Committeeman 1958-1962. He was elected to the Eighty-Eighth       United States Congress by special election October 22, 1963       to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Representative       Hjalmar Nygaard; he was re-elected to eight succeeding       congresses serving North Dakota in the United States House of       Representatives from October 22, 1963 until January 3, 1981.       He was elected to the United States Senate in November 1980       with 70% of the vote and served North Dakota there from       January 3, 1981 to January 3, 1987.        Mark worked hard to serve his state in Congress and was       remarkably adept at finding and forming alliances to       accomplish good and get problems solved. He frequently said,       ``You know in those days people from both parties worked       together and we got things done--Quentin Burdick was a good       Democrat and I was a good Republican but we were good friends       and we worked together for North Dakota. This not working       together is foolishness!''        Following his political career Mark and Jacqueline Balk-      Tusa established a successful consulting firm based in       Washington, DC; he served as a director of Tenneco, Inc. and       as a director of Nodak Mutual Insurance.        Mark was blessed with a long and wonderful life. He was so       large at 6'4" and full of stories and love for his family,       his farm and his state that it is hard to believe he can be       gone. Our sadness is tempered by our knowledge that he is       once again with his best friend of eighty-one years and at       peace.        Those blessed to mourn Mark are his sister, Barbara Bertel;       his children, Mark III (Sue), Sarah (Doug Herman) and Karen;       grand and great-grandchildren: Mark Andrews IV, Katie and       Aaron Locke and their children, Lucy and Staton; Matt and       Poli Herman and their children, Henry and Caroline; Sam and       Mia Herman and son, Gage and Joe and Kristin Herman.        Mark and his family were blessed by his excellent       caregivers, especially Missy Williams, Elaina McDonald and       Allison Brocht.                                   ____                 [From the Grand Forks Herald, Oct. 14, 2020]                   Mike Jacobs: Sic Transit Gloria Mundi                          (Written by Mike Jacobs)         Mark Andrews deserved better. He was a prominent and       sometimes commanding figure in North Dakota politics for a       quarter of a century, the victor in a titanic struggle for       control of the Republican Party in the state--the dominant       party then as now. In the end, he was an independent voice,       as critical of Republicans when they deserved it as he was of       Democrats when he campaigned against them. All told, he       served for 17 years in the U.S. House of Representatives and       six in the U.S. Senate. He lost the Senate seat in a close       election in 1986.        Andrews died Saturday, Oct. 3. He was 94 years old. His       death wasn't reported until the following Tuesday, Oct. 6,       and then apparently because a funeral home routinely       submitted an obituary.        Andrews deserved a bigger sendoff. Thirty-four years away       from the limelight don't diminish his impact or his       importance.        At just 36 years old, Andrews was a prodigy with a pedigree       when he first came to prominence as the Republican candidate       for governor in 1962. Like many of the state's governors, he       had deep roots in the Red River Valley. His family had farmed       near Mapleton, just west of Fargo, for two generations, and       his father had been sheriff of Cass County, then as now the       state's most populous and most powerful.        Andrews lost that first election to William Guy, who was a       bit older, though still youthful, and who ran as the       candidate of the emergent Democratic-NPL Party. For newcomers       and neophytes, those last three letters stand for Nonpartisan       League, an insurgent movement that brought North Dakota a       state-owned bank and mill and elevator. The NPL historically       filed its candidates mostly in the Republican column; the       switch to the Democrats occurred in 1956. This was a tremor       in the seismic change that swept over the state. Having       dominated the state's politics for half a century, William       Langer, known as ``Wild Bill,'' died in 1959. He'd been       successively--though not without interruption--attorney       general, governor and U.S. senator. The special election for       a successor sent a Democrat to the U.S. Senate, Quentin       Burdick.        The great opportunity for young Andrews came in 1963, when       U.S. Rep. Hjalmar Nygaard died of a heart attack in the       capitol building. North Dakota was divided into East and West       congressional districts then, and the contest for the       Republican endorsement for the East District seat was       spirited, pitting the youthful Andrews against a coalition of       conservatives led by John W. Scott of Gilby, a founder of the       John Birch Society. Andrews, the liberal, won.        Of course, the more conservative Republicans haven't given       up. The state's politics today are animated by the same sort       of conflict within the Republican Party, though without the       hysterical anti-communism of the Sixties.        Andrews won the election and immediately built a reputation       as an independent thinker. A Republican to be sure, Andrews       didn't hesitate to take on the party establishment, and even       the president. He indicated that he'd vote to impeach Richard       Nixon, for example, and he frequently challenged Ronald       Reagan's economic and agricultural policies, a posture that       drew national attention not to Andrews alone but to North       Dakota's once-vaunted exceptionalism in national politics--a       heritage that Andrews understood and appreciated.        As congressman and senator, Andrews proved adept at       promoting the state's interests, notably championing the kind       of farm programs that Reagan's market orientation rejected.       He's probably best remembered for his work to promote the       Garrison Diversion project, which would have moved water from       the Missouri River to central and eastern North Dakota.        This issue dominated the state's politics from the mid-      Sixties when Andrews arrived in Washington. Unlike other       state politicians, Andrews sensed that the project wouldn't       survive scrutiny, and he worked to salvage what he could of       the plan. His efforts met hostility from water development       interests in the state, who came to regard Andrews as a kind       of traitor.        They might have provided enough votes to defeat him when he       sought re-election to the U.S. Senate in 1986. That's       impossible to know for sure, of course; there were other       issues of significance in that election, as Richard Fenno's       book, ``When Incumbency Fails,'' illustrates in some detail.        Apart from politics, Andrews had personal appeal. Perhaps       the best illustration is his marriage. He'd known his wife,       Mary Andrews, most of his life, and she became an integral       part of his campaigns. Andrews bought time on Election Eve       each year for what became known as ``The Mark and Mary       Show,'' where the two of them talked about matters pending.       Mary Andrews appeared on their last show, on Election Eve       1986, when she was seriously ill. Her illness and its       treatment had become an issue in the campaign.        Mary Andrews died in July 2020, just months before her       husband's passing.        Mark Andrews' own life can be parsed neatly: roughly 36       years before his prominence in the state's politics, 23 years       as a prominent player, and another 36 years, almost, out of       the spotlight--so much so that his passing went unnoticed for       72 hours.        Sic transit gloria mundi. So goes worldly glory.        For clarity's sake: The State Board of Higher Education has       eight voting members, seven citizens appointed by the       governor who serve four years, and one student who serves but       one year. Faculty and staff each have non-voting       representatives to the board. Measure 1 on the November       ballot would double the number of citizen members.     We are confined to watching funerals on the internet,  leaving us with a sense that our expressions of gratitude and emotions  are inadequate to the honor that is deserved. But fortunately for the  Presiding Officer and me, the U.S. Senate does provide an opportunity,  a venue, and an appropriate way to say goodbye to a friend and a mentor  that is commensurate with the incredible quality of the life that we  celebrate.  [[Page S6362]]    Senator Andrews was a giant to me for lots of reasons, not just  because he was 6 feet 4 inches. But from growing up in Kindred, just  about 20 miles south of the Andrews farm just outside of the city  village of Mapleton at the time, to working on his reelection  campaign--the first real job I ever had out of college--to seeking his  guidance as I followed in his footsteps, first in the House of  Representatives and then to the Senate, Mark Andrews was always a  larger-than-life figure and personality to me.   Kris and I were grateful for the counsel he and Mary gave us my first  year in this Chamber just last year. I am really grateful to Mark and  Mary's daughter, Sarah, for facilitating a visit for Kris and me to  come see her parents just last year. This picture will be important to  me forever. It was an emotional time for me. I don't mind telling you  that it was emotional for me to be able to go see Mark at the age of 93  and Mary at the age of 92 and say thank you for the opportunities and  for the grace he afforded me when I didn't deserve it.   I mean no disrespect to any of my colleagues today, but what made me  the most emotional when I walked into Mark's apartment and saw him  sitting in that recliner was that it hit me for the first time in a new  way that the people of North Dakota had given me a responsibility that,  at that time, as I looked at my giant, I didn't feel quite up to. There  it was, with this job that he had and this giant from my youth who did  big things, I suddenly felt, by comparison, quite small. But, as Mark  often did, he encouraged me. He offered a word of encouragement--many  of them. Likewise, Mary did the same. At the age of 92, she offered  Kris encouragement that only another Senate spouse really had the  credibility to offer.   I was overwhelmed by the blessing of the moment. I was grateful  beyond words for the opportunity to spend even 90 minutes with Fargo's  most important power couple. It was pretty cool.   Mark and Mary celebrated their 71st wedding anniversary just prior to  her death earlier this year, as the Presiding Officer mentioned. They  met while attending Agassiz Junior High in Fargo in 1939; then they  became best friends for life. It is pretty cool. Pretty cool. I love  that Mary Andrews was her husband's not-so-secret weapon in all of his  successful campaigns.   As the Presiding Officer said, Mark served a total of 23 years in  Congress--17 in the House of Representatives and 6 here in the Senate.  His hallmark was his fierce independence. Now, that fierce independence  sometimes was to the chagrin of the Reagan administration. He served  during a very, very difficult time in farm country, but he fought  tirelessly with the government on behalf of the people. He always put  the people ahead of the government.   As the Presiding Officer mentioned, anyone who spent any time with  Mark--and he and I did a lot in the last several years--knows that no  computer hard drive in the world contains as much knowledge and  information about water policy as Mark Andrews had in his brain, even  to the end. Of the 90 minutes we talked last year, I am sure 60 of them  were spent talking about water policy and water politics.   He was passionate about the accomplishments, as the Presiding Officer  said, and the shortcomings of the government's promise to distribute  Missouri River water to the farms and communities of Eastern North  Dakota. He fought and advocated for water justice for our farmers, and  I think of him often as we engage in the very same fights today. He was  also a strong, strong critic of government waste.   You are right that he supported our military fiercely. There was a  famous story about when he opposed the sale of AWACS to Saudi Arabia on  behalf of our ally Israel, and it took a lot of, shall we say, gentle  persuasion to convince him otherwise.   He always looked out for the taxpayer. He cared more about the  taxpayer than the tax spender. He demonstrated his commitment to fiscal  restraint when he took on the Department of Defense in 1983, sponsoring  a bill requiring defense contractors to guarantee their hardware. The  bill passed and became law. He was also critical of what he called the  ``incestuous relationship'' between the officers who made the weapons  purchase decisions and the contractors who employed the officers after  they retired.   But, as the Presiding Officer pointed out in his remarks, Mark  Andrews was first and foremost a farmer. Don't take our word for it. It  is not just a couple of hayseeds from North Dakota who will make that  claim. No, just look at the headlines surrounding his recent death.   The New York Times, in an obituary written by Robert McFadden,  carries the headline ``Mark Andrews, North Dakota Farmer-Politician,  Dies at 94.'' Did you catch that? Farmer first, the dash of life, and  politician last.   McFadden writes this in his story:         As his 23-year congressional career drew to a close, The       New York Times said Mr. Andrews kept ``three items at the top       of his priority list:''--    A lot like you, I might say to the Presiding Officer--       ``farmers, farmers and farmers.''    The headline for a story written by Mikkel Pates in Agweek--a friend  of ours, a reporter; actually, an agricultural reporter--he described  Senator Andrews' legacy: ``Andrews was a political `laser beam' for  farm interests.''   I ask unanimous consent to have both the Agweek and the New York  Times stories printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Oct. 7, 2020]          Mark Andrews, North Dakota Farmer-Politician, Dies at 94                          (By Robert D. McFadden)         Mark Andrews, a North Dakota Republican farmer whose       strident support for farmers helped him win nine elections to       the House of Representatives and one to the Senate, but who       could not stave off defeat for a second Senate term in 1986,       died on Saturday in Fargo, N.D. He was 94.        The Hanson Runsvold Funeral Home in Fargo confirmed the       death on its website.        As his 23-year congressional career drew to a close, The       New York Times said Mr. Andrews had kept ``three items at the       top of his priority list: farmers, farmers and farmers.''        Tall (6 foot 4), plain-spoken and rawboned, Mr. Andrews       raised wheat, sugar beets and corn for 13 years before       venturing into public life. He was the third generation in       his family to work a 1,280-acre Red River Valley spread that       had been started by his grandfather, Albion Andrews, in the       Dakota Territory of 1881, eight years before North Dakota       became a state.        His father, also named Mark Andrews, was born on the farm       in 1886 and became an opera-singing farmer-politician who       gave concerts in Fargo and in New York and sang for the       voters in his successful 1928 campaign for Cass County       sheriff. He served one four-year term, went back to farming       and died after being injured in a car accident.        ``They called him the singing sheriff,'' Mr. Andrews       recalled in an interview for this obituary in 2018. ``People       used to say to me, `Well, you're the son of the singing       sheriff,' and ask me to sing. But I couldn't carry a tune in       a bushel basket.''        With an easygoing warmth that appealed to rural voters, he       began his political career in 1963 by winning a special       election after the state's lone member of the House of       Representatives died in office. In 17 years in the House, Mr.       Andrews was a fiscal conservative, favoring spending cuts and       balanced budgets, and a faithful backer of agricultural       subsidies and farm price supports. His re-election became       routine.        But there was another side to Mr. Andrews, and it said much       about his constituents' tolerance. He had a moderate-to-      liberal voting record on social issues, supporting food       stamps and assistance to the poor and opposing bans on       abortion and prayers in public schools. He once endorsed       Nelson A. Rockefeller, New York's liberal Republican       governor, for president.        In a gentler era when politics was less of a blood sport,       he liked Ike and L.B.J.--Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, a       Republican, and Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat. And he       befriended liberal Democrats like Senator Edward M. Kennedy       of Massachusetts and Representative Bob Bergland of       Minnesota, who later became President Jimmy Carter's       secretary of agriculture.        ``Sure, he was a Democrat, and I was a Republican,'' Mr.       Andrews told Inforum.com, The Fargo Forum news website, in       2017, referring to Mr. Bergland. ``He would come to North       Dakota and talk about his good friend Mark Andrews, and I'd       go to Minnesota and talk about my good friend Bob Bergland,       because we really were good friends despite our political       differences.''        The voters did not mind. In 1980, when North Dakota's long-      serving Republican senator, Milton Young, retired, Mr.       Andrews jumped into the race and won the seat with 70 percent       of the votes, part of a swing to Republican control of the       Senate for the first time in decades. He began making       national headlines.        In 1981, as debate swirled over the Reagan administration's       proposed sale of Awacs  [[Page S6363]]       (Airborne Warning and Control System) planes to Saudi Arabia,       Mr. Andrews joined liberal Democrats in opposing the sale as       a peril to Israel. But after meeting with a persuasive       President Ronald Reagan, he and four other senators switched       sides, providing the margin to approve the arms sale, the       biggest in the nation's history.        Senator Andrews took on the Defense Department in 1983 by       sponsoring what became a law--backed by a bipartisan       coalition in Congress--that required makers of military       weapons to guarantee their hardware. He criticized       ``incestuous relationships'' between military officers who       bought weapons and defense contractors who often hired the       officers in retirement.        And in 1985, as a crisis loomed over the farm economy, he       took on the Reagan White House, writing a bill to stabilize       farm incomes by subsidizing commodity prices at steady levels       over several years.        Reagan opposed the measure as a budget-buster, arguing that       subsidies encouraged surplus production and depressed       markets. But he signed the measure anyway, hoping that rising       commodity exports might eventually wean farmers from costly       price supports.        As Senator Andrews ran for re-election in 1986, Republican       anxiety ran high across the Farm Belt, where a devastating       combination of falling land values, slumping market prices,       high interest rates and dwindling exports had driven       thousands of once-prosperous farm families off their land and       inflicted economic pain on small towns.        Trying to preserve Republican control of the Senate, Reagan       campaigned in North Dakota three times for Mr. Andrews. But       the dismal farm economy counted for more than the president's       charisma. On Election Day, Mr. Andrews lost by 3,785 votes,       out of 182,600 cast, to the Democrat Kent Conrad, the state       tax commissioner. South Dakota's Republican Senator, James       Abdnor, also lost. (Mr. Conrad would have a long career in       the Senate, retiring in 2013.)        ``The farmers were saying they were not happy with the       president's farm policies,'' Mr. Andrews' campaign manager,       Bill Sorenson, said in a day-after analysis. ``Yet they were       saying this president is a great fellow, and they took their       resentment of his policies out on senators.''        Mark Andrews II was born in Fargo on May 19, 1926, to Mark       and Lillian (Hoyler) Andrews, a former kindergarten teacher       from Michigan. He graduated from Fargo Central High School in       1943. After a year at North Dakota Agricultural College (now       North Dakota State University), he attended the United States       Military Academy at West Point for two years, leaving on a       disability discharge, his family said, then returned to North       Dakota Agricultural and graduated in 1949.        In 1949, he married Mary Willming, whom he had known since       eighth grade. She died in July. He is survived by a son, Mark       III; and two daughters, Sarah Herman and Karen Andrews; and a       sister, Barbara Bertel; as well as grandchildren and great-      grandchildren.        After his political career, Mr. Andrews became a Washington       lobbyist and consultant. In 1995, he retired to his farm, in       Mapleton, N.D., which had grown to 3,000 acres. In recent       years he had resided at Bethany Retirement Living at Grace       Pointe in Fargo.        Mr. Andrews called 1980 the high point of his political       life. ``It was the year I was elected to the Senate,'' he       said in the Times interview ``and in North Dakota I outpolled       the head of the Republican ticket, Ronald Reagan.''                                   ____                         [From AGWEEK, Oct. 15, 2020]          Andrews Was a Political `Laser Beam' for Farm Interests                             (By Mikkel Pates)         Mapleton, N.D.--Former U.S. Sen. Mark Andrews, R-N.D., who       died at age 94 on Oct 3, 2020, had an outsized impact and       intimate knowledge of the region's agricultural industry--      both in Washington, D.C., and back home.        His agricultural roots ran deeper than the state itself.        Officially, he was Mark Andrews II. His grandparents were       from New York state and were Michigan-trained medical doctors       who moved to Dakota Territory in the late 1870s, prior to       statehood in 1889. The Andrewses bought some farmland near       Mapleton, N.D., and established a farm.        Later, Andrews' father, Mark I, and uncle Arlo farmed it in       a partnership. Mark I was trained as an opera singer and sang       in the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He was dubbed the       ``singing sheriff' and died from injuries in an auto chase       with a perpetrator. Mark II was 12.                              Farming, politics         Mark II grew up in Fargo and was active in Boy Scouts and       Republican politics, said his daughter, Sarah Andrews Herman.       He started West Point, but resigned because of a back injury,       and took up agriculture at what is now North Dakota State       University. In 1948 he married his wife, Mary, a political       science graduate of Smith College in Massachusetts, where       Nancy Reagan, Gloria Steinem and Barbara Pierce Bush had       graduated.        The Andrewses moved on the farm in 1949. With Mary at his       side, in 1960 he ran unsuccessfully for governor against Bill       Guy, an Amenia farmer and agricultural economist. It was the       first year John F. Kennedy was elected president and the       first year of the Democratic-Nonpartisan League party in       North Dakota.        Standing 6-foot-4, Mark II went on to win a House seat in a       special election in 1963. He became a member of the       Appropriations Committee, and served as the chairman of the       agricultural subcommittee, working with two North Dakota U.S.       senators--Milt Young, a Republican, and Quentin Burdick, a       Democrat.        Bob Christman, a former agricultural aide to Young (often       dubbed ``Mr. Wheat'') recalled that Andrews was always a       ``spokesman for, fought for agriculture.'' Andrews was known       for cross-party alliances, including with Burdick.        In 1980 Andrews won the Senate seat with 70% of the vote.       Mary Ann Bond of Fargo, an aide to Andrews from 1964 to 1983       in the House and Senate, said Andrews was an advocate of       sugar policies, but worked on other projects, including with       then-University of North Dakota President Tom Clifford in       establishing UND as an aviation education leader, which later       paved the way for the state's leadership in drone technology.         ``Agriculture is what we worked on every day,'' Bond said.       ``It was the one area he wasn't willing to compromise on.''                                `A laser beam'         Clare Carlson, today's state director of the USDA's Rural       Development agency in the Trump administration, worked for       Andrews as an ag aide in the Senate as he contributed to the       1985 farm bill, at the height of the farm credit crisis.        ``He was the master of staying on the outside of a deal       until he was needed,'' Carlson recalled.        Carlson said the 1985 bill offered benefits to the farm       economy--including the Conservation Reserve Program land-      idling program and strong increases in allocations to the       Farmers Home Administration loan allocations. The help didn't       come quickly enough for some farmers.        Randy Russell, principal in the The Russell Group Inc., one       of today's top Washington, D.C., lobbying firms, was chief of       staff to then-Secretary of Agriculture John Block for the       1985 farm bill, and was a deputy assistant USDA secretary of       economics. Russell noted that agriculture faces its       challenges today, but not like the 1980s when asset values       declined by 25%. People simply couldn't repay loans.        ``He was a force to be reckoned with. He was tough,''       Russell recalled, of Andrews. ``He was a fierce advocate for       rural development and sugar. He focused like a laser beam on       things that he wanted.''        Andrews lost his seat in 1986 in a close election with Sen.       Kent Conrad, D-N.D., despite bringing in President Ronald       Reagan and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan. Pundits       speculated some voters were looking for different leadership.       Others said Andrews hurt himself politically when his family       sued St. Luke's Hospital in Fargo, for $10 million, alleging       medical malpractice in Mary's meningitis case. The Andrews       family won the suit in June 1984 but received no financial       damages.        After his children were grown, the Mark and Mary Andrews       lived in the famed Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C., but       his heart was on the farm, where the Hermans now live,       retired from legal careers.                             Progressive farmers         The Andrews family were progressive farmers. In the past,       they'd fed cattle and raised sugar beets before and after       American Crystal Sugar Co. became a cooperative. They built a       grain elevator and were growers of certified seeds. In the       later years, their crops were primarily com, soybeans and       wheat.        For many years, the senator's son, Mark III, ran the       operation until the land was rented out about five years ago.       At its apex, the farm grew to 5,000 acres, including 3,000       owned acres. They raised com, soybeans and wheat.        As the worldwide farm crisis deepened in 1986, Steiger went       into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and emerged by       selling to J.I. Case, which since the 1970s had owned half of       J.I. Case. (In 1984 Case had acquired International Harvester       assets, eventually marketed as Case-IH.)        Mark III said his father had used John Deere equipment, but       also liked Steiger tractors, developed in the Red River       Valley and manufactured in Fargo--high horsepower, four-      wheel-drives with an oscillating, articulated design.       Sometimes company engineers would test their prototypes on       his farm--only about 15 miles from the factory.        In the 1990s, Mark III surprised his dad when he bought a       Case-IH tractor and set of grain drills from Jim Williams,       who ran Arthur (N.D.) Mercantile, the oldest one-family farm       equipment company in the state. He remembers his father--      flying in from Washington--wondering ``what the hell I'd       done.'' But, in fact, the Andrewses had purchased Case       equipment from the Williams family in earlier decades, so       they shifted almost entirely to Case-IH. (Arthur Mercantile       merged into Titan Machinery of Fargo in 2009 and Williams       went on the board of Titan, the largest string of Case-IH       stores in the country.)        Out of the Senate in January 1987, Andrews started a       political consulting company in Washington. He connected with       Jim Ketelson, Tenneco's CEO, who invited him to run for the       parent company's board of directors.        Tenneco's sold its ag interests to Fiat in 1999, which       later merged the company with  [[Page S6364]]       New Holland Agriculture to form CNH Global. Andrews stayed on       at Tenneco until 2001.        Howard Dahl, chief executive of Amity Technology in Fargo,       whose father, Gene, had been chairman of the board at Steiger       Tractor, said Andrews had a ``positive role, after the       Tenneco acquisition, for keeping Steiger jobs in Fargo.'' The       company would go on to add construction wheel-loaders to its       Fargo production line, adding to its stability.        In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Case-IH developed a       ``Quadtrac'' tractor with four tracks to replace four wheels.       Mark III said his father was a big fan of four tracks       offering particular turning capabilities and traction in Red       River Valley heavy soils that had turned wetter after 1993.        Titan CEO David Meyer said Andrews was a ``gentleman'' and       big proponent of the Quadtrac. The Quadtrac went into       production as a 360 horsepower tractor in 1996. Today there       are eight models from 370 to 628 horsepower, including the       470, featured on a pedestal at the company's factory in       Fargo.     ``Farmer,'' ``fiercely independent,'' ``fiscal hawk''-- all of the good things the Presiding Officer said about him--they  describe a part of Senator Mark Andrews, but to me, he is still a  giant.   At his funeral, the Gospel text that was read was from an agrarian  parable in Matthew 13--a very familiar one to most people--where Jesus  talks about the teeny mustard seed. In verse 32, He is recorded as  saying: ``Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it  is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree so that birds can  come and perch in its branches.''   Mark Andrews was a really big tree with really big roots into the  soil of the Red River Valley of North Dakota. I felt as though I had  found a perch on his branches and stand on his shoulders.   Mark and Mary also died with the Gospel promise that Christ has  prepared a mansion for them in Heaven. I am pretty sure it is a  farmhouse.   Thank you, Senator Andrews. You served North Dakota well and will be  missed.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object, I served as an economic  regulator of utilities for nearly 10 years before coming to Congress.  This idea of a moratorium--a national moratorium--violates all kinds of  things, not the least of which, by the way, seems to me to be, at the  very least, the spirit, if not the literal Constitution that my  colleague from Oregon says he is so proud of.   Remember, the States created the Federal Government, not the other  way around. As a State regulator of natural gas and electric utilities,  I saw  [[Page S6371]]  from time to time the attempted overreach of the Federal Government to  mandate things. It violates the principles of the Constitution, and it  violates, really, the best practices of States' rights, of communities'  rights, of rural electric's rights because it assumes that somehow we  here in these Chambers know better than the utility regulators who are  appointed by Governors--the ones who are elected, like I was--the  municipalities that set the rates for water and sewer; that somehow we  are better equipped to make the decisions for a local utility and, yes,  their consumers; that somehow we are better at doing that. It makes no  sense. In fact, it would be very harmful to the very consumers the  Senator from Oregon says he wants to look out for.   Let's just take some examples. Utilities are not capitalized to  provide services for free. That is what this bill would do. And guess  what happens to a regulated utility, an investor-owned utility, when  something like this happens, when the Federal Government throws a  wrench into their local rate structure. Well, somebody eventually has  to pay for that. And guess how the money is raised to pay for the  moratorium? The rates go up. They have to. That is how rate structure  is designed.   If you are a utility--let's say a rural electric cooperative or a  rural telephone cooperative that is providing broadband--that is even  better yet because it is actually the consumers who are the board of  directors. It is the most direct experiment of self-governance that we  have.   So let's please leave the regulation to the locals and to the States.  If there is a need for a moratorium or a design for some different  structure, they can do it in concert with the consumers, the  regulators, and, of course, the utilities in a way that does the least  harm. That makes all the sense in the world.   But here is, in my mind, the richest irony of this moment. The  Senator from Oregon talked about the high unemployment rate, the large  unemployment numbers. Just today we had the opportunity on this floor,  when Republicans brought a bill that would have provided $300 a week of  federally funded supplement to unemployment insurance benefits to those  unemployed people--$300 a week--do you know how many utility bills that  would have helped pay without disrupting the utilities' rate structure?  Just today we had that moment, and the Senator from Oregon and every  one of his Democratic colleagues voted against it--not for the first  time, by the way, but for the second time. And here we are tonight  coming up with a piecemeal solution when the more comprehensive one was  rejected.   So for those reasons and several others I could think of, but the  hour is getting late, I object.
