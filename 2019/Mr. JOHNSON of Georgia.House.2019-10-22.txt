 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1123) to amend title 28, United States Code, to  modify the composition of the eastern judicial district of Arkansas,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1123         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Divisional Realignment for       the Eastern District of Arkansas Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. REALIGNMENT OF THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS.         Section 83(a) of title 28, United States Code, is amended       to read as follows:      ``Eastern District        ``(a) The Eastern District comprises three divisions.        ``(1) The Central Division comprises the counties of       Cleburne, Cleveland, Conway, Dallas, Drew, Faulkner, Grant,       Jefferson, Lincoln, Lonoke, Perry, Pope, Prairie, Pulaski,       Saline, Stone, Van Buren, White, and Yell.      Court for the Central Division shall be held at Little Rock.        ``(2) The Delta Division comprises the counties of       Arkansas, Chicot, Crittenden, Desha, Lee, Monroe, Phillips,       and St. Francis.      Court for the Delta Division shall be held at Helena.  [[Page H8358]]         ``(3) The Northern Division comprises the counties of Clay,       Craighead, Cross, Fulton, Greene, Independence, Izard,       Jackson, Lawrence, Mississippi, Poinsett, Randolph, Sharp,       and Woodruff.      Court for the Northern Division shall be held at       Jonesboro.''.       SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.         This Act and the amendment made by this Act shall take       effect on the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1123, which would amend current law to  reduce the number of operating divisions in the Eastern District of  Arkansas from five to three.   This legislation, introduced by Congressman Rick Crawford from  Arkansas, has the support of every member of the Arkansas congressional  delegation.   The bill was prompted by the closure in 2017 of the only Federal  courthouses in two of the divisions. The three new divisions created by  H.R. 1123 would align with the three remaining courthouses in that  district. The new divisional lines are based on caseload history and  travel times to the remaining courthouses.   As chairman of the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee with  jurisdiction over the courts, it is a priority of mine to ensure that  people across this Nation have ready access to the Federal judiciary.   In the context of a bill such as that under consideration here today,  I mean that in a very literal sense, ensuring that jurisdictional lines  are appropriately drawn so that those residing in their bounds are not  unduly burdened by travel time to a courthouse. But this must be  balanced against closing courthouses where resources are not being used  efficiently.   I am satisfied that such a balance has been achieved here, given the  support this bill has gotten from the Judicial Conference, the Judicial  Council of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,  and the chief judge of the Eastern District of Arkansas.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this legislation and urge my  colleagues to support it as well, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time  so that I can close.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1123 is a straightforward  bill that better aligns the divisions of the Eastern District of  Arkansas with the current operations of that district, and so I urge my  colleagues to support the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.
