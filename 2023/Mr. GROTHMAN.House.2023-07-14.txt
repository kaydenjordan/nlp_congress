 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for  introducing this amendment.   I think it is a commonsense amendment. Right now, there are all sorts  of rumors out there that when people are admitted to the service  academies--who, after all, are going to wind up running our military,  the one part of our government that cannot fail--preferences are being  given and they are not always taking the best people that they can.   I want to point out something that is a little bit offensive about  this whole diversity thing. Diversity for people like the Democratic  Party, sadly, is solely determined by your genetics or your DNA or  where your ancestors were 200 years ago.   I will give you an example to show the foolishness of it and that the  real goal here, I think, is to divide Americans.   If I am one-quarter Peruvian, I can identify as Hispanic. I can  identify as Hispanic despite the fact I have never spoken a word of  Spanish and never been south of the border in my life. The people who  just want to divide America would say that I have a unique perspective  growing up in a Milwaukee suburb, despite the fact that I am one- quarter from a different part of the world.   This is preposterous on its face, and it will inevitably lead to  division as we are educating our military that they should look at  people by where their ancestors came from, not as individuals.   This true racism, which is what it absolutely is because that is how  they determine which silo you fit into, has to be ripped away from our  society and the military, in particular.   The idea that we have different viewpoints because of where our  ancestors came from despite the fact that we have not been there and  know nothing of them is preposterous.   Like I said, in addition to the divisiveness, you are going to wind  up with people who are not necessarily the best people to lead our  military. Anybody familiar with military history knows the important  decisions that have to be made during wartime. We want those decisions  made by the brightest people we have, not by people who have been  picked based upon where their DNA was 2,000 years ago.    Mr. Speaker, I won't keep you here for 60 minutes.   There are a couple of issues I think that I have dominated discussion  here the last couple of weeks, or should have dominated the discussion,  that I think deserve a little bit of attention today.   I am going to address, one more time, our crisis at the southern  border. I am a little bit afraid that, as the weeks and months roll on,  people are being accustomed to what is going on at the southern border.  But as with every tragedy that happens in our society, if a tragedy  happens every week or every month, we ought to talk about it every  month.   Now, recently, the Biden administration changed the way we allow  people from certain countries, Cuba, Haiti, one of the Central American  countries, to be able to come in here. But we have to look and see how  many people are crossing the southern border and, if we look, including  people coming across in the new administrative fashion, every month we  continue to hit all-time records of people coming into the United  States.   The most recent month available is May. We are still waiting for the  June numbers. There we have a total of 227,000 people crossing our  southern border. If we compare that to last May, it was 142,000; and if  we compare it to the first May under President Biden, it was 74,000.   So things are going up dramatically, but it seems as though the press  is not as appropriately concerned as they should be. In other words, we  are succeeding in getting them bored; the greater the concern should  be.   I want to point out as well that as the total number of people come  across, different subgroups continue to come up. We, right now, have  unaccompanied minors at approximately 7,000 people.   Now, recently, The New York Times reported we have lost tens of  thousands of young people coming here. We have almost 7,000 people  crossing the border every month, not being supervised by their parents  or, quite frankly, any other adult. The Border Patrol will tell you  that sometimes if you do a DNA test, children that are coming across  with people who purport to be their parents, purport to be their aunts  or  [[Page H3609]]  uncles, are not. This should be a cause of great concern here in this  Chamber.   When children were left to spend a week or 2 weeks apart from their  parents, that was considered a major concern and something we all had  to bring up.   But no, I believe that there is a new committee formed, and one of  the things we will have to look at is what we can do to make sure that  people who are entering the United States have not one but, in most  cases, both of their parents with them.   It is not a good idea for the United States to be part of a system  which is causing people, young people, to be separate from, in many  case, both parents, in other cases, one parent. Hopefully, we can  change our policy down there, a little more family oriented, and the  United States will not act as a kind of coconspirator with the drug  cartels in breaking up these families.   I think it is also important that we not only check this out when  people are crossing into our border but check them out when our  Department of Labor finds young people, as they do, working maybe third  shift, maybe working illegally. We had a committee hearing on this. It  wasn't publicized as much as it should have been, but we find the  Department of Labor expresses no interest at all, as far as we can  tell, when they find a child working third shift, when they find a  child working in such fashion against the law. They do not look for the  parents at all, and this is something that should change if the  administration was all concerned about these parents.   Nobody can tell me if a child was working illegally, working too  late, working at too young an age, and they were an American citizen,  and this were found out, the appropriate authorities would not be  contacting the parents and wondering what was going on. But, under the  Biden administration, we don't care.   Of course you are setting up a situation of human trafficking. When  you have children who are unaccompanied by parents, that is an obvious  result.   We always refer to human trafficking. We should--frequently, I think  the phrase ``human trafficking'' is used to kind of nicen up what is  really going on, and that is prostitution.   In any event, I call on the press corps to report on the new migrants  coming in in the May numbers and sometime in the next couple of weeks,  we should get new numbers in June. Last year, in June, we had 140,000  people cross across the southern border, and I hope the press corps  takes a little bit of notice as to whether one more time we hit a  record for the month.    Right now we have numbers for the first 9 months of this fiscal year.  Every one of the 9 months has hit a high in the number of people coming  here, at least in recent history. We will find out within a couple of  weeks whether we are on the tenth month in a row of record number of  people coming in.   The next issue that I would like to address--it was touched upon this  week in some of the diversity talk--is that with regard to the  transgender issue. It is an issue I never thought we would discuss here  in Washington. It is an issue I don't think that even crossed people's  minds 15 or 16 years ago.   There are a variety of topics that people bring up here. Do  transgenders get to use a girls' bathroom?   Do transgenders get to use a girls' locker room if they are in  sports?   Do transgenders get to play on women's sports?   But I think the most important issue, and it is one that should be  more obvious, is what is society doing to reduce this problem?   What they found out in Europe is that over time, the number of  transgenders go up. If we didn't have this obvious increase in number  of people, we wouldn't have anywhere near the problem in the first  place.   Now, why is it going up? I think the more you read, one of the  reasons it is going up is this subgroup of our population is kind of  held up as heroes.   I would suggest that some people interested in this topic read an  article by a woman by the name of Heather Mac Donald in which she  discusses the transgender situation and the fact that all of the  coverage in the press and all of the favorable comments from American  politicians, particularly our President of the United States, referring  to people who question the proliferation of the transgender movement,  he says they are motivated by hate and fear.   I don't know anybody who is hating anybody. I do think there are  people who feel sorry for these people.   But obviously, the number is increasing the more politicians and the  news media pays attention to this subgroup and makes them out to be  some sort of heroes. It gives people attention and, of course, all  young people like attention.   It gives people a sense of belonging, a sense that they are part of a  cause. And, of course, young people like to be part of a rebellion of  some nature.   But the people who are being hurt by this more than anybody are, of  course, the people who would not have gone down this path but are going  down this path and it is brought to people's attention more and more.  This is a group that was nowhere near as common in this country in the  past and, quite frankly, I do not believe this is common in other  nonwesternized countries. That is because in these nonwesternized  countries it is not discussed as something that we ought to do.   Now, I recently met with a young lady who was convinced that the  reason she was unhappy is because she really should have been a boy.  She now credits it entirely to looking on the internet where they told  her if she was unhappy--and many, many young people are unhappy. They  told her the reason she was unhappy is perhaps she should be a boy.   So they took this young lady and, at the age of 12 or 13, they gave  her powerful puberty blockers. They gave her testosterone, and  eventually they removed her breasts. She, of course, came to regret it.   I don't know what sort of doctor would look at a 15-year-old, knowing  very well that people's opinions and idea of the world change so  dramatically between 15 and 20 and 25 and 30, and decided to do  something as irrevocable as remove this young gal's breasts. But this  is happening all the time in this country.   This gal was from another State, but I know of two hospitals in  Wisconsin who would make this dramatic change to somebody. They  wouldn't--I don't know why. Money. I can't imagine why they wouldn't  say, why don't you come back when you are 23 or 24 and we will talk to  you then. That wouldn't be a good idea then--but to a 15-year-old?   Again, the reason she did it is because she got a lot of affirmation  on the internet, people encouraging her, people telling her she is a  hero, people telling her that she should be so proud of herself if she  was going down this route.   I think it would be good if we would start in this Chamber, among  politicians here--and, hopefully, even the President--and stop  encouraging people that this is an option.   By the way, if people have these surgeries, they have to continue to  take medications costing a great deal every month. If it were really  true that this gal should have been a boy, she wouldn't have to  continue to take medications even after she had the surgeries; however,  she would have to take these medications for the rest of her life.   I hope, in the future, people in this Chamber are a little bit more  measured in their words before they imply to people that they are some  sort of special heroes by getting their sex changed.   So, in any event, these are two topics that I will say the other side  has not been brought up to the degree in which it should be by the  mainstream media and not brought up enough by my colleagues.   So I hope when we return from our break over the weekend that these  issues are brought up a little bit more in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 12 o'clock and 43 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday, July  17, 2023, at noon for morning-hour debate.
