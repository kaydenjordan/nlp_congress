 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  Trinity School of Durham and Chapel Hill 6th grade history bowl team  consisting of Devlin Smith, Chloe Blumhofer, Shya Khosla, and Joshua  Glass. This team proudly represented the great State of North Carolina  at the 2023 National History Bowl Championships, which is one of the  largest quiz bowl tournaments in the world.   Qualifying for the national championships is a great achievement in  itself. The young scholars were required to pass a rigorous qualifying  test of 50 questions that needed to be completed within 20 minutes.  Exceptional performers were then invited to compete in the regional  finals, and the most highly qualified participants at the regional  finals were invited to the national championships.   North Carolina is proud of the accomplishments of these young  scholars and their representation of our State at the national  championships, where they finished in the top 20 and came so very close  to qualifying for the world championship in Rome, Italy.   It was an incredible performance and a testament to their skills and  dedication to expanding their knowledge. I wish them all the best as  they continue to pursue their academic endeavors in the next school  year. We all can't wait to see what you do next.                            ____________________
