 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the last 4 years, we have seen a  series of encouraging developments in the Middle East--a place where  there isn't a long trend line of positive developments.   We have destroyed the ISIS caliphate. We have brought down dangerous  terrorist leaders like al-Baghdadi and, of course, the head of the  IRGC, Soleimani, who was personally responsible for American blood on  his hands, particularly providing explosives that penetrated our armor  in Iraq.   Through congressional action and the work of the Trump  administration, we strengthened bilateral ties with our closest friends  and allies, including Israel and Jordan. This summer, the  administration helped forge historic peace deals between Israel and  Arab nations in the region. The United Arab Emirates became the third  Arab country and first Gulf State to recognize and normalize relations  with Israel by the signing of the Abraham Accords Peace Agreement. It  was only a matter of days until Bahrain followed suit and announced its  agreement with Israel to open formal diplomatic negotiations.   These historic breakthroughs represent serious progress in our  efforts to fight terrorism and establish lasting peace and stability in  the Middle East. While more work obviously remains, it is great to see  the mounting pressure against Iran--the region's greatest antagonist  and largest state sponsor of terrorism.   Last month, the Trump administration announced that it intended to  sell arms to our friends in the United Arab Emirates--a move that I  support. This will help the UAE work with the United States and our  friends to deter and defend these threats from Iran and other  hostilities in the region. What it seems to me is that it focused  everybody's attention on the recognition that Iran represents the  single biggest destabilizing and dangerous influence in the Middle East  today, and it is the recognition that they are the common adversary of  not only the Arab nations in the region but also the United States and  our ally Israel that has, I think, brought them to the negotiating  table.   As Iran grows increasingly belligerent toward the United States and  our allies, these military assets that we will sell to our friends in  the UAE will serve as a stabilizing force, a force multiplier, and a  source of protection for the United States and our security interests.  We have learned a hard lesson that American boots on the ground is  something we want to do as a last resort. But if we can work by, with,  and through our friends and allies to provide that security and  stability against a common enemy, we should do it.   The arms sale will allow greater military cooperation between the  United States, the UAE, and Israel and strengthen a growing coalition  of aligned forces in the region. It will also make sure the United  States remains the partner of choice.   It is not as if the United States is the only one that has a say.  Obviously, if we don't provide them the military equipment they need,  they will go looking for other sellers, and that would certainly be  less desirable for us and for them because we are their partner of  choice in the region. Russia and particularly China have sought to  increase their malign influence in the Middle East, and they would be  more than happy to fill the void left by any refusal on the part of the  United States to make this sale. So blocking this sale would only  strengthen the position of China and Russia, while significantly  weakening our own.   As we continue to make progress in the decades-long quest for peace  and stability in the Middle East, I support the administration's  strategic decision to sell arms to the UAE. This would provide the UAE  with critical national security assets, such as access to the F-35  fifth-generation fighter, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other advanced  munitions to act as a deterrent, and if worse comes to worse, it  actually gives them a comparative advantage with other countries in the  region.   The Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, perhaps  summed it up best when he said:         What keeps me up at night is actually not the proposed F-35       sale to the Emirates. What keeps me up at night is the idea       that somebody would return to the nuclear deal with Iran                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, this week, I hope we  are able to make more progress on the coronavirus relief negotiations  so we can pass another bill before recessing for the holidays. There  are a lot of people in this country, all throughout the country, who  are hurting, who are anxious, and who are worried about their ability  to pay the rent and to meet their other obligations in the face of this  pandemic, and I think it would be a dereliction of duty on our part to  leave here without addressing those real needs.  [[Page S7269]]    Earlier this year, we worked in a quick, bipartisan fashion to pass  relief bills totaling more than $3 trillion. Thinking back on it, it  was pretty remarkable to do as much as we did as fast as we did, but we  knew we were up against a common enemy in this virus, and we knew we  had to respond quickly, and we did. The funding we provided has gone a  long way to support our healthcare and economic response, but as our  war against COVID-19 continues to rage on, additional support is  needed, and it is needed now.   The good news is, as earlier, there are a number of areas that we  agree on what the support should look like, including funding for  schools, assistance for the hardest hit workers and small businesses,  and another investment in the distribution of the vaccine that can't  come soon enough, but we remain hung up on a couple of important  points, including liability protection for businesses, schools,  nonprofits, and others who in good faith did their best to follow  guidance from the CDC and other public health authorities but now face  the prospect of litigation.   It is pretty hard to follow the guidance as knowledge of this virus  has evolved. I remember before April, the head of the CDC, including  Dr. Fauci and others, said that masks were useless. Then they changed  their guidance in April. That is fine. I respect that based on what we  have learned about the virus. But we simply can't expose people who  have tried their best to muddle along in the face of this pandemic,  following the guidance from public health officials, and say: You  didn't know then what we know now, so you must have been negligent, and  you need to pay compensation in the form of litigation.   Well, I don't think that is fair to those entities, those  individuals, those businesses, those schools, those churches, mosques,  and synagogues. But this is something that is on the minds of a lot of  people, from healthcare workers, to teachers, to nonprofits, to small  business owners. Those who continue to provide essential services and  goods didn't have any choice but to show up and go to work. Now they  are worried that by opening their doors to people who really needed  their help at the time, they have also now opened themselves up to an  endless parade of lawsuits by the trial bar.   We all know that lawyers can be very creative and opportunistic. That  is part of what lawyering involves. But the litigation we expect  against doctors, nurses, colleges, churches, small businesses--anyone  and everyone could be blamed for another person's harm. If those  lawsuits are feasible, they will follow. And the statute of limitations  is a couple years, so even though we are not necessarily seeing it now,  we do know that class action litigation could be filed in any favorable  jurisdiction anywhere in the country and basically bankrupt many  businesses and certainly discourage businesses from safely reopening  and following those guidelines.   I think there is another reason to reward people who have tried their  best to follow those guidelines--because it ensures more compliance. To  now play a game of ``gotcha'' with them and say: It wasn't good enough,  so now you are going to have to pay or maybe even just defend a lawsuit  that you ultimately will win--we all know that will cost a lot of money  and will take a lot of time, and I would prefer to see them rebuild  their businesses and restore the jobs that were lost as a result of the  pandemic   So because of my concern about the need for some liability shield, we  introduced a bill called the SAFE TO WORK Act that provides commonsense  protections for those who acted in good faith to keep their customers  and their employees safe, while still preserving the right to sue for  those who were victims of gross negligence or intentional misconduct.   This is not a blanket liability shield that won't permit the really  truly bad actors from facing due consequences. It won't ban coronavirus  lawsuits, and it won't give anyone a get-out-of-jail-free card. So we  need to get that straight up front. In cases of gross negligence or  willful misconduct, where the applicable public health guidelines were  not followed, the person affected has every right to sue and be made  whole in a court of law. No one is asking to change that. What we do  need, though, is to put safeguards in place to ensure that those who  operated in good faith and were following all the relevant guidelines,  even as they evolved over time, cannot be sued out of existence.   First and foremost are protections for our incredible healthcare  heroes who made tremendous physical and mental sacrifices over the last  several months. This legislation sets a willful misconduct or gross  negligence standard for coronavirus-related medical liability suits to  ensure that only legitimate cases are brought against our healthcare  workers who, again, didn't have any choice but to show up for work.   In addition to protecting our healthcare heroes, we need to ensure  that a fear of lawsuits doesn't prevent schools, nonprofits, churches,  small businesses, and a range of other organizations and institutions  that are vital to our communities and our economy from opening their  doors. This spells out in black and white that these entities will be  protected from COVID-19 exposure claims as long as they comply with  mandatory public health guidelines.   It is true that a number of States have already provided similar  protections, including the minority leader's home State of New York,  and it is time that we extend these liability limitations to the rest  of the country, particularly States like mine where the legislature  does not meet on a continual basis. They haven't even been in session  during 2020. They will go into session in January, and I presume they  will try to fill in any holes they feel like we left when it comes to  liability protection. But without a uniform Federal standard, we are  going to end up in a dangerous venue shopping situation, and it is only  to be expected that the lawyers will find the place most favorable for  their lawsuits. They will seek to pursue those claims using class  action procedures, and we will be right back at the worst nightmare  that I think many folks would have contemplated unless we provide for  this Federal liability shield.   The goal is not to protect bad actors. What we do need to clearly  spell out is for the schools, colleges, nonprofits, churches, and  businesses that are asking us to provide them some guidance and some  security.   Our Democratic colleagues have not expressed a lot of enthusiasm for  this legislation, and my Republican colleagues and I have tried to work  with them to reach a result that both sides can support. But the nature  of compromise, as we all know, is give-and-take, but so far it has been  pretty much one-sided. We have offered changes to appease our  Democratic colleagues' concerns while still preserving the basic goal  of the legislation, but the truth is, they really haven't moved much in  any meaningful way.   I think the truth is that our country's long-term economic recovery  from this virus depends on these liability protections in large part.  Businesses doing the best they can during a worldwide emergency should  not face bankruptcy because of concerns about the trial bar. I mean,  who are we here working for--the American people or for lawyers who-- and this isn't necessarily designed to be a criticism--who are looking  out for their own economic interests first and foremost? Our view must  be much broader than that, and the greatest good for the greatest  number I think should be our guiding principle.   Our essential workers and institutions need to know that if they have  been operating in good faith and obeying the guidelines that have been  promulgated by the public health authorities, they won't be subjected  to litigation, and only Congress can provide that certainty.   Now, this is not a permanent Federal takeover of State tort law by  any means. It really is comparable to what we did after Y2K--or in the  run up to Y2K--and also with other national  [[Page S7270]]  emergencies like 9/11. We have even given some protection to  pharmaceutical companies, which we have asked to take risks to come up  with world-class vaccines and therapies, to encourage them and to  incentivize them to do that because we know it is in the public  interest.   But across the country, we are already seeing these lawsuits rolling  in, and without action from Congress, we are going to emerge from this  pandemic only to find ourselves in not another wave of the virus but in  a second wave of litigation that will be devastating for many.   In order for our country and our economy to recover, these workers  and these institutions need to know that they can follow the guidelines  and then safely reopen their doors and do their jobs with confidence.  They need to know that if they follow these guidelines and act in good  faith, they won't be subjected to perhaps business-ending litigation  that could tie them up in court and drain their remaining resources  dry.   As I have said, the way we reach agreements around here is through  bipartisan negotiations. It took a little compromise, and neither side  achieved 100 percent of what they wanted, but we eventually have gotten  there. We have done that four times in the coronavirus response, and I  hope we can do it again here.   I hope our Democratic colleagues will approach these negotiations  with the gravity they deserve. We can't leave people waiting and  wondering what their future looks like any longer if there is something  we can do to provide them some safety and security and some confidence  about what the future may look like.   I hope we will all work together to deliver these critical liability  protections for folks across the country in all 50 States.
