 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a faith community  in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that truly embodies the virtues of  kindness and charity. Grace Bible Church in Souderton, will be hosting  its sixth annual Easter dinner, where all members of our community are  welcome.   Like last year, Grace Bible Church will be offering transportation to  residents of Grundy Manor in Telford and Valley Vista in Souderton so  that they are able to participate in an evening of food and fellowship.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to all of the congregants of Grace Bible  Church for opening their doors to our neighbors and for living out  their Christian faith in their actions.   I would like to particularly thank and recognize one of the event's  organizers, Carol Doyle, for her work, along with Pastor Dave Dunbar  for his vision and for his leadership.                   Recognizing Alan Hartl in His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the retirement of a  true professional and advocate in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, after his  nearly 40 years of providing mental health counseling and recovery  services to members of our community.   Alan Hartl will be stepping down as the chief executive officer of  the Lenape Valley Foundation after a long and distinguished career. A  psychologist, Alan has, for decades, been a strong advocate for those  with behavioral health needs.   Widely respected throughout Bucks County and among his peers, Alan is  a member of the board of directors of both the National Council for  Behavioral Health and the Pennsylvania Rehabilitation and Community  Providers Association.   Alan's dedication to improving the lives of our neighbors and his  delivering hope to those most in need are truly admirable. I wish him  all the best in his new chapter, and I wish his successor, Sharon  Curran, all of the best in her new role.          Recognizing Carolann Begley for Her Work to Prevent Hunger     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an outstanding  school administrator in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, who was  recently recognized by a national nonprofit organization for her work  to prevent hunger amongst our community students.   Carolann Begley, nutrition services area supervisor at North Penn  High School, was named a Breakfast Hero by the organization, No Kid  Hungry.   Carolann's work has been instrumental in making breakfast more  accessible to students, notably through her work to implement a  breakfast cart for the 2018-2019 school year.   Mr. Speaker, our community school administrators and educators work  tirelessly to give our students the resources they need to pursue their  goals. I applaud Carolann for her service, and I would also like to  thank North Penn High School Principal Pete Nicholson and the No Kid  Hungry network, an organization, for all of the work that they do for  our community.                            ____________________
