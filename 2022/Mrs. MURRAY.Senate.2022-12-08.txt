 Mr. President, I am here today because no one should  have to choose between their job and a healthy pregnancy.   It is outrageous that pregnant women in our country have been pushed  out of their jobs by their employers because, as you just heard, they  asked for an additional bathroom break or because their doctors say  they need to avoid heavy lifting or because their employer can't be  bothered to simply provide them a stool to sit down on.   It is unconscionable that people who are looking forward to welcoming  a new family member are having their lives upturned or losing the  paychecks they depend on to make rent or buy groceries or pay for  childcare, all because their employers refuse to provide basic,  commonsense, low-cost and even no-cost accommodations. We have got to  do better.   That is why I am here with Senator Casey, who has been a relentless  champion on this issue, to urge all of my colleagues to let us pass the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which is a bipartisan bill that will  make sure that no one is forced to choose between a job and a healthy  pregnancy and everyone can get the reasonable workplace accommodations  they need when they are pregnant.   Let me be clear: This is, fundamentally, a bipartisan bill that we  have worked closely with our Republican colleagues on. Senator Cassidy  coleads this bill. He has been an amazing partner. It passed out of the  HELP Committee overwhelmingly. It is supported by my ranking member  Senator Burr, and it passed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan House vote.   There is no reason to stand in the way. We can send this to the  President's desk right now.   We are really not here asking for much. This is very simple. Give  pregnant workers a break, give them a seat, and give them a hand. Give  them the dignity, the respect, and basic workplace accommodations that  they need.   This is way overdue, and I can't think of a more commonsense, less  controversial bill, and I hope that we can get it done today.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, let me add my thanks to Senator Portman  for his tremendous work here. I wish him the very best in his future as  well.    Mr. President, last month, Lois Curtis, the lead  plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court decision Olmstead v. L.C.-- which affirmed the rights of people with disabilities to live in their  own communities--passed away from pancreatic cancer. Today, I join so  many touched by Ms. Curtis' advocacy in mourning her passing,  remembering her life, and paying tribute to the invaluable  contributions she made to civil rights.   Ms. Curtis, a Black woman with intellectual and mental health  disabilities, spent her childhood and young adult life living in State  institutions. But she wanted to get out of the institution she had been  confined to and finally have the ability to live in her own community.  So she took her case to court in 1995 and eventually became the lead  plaintiff in Olmstead v. L.C., in which the Supreme Court ruled for the  first time in 1999 that unjustified segregation of people with  disabilities constitutes discrimination in violation of the Americans  with Disabilities Act.   The landmark ruling established that people with disabilities have  the right to receive the services and supports they need to live in  their own communities, not just State institutions. Ms. Curtis' courage  and refusal to accept the status quo helped propel the disability  rights movement, made our country more just, and improved the lives of  so many people with disabilities.   After winning her case and gaining her independence, Ms. Curtis  dedicated her life to advocacy work and became a renowned artist. In  2011, she showcased her artwork in the White House for the anniversary  of the Olmstead decision.        Ms. Curtis' life's work improved the lives of so many       across our country. She will be remembered fondly.                            ____________________
