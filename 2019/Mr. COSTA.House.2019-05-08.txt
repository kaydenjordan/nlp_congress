 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about healthcare and to  ask that my colleagues join me in support of protecting individuals in  America who have preexisting conditions.   We can, and we must do a better job in reducing costs and improving  access to healthcare in America. Since the Affordable Care Act was  signed into law in 2010, no provision has had a more significant impact  on the health of Americans than protecting those with preexisting  conditions.   In my district in 2010 in San Joaquin Valley in California, almost 25  percent of my constituents had no healthcare insurance whatsoever, and  17 percent were uninsured. Today, 9 years later, 10 percent of my  constituents do not have healthcare insurance, and the ability to  provide insurance for those who were underinsured has much improved.   Before the ACA, insurers could deny health coverage to many health  conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or cancer.   How many of our families have preexisting conditions in those areas?   I submit most of us do. These denials often force families into  decisions between paying for a loved one's treatment or keeping the  lights on in their house. No family should be faced with such a choice.   Protections for preexisting conditions remain one of the popular  parts of the ACA. These protections should not be weakened due to  partisan politics. Working together in a bipartisan fashion is the only  way we are going to get something enacted that will work for all  Americans.   We can do better for the American people, and we should. That is what  the folks in my 16th Congressional District in the San Joaquin Valley  want me to do. They want me to help improve their healthcare.                              Wildfire Awareness     Mr. Speaker, I would like to discuss the importance of  wildfire awareness. No State knows more about how important the subject  is than California.   There is no longer a fire season in California. It suffers from  fires, sadly, year-round resulting from many factors, including climate  change.   Just last year California saw the deadliest wildfire in its history.  The town of Paradise was decimated with more than 14,000 homes  destroyed, and 85 people lost their lives. God bless them and their  families.   There have been other fires in Santa Barbara, Mendocino, and the  Yosemite Rim fire right in my own district's backyard.  [[Page H3481]]    We need to do more. For the first time in its 110-year history, the  Forest Service says they will now dedicate more than half their budget  to wildfire suppression efforts, which we have directed as a result of  the farm bill last year.                                time  1015    To begin with, this requires better managing and caring for our  forests.   This week, we will vote on an emergency supplemental to help  communities affected by wildfires. I ask my colleagues to vote with me  and pass this important legislation.   Let's do the right thing and help our fellow Americans rebuild their  lives and their communities. At the same time, let's be more  responsible stewards of our forests.   We know how to do it. Let's get started with our States, local  governments, and the private sector.   Future generations deserve better management of forests throughout  our country. I think we can do it if we work together.                            ____________________
