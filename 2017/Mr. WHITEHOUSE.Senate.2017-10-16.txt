 Mr. President, let me echo the remarks of the senior  Senator from Ohio.   Like Ohio, Rhode Island has a very significant opioid problem, and we  came together in this Chamber to support the Comprehensive Addiction  and Recovery Act. I had the privilege of being the principal Democratic  author of that piece of legislation, and Senator Portman of Ohio was  the principal Republican author of that legislation. We worked for  years to set it up--to hold the hearings necessary, to get the  information together, to make it work. When we did, it passed this body  with a massive bipartisan expression of support.   It makes no sense to nominate somebody to this position who does not  understand what we understand, which is  [[Page S6391]]  that the drug epidemic is, at its heart, a public health emergency and  an illness. A reversion to law enforcement harshness in dealing with  this problem will simply not be effective.
