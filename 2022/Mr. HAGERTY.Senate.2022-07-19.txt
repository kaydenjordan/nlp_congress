 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, since last  year, I have been asking for a commitment from my Democrat colleagues  that any future reconciliation legislation in this Congress will not  incorporate policies that will reduce access to care in nonexpansion  States such as Tennessee. Specifically, my concern is that this  reconciliation legislation that the House of Representatives passed  last fall included provisions that cut DSH and uncompensated care pool  payments for nonexpansion States. This would result in less healthcare  for vulnerable populations in my State, accelerate hospital closures in  my State, and it would disadvantage rural communities in my State of  Tennessee. These are places and populations for which we are trying to  secure more quality healthcare, not less.   Because I have not received confirmation that these provisions will  not be included in any future reconciliation bill, I cannot consent to  expediting confirmation of this nominee, and I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   As I mentioned a moment ago, I have been asking for a commitment from  my Democratic colleagues that any future reconciliation legislation in  this Congress will not incorporate policies that will reduce access to  care in my home State of Tennessee. Reiterating, my concern is that the  reconciliation legislation that the House passed last fall included  provisions that cut DSH payments and uncompensated care pool payments  for nonexpansion States which would result in less healthcare for  vulnerable populations in my State, accelerate hospital closures, and  disadvantage rural communities. These are places and populations for  which we are trying to secure more quality healthcare, not less.   Because I have still not received confirmation that these provisions  will not be included in any future reconciliation bill, I cannot  consent to expediting confirmation of this nominee, and I object.
