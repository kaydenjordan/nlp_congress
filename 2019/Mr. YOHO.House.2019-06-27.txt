 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois for  yielding.   I rise today as a Member from the great State of Florida. We all  recall the 2000 Presidential election. What happened in Palm Beach  County turned into a national punch line, ``the hanging chad.''   The Democratic bill before us today would mandate paper ballots and  make our elections a technology-free zone. I, too, am worried about  malign actors like Russia and China when it comes to our cybersecurity  network. However, let us not throw out the baby with the bath water.   Many of my colleagues submitted commonsense amendments that would  improve the bill, amendments addressing ballot harvesting and ensuring  State matching funds. Yet, Democrats, under another closed rule, are  forcing passage on a one-sided bill with no prospect in the Senate and  no chance of being signed by the President.   Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope we address these issues in a  bipartisan manner that reflects well on this body and the American  people.
