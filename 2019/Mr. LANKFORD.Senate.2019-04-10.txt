 Mr. President, I want to join several of my colleagues  today who are noting that we are approaching tax day. It is not a day  Americans look forward to, but it is part of our responsibilities. The  old joke about the two things that are certain--death and taxes--is  still certain for all of us.   This year, it is interesting to approach this tax season in the first  year of everyone filing under the new tax law. It has been fascinating  to read some of the stories about what some of the media--the national  media in particular--is saying about the tax law. They are so desperate  to find anything to criticize. It is fascinating to me to read the  headlines versus the stories.   The headline in this story in particular is ``This is going to wipe  us out,'' in reference to the new tax law. When you read through the  story and find out who they say is going to get wiped out, here is  their illustration of the person: a person moving from a $400,000 house  this past year to one valued at $1.1 million. He concedes he has a  first-world problem of his taxes going up, but he says that owing more  in taxes is ``a little disheartening''--as he moves from a $400,000  house to a $1.1 million home. I am excited for him and his new home. I  am sure it is beautiful. But that was their illustration of who is  going to get hard hit by the tax changes.   This article from a national source said: ``Is a Tax Refund Ahead in  Your 2019? Some Taxpayers Received a Tax Bill Instead.'' You go to the  middle of the story, and they make this one little note: ``Only about  5% of taxpayers . . . are expected to pay more under the new law.'' In  other words, 95 percent of Americans--even in this story that is a  negative story about the taxes, they hide the simple fact that 95  percent of Americans will pay the same or less. The vast majority of  those will pay less in their taxes for the next year.   How about this one. Here is another national story that came out.  ``Small business owners struggling to understand Trump's new tax law.''  When you get down to literally the last line of the story, it ends like  this, with the same small business owner:         I don't know [yet] if it's going to impact my cash flow,       the way I have to put money aside for this year, because I'm       not sure. I may even do better [under the tax law], I don't       know [yet].    That was their whole story to say that people are struggling under  this tax law--it was just the uncertainty.   What am I finding in Oklahoma? I am finding more jobs and more  opportunity across the State. This is not some accident of history;  this is the direct result of a change in the tax law.   I am quite confident that my liberal colleagues have all been very  excited to find something to complain about through this process, but  they overlook the simple fact that this one story buries 95 percent of  Americans who do the same or better under the tax law and that the vast  majority of those are doing better under the tax law.   It was interesting. There was a Vox tweet that came out from a news  source from one of the reporters who made this one comment this past  week, saying: ``Nobody likes to give themselves credit for this kind of  messaging success, but progressive groups did a really good job of  convincing people that Trump raised their taxes when the facts say a  clear majority got a tax cut.''   My favorite: The left-leaning Tax Policy Center had to begrudgingly  study the tax cut and what is actually happening and say: Middle-class  taxes actually went down. Families kept almost $1,000 more, which would  have previously gone into government coffers.   What happened as a result of that, as a result of people keeping  their own money and the withholding tables changing this past year so  that each month, people are actually keeping more of their own money?  Here is what happened: Our GDP grew at 3 percent a year--a dramatic  increase from what we have had in the past; inflation-adjusted business  investment has gone up 7 percent just since the tax cuts; and 215,000  new jobs have started on average every month since the tax cuts. Those  are very strong numbers across the country. Unemployment has gone to  3.9 percent since the enactment of tax reform. Beginning in April of  last year, the number of job openings in the national economy has  exceeded the number of unemployed Americans--something that had not  been recorded prior to April since records have been kept.   So starting this past year, there are literally more people searching  to find other opportunities than there are opportunities out there  because there are so many jobs open. So many companies are still trying  to hire and are looking for people that people have the opportunity to  stay at their same job, get better pay, or switch to a new job and get  opportunities. That is providing more opportunities for more people to  transition to a new job or make more money at their own job.   Well, what has happened on wages? As a result of what is happening in  the economy, wages have gone up 2.9 percent just since the tax cut;  that is, individual wages have gone up. What happened to income during  that time period? Let me go back to the Obama time period. When  President Obama was President, on average, income went up 1.8 percent;  that is, total take-home. Since the tax reform, income has gone up 4  percent for each American. That is double the amount during the Obama  administration. Again, this is not an accident of history; this is the  result of the tax reform. This is what happens when people are allowed  to keep more of their own money and spend it. More companies are doing  better. There is more investment happening, more job opportunities,  more opportunity to get a different job or to get a raise at your  current job, and take-home pay has increased.   What has happened in people's taxes? Well, early on this year, the  stories, as I referenced before, were all about how tax returns were  down. They searched to find anyone who had tax returns that were down.  All those stories disappeared in late February, when the IRS brought  out the latest numbers, not from January and early February but from  February and March, and said: Actually, tax returns are up this year  from what they were in the previous year.   As of the latest number, April 5, tax returns for individuals almost  are dead even, exactly as they were last year. So the stories have  disappeared from headlines that their tax returns changed because the  IRS continues to report the facts. Actually, the returns are almost  exactly what they were from the previous time.   So what has happened to actually help people in their paying of their  taxes? Well, I started asking some of my team in Oklahoma to just ask  people. When you are traveling around the State and when you are  visiting people, just ask them how their taxes have gone and what has  happened because people are filing now--just find out what is going on.   One of the dry cleaners in Enid let our team know that he is doing  better in his small business taxes this year, and he is actually going  to be able to put a downpayment now on some brand new equipment at his  dry cleaner in Enid.   With another one we talked to--he is in his early thirties, married,  he and his wife both work. They said they saved enough on their taxes  this year from last year that they are going to start paying off some  of their student loans and start paying down their car loan faster.   We spoke to one other gentleman who is also in his late thirties.  They have one child who was born this past year. They said they have  saved enough in their taxes from the previous year that they are going  to be able to take care of some healthcare costs they have, and they  are going to start setting aside some money to allow his wife to start  a Roth IRA account. Starting their savings for their retirement in  their thirties, when you should start saving for your retirement, they  are able do this year because of the change in the Tax Code.   With another gentleman we talked to who works in Oklahoma City, he  reported that with his withholding changes that happened, he is now  actually in a--he was in a 25-percent tax bracket and has now moved to  the 22-percent tax bracket, and he is using his savings to take care of  some of the issues he had in his own personal debt.   We have a married couple in Davis, OK, down in South-Central  Oklahoma. Their income actually went up $4,000  [[Page S2361]]  this last year. When they finished all their tax payments, their tax  actually decreased by $700 from one year to the next, even though their  income went up.   Another couple down the street from Davis in Sulphur, OK, own a small  farm. Their income went up $7,000 last year from the previous year, and  they were panicked about what would happen with their taxes. Well,  their taxes actually decreased $1,400 from the year before.   We have a police officer in Norman, OK, just south of Oklahoma City.  He actually--he and his family, after they finished filing all their  taxes, he said this:         I now bring home more in my check every 2 weeks because of       the change in the Tax Code. It is making things so much       simpler for us to be able to make ends meet.    There was a teacher in an elementary school. She noted, as simple as  this may sound, that she has received $10 more every single time a  paycheck came out, and that made a difference for her as a first-year  teacher just getting started.    There is a farmer with two kids. He was able to use the new child tax  credits, and although his income was higher than the year before, his  tax burden was $3,000.   There is a pilot married to a nurse in our State. Their income  actually increased in the past year as well, but he said with the lower  tax rates and the child tax credits, their tax burden also decreased by  $1,000 from the year before.   All these are real-life stories of what is really going on in the  State. As I hear all the different stories that come out, people lose  track of the fact of what is really happening. While some of my  colleagues have been so focused on trying to find some way to be able  to damage the effect of tax cuts, families in my State know the  difference.   One of the families we encountered this past week made a comment that  they had a child born in 2018. That child was born in 2018 but actually  very premature. Their medical bills racked up pretty quickly because  the child was in the ICU. Then they started filing their taxes this  year as their medical bills were coming in--by the way, their child is  doing well and healthy. As they started filling out all their forms and  were thinking about some of their bills, being able to cover their  deductible, their tax bill came back in, and they saw their taxes are  lower, and they are using their higher return this year to offset the  medical costs from the early delivery of their child.   This is what tax reform looks like. Some of my colleagues try to  spend all of their time saying tax reform is all about big corporations  and Wall Street. Interestingly enough, most of the high-income folks in  my State have said, actually, their taxes went up a little bit this  year, not down. They are part of that 5 percent of Americans who didn't  end up with a tax change. For the vast majority of Americans who are  working and putting ends together and taking care of their family, in  my State and in other States, they are finding that tax reform is not  some theory to them. It was a real help to their family in paying off  debt, starting retirement, taking care of medical costs, taking care of  their family, getting going on with life, and as the police officer in  Norman said, ``just making things a little simpler.''   Tax reform is determined to help our economy, to get us growing, to  get us going as a nation and provide more opportunities, and I am  grateful, even in all the complexity of filling out tax forms, it is  showing a real result in pragmatic ways to Americans.   This past weekend, I stopped and filled out my tax information--going  through all the details and gathering all the forms and filling  everything out. It is still a pain, and it is still not the most  pleasant experience in all of life filling out your tax forms, but at  the end of it, I reflected on some of these direct stories and realized  there are people who really do feel the real effects of what is going  on. Understanding all the frustration of filling out taxes, which is a  pain for everybody, there is some real benefit this year versus the  year before and I hope for the years to come.   I yield the floor.
