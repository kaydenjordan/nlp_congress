 Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 4926, the Respect for Child Survivors Act requires  the FBI to use multidisciplinary teams when investigating certain  crimes involving children.   This requirement includes, for example, situations where the  interviewed victim is no longer a child, but was the victim of a crime  as a child. The multidisciplinary teams would consist of a variety of  professionals trained to work with children who had been victims of a  crime. The goal of using these multidisciplinary teams is to prevent  re-traumatizing victims.   S. 4926 also contains provisions related to information-sharing and  case review for crimes involving children. These provisions would  hopefully ensure that these cases are not forgotten or simply dropped  without review.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I simply urge Members to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
