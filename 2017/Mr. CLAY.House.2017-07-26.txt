 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2370, introduced by Representative Gaetz, settles a  longstanding land management issue in his Florida district.  Specifically, the bill transfers land associated with the former Santa  Rosa Island National Monument to Escambia County. Once it is  transferred to Escambia County, the bill authorizes a second transfer  to Santa Rosa County, without any conditions or further restrictions.   The land in question was provided to the county by the Federal  Government in 1947 under the condition it remain in use for a public  purpose. In 1956, the county decided a 100-year lease to neighboring  Santa Rosa County was in the public interest. In the 61 years since,  the counties have grown and prospered, but due to the terms of the  original conveyance and subsequent lease, there is some confusion about  Santa Rosa County's power to tax.   This bill will clear up some administrative challenges that have  arisen out of this unusual arrangement, a goal that we support.  However, it will also allow for developments that conflict with the  terms of the original conveyance.   As drafted, this bill authorizes activities that will do significant  environmental damage to a fragile coastal barrier island and  potentially lead to the privatization of land on Santa Rosa Island.  Neither of these results is in the public interest or consistent with  congressional intent.   Congress granted Escambia County this land with one condition, which  this bill completely ignores. We understand how important this bill is  for Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties, but honoring the original intent  of this land grant is as important as well.   It is our hope that we can work with our colleagues in the Senate to  make improvements to this legislation that will continue to protect the  interests of the American taxpayers in this land deal.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by assuaging the concerns raised  by my friend from Missouri. A provision in the bill--and I will simply  read it--I think, answers his concerns rather clearly. It says:   ``. . . the county shall preserve in perpetuity the areas of the non- Federal land that, as of the date of enactment of this act, are  dedicated for conservation, preservation, public recreation access, and  public parking, in accordance with any resolutions of the Board of  Commissioners of the county.''  [[Page H6330]]    As my friend has pointed out, Congress established the Santa Rosa  National Monument and directed the Secretary of the Interior to convey  the Federal land in the monument to Escambia County, Florida, back in  1946. Just 6 months later, the land was deeded to the county. Under the  terms of the conveyance, Escambia County was given the authority to  lease the property on Santa Rosa Island; however, they were not allowed  to issue title on the property or otherwise dispose of it or reconvey  it.   In the intervening years since then, Santa Rosa Island has  experienced tremendous economic growth. This growth prompted county  leaders to assess property taxes on the leased lands. The imposition of  taxes led to several lawsuits centered on the question of whether  island residents and businessowners paying lease fees for their land  could be taxed, despite not having outright ownership of the property.   Courts have reached different conclusions based on differences in the  language of particular leases, which has created fairness issues for  the county governments of Escambia and Santa Rosa. One property may be  subject to property taxes, while a virtually identical property next  door may not. This uneven treatment has prompted interest in removing  the deed restriction prohibiting reconveyance, which then allows the  county governments to convey ownership and create a uniform tax  treatment for all properties on the beach.   Recently, both Escambia County and neighboring Santa Rosa County  passed resolutions asking for a Federal solution to allow current Santa  Rosa Island leaseholders the option of attaining fee simple title while  protecting public access to the beaches and conservation areas on the  island.   I commend my colleague, Congressman Gaetz, for listening to his  constituents and working to find a solution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I appreciate my friend from  California for that explanation. Hopefully, my colleague,  Representative Gaetz, will try to strike a balance between protecting  our environment, protecting the pristine nature of that island, as well  as looking out for the best interests of his constituents when this  bill gets to the Senate. So, therefore, we will not oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   I would simply add that one of the overarching objectives of the  Federal Lands Subcommittee is to restore the Federal Government as a  good neighbor to those communities impacted by the public lands. This  bill is an example of that principle at work, and I would urge adoption  of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2370.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the African American Civil  Rights Network Act of 2017, updated and bipartisan legislation that I  was proud to introduce along with my distinguished colleague from  Missouri's Eighth Congressional District, Congressman Jason Smith. I  appreciate his leadership and true friendship as well.   Our legislation, which has already earned 72 cosponsors, would  authorize the National Park Service to establish a program to preserve  and protect the memory of the people and places that were significant  in the struggle to securing equal rights for African Americans during  the 20th century's civil rights era between 1939 and 1968.   The purpose of this legislation is to recognize, protect, and share  the remarkable American story of the modern struggle for civil rights,  a unique national experience that touches every American regardless of  their age, region, or heritage, and yet this very American story is  often left untold, without the level of honesty and accuracy that it  surely deserves.   In fact, the generation now coming of age has only scant knowledge of  the history of the civil rights struggle. Young Americans find it  difficult to believe that racial segregation was once considered normal  and necessary in the United States.   I truly believe that the healing potential for this legislation is  essential to bringing our Nation together. The historic network that  H.R. 1927 would create would offer tremendous educational opportunities  by recognizing those brave souls from all walks of life who fought to  make the promises enshrined in our Constitution finally ring true for  every American regardless of the color of their skin.   Across this great country, precious historic waypoints along the  routes of that still largely untold story are at risk of being lost  forever.   My hope is that the historic civil rights trails and the programs  that will grow from this act will honestly tell the truth, the full and  sometimes painful story of the struggle for civil rights, not just for  African Americans, but to foster healing, tolerance, and understanding  among all Americans.   This bill is similar to legislation that created the National  Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1998, which is currently  administered by the National Park Service. It directs the Secretary of  the Interior to identify and create a national network of historic  sites, stories, research facilities, and educational programs connected  to the modern African-American civil rights movement.   This legislation has also earned the strong support of the National  Urban League, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the  National Parks Conservation Association, and the NAACP.   Mr. Speaker, let me also commend the gentleman from California for  his support of this legislation that came out of his subcommittee. I  appreciate his help and strong support of it.   I look at this opportunity as something that we should all want to  embrace the transformative power of the real American story. We should  seize it. This bill advances that worthy goal for our Nation, and I  urge my colleagues to support this important act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. Love).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to reciprocate the kind  words of the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay). It has been a pleasure  working with him on this bill.   Shakespeare put it best:         This story shall a good man teach his son.    This bill tells that story of how the full measure of our Nation's  founding principles came to fruition.
