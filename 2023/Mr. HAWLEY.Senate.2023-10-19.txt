 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on October 7, 2023, the terrorist  organization Hamas invaded the State of Israel. Terrorists killed 1,400  Israeli civilians, including women and children, people asleep in their  beds. They went door to door. They shot Israelis in their homes. They  shot soldiers as they were asleep, unawares in their barracks. They  wounded more than 3,700 civilians. That includes 31 Americans at least.  Over a dozen Americans have been taken hostage and many, many more  Israelis.   It is the worst attack on the Jewish people and the State of Israel  in 50 years. It is truly an existential threat to the State of Israel  and, really, to the safety of Jewish Americans and Jewish people all  across the world.   Perhaps incredibly disturbing--maybe almost as disturbing as the  facts of these terrible attacks themselves--is the response of some  people in this country, on our college campuses in this country, who  promptly took to the streets, to the courtyards of these campuses, to  the airwaves to broadcast their support for this genocide against the  people of Israel. That is right. I said their support for the genocide  against the people of Israel. Listen to what these students said.   At Harvard University, students wrote that they ``hold the Israeli  regime entirely responsible''--``entirely responsible''--``for all  unfolding violence.''   Think about that. They hold the Israelis, the Jewish people,  responsible for their own deaths and massacres. They hold the Jewish  people responsible for their babies' heads being chopped off. They hold  the Jewish people responsible for the homicidal maniacs who came to  their doors and gunned them down in cold blood. They hold them  responsible.   Students at New York University's School of Law wrote that they  believe ``Israel bears full responsibility for this tremendous loss of  life''--``full responsibility.''   Students at Ohio State praised the ``heroic resistance in Gaza.''  ``Heroic''? It is now ``heroic'' to massacre Jews in cold blood. It is  now ``heroic'' to try and carry out a genocide against Jewish people.   Students at the University of North Carolina said:         It is our moral obligation to be in solidarity no matter       the pathway to liberation--    their word--      they choose to take. This includes violence.    ``This includes violence.'' This is an out-and-out endorsement by  American students for violence against Jewish people and the State of  Israel.   You know, it is not just Jews in Israel who are threatened by these  outrageous remarks. Jewish Americans on our campuses have been  threatened. Columbia University had to close their campus temporarily  when an Israeli student was physically assaulted and Jewish American  students threatened. Jewish American students have been threatened  across the country in all sorts of settings, not the least on our  college campuses. And, in the wake of this, campus leaders have been  silent. They have refused to condemn this violent, virulent, genocidal,  anti-Semitic rhetoric for what it is.   Now, I want to be clear. I believe in our Constitution. The  Constitution has the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects the  right to free speech. As I have said on this floor before, the First  Amendment is the right to be wrong. So these students can say this kind  of virulent, moral idiocy if they want so long as they don't themselves  encourage violence. Although, I would just say, when you say that this  includes violence, that there ought to be violence, they are coming  pretty darned close--pretty darned close.   But let's just assume that their remarks are protected speech. That  doesn't mean we have to endorse them. That doesn't mean we have to say:  Oh, yes, that is fine. It is just another opinion.   No, it is not just another opinion. Calling for the death of Jewish  people is not just another opinion. Calling for the genocide and  celebrating the genocide of Jewish babies is not just another opinion.  Celebrating the assaults on Jewish people in this country is not just  another opinion.   The Senate should be clear and stand with moral clarity and say: This  is wrong.   Can you say it in this country? I guess you can, but it is wrong,  and, frankly, it shouldn't be hard. It shouldn't be hard to say: ``We  condemn this rhetoric. We recognize the right of Israel to exist''-- talk about basic, basic principles here--``and we recognize the right  of Israel to defend itself''--things, by the way, that the President  has said.   It shouldn't be hard for this body to say it, but it is vital-- morally necessary--in this moment of attack, in this moment, frankly,  of danger for Jewish people in Israel, around the world, and, sadly, on  our college campuses.   That is why I have offered this resolution, along with my cosponsors,  that condemns the terrorist attacks by Hamas; that denounces this  violent rhetoric here in the United States against Jewish people,  Jewish Americans, and, of course, the State of Israel; and recognizes  the right of Israel to defend itself. It is a pretty simple amendment,  and I can't imagine what the objection to it would be.   So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of S. Res. 418, which is at the desk. I further ask that  the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Would the Senator yield for a question?    What of the rhetoric that is cited specifically in the  resolution--you talked about legitimate concerns. What, specifically,  do you think is legitimate?    Senator, what is the smear? What is the smear?    What is the smear? Point me to the language.    They are not condemned by this resolution.    Senator, we are condemning----    Mr. President.    Mr. President, it is hard to believe what we have just  heard on this floor. Defense of the most vile, anti-Semitic rhetoric  under the excuse that to call out specifically the specific statements,  and denounce them one at a time and say this is wrong, that that is  somehow a smear, what that is, is a failure of moral nerve. What it is,  is a failure of moral clarity. What it is, is, frankly, sympathizing  with this rhetoric.   I don't know why it is so hard, but I guess we have now found out why  college presidents won't come out and say this is wrong.   We cite the specific words. Why is it wrong to say ``It includes  violence''? Why is it wrong to condemn this?   When students say the heroic resistance in Gaza should be praised,  they are not referring to something in general. They are talking about  the attack on Israel, the slaughter of innocent Israelis, and that is  perfectly fine? Those are legitimate concerns?   I mean, this is--the moral equivalency that has seeped into our  college campuses and, I guess, to the floor of the U.S. Senate is  unbelievable.   Let there be no mistake. What has happened today is one Senator has  blocked this body from condemning the attacks against Jewish people in  Israel, Jewish Americans in this Nation, and pretended that there is  some moral equivalency here between this and what?   The State of Israel is under existential threat. We have students in  this country who are specifically calling for and celebrating the  killing of Jews, and we can't condemn that on the floor of the Senate?  To say I am disappointed is an understatement. But I will say this: It  is a revealing moment.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
