 Madam Speaker, my faith and belief in God are the  catalyst for every decision I make, and I am committed to protecting  the most vulnerable among us.   We all have a moral responsibility to defend the right to life, which  begins at conception. Today, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in  the monumental case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.  This case concerns Mississippi's law passed in 2018, which limits  abortion at 15 weeks gestation to medical emergencies in cases of  severe fetal disability.   The Court is expected to decide whether laws like Mississippi's aimed  at protecting unborn children pre-viability align with the  Constitution.   I hope and pray that the Justices will be guided by righteousness, by  a respect for human dignity, by proper constitutional interpretation,  and by modern science to uphold Mississippi's law, and protect the  lives of the unborn.
