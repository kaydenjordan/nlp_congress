 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of Chairman  McGovern's amendment to increasing funding for the Healthcare for  Homeless Veterans Program.   Like many, I recognize the original intent for the AIR Commission.  The VA's infrastructure is aging, and we need to ensure its facilities  optimize care for veterans. I know that the chairman shares my  determination to ensure our vets receive the best possible care.   Unfortunately, the AIR process was flawed from the beginning. In a  report issued earlier this year, the GAO found that the data AIR  recommendations relied on was outdated and riddled with gaps.   The moment the AIR recommendations were released, I received calls  from veterans and VSOs in my district concerned about proposals to  close the CBOC in Paterson, New Jersey. Veterans in my community are  already asked to travel too far and wait too long for care. Closing a  central CBOC would only exacerbate this.   So while we must improve our VA facilities, the AIR's recommendations  are the wrong way to go about this. I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment.
