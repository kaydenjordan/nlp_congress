 Mr. Speaker, today the House is  expected to consider H.R. 5682--the Formerly Incarcerated Reenter  Society Transformed Safely Transitioning Every Person Act or FIRST STEP  Act. This bill represents a good faith effort to improve the  reintegration of incarcerated individuals back into their communities  and reduce recidivism. In this political climate, we must always strive  to achieve meaningful reforms wherever possible. I believe that the  FIRST STEP Act will do just that and I intend to vote for this measure  when it is considered on the floor.   I acknowledge that this is not a perfect bill. Very few are, if any.  However, the STEP Act will offer a new opportunity for incarcerated  individuals to participate in evidence-based programming to reduce  their likelihood of recidivism. It is a bill that is supported by  prominent civil rights and criminal justice reform organizations such  as the National Urban League and the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition.  It passed the House Judiciary Committee on a 25-5 vote, and I feel even  more confidently about its passage on the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that this Congress can do more to not  only reduce recidivism through ``back-end reform,'' but also engage in  ``front-end reform'' to keep individuals out of prison in the first  place. However, we must consider a bill entirely on its merits and not  just oppose a measure because it does not go far enough in its reforms.  The FIRST STEP Act is exactly that--a first step to make meaningful and  impactful changes to our prison system.
