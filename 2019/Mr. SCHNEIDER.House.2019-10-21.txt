 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in great sadness and  profound concern over President Trump's inexplicable abandonment of our  Kurdish allies in Syria who sacrificed more than 11,000 of their sons  and daughters in our joint fight against ISIS.   The President's impulsive and abrupt decision not only betrays our  allies, but it betrays our values. It immediately compromises our  national security, dramatically undermines American credibility, and  will have negative strategic implications for generations to come.   It is not just me saying this. These are the words of Senate Majority  Leader Mitch McConnell: ``Withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria is a grave  strategic mistake. It will leave the American people and homeland less  safe, embolden our enemies, and weaken important alliances.''   While we should all welcome the announced 5-day pause in the Turkish  assault, we should not be celebrating. Turkey has not recognized the  cease-fire but, rather, just a pause in fighting. Reports from the area  indicate that Turkish-affiliated forces are still attacking, and the  pause is scheduled to end tomorrow. We can likely expect the carnage to  then resume with a new ferocity.   Regarding the deal with Turkey, The Wall Street Journal this morning  notes: ``Critics have said the agreement was a wholesale concession to  Ankara, giving it control of an area in Syria it has coveted for years  and freeing it from U.S. sanctions in return for pausing an offensive  it had no international backing for. While President Trump hailed the  pact as a diplomatic victory, U.S.-allied Kurds have likened it to a  surrender on their part.''   Unsurprisingly, our Kurdish allies have now aligned their forces with  Assad's army. Assad has, thus, instantly made significant territorial  gains in just a few days, effectively controlling lands that the U.S.  and allied forces have spent years seeking to defend.   So, let's review.   In the weeks following the President's decision to walk away from our  allies, Turkish forces and allied fighters, many of which are Islamic  extremists, have crossed the border into Syria.   U.S. forces have abandoned forward operating bases and then sent U.S.  planes to destroy those bases. But before those bases could be  destroyed, celebrating Russian troops posted selfies in some of these  former American strongholds.   Turkey is not just targeting Kurdish forces, they are attacking  entire towns, and civilians are literally being murdered in the  streets.   The expansion of control by Russian and Syrian forces is not just a  win for those countries in Syria but also threatens our allies in the  region--in particular, Israel.   Iran's sense of emboldenment will likely lead it to expand programs  to deliver advanced weapons to Hezbollah, increasing the already  significant threat to Israel--only now from Syria as well as Lebanon.   As already noted, Assad has consolidated his power over virtually all  of Syria at no political or military cost.   Finally, many ISIS prisoners have escaped to join the fight, and  thousands more are at risk of release, giving ISIS a greater ability to  reorganize.   One more thing: Today, there are reports that President Erdogan now  wants Turkey to acquire nuclear weapons. The last thing this region  needs is a nuclear arms race.   Here is the bottom line. Last Thursday, the American Vice President  and Secretary of State stood at a podium and announced the  administration's effective capitulation and surrender. Turkey will  complete its ethnic cleansing, and the U.S. will lift all sanctions.   Assad has full control in Syria, under the tutelage of his Russian  and Iranian masters.   Turkey, Syria, Russia, and Iran are the winners. The Kurds are, once  more, on the losing end.   The United States, under President Trump, is sadly diminished--so  much so that Syrians are throwing rotten food at retreating U.S.  troops.  [[Page H8264]]    The administration's policies are tragic for reasons beyond the human  suffering it has unleashed. They weaken our national security,  undermine our fight against terrorism, and diminish American  credibility.   We are so much better than this.   I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to speak out and  condemn the actions of this administration. Congress must pass  sanctions on Turkey and seek to compel Erdogan to stop Turkey's assault  on the Kurds. We must compel this administration to live up to our  Nation's values, to stand by our allies, and to confront our enemies.                            ____________________
