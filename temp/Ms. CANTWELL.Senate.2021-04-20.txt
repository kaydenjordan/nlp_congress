 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  support the nominations of Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke to serve in  the leadership of the U.S. Department of Justice, and I am here, Mr.  President, to say that just because you are pro-civil rights does not  mean that you are somehow anti-police. To be for a Department of  Justice that will help us make the right decisions in enforcing civil  rights laws around the United States is what is at stake with these  nominations. I personally am tired of the challenges that we have faced  at home when we do not have people being held accountable and we have  incident after incident. And the last administration said, instead of  playing our role on consent decrees and making sure federal civil  rights laws are enforced, instead they said, ``We're going to stop  playing that role.''   So it is so important that we get a Department of Justice that will  fight for the civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans. Both  these women are highly qualified. They have defended our constitution.  They have defended the civil rights of all Americans, and they will  ensure that everyone, including the police, are held accountable. We  have probably heard this afternoon my colleagues praising Vanita Gupta  and supporting her to serve as Associate Attorney General, the third  highest position in the U.S. Department of Justice. She is very  qualified for the position. She will be the first civil rights lawyer  and woman of color to serve in this role. She led the Civil Rights  Division during the Obama administration and previously served as an  attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. When it came to  enforcing consent decrees, she made sure the Obama administration did  the job.   Now, why is this so important? I can tell you, in Seattle, we had a  Native-American carver who happened to stop carving on one corner to  walk to another corner and was shot and killed by a police officer  because he didn't respond immediately to ``Drop your knife.'' I am so  glad the Federal Government was there to say what is going on in  Seattle with the police department and overseeing on a consent decree.  We had a tragic situation in Spokane where a disabled man just went in  to buy a soft drink and snacks, but because somebody thought he was  fooling around with the ATM machine, they called the police. And when  the police arrived and he didn't respond immediately, he was brutally  beaten in the head with a baton, tasered, improperly hogtied to the  ground, and stopped breathing shortly after first responders improperly  strapping a non-rebreather mask to his face. That was Otto Zehm's  afternoon activity, to just go to the store. As he lay there dying, he  said, ``All I wanted was a Snickers.''   And thank God we had a Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department  of Justice that said, yes, we are going to intervene and make sure that  there is oversight of the Seattle Police Department and an  investigation, and we are going to make sure that the civil liberties  of all Americans--all Americans, whether you are White, Black, or  disabled, or Native American--your civil rights are going to be upheld.  But instead of discussing what is the proper role of the Federal  Government in making sure that civil liberties and civil rights of all  Americans are upheld when their rights are violated--instead, people  have said, Well, Ms. Gupta supports decriminalization of all drugs.   Well, from a State that has actually passed legislation legalizing  the recreational use of marijuana, I guarantee you, my State views some  of these issues very differently. But I can say, emphatically, Ms.  Gupta has stated consistently she does not support the  decriminalization of all drugs--nor do the people of Washington, just  because they voted to legal marijuana.   Ms. Gupta does not claim that all drugs should be legal, and she does  not adhere to the statements that some people have tried to paint her  with. You have to ask yourself, What are they afraid of? What are they  afraid that she is going to do at the Department of Justice besides  uphold our civil liberties? Some of my colleagues have argued that she  supports defunding the police. There is zero proof that she supports  defunding the police. I don't know why we keep having this debate, but  she has worked and understands the police officers' perspective. She  has worked to ensure that they were provided with adequate resources.  She has worked on building relationships. She has a comprehensive  approach to law enforcement and support from their organizations. And I  [[Page S2057]]  believe she deserves the support of our colleagues.   In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Fraternal Order of  Police described Ms. Gupta as one who ``always worked with us to find  common ground, even when that seemed impossible.'' So it is clear that  she has the support of police. So we need someone like her who is going  to bring back this important role of oversight to these important  issues.   Ms. Clarke is the same. She is nominated to head the Civil Rights  Division where she once worked as a trial lawyer. She previously  codirected the voting rights work of the NAACP Legal Defense and  Education Fund, led the Civil Rights Bureau in the New York State  Attorney General's office, and has served as the president of the  Lawyers Committee on Civil Rights Under the Law. I have called her; I  have interviewed her. Why? Because I am tired of the violence and hate  crimes in the State of Washington. I am tired of hearing, time and time  again, about these issues. And it can be the synagogue in Spokane,  where literally somebody spray-painted it. And you would think, Well,  how are we going to find who spray-painted a swastika on a synagogue in  Spokane? You think, How are we going to find that person? Okay. Not a  lot of trouble because people actually said, We did it purposely  because we are an organization who believes in this, and we wanted to  get our message out. That is what we're facing.   And several years ago, we found a bomb planted in the Martin Luther  King Day Parade in Spokane, just a few years ago. So these aren't  issues that we are sending somebody over to the Department of Justice  to analyze and write a report on. We are asking people to help us with  the situation in the United States of America to fight hate crimes and  to bring about justice on the civil rights and civil liberties of all  Americans. And so we have to have people that we have confidence that  they are going to uphold our laws and enforce them.   We need to have consent decrees to hold police departments  accountable for systematic violations of constitutional rights. We need  to defend voting rights and to make sure that hate crimes against  Asian-American and Pacific Islanders are prosecuted. And so this is why  the nomination of Ms. Clarke is so important. I ask my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle, if you are facing any of this in your  State, please get Kristen Clarke to be there to help us address these  issues.   Advocating for increased investment in mental health and social work  and school resources for minority communities is something that law  enforcement agrees with. They agree that we should do these things. So  that is not defunding the police; yet people accuse Kristen Clarke of  the same thing. She must be for defunding the police. I have talked to  prosecutors throughout the State of Washington, and they will tell me  that these programs that help families and communities identify these  problems early are actually the best things to keep them from having to  really have problems later. I certainly hope that some of the false  claims that people have made about Ms. Clarke being anti-police are  also continued to be struck down as untrue.   Ms. Clarke understands law enforcement must collaborate with the  State, local, and Federal level. She has a solid record of working  cooperatively with law enforcement for decades. She is supported by the  Major Cities Chief Association, the National Association of Black Law  Executives, a bipartisan group of over 70 former State attorneys  general, and more than 40 police chiefs and sheriffs throughout the  United States. That can't be somebody who sounds anti-law enforcement.  They have the support of law enforcement.   What we need is the support of our colleagues to say that these are  serious issues and the Federal Government does play a role. That is why  it is called the Department of Justice, and that is why they oversee  and make sure that the civil liberties of all Americans are upheld. As  attorney general and at the Lawyers Committee, Ms. Clarke played a key  role in launching a Religious Rights Initiative to address faith-based  discrimination to fight anti-Semitic activities. When Ms. Clarke led  the Lawyers Committee, she led the charge in shutting down abhorrent  anti-Semitic websites that made racist comments, and some were in  connection with stormfront.org, which was a central site used to  organize the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.   She recognized that online hate is an emerging threat and that  Congress must address that threat. After seeing what happened on  January 6 and the plethora of anti-Semitic paraphernalia presented here  even in the Capitol as we saw riots, Ms. Clarke's expertise and  dedication to fighting online hate would be extremely beneficial to the  Department and to all Americans.   So I implore my colleagues, these are strong women, great  qualifications, have been in the mix on these policy issues for a long  time. They know what we are up against. We have to ask ourselves, Are  we going to enforce the law? These women will enforce the law, and they  have the support of law enforcement. We should proceed and confirm both  of them.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.
