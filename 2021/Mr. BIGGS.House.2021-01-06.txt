 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the objection.    Madam Speaker, I join the objection to counting votes of  electors from my home State of Arizona, as well as Georgia,  Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Nevada, because election  integrity is the heart of our American constitutional republic?    In a representative form of government, we must be able to trust that  our elections accurately represent the will of the American voter. This  is the appropriate forum anticipated and provided for by our Founders  to debate whether this election complied with the Constitution that we  have all sworn to protect.   Every particular of the Constitution is to be protected, including  Article II, Section 1. The debate as to the legitimacy of the 2020  Presidential election has been suppressed by the left and its  propagandists in the media until today.   State legislatures are required to determine the manner in which  electors are chosen. Arizona names its electors on the general election  ballot and identifies what candidate those electors are required to  vote for should that candidate obtain the majority of votes in the  general election.   As part of the manner for determining electors, Arizona also  establishes deadlines for voter registration. The deadline has been in  place for 30 years.                                time  1345    This year, that voter registration deadline was October 5. Early  voting commenced 2 days later. Five days before the deadline, a group  filed a lawsuit demanding that Arizona election officials not enforce  the deadline.   The Federal District Court decided that since other States have a  deadline later than Arizona's and some even allow for registration when  voting, that Arizona's new deadline would be a time he chose, not the  legislature's timeline.   The appellate court effectively overturned the lower court ruling and  noted that the Arizona deadline established by the State legislature  was sound and appropriate and complied with the Constitution. But the  appellate court merely shortened the extension, the bypassing of the  deadline to 10 days.   The appellate court, without legal justification, also decided that  everyone who registered after the legal deadline, but before the  deadline created by judicial fiat, could still vote.   Note that the Arizona legislature was no longer in control of  determining the manner of appointing Presidential electors because the  court had set a new deadline, even though the appellate court found the  legislature's deadline was constitutionally sound.   During that window, more than 32,000 voters registered in Maricopa  County alone. Here are copies of those voter registration records. In  going around the deadline set by the legislature, the court ignored the  Arizona legislature's obligation and right to direct the manner of  choosing Presidential electors as set forth in Article II, Section 1.   As a consequence of that judicial usurpation, more than 32,000 people  were allowed to unlawfully cast ballots in Arizona's Presidential  election in 2020.   The Arizona legislature seeks an independent audit of the election.  The Governor refuses now to call them into a special session. The  Maricopa County Board of Supervisors has refused to comply with  legislative subpoenas. In Arizona, the people who control the evidence  related to the election have done everything possible to prevent an  independent audit directed by the legislature.   Arizonans have used the limited amount of records available to  investigate the 2020 Presidential election. Of a limited sample of  1,000 addresses of voters, they found 539 voters did not live at the  addresses on the voter rolls. Here is a stack of 1,000 declaration of  affidavits supporting that.   I object to counting the votes of Arizona electors because the  Federal courts went around the legislatively constructed mechanism for  choosing Arizona's Presidential electors, allowing tens of thousands of  voters to unlawfully cast votes. The court usurped a key component of  the Arizona legislature's manner of selecting Presidential electors,  thus violating Article II, Section 1. The legislature is being  obstructed in its efforts. And what little evidence we have and what  little information we have has produced this kind of evidence, which  indicates a significant problem with the integrity of the Presidential  election.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record my written comments, together  with the voter registration records that reflect the 32,000  registrations permitted in contravention of State law; letters and  resolutions from Arizona legislators pertaining to the count of votes  from electors; along with approximately 1,000 affidavits and  declarations pertaining to potential voter fraud in Arizona in the 2020  Presidential election; and the statement of Congressman Randy Weber of  Texas.                                                  December 31, 2020.        Dear Vice President Pence: As the Chairwoman of the Arizona       House Elections Committee, I write to you with upmost urgency       to communicate to you several occurrences that thwart our       ability as legislators to investigate legitimate and       concerning allegations of election fraud in the most recent       general election. On December 14, 2020, Arizona sent an       alternate slate of electors, along with a resolution from 21       current and 8 newly elected legislators asking you to refrain       from accepting the Biden electors until we could adequately       investigate these claims of fraud.        Soon after the election, I requested an Elections Committee       discovery hearing in order to use subpoena power to acquire       the voting machines and ballots in order to do a       comprehensive and forensic audit. I was told that it was not       a good idea and was denied the ability. I continued to       request the hearing with the Speaker of the House, asked       publicly, and tried every avenue to no avail. A full month       later on December 9th, the Senate President authorized a       hearing via the Judiciary committee, and that did result in       subpoenas to the Maricopa County Supervisors (who oversee the       elections process) that have yet, as of the writing of this       letter, been complied with.        Court cases have been dismissed due to not having evidence,       however our efforts to do an audit to obtain such evidence       have been suppressed. We held a hearing on 11/30/2020 with       Rudy Giuliani to at least hear testimony from citizens who       experienced irregularities, along with subject matter experts       who reported severe irregularities and probable tampering       with the machine apparatus. On 11/30/2020, a group of Arizona       citizens reported publicly that they had uncovered with great       confidence a minimum estimation of 160,000 fraudulent voters,       based on over 1000 declarations/affidavits collected. This       supports an earlier document submitted to the Attorney       General and would largely impact the outcome of the election.        We have experienced obstruction at every turn. For your       reference, I have itemized, in Exhibit A, many of the various       ways we have been stopped from investigating claims of fraud       and gross irregularities. It is my hope that you will see       that the Arizona Presidential election is still in dispute       and unresolved. We call on you to take this into       consideration as you perform your duties on January 6th, and       not accept the electors until we have resolution to these       matters.            With utmost respect,                                                 Kelly J. Townsend,                                                     Senator-Elect.                                 Exhibit A         1. Requests from the House Elections Chairwoman (myself)       and the House Federal Relations Chairman (Mark Finchem) to       hold an evidentiary hearing were repeatedly denied and have       yet to be honored. Multiple Chairmen of various committees       requested a hearing in order to investigate claims, to no       avail. We were forced to hold an unofficial hearing on       November 30th where many came forward with very concerning       evidence and claims.        2. The Senate Judiciary Committee hearing was not held       until 41 days after the election on 12/14/2020, the same day       as the Electors were to cast their votes. This delay rendered       the hearing of little effect regarding having confidence in       the correct votes cast. The Chairman thus issued a subpoena       for the equipment and ballots, but the Maricopa Board of       Supervisors has countersued and refuse to comply. They will       not release any machine or ballot info, even though within       the RFP for the Dominion machines, it is stated that their       key features are their ability to conduct hand counts,       perform risk limiting audits, and publish ballot images and       adjudication records with markings on a  [[Page H81]]       public website, calling it their open data initiative. Now       that they are being asked for it, they are refusing to make       it available, citing voter confidentiality. There is no voter       information contained in the machine or on a ballot, however,       so that reasoning is insufficient. Their inaction and       nonfeasance prevent us from proper discovery.        3. I, along with several others, requested the Governor to       call us in for special session to be able to deal with the       issue. It is our understanding that we cannot enforce the       subpoena for equipment and ballots unless we are in session.       His ongoing unwillingness to call us into session to address       these issues had kept us from adequate discovery. On 12/02/      2020, Governor Doug Ducey was asked by the media if he was       going to honor the Legislator's request for a special       session. He proceeded to incorrectly name Monday January 13th       as our first day back in regular session. In response, the       reporter asked, ``So you see no need for a special session to       look at any of these issues or the issue of Presidential       electors...,'' to which the Governor interrupted and said,       ``I'll see the Legislature in January.''        4. The House leadership attempted to deter Representative       Bret Roberts from sending a letter to Attorney General       Brnovich and the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors       regarding the accurate performance of a hand count based on       the statutory requirement to do so by precinct, versus vote       center. By doing a hand count based on voting centers, it       renders it impossible to tell if there was a rogue precinct       involved in fraud. Nevertheless, Rep. Robert's efforts to       enforce statute were thwarted by House leadership.        5. One week prior to the Electors voting, on December 7th,       the House and Senate leadership closed the buildings in the       name of COVID-19, preventing any in-person hearings or work       to be performed. This greatly hindered our ability to push       for discovery regarding election integrity during the last       days before the Elector's votes were cast.        6. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors held a closed       meeting on 11/20/2020 in order to certify the election       results, where the public was not allowed to participate and       ask questions. Prior to that meeting, on 12/08/2020, Merissa       Hamilton (a data integrity expert) delivered to the Attorney       General a statistically significant listing of deceased       voters that received a ballot and those deceased who actually       returned a ballot. At the aforementioned meeting, the       Maricopa County Elections Director Ray Valenzuela stated that       the list of deceased voters casting a ballot was mere       folklore and dismissed it as a nonissue. This accusation is       still pending an investigation.        7. After submitting a public records request for the       Federal only voters who cast a ballot in the 2020 General       election, I was told by a staff member that the Elections       Director was ``vetting the list'' before he gave it to me. I       did not request a cleaned-up list of voters, but the list in       its entirety. This diminished my confidence in that list,       that I have a true representation of persons who cast a       ballot that cannot establish their identity or citizenship.        8. Arizona State House leadership prevented Legislators       from issuing press releases having to do with the election       that did not conform to their own opinion. This diminished       our ability to communicate to the public our concerns about       how the election and post procedures were being handled.        9. On 12/01/2020, I requested the Attorney General's       Elections Integrity office to investigate the claims made at       the November 30th Giuliani hearing and provided them the       link. I was told that none of the items listed at the       Giuliani hearing would be investigated by that office.        10. The Maricopa County Recorder attended more than one       DefCon conference that focused on the ability to hack voting       machines. The Legislature was never informed that the outcome       of these conferences recommended that elected officials be       notified due to unprotected ports on the machines, passwords       left unset or left in default configurations and security       features of the underlying commercial hardware were left       unused or even disabled. It was recommended that to improve       election security, paper ballots should be used, and a       rigorous post-election audit be performed. We learned about       this issue via social media, and it was obfuscated by the       Election officials.        11. Arizona Republican State Chair Kelli Ward reports the       following malfeasance and obstruction:        a. No allowed review of the digitally adjudicated ballots--      over 200,000.        b. Only 100 of the duplicated ballots reviewed--3% error       rate in favor of President Trump. Maricopa County refused to       look at the other 28,000 ballots.        c. No meaningful signature verification. County employees       doing signature verification offsite, over the internet,       without oversight, and at times at a rate of 30 signatures or       more per minute.        12. The Secretary of State took 24 days to answer a public       records request by Merissa Hamilton, asking them to deliver       the meeting minutes from their technical committee to certify       the Dominion voting equipment. Only after four requests and       the involvement of the Ombudsman did she obtain the       information. The results of that request showed that despite       the voting equipment not being able to calculate the votes       properly, which was never addressed, the machines were still       certified. The Maricopa County RFP for the Dominion equipment       did not give the public a chance to give input on the       procurement. There was never any discussion or an offer of       various options to choose from. The Board of Supervisors went       straight to a vote with no discussion and approved the       machines unanimously.        13. There are multiple/numerous examples of how on election       day observers and poll workers were prevented from overseeing       the various procedures, thereby undermining confidence that       there was no illegal activity and violating Arizona's       statutes regarding election integrity. We have had no formal       investigation into the vast majority of these accusations.                                   Summary         Arizona has many unresolved issues that we would like to       have investigated in order to confidently say our electors       voted for the true victor in the 2020 Presidential election.       We still have outstanding issues left unresolved and are       being stopped at nearly every turn from investigating. For       example, the Maricopa County Recorder's office started       counting early ballots 14 days before election day. During       that time, the backup server was removed each night by a       Dominion employee. This is of significant concern because the       information on those servers could have been manipulated and/      or provided to nefarious people as to how many ballots/votes       were needed to change the results of the election as time       went on.        Many in the Legislature believe that if we are able to do a       forensic audit, we could investigate these and other serious       claims brought forward to us. However, as you can see by the       list above (not exhaustive but brief for your benefit) we       have many entities who appear to be blocking our efforts to       get to the bottom of the issue. One can only ask, in a       supposedly secure and fair election, why discovery is being       quashed.                                  Conclusion         It is asked that all of these issues be considered when       contemplating the eleven Arizona electoral votes. Our       election is still in dispute, and we have obfuscation and       attempts at running out the clock to prevent discovery of the       facts. We believe it is impossible to conclusively declare a       winner in Arizona and pray that you would refrain from       counting the electoral votes from our state, and consider the       alternate slate should we be able to establish validity to       the various claims of election fraud on such a scale that       would change the outcome.        Thank you, kindly, for your attention to these matters.                                   ____                           A Resolution to Congress         Whereas, it is the constitutional and legal obligation of       the Legislature of the State of Arizona to ensure that the       state's presidential electors truly represent the will of the       voters of Arizona; and        Whereas, pursuant to the direction of Congress as set forth       in United States Code, title 3, section 1 as authorized by       Article II, section 1, clause 4 of the Constitution of the       United States, and state law adopted pursuant thereto,       Arizona conducted an election for presidential electors on       the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November of 2020-      that is, on November 3, 2020; and        Whereas, that election was marred by irregularities so       significant as to render it highly doubtful whether the       certified results accurately represent the will of the       voters; and        Whereas, Congress has further directed in U.S. Code, title       3, section 2 that when a state ``has held an election for the       purpose of choosing electors, and has failed to make a choice       on the day prescribed by law, the electors may be appointed       on a subsequent day in such manner as the legislature of such       State may direct''; and        Whereas, that provision implicitly recognizes that Article       II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution grants to       each state legislature, with stated limitations, the sole       authority to prescribe the manner of appointing electors for       that state; and        Whereas, the United States Supreme Court and other courts       have explained that when a state legislature directs the       manner of appointing electors, it does so pursuant to a grant       of authority from the U.S. Constitution rather than by reason       of any state constitutional or other legal provision; that       this authority may be exercised by the legislature alone       without other aspects of the normal lawmaking process; and       that the state legislature's authority over the appointment       of presidential electors is plenary and may be resumed at any       time; and        Whereas, because U.S. Code, title 3, section 7 mandates       that all presidential electors vote for President and Vice       President of the United States on December 14, 2020, it is       impossible to pursue the Legislature's preferred course of       action, which would be for Arizona's voters to participate in       a new and fair and free presidential election before that       date; and        Whereas, in view of the facts heretofore recited, the       Legislature is required to exercise its best judgment as to       which slate of electors the voters prefer; and        Whereas, legal precedent exists where in 1960 the State of       Hawaii sent an alternate slate of electors while the       Presidential election was still in question in order to meet       the deadline of selecting electors, and upon recount the       alternate slate of electors' ballots were ultimately counted;       and        Whereas, the undersigned have an obligation to find the       truth. For this reason, on several occasions since November       3, we state lawmakers have requested fact-finding hearings to       include a comprehensive and independent forensic audit. At       this time, no such  [[Page H82]]       audit has been authorized. This leaves the uncertainty of the       election results in a state that requires further       investigation and resolution; and        Whereas, ongoing election irregularity litigation is       currently active, and there are unresolved disputes by both       the Legislature and at least one Presidential campaign,       rendering the election inconclusive as of date of signing of       this letter,        Therefore, be it        Resolved by the undersigned Legislators, members of the       Arizona House and Senate, request that the alternate 11       electoral votes be accepted for to Donald J. Trump or to have       all electoral votes nullified completely until a full       forensic audit can be conducted. Be it further resolved that       the United States Congress is not to consider a slate of       electors from the State of Arizona until the Legislature       deems the election to be final and all irregularities       resolved.        Signed this day, 14 December, 2020.
