 Mr. Speaker, our Nation's healthcare providers  are in a unique position to recognize and start to address a patient  suffering from addiction. It is vital that their training fully equips  them to play that very important role.   Currently, fewer than 10 percent of U.S. medical schools require a  dedicated course on addiction, and only a handful have a robust  curriculum on the diagnosis and treatment of substance use disorder.  The TEACH to Combat Addiction Act seeks to increase the amount of  education health professional students receive specific to substance  use disorder and addiction by recognizing and supporting institutions  that focus on these areas and holding them up as a model for other  programs.   I know from talking with schools in Ohio like the University of  Cincinnati and The Ohio State University that the medical education  community is eager to be a part of the solution to the opioid crisis.  This legislation gives them the additional tools with which to pursue  innovative strategies and community partnerships that advance their  students' knowledge and understanding of substance use disorder and  addiction.   Mr. Speaker, the work we are doing in this House to combat the opioid  epidemic is important. Too many of our families, friends, and neighbors  have been lost for us to delay any longer.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
