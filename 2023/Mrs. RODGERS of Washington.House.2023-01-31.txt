 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's  leadership on the Subcommittee on Health, as well as bringing forward  this legislation today. I think it is very important legislation, H.R.  382, the Pandemic is Over Act.   Just to recap, 3 years ago today, Health and Human Services Secretary  Alex Azar declared a public health emergency for the emerging threat  that was the novel coronavirus. The U.S. had just identified its first  official case over a week prior.   Within 1 year of the anniversary of the public health emergency,  thanks to the early leadership of President Trump and Operation Warp  Speed, an authorized vaccine helped prevent thousands of  hospitalizations and deaths.   Mr. Speaker, 3 years later, it is estimated that 95 percent of those  over 16 have been vaccinated or have had COVID-19.   Earlier in January, President Biden extended the public health  emergency for the twelfth time, continuing to use the pandemic and the  national and public health emergency authorities to achieve progressive  policy goals. This includes pushing for an indefinite extension on the  moratorium on evictions, the suspension of student loan interest  payments, and attempts to require masking in public transit.   Last week, House Republicans announced that we would bring this bill,  along with Representative Paul Gosar's bill, to end the COVID-19  national emergency to the floor today. Just yesterday, the Biden  administration decided to announce their plans to end the public health  emergency on May 11, 2023, which CNN has reported only came after the  House Democrats were worried about voting against this bill without the  White House having a plan in place.   Whatever the reason or the rationale for their announcement, I am  pleased that the administration is following the House Republicans and  finally abiding by President Biden's own acknowledgment 4 months ago  that the pandemic is over, but it shouldn't take another 3 months to  unwind this authoritarian control.   It is long past time for the Biden administration to stop relying on  an emergency that no longer exists so that they can make unilateral  decisions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Democratic colleagues to join the  Democratic administration and House Republicans in voting ``yes'' on  H.R. 382. Declare the COVID-19 pandemic over. Give Americans their  lives back. Work to develop policies so that we are better prepared  moving forward.   The Senate voted in a bipartisan way to end the national emergency,  and I hope that this bill also will gain bipartisan support.  [[Page H538]]         Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership  of Dr. Bucshon and thank him for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.  Representative Duncan's bill, H.R. 497, the Freedom for Health Care  Workers Act, and I join in offering my heartfelt condolences to the  gentleman from California, Representative Garcia, who lost his mom  [[Page H544]]  early on in this pandemic, early on in 2020.   I also want to note that in November of 2021, long after the date it  became available, the vaccines did not prevent the transmission of  COVID-19.                                time  1545    We have known since November 2021 that the vaccines do not prevent  transmission of COVID-19, yet the Biden administration released their  interim final regulation requiring this vaccination for all Medicare  and Medicaid providers.   This bill is long overdue to repeal what is an egregious mandate and  to return the decisionmaking to our healthcare workers, as well as  providing relief to our healthcare facilities that are struggling to  hire frontline healthcare workers today.   Because of this mandate, facilities all across this country are being  forced to require all of their employees, including support staff such  as cooks and cleaners, to get the COVID-19 vaccination regardless of  whether they even had the infection prior, or they face civil monetary  penalties, a denial of payment for new patients, or termination of  their entire Medicare or Medicaid provider agreement.   Healthcare workers have been forced to choose between violating their  own personally held beliefs and their healthcare decisions informed by  their doctors' medical advice or potentially lose their job and  livelihood, be forced to move from their communities, and struggle to  pay their bills during record-high inflation.   This mandate did not build trust in the vaccine. It has only further  eroded Americans' trust in our public health officials and  institutions. The CDC and other institutions have acknowledged that the  vaccines do not prevent transmission of the COVID-19 virus, which  reinforces that this is just an authoritarian mandate and that it does  not protect vulnerable patients.   This is not about science. In Washington State, the Washington State  Hospital Association estimates that 2 percent of the workforce has been  lost because of this healthcare vaccine mandate. That may not sound  like a lot, but at a time when we have unprecedented shortages, we need  every nurse and every doctor available to be able to be hired and help  meet the needs of patients. This is a burden on an already struggling  system.   There is no reason that this administration should continue this  policy, but since they haven't taken action, Congress must step in  again as we did when we removed the mandate for our troops last year.   I am hopeful that some of our Democrat colleagues will recognize the  toll of this mandate on this already stressed workforce and join us in  supporting this legislation. Let's return critical healthcare decisions  to doctors and their patients. It is time to close this chapter on the  pandemic and the mandates and start looking ahead.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
