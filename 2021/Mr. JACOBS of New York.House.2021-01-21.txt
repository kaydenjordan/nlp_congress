 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  waiver allowing General Lloyd Austin to serve as Secretary of Defense.   Civilian leadership at the top of the Pentagon is desirable and  necessary. I believe this should only be reserved for unique  circumstances. Regularly nominated candidates who require waivers is  not a precedent we should set.   However, examining General Austin's credentials and the circumstances  facing our Nation lead me to believe the approval of this specific  waiver is warranted.    The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. China is growing bolder and  more  [[Page H213]]  aggressive, using espionage, cyber warfare, and manipulation to  undermine U.S. and global security. Iran remains an ever-present threat  to the Middle East and the world. North Korea continues to pursue an  ambitious nuclear weapons development program.   These issues and others require the steady hand of an experienced and  qualified Secretary of Defense. General Austin meets these requirements  and is more than qualified to oversee our Nation's military.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the support of this waiver. I look forward to  working with Secretary Austin to confront these very real threats to  our national security.
