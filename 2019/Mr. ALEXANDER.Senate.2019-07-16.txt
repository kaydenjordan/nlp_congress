 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last month, during National Nurses  Week, Ballad Health, a healthcare system in East Tennessee, announced  it would be giving several thousand nurses a raise.   The head of Ballad Health announced a $10 million investment in pay  increases for nurses.   He said: ``Our nurses and those who work with them in the provision  of direct patient care are heroes . . . however, it is also true that .  . . we face significant national shortage of these critical health care  providers.''   Alan, the head of Ballad Health, said that his investment was, in  part, because of a new rule proposed by the Trump administration in  April.   This new rule will update the formula that determines how much  Medicare will reimburse hospitals for patient care. The formula takes  into account, among other things, the cost of labor in that geographic  area called the area wage index.   This new rule attempts to level the playing field between hospitals  in areas that have higher wages, and therefore are reimbursed at a  higher rate than hospitals in areas with lower wages.   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator, Seema  Verma, wrote in a recent op-ed in The Tennessean in Nashville:         Many stakeholders have raised concerns that the Medicare       hospital payment system disadvantages many rural hospitals.       Our proposed rule brings payments to rural and other low-wage       hospitals closer to their urban neighbors.    I say this standing in the Senate Chamber, where we have the chairman  and the ranking Democrat on the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry  Committee--two experts on rural areas and rural hospitals in our  country.   In recent years, too many rural Americans have seen their local  hospital close and their doctors leave town.   Since 2010, 107 rural hospitals have closed across 28 States and  another 637--about one-third of all rural hospitals--are at risk of  closing.   In Tennessee alone, 12 rural hospitals have closed since 2010.   A recent survey by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard  School of Public Health found that one in four Americans in rural areas  couldn't access healthcare when they need it.   This new rule will help rural hospitals keep up with the cost of  providing care and keep those hospitals open.   Alan from Ballad Health said: ``This proposed change indicates that  Washington finally understands that rural health systems, like ours,  have been historically unable to keep up with the real cost growth of  nursing and other direct care providers.''   Craig Becker, who leads the Tennessee Hospital Association, wrote in  The Tennessean earlier this month that this rule ``is good news for our  State's hospitals and will provide much-needed relief to many of them,  especially those in rural areas'' and that the rule ``finally will  address the significant inequities in the Medicare area wage index--the  first meaningful effort by any administration to address this flawed  system.''   This new rule from CMS will help ensure Americans can access  healthcare close by to their homes by leveling the playing field  between urban and rural hospitals that rely on the Medicare hospital  payment system.   Last month, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee, which I chair and Senator Murray of Washington State is the  ranking Democrat, approved, by a vote of 20 to 3, a bipartisan package  of 55 proposals from 65 Senators to lower healthcare costs that will  help rural Americans.   For example, the legislation would ban anticompetitive terms that  large hospital chains sometimes use in contracts with employers, such  as the so-called all-or-nothing clauses. These clauses increase prices  for employers and patients and can block healthcare plans from choosing  hospitals based on the care quality, the patient experience, or one  hospital's competitive pricing.   Banning all-or-nothing clauses will help level the playing field for  smaller, independent hospitals who are not part of a large corporate  chain.   Another provision in the Lower Healthcare Cost Act of 2019 will  expand technology-based healthcare to help Americans in rural areas  have access to specialty care.   I hope the Trump administration and CMS Administrator Verma will  quickly finish this rule and give Americans better healthcare choices  and outcomes at lower costs, especially in our rural areas.   I yield the floor.
