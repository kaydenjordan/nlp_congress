 Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce my  legislation, the Pay Workers What They've Earned Act.   As we face this extreme MAGA Republican shutdown caused by Speaker  McCarthy's unwillingness to work in a bipartisan fashion, we must  remember the lessons of past shutdowns.   The Republicans are hell-bent on shutting down the Federal  Government, harming thousands of Nevadan workers and small business  contractors, wreaking havoc on our economy, and impacting essential  services for women and children, our military, and causing delays to  Medicare and Social Security payments to seniors. It is wrong. It is  unacceptable. It is why I am committed to supporting a bipartisan  solution to keep government working for my constituents in Nevada.   Madam Speaker, my legislation would reimburse Federal employees for  fees and interest and fines charged through no fault of their own  during a government shutdown. The bill would also reimburse State and  Tribal Governments for costs incurred during government shutdowns. As  thousands of Federal employees and small business contractors learned  in previous sessions, simply reopening the government doesn't help them  pay their credit card fees or their overdue rent notices.     This is something you may not understand, but the  hardworking people of Nevada's Fourth do.
