 Madam President, today I would like to remember  the life of retired U.S. Army National Guard SSG Jordy James Soesbe.  Staff Sergeant Soesbe passed away on May 20, 2019, at the age of 44.   Jordy Soesbe was born in Burke, SD, and raised on his family's farm  and ranch in Gregory, SD.   Soesbe spent more than 20 years in the U.S. Army and Army National  Guard, retiring in 2017 at the rank of staff sergeant in the National  Guard. He completed two tours of duty in Afghanistan, serving as a  gunner on a Humvee, sniper, and prison guard. He served with the Army's  82nd Airborne Division and 25th Infantry Division and the South Dakota  National Guard's 235th Military Police Company.   During his time in the military, he earned numerous commendations and  medals, including the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Campaign Star,  Armed Forces Reserve Medal with ``M'' Device and 10-year Hourglass  Device, Army Commendation Medal, and four Army Achievement Medals.   Aside from his career in the military, he also served as a reserve  sheriff's deputy with the Meade County Sheriff's Office.   In his spare time, he was an avid pheasant and deer hunter. He also  enjoyed spending time at his local shooting range.   Staff Sergeant Soesbe was not only a hero in life, but also a hero in  death. As an organ donor, he saved at least three lives. I commend this  hero for his service, both in life and death, and offer my sincerest  condolences to his family and friends. He is survived by his mother  Virginia; brother Brett; daughters Alexandra, McKenna, and Alyssa; and  numerous nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, cousins, and in-laws.                            ____________________
