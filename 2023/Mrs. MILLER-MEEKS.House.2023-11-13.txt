 Mr. Speaker, last week, the city of Davenport  gathered to celebrate the completion of phase 2 for the Veterans  Memorial Park located at 315 South Marquette Street.   The new features include developments of the river outlook, the  addition of an amphitheater, and a large mural created by Davenport  West art teacher Dave Schaeffer. The new mural installation took the  span of 2 years to create.   Our veterans and their families have given so much for our great  Nation, and we must honor our commitment to those who have served and  remember their sacrifices.   As a veteran, I thank our community volunteers who came together and  dedicated time to create this project, which will impact future  generations, in time for Veterans Day.                        Congratulating Camryn Sattler     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Camryn  Sattler, a standout senior cross-country athlete from Clinton High  School  [[Page H5674]]  who demonstrated her exceptional talent and determination at the Class  4-A State meet on October 27.    Camryn not only set her high school's record earlier in the year, but  she went on to smash her own personal best by almost 23 seconds.   I congratulate Camryn on her 13th place finish at State this year. I  congratulate her younger sister, Carryn Sattler, for making her  sophomore debut, finishing 65th.   Mr. Speaker, I wish them the best of luck in their future  competitions and endeavors.                       Recognizing America Recycles Day     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize America  Recycles Day. This year, America Recycles Day will be celebrated on  Wednesday, November 15.   Recycling in rural America is no small feat. In many cases, recycling  in rural communities can require driving long distances to reach  facilities that can process recycled materials.   That is why I was proud to introduce the Recycling Infrastructure and  Accessibility Act with Representative Mikie Sherrill. This legislation  rethinks rural recycling programs, works with States and local  governments to support partnerships to process recyclable materials,  and creates good-paying jobs for our rural and underserved communities.   This year, on America Recycles Day, I urge my colleagues to expand  access to recycling for all communities and support the Recycling  Infrastructure and Accessibility Act.               Hawkeye Women's Wrestling Off to Wonderful Start     Mr. Speaker, in 2021, the University of Iowa  Athletics Department announced that it would become the first NCAA  Division I, Power Five conference institution to offer women's  wrestling as an intercollegiate program.   This year, on November 4, the women's wrestling team officially  kicked off their inaugural season. The Hawkeyes dominated East  Stroudsburg, winning 43-1. On Sunday, November 5, the Hawkeyes competed  in the Princeton Open, bringing home six gold medals. Over the weekend,  a crowd of 8,207 people showed up for the Hawkeye women's Carver- Hawkeye Arena debut for the Trailblazer Duals.   The Iowa women's wrestling team is off to a wonderful start.   The team is led by Head Coach Clarissa Chun, a two-time Olympian who  took fifth at the 2008 Beijing Games before earning a bronze medal at  the 2012 London Games.   With a roster comprised of 28 impressive women, the Hawkeyes are sure  to continue this dominance throughout the remainder of their 13-match  season.   Go Hawks.   Mr. Speaker, let me also wish a happy belated birthday to my very  good friend and former deputy chief of staff, Austin Harris.   Happy birthday to Austin.                            ____________________
