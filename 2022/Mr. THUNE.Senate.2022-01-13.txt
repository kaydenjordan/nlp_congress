 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, just a quick observation or two about what  my colleagues from New Hampshire and Connecticut were just speaking to,  and that is the issue of the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. I intend to talk  about another subject, but as I was listening to their dialogue on that  subject, there were a couple of things that I thought were important to  respond to.   They had indicated that there is a bill offered by Senator Menendez  on their side of the aisle that they thought would get 90-plus votes  here in the U.S. Senate. I would say to my colleagues on the Democratic  side that Senator Cruz, as he was advocating for a vote on his  amendment, offered that up. He offered up a vote on Menendez and a vote  on his amendment to Menendez, and that was turned down by the Democrat  leadership. So that was put forward as an offer by the Senator from  Texas, Senator Cruz.   Just to also make the point--this isn't something that is a new issue  for him. He has been advocating on the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline for  years. In fact, there were sanctions put in place under the previous  administration, which I think had been quite effective.   With respect to holding State Department nominees, sometimes around  here, you have to get people's attention in order to get a vote on  something. I mean, he didn't have to hold nominees in the last  administration because they allowed for a vote. In this administration,  that has not been the case. He has been trying for literally weeks and  months. I happened to be here in the wee hours of the morning a few  weeks ago on a Friday evening when this was being discussed, and we  were waiting for some agreement between him and the Democrat leadership  about giving him a vote on this amendment. Ultimately, when he got the  vote on his amendment, he turned loose 40-some State Department  nominees.   So I think he has in this case played fairly, played by the rules in  the Senate, and exercised the leverage he has as a U.S. Senator to  ensure that he got a vote on an issue that is critically important, not  only to him and I would say to this entire body but to our country and  certainly to our allies in that region.   There is one final point I will make. Everybody, as they were talking  about this, was saying: Wow, you know, this is--all of a sudden, this  issue has become a relevant one.   Well, it has always been a relevant one. Defending and supporting  people in Ukraine and making sure they have a democratic government  that allows for self-rule is something that I think all of us in this  country want to see happen.   But I think one of the reasons it has come to a head is because last  year--not last year but 2 years ago, the previous administration--the  Senators from New Hampshire and Connecticut were going after Senator  Cruz and other Republicans for not paying attention to this issue a  long time ago.   We have been paying attention to it for a long time, but one thing  that has intensified that attention is the fact that the Russians now  have tens of thousands of troops on Ukraine's border. That is a new  issue and an issue that I think demands the attention of this body, our  country, our government, our State Department, and the American  military, in conjunction with our allies in that region.    This is a critical time. It is very important that a strong message  be sent. I am not sure why you would wait until after the Russians  cross the border and occupy Ukraine before you do something that might  deter that kind of bad behavior.   I think the reason they have amassed the troops they have on the  Ukraine border is because they perceive the change of administration,  perhaps a different view, and, in fact, I think that buildup started in  the spring of 2021 under this administration.   So just to make the point that the vote we will have this afternoon  on Senator Cruz's proposal on Nord Stream 2 has been a long time in the  making--he has, I think, consistently worked this issue, advocated for  this issue in a way that any Senator who is trying to get a vote around  here would.   I think with respect to why this issue is now particularly relevant  in light of our national security interests is the fact that the  Russians do have literally tens of thousands of troops sitting on  Ukraine's border at a time when the world is a very dangerous place,  and that region in particular faces considerable peril because of the  neighborhood in which they live.   So I would hope that this afternoon when this Nord Stream 2 vote  comes up, that it will enjoy broad bipartisan support recognizing the  value and importance of the message it sends.   Also, I might add, because it was also pointed out by the two  Senators who were just here, that this is something that the Ukrainian  Government is asking us to do. They suggested this was something that  isn't desired or wanted, and it, in fact, is. Many of us participated  in a conference call on Christmas Eve with President Zelensky in which  he voiced support for this. I think he and his country, his government,  and his people realize how important it is that a message be sent to  their neighbors and that the American Government, in concert with our  allies in this region, send a very strong statement with respect to  that particular issue.   So I hope that we get a good, strong vote this afternoon and that it  won't be a party-line vote. It is at 60, meaning it will take some  Democrats to vote with Republicans. But I can't think of a time when  the stakes have been higher for the people of Ukraine or, frankly, for  that matter, for that region in its entirety.                                  Inflation    Mr. President, I want to shift gears now, if I might. Yesterday, we  learned that in December, inflation hit its highest level in 40 years-- 40 years. Inflation reached 7 percent in December, the seventh straight  month that inflation has been over 5 percent. Today, we discovered that  year-over-year inflation for domestically produced goods increased even  more, by a massive 9.7 percent.   Americans are struggling under steep increases in grocery prices,  fuel prices, utility prices, and the list goes on. Despite wage  increases in 2021, American families experienced a de facto pay cut,  with their purchasing power shrinking thanks to inflation, and there is  apparently no end in sight.   Given the real economic harm that American families are suffering as  a result of this crisis, you would think the issue would be front and  center here in Washington for Democrats, but you would be wrong. In  fact, a lot of the time, inflation doesn't even seem to exist on  Democrats' radar. Democrats can't be bothered to pay attention to a  real crisis with real economic consequences for American families  because they are too focused on their manufactured voting rights  crisis.   Earlier this week, President Biden traveled to Georgia, which has  become the Democrats' poster child for the supposed assault on voting  rights, to deliver a speech to gin up support for the Democrats'  partisan election bill, and what a speech it was.   In the course of his overwrought and bombastic remarks, the  President, who once vowed to bring Americans together, managed to imply  that half the country is racist. Never one to let the truth get in the  way of a good story, he continued his bizarre habit of falsely claiming  that he had been arrested in various situations. He laid out, perhaps,  the weakest case for a voting rights crisis that you can imagine.    The President, of course, used Georgia's thoroughly mainstream 2021  election law as his main example. Here is what he had to say. Here is  what the voting rights crisis amounts to:   First, according to the President, Georgia is making it harder to  vote by mail. Now, I am guessing he might be referring to the provision  of the Georgia law that asks voters to write in their driver's license  numbers on their absentee ballots. Given that almost every American in  this country has a driver's license or some form of photo  [[Page S202]]  ID, I have got to say that it doesn't seem like an unduly burdensome  requirement. After all, New York City and Washington, DC, are now  requiring you to present a photo ID and proof that you have been  vaccinated before you can enter any restaurant or public place, and  liberals seem OK with that, but, apparently, to the President,  Georgia's measure is Jim Crow 2.0.   The President continues by accusing Georgia of limiting drop boxes.  Ballot drop boxes have become a bizarre fixation of Democrats engaged  in trying to persuade Americans that the right to vote is under attack.  The truth is that Georgia didn't even use drop boxes until the 2020  election and that Georgia's new election law now requires at least one  drop box in each county is hardly a criminal attempt to restrict drop  boxes. But let's be honest here. Even if Georgia decided to eliminate  drop boxes entirely and return to its pre-2020 status quo, Georgians  would still have ample opportunities to vote.   Georgia's new law mandates a minimum of 17 days of early voting--17  days--and Georgia provides for no-excuse absentee voting, which means  any Georgia citizen can request an absentee ballot for any reason  whatsoever. That, of course, is a far more generous voting policy than  those offered by the President or the Senate Democrat leader's home  States. The President's home State of Delaware doesn't offer no-excuse  absentee voting, and it is just starting to offer early voting this  year--remember, Georgia with 17 days early voting, no-excuse absentee  voting. Similarly, the Democrat leader's home State, Senator Schumer's  home State of New York, offers just 9 days of early voting in contrast  to Georgia's 17, and New York--the State of New York--on their ballot,  recently rejected a ballot measure to allow no-excuse absentee voting.   So no-excuse absentee voting is not allowed in New York, but it is  allowed in Georgia, with 9 days early voting in New York and 17 in  Georgia. Yet, somehow, the President hasn't yet visited Delaware or New  York to accuse them of making it difficult for citizens to vote. I will  believe in Democrats' supposed commitment to protecting the vote when I  see the Senate majority leader come to the floor and excoriate New  Yorkers for attacking voting rights.   Continuing on with President Biden's speech, we come to, perhaps, the  most ridiculous example the President and Democrats have used in their  attempt to convince Americans that voting rights are under assault, and  here I am going to quote directly from the President's speech:         [T]he new Georgia law actually makes it illegal--think of       this--I mean, it's 2020, and now '22, going into that       election--it makes it illegal to bring your neighbors, your       fellow voters food or water while they wait in line to vote.       . . . I mean, think about it. That's not America. That's what       it looks like when they suppress the right to vote.    That is what it looks like when they suppress the right to vote?  Really?   I mean, I have to give President Biden credit for delivering that  line with a straight face because that is pretty much the most absurd  claim Democrats have made in the course of this debate. The President,  of course, is referring to the provision of Georgia's election law that  prohibits individuals or organizations from giving food or drinks to  voters within 150 feet of a polling place.   Now, just for purposes, again, of comparing and contrasting, the  Democrat leader's home State of New York--Senator Schumer's home State  of New York--has a similar provision preventing voters in line from  being given anything, including food and water, whose retail value is  in excess of $1. This is the State of New York--the State of New York.  But people are blowing a gasket over this provision in Georgia law--the  very provision the State of New York has in law today. I would argue,  in most States, you can't go within a certain number of feet of a  voting place if you are a political operative or a political  organization. I mean, that is true in our State, and I am sure it is  true in a lot of States around the country. The aim of those laws, of  course, is to prevent partisan political organizations or candidates  from exerting improper pressure on voters in line.   Now, nothing in Georgia's law prevents partisan political  organizations from setting up food trucks or lunch stations outside of  the 150-foot radius and feeding voters to their hearts content--150  feet. That is 50 yards. Of course, Georgia's law explicitly allows  nonpartisan poll workers to make water available to voters. An election  worker, somebody who is involved with the actual vote itself, can  deliver water to voters if they are waiting in line. It just prevents  political operatives and political organizations from doing that--a law  that, again, is consistent with laws throughout the country,  including--including--the State of New York. Yet I suppose it is  typical of nanny-state Democrats to think Americans are incapable of  packing themselves a snack.   I am pretty sure--pretty sure--I have never seen a weaker case for a  crisis. Take a look at Democrats' supposed evidence, and their case  crumbles to dust, which, of course, raises the question of what is  behind Democrats' manufactured crisis. Unfortunately, I think we know  the answer. The Democrats have manufactured the supposed voting rights  crisis in the hopes of forcing through election legislation that they  hope will give them an advantage in future elections. More than one  Democrat has openly admitted that Democrats want to pass a Federal  election takeover because they think it will help their party win  elections.   I don't blame Democrats for running scared. Between their inflation  crisis, their border crisis, the President's humiliating, disastrous  retreat from Afghanistan, the November election results in Virginia,  and the fact that just one-third of the American people approve of the  job the President is doing, the Democrats have reason to be scared  about their 2022 electoral prospects.                                  Filibuster    Mr. President, instead of addressing the inflation crisis they helped  to create or, perhaps, moving their agenda from the far left and closer  to the center, the Democrat leaders have decided that the solution to  improving their electoral chances is to pass a partisan Federal  takeover of election law and to break the Senate rules to do it.  Apparently, they don't care what damage they do to the Senate and the  country in the process. If Democrat leaders have their way, the  longstanding protections for the minority in the Senate and the  millions upon millions of Americans the Senate minority represents will  be swept away in the name of, perhaps, improving Democrats' electoral  prospects.   Although, I have to say, in the Washington Post Fact Checker about  the Georgia law, which, by the way, gave the President four  Pinocchios--four Pinocchios, which is pretty much the biggest whopper  you can get--for his statements last year about this Georgia election  law, they went on to say that the analysts who have looked at this--a  lot of the analysis has been done by so-called election experts--think  that it will expand--expand--the opportunity for people in Georgia to  vote.   All of this is disheartening, to say the least, because I think we  all know that, in the end, if you are going to blow up the Senate  rules, that that has consequences that go on for a very, very long  time.   There are Democrats in this Chamber today who still express, I think,  regret for what happened in 2013, with respect to the executive  calendar--which deals with executive branch nominees and judicial  branch nominees, judges--because it led, in 2017, to the Republicans  retaliating, following suit, with Supreme Court Justices.   I don't think you can--assume for a minute that, at some point, this  flips. If Democrats blow up the rules to do this and create, I have to  say, a manufactured crisis in order to do it, then you are not going to  be able to blame Republicans, because once the rules are gone, the  rules are gone. Then we become the House of Representatives, a total  majoritarian body with longer terms.    That is not what the Founders intended. This place is here for a  reason. It is here to represent the rights of the minority, the people  who didn't win the vote, the people who might be in the minority party,  who ought to have some say and some voice in the laws that are made  here and the policies that are made here that are going to affect them  and their families. I am hopeful that there are still some Democrats  with doubts about this course of action, enough, perhaps, to block  their leadership's partisan push.  [[Page S203]]    In his inaugural address, the President of the United States vowed to  be a President for all Americans. On Tuesday, he made it clear that he  is becoming nothing more than a President for the far-left wing of the  Democratic Party. In less than a year, he has gone from promising unity  to sowing division. It is a sad epitaph to a Presidency that has barely  begun.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
