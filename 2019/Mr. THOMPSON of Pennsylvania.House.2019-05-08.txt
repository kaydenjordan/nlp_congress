 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  Bald Eagle Area High School unified bocce team, which recently brought  home a State championship.   It is only the unified bocce team's second season, and they have  already been crowned the best in the State.   The unified bocce team is made up of four students, four with  intellectual disabilities and four without. This winter sport allows  students with and without disabilities to participate in a competitive  environment that promotes physical activity, sportsmanship, and  socialization. Teams are made up of students with intellectual  disabilities, known as athletes, and regular education students, known  as partners.   I am so proud of my alma mater for adopting the unified bocce team,  which operates in conjunction with Special Olympics. In fact, multiple  high schools in the region have unified bocce teams, including State  College and Bellefonte in Centre County and Clearfield Area High School  in Clearfield County.   Bocce has become so popular at Bald Eagle Area that it started the  season with two teams, a blue team and a gold team. The two met in the  regional championship, with the gold advancing to states.   The gold team's eight members include Chelsea Butterworth, Alyssa  Packer, Nick Zink, Josh Zink, Fay Shaheen, Emily Gardner, Jordan  Bonsell, and Bridget Esenwine.   Mr. Speaker, Special Olympics Pennsylvania also hosted its third  annual Unified Bocce Government Challenge on Monday in the east rotunda  of the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg. The challenge paired  various local organizational leaders, government officials, and  legislative leaders with Special Olympics athletes for a fun,  competitive, and social experience.   I am so proud of our athletes, our partners, and everyone in the  community who has supported the unified bocce team and the inclusion  movement.   The team had a hero's welcome home from Hershey in March when they  won the State championship. About 100 teachers, parents, and students  greeted the team when they arrived back at the school, with a fire  truck escort leading the way.   Congratulations to our State champs, the unified bocce team. Go  Eagles!                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Capitol Worship, which is a mission that is near and dear to my heart.   For the past 8 years, Pastor Dan Cummins and his wife, JoAnn Cummins,  have ministered the Members of Congress, staff, and the Capitol Police.  They share the love and Gospel of Jesus Christ through weekly prayer  services and Bible studies.  [[Page H3484]]    Each year, Capitol Worship hosts and produces the Carols in the  Capitol Christmas Concert and the Washington, a Man of Prayer, both of  which take place in Statuary Hall. The Washington, a Man of Prayer  event commemorates when President George Washington was sworn in at  Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789.   President Washington, accompanied by Congress, proceeded to St.  Paul's Chapel, where one of his first official acts as President was to  offer prayers of dedication to God on America's behalf. This is truly a  remarkable event made possible by Pastor Dan and JoAnn Cummins.   Mr. Speaker, Capitol Worship fosters strong personal and bipartisan  relationships between Members from both political parties, and I  congratulate Pastor Dan and JoAnn Cummins on their dedication to this  awesome mission.                            ____________________
