 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant First Class  Richard Stayskal and to tell Rich how much I admire his bravery and his  service to our country.   Rich has been in D.C. since yesterday, talking to Members of the  Senate about the critical need to address the injustice of the Feres  doctrine. Today, he has joined us in the gallery.   This will likely be his last trip to Washington, D.C. That is because  this father, this husband, this marine and Army Green Beret has end- stage lung cancer, a cancer that Army medical staff failed to alert him  to despite finding the tumor on scans. The cancer grew at a deadly  pace, untreated and undiagnosed, until he went to a private practice  doctor in 2017. By then, it was stage IV, and his prognosis was  terminal.                                time  1015    Despite this devastating development, Rich continued his service  overseas and at home in good times and bad until not long ago and just  shy of his 20-year milestone for full retirement. He also fought this  tragedy as a true soldier and tackled the very thing that has left him  and his family most vulnerable: The Feres doctrine.   The Feres doctrine is an outdated judicial ruling that bars active  duty servicemembers from suing the government for medical malpractice.  These are not in combat situations. These are cases that happen here at  home at medical facilities on Army bases and other services. There has  never been a bill, there has never been a hearing, a vote in Congress,  but that is the Feres doctrine, and that has been what has been the law  of the land for 70 years.   Servicemembers' spouses and families, civilian Federal employees, and  even convicted prisoners have the right to sue for negligence, but not  our servicemembers. Only Rich and our brave military servicemembers are  denied this right by the Feres doctrine. That means that Rich, his  family, and other servicemembers and their families have been denied  justice in their greatest hour of need. It also means there are no  consequences for botched procedures and few incentives for the  military's medical providers to improve care.   In this fight to achieve justice for his family and spare others what  they have endured, Rich has met with Democrats and Republicans in the  House and Senate. He testified before the Armed Services Military  Personnel Subcommittee, which I chair. The media has taken notice. The  House has taken notice. The NDAA has addressed it in the House. The  question is: Will the Senate?   At a time when Rich should be able to spend his remaining days with  those he loves, he has answered the call to fight. Rich, as I promised  you when you testified before the committee, we will never forget your  commitment, your honor, and sacrifice, and I will keep fighting to fix  Feres as long as it takes.   Congress is responsible for allowing Feres to stand for 70 years, but  we can correct this failure, and we can do it now. The House-passed  NDAA contains the Sergeant First Class Richard Stayskal Act of 2019. It  would create an exemption that would finally give servicemembers and  their families the right to sue the government for medical malpractice  in noncombat settings.   The ball is now in the Senate's court where it seems Senator  McConnell would rather help corporations than  [[Page H7563]]  our brave servicemembers. I hope he will make an exception for doing  the right thing and for Rich, because Rich deserves to know that after  all his years of coming through for this country when it really counted  this country will come through for him. Rich deserves to know that his  efforts, his life, his sacrifice matter because he made life better for  those who will come after him. And Rich deserves to know that when his  time comes his wife Megan and their two young daughters will not be  left alone. They, like so many military families, have sacrificed so  much so that we may sleep at night. They have forfeited unknown years  of happiness with a father and husband that they would move heaven and  earth to keep with them.   In honor of Rich and his family and all those who serve, I implore  the Senate to join the House and pass the Sergeant First Class Richard  Stayskal Act of 2019.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues in the  Democratic Women's Caucus in hosting this Special Order hour to raise  awareness of the damage done by mandatory arbitration and of our  support for H.R. 1423, the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act, or  as we refer to it, the FAIR Act.   We are pleased that the Judiciary Committee is holding a markup on  this bill as we speak.   Madam Speaker, what is stunning about this issue is that a recent  study found that one is more likely to be struck by lightning than to  win an arbitration case. In fact, the 5-year study found that, of 6,000  claims that were made on arbitration clauses, money awards were  provided in only 137 cases.   Today, my colleagues will read accounts from just some of the women  who have experienced this miscarriage of justice firsthand. Over 60  million workers are subject to forced arbitration, but even those  staggering numbers fail to fully illustrate the suffering and human  plight caused by mandatory arbitration.   Today, we share the experiences of women fighting back against the  silence and shame, and we join them in demanding systemic change so  that all workers are treated with the dignity and respect that they  deserve.   Sterling Jewelers, known to many of us as Jared Jewelers or Kay  Jewelers--Diane Acampora. Perhaps no company better exemplifies the  harm caused by mandatory arbitration than Sterling Jewelers.   In April 2019, The New York Times Magazine published a story on the  ongoing, decade-long pay-and-promotion lawsuit against Sterling  Jewelers, which at one point included nearly 70,000 women. These  stories should outrage each of us.   Diane of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said that, after 5 years at Kay  Jewelers and 6 years of experience at another store, she made $2 to $4  less per hour than her more recently hired, lesser experienced male  colleagues.   According to the investigation, ``When she was promoted to manager,  she attended the company's annual managers' meeting in Florida. On a  shuttle bus back to the resort, she was pulled onto the lap of a  manager, who held her tightly as he fondled her. At the same meeting, a  district manager tried to kiss her. At a later meeting, she had to  leave a hot tub because discussion turned uncomfortably sexual. She was  later told that the hot-tub scene turned into an orgy.''   And that is just the tip of the iceberg.   ``There was Amanda Barger, a sales associate who made her way up to  assistant manager, who after 5 years of employment complained that she  was still making her starting salary but was brushed off by her  manager; who watched the new guy who previously worked at a cell phone- cover kiosk be promoted ahead of her; who dared to complain to HR after  her district manager invited her to a Chili's with a few other managers  and, while they were eating, texted her from across the table, `I want  to come on your tits.'''   Marie Wolf's manager didn't seem to like her, despite the fact that  she was a top salesperson at Jared. She didn't have ``the Jared look,''  the manager told a colleague.   ``Marie was tall and wore pants and blouses, not short skirt-suits,  and she wore little makeup. One day, Marie asked for a raise, and the  manager told her she was already making more than any other salesperson  in the store.'' Not surprisingly, that was far from the truth.   Or, ``Tammy Zenner, who was called `Texas Tammy' by her colleagues  because of the size of her breasts and who complained to her store  manager that an executive visiting the store had rubbed himself against  her from behind but was told when she complained that she should be  flattered.''   The culture of rampant gender discrimination, pay inequity, and  sexual harassment at Sterling is the stuff of living nightmares  suffered by so many working women, many of whom are the primary, if not  only, breadwinner for their families.   Diane, Amanda, Marie, and Tammy are just 4 of nearly 70,000 women who  have at some point joined the lawsuit against Sterling. And Sterling  was able to hide the details of these allegations from its shareholders  and from the public because all of their employees are forced to sign a  forced arbitration agreement upon being hired.   That means all work-related disputes had to go through Sterling's in- house dispute resolution system, effectively gagging employees and  destroying any chance of positive change.   It also, undoubtedly, resulted in countless other women facing  similar types of abuse and discrimination. That is why the experiences  of these women are so important for us to hear, so that Congress will  pass the FAIR Act.                                time  1600    It is unacceptable that millions of employees are subjected to a  system  [[Page H7589]]  that forces them to settle disputes through mandatory arbitration,  where the company can control the process and shroud the outcome in  secrecy.   I urge my colleagues to support the FAIR Act and strike a blow in the  fight for fairness and transparency. No one should have to suffer  harassment, assault, and degradation in silence in order to support  themselves and their families and pursue their career dreams.   ``Every kiss begins with Kay Jewelers'' should be a jingle, not a job  requirement. When couples are shopping for wedding rings, I hope they  stay away from retail jewelers that treat women like sex toys or  second-class citizens.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn  B. Maloney), one of the architects of the Equal Rights Amendment.    Madam Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), my good friend and colleague  who also has spent a great deal of time working on this issue of forced  arbitration as it relates to sexual harassment.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lee), my good friend and colleague from the East Bay and a great  advocate for equal rights.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California  again for her outstanding leadership.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Hill),  one of our new colleagues, but not new to fighting on behalf of women.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Frankel), the co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus.    Of course I am up to it.    Actually, no, I don't. It sounds like someone talking  about repairing one's car, but, you know . . .    Will the gentlewoman yield?    So this is a consumer who went to get a package of three  massages at Massage Envy?    She signed up for it and then decided she didn't want to  do it and didn't read the fine print that said she had to go to  arbitration?    Well, because there is no justice. Oftentimes, as we have  pointed out, these arbitration claims end up benefiting the company as  opposed to the individual. So few of them actually result in claims  being paid out to the consumer or the employee who was impacted by it.   So, once again, it is a, you know, buyer beware, employee beware,  because it is set up, not for fairness, but to protect the employer or  the retailer in the case that you pointed out.    Well, again, the lack of fairness, because that  particular arbitrator is chosen each time. That arbitrator is probably  chosen because he or she finds in favor of the company, and the result  is that fairness is thrown out the window.    A doctor's office. I am about to tell a story about a  nursing home. Here is a patient in a nursing home who gets violated,  and then there is this arbitration clause that prevents any kind of  relief for that particular person who was a client at the nursing home.  So it really does impact virtually every aspect or every contract you  sign. Every app that you sign up for probably has an arbitration  clause.    That is correct. Without being harsh here, it is rigged.  You are not necessarily, in all likelihood, going to get a fair  hearing. You are not going to have someone who is independent.  Oftentimes they are employed by, selected by the corporation, and the  result is, as you pointed out, that they want to be rehired again, so  they find reasons to be supportive of the corporation and not the  individual.    That is absolutely correct. And it is really important  for us to make the public aware that whether you know it or not you are  probably signing these arbitration clauses every time you sign up for a  particular program, a particular service, or you are being employed by  a specific company.     Oftentimes it does. In one of the cases that our  colleague from New York reflected on, it was costing her hundreds of  thousands of dollars.   In this case I am going to speak about, the patient, the client at  the nursing home had to pay money, some $3,000 for the rental of the  room in which the arbitration took place. So it is like a double slap  in the face.    This legislation, and again, they are marking it up right  now in the Judiciary Committee, is going to return to the consumer,  return to the employee, the opportunity to not sign a forced  arbitration agreement when they are at the most vulnerable position,  typically when they are being hired or when they are requesting a  service and, frankly, not knowing that the arbitration clause is there.    I thank the gentlewoman from Florida. I am going to end,  Madam Speaker, with two cases because they are both egregious in their  own right.   One is about Irene Morissette, an 87-year-old Catholic nun. Now think  about this for a minute. An 87-year-old Catholic nun was raped in her  nursing home near Birmingham, Alabama. Police and medical records  revealed a brutal attack. ``Police investigators found two semen stains  in Morissette's bed and blood on the `inside rear area' of her green- and-pink-flowered pajama bottoms, which had been shoved underneath the  mattress.'' Equally alarming was the article recalls how the medical  examiner later wrote that Ms. Morissette was afraid to call anyone  because she was afraid the assailant would be the one to come back to  her room.   Ms. Morissette told police in an interview several days after the  attack that she felt like ``a piece of trash'' because she had honored  her vow of chastity for over 6 decades and had lost something she had  valued for her entire life. That one really breaks my heart.   Due to a forced arbitration clause in the admissions contract she  signed when she was admitted, Ms. Morissette was left with no choice.  Her family could not pursue their claim in a public court of law, but  was, rather, forced into arbitration. In the forced arbitration  proceedings, the arbitrator invented outlandish arguments of hearsay  and conjecture, including claims that Ms. Morissette did not appear  ``upset enough'' about the rape for it to be believable. Mind you,  there is evidence, there is DNA evidence.   Ms. Morissette lost, and as a final insult received a bill for $3,000  to cover the cost of the room rental for the forced arbitration  proceedings.   No nursing home resident or family should ever have to go through  what Ms. Morissette endured. That is why we are calling this particular  piece of legislation the FAIR Act and urging a vote on the House floor.   One last story that I would like to tell is of Rosette Pambakian. Ms.  Pambakian was a senior executive at the dating app Tinder. She was one  of the earliest hires and the longest standing female executive at  Tinder, writing their very first press release. She was the head of  marketing and communications, ran a department of more than 40  employees, and served as the face of the brand on panels and in the  press.   Ms. Pambakian had sued her former employer for sexual harassment and  assault. Now Tinder is one of those dating apps. According to her  lawsuit, former Match Group and Tinder CEO Gregory Blatt assaulted Ms.  Pambakian in 2016 at a Tinder holiday party. Blatt made a lewd overture  to her saying that he got a hard-on ``every time I look at you,'' and  ``let's get out of here.'' Pambakian left the party and went to a  colleague's hotel room with another coworker.   Later in the night Blatt showed up. According to the lawsuit, he  began forcibly groping her breasts and upper thighs and kissing her  shoulders, neck, and chest without her consent in front of other  subordinates.   A meaningful investigation of the assault, which was required under  company policies and California law, never happened. Pambakian alleges  she was never even interviewed. Instead, she claims she was  marginalized, subjected to additional harassing and offensive behavior,  put on administrative leave, particularly accused of consenting to  advances, calling it ``consensual cuddling,'' and finally, wrongfully  terminated.   The lawsuit further alleges IAC and Match tried to buy Ms.  Pambakian's silence following the assault by offering her a higher  salary and more stock options on the condition that she sign a  nondisclosure agreement. She declined.   According to her attorney, Rosette is bringing this action not only  to right the personal wrong against her, but to stand with the many  women in the tech industry and beyond who have been ``blamed and shamed  into submission or silence.''   Match and Blatt have filed a motion to have the case sent to  arbitration, even though Ms. Pambakian was forced to sign an  arbitration agreement after the assault and after she rejected the  proposed NDA. Her pursuit of justice is ongoing.   I now yield to Congresswoman Schakowsky, the gentlewoman from  Illinois, who will also be telling a story.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky) for her comments on this Special Order. As she said at the  end, she is one of the loudest voices to make sure there is justice in  this country.   Madam Speaker, we could tell many more stories tonight, but I am  going to close now by thanking all of my colleagues from the Democratic  Women's Caucus for sharing the stories of women and men who are hurt by  forced arbitration and demonstrating the human impact of this corrupt  and abusive practice.   We are eager to have the House of Representatives take a vote on the  FAIR Act on the House floor because survivors deserve their day in  court and workers deserve dignified and respectful workplaces.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
