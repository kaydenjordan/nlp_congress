 Mr. Speaker, this is my fifth speech in a  series on voter fraud, election theft, and the Presidential election.   For emphasis, Congress is the judge, jury, and final arbiter of the  2020 Presidential election contest. Further, America's election system  is plagued by systemic flaws that promote voter fraud and election  theft.   Joe Biden exploited one such flaw when he brazenly promised more than  10 million illegal aliens that he will give them amnesty and  citizenship if they help elect Joe Biden President.   The Constitution's Election Clause, Article I, Section 4, is very  clear. Congress has absolute authority over the ``times, places, and  manner of holding elections'' for Federal offices.   Pursuant to the Election Clause, and title 2, United States Code,  section 7, Congress set November 3 as the 2020 ``day for the  election.''   For emphasis, Congress set a ``day for the election'' on which  citizens vote. Congress did not set an election week, an election  month, or an election season during which citizens can cast votes.  Also, pursuant to the Election Clause, Congress created limited  exceptions to its ``vote within a 24-hour window'' mandate, to wit:   Alternative voting means for persons with disabilities;   Overseas persons may vote by absentee ballot;   Persons to be absent from their voting location or State on election  day may vote by absentee ballot.   Any voting schemes that allow voting outside of congressionally  mandated times and means are illegal under the Constitution and Federal  statute.   Congress' reasons for limiting voting to one 24-hour period are  described by the 2005 bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform,  co-chaired by Democrat President Jimmy Carter and former Republican  White House Chief of Staff and Secretary of State James Baker. They  strongly cautioned against overly broad absentee ballot and vote-by- mail schemes because they ``increase the risk of fraud.''   The bipartisan commission found that absentee voting has been one of  the major sources of fraud in American elections and that vote by mail  ``is vulnerable to abuse in several ways: Blank ballots mailed to the  wrong address or to large residential buildings might get intercepted.  Citizens who vote at home, at nursing homes, at the workplace, or in  church are more susceptible to pressure, overt and subtle, or to  intimidation. Vote-buying schemes are far more difficult to detect when  citizens vote by mail.''   Mr. Speaker, Congress passed laws to prevent voter fraud and election  theft by establishing, with minor exceptions, a 24-hour window in which  to vote. In contrast, socialist Democrats use bureaucratic allies or  engaged in rigged lawsuits involving conspiratorial parties and  inattentive judges to obtain sham settlement agreements that blatantly  violate the Constitution and Federal law to promote voter fraud and  election theft with the singular goal of stealing the United States  Presidency.   In particular, all en masse vote-by-mail schemes promote voter fraud  and election theft and are illegal because they violate Congress'  election procedures and 24-hour voting mandate.   As such, all votes cast pursuant to these vote-by-mail schemes are  illegal, void, and should not be counted.   Mr. Speaker, the evidence is overwhelming, compelling, and  irrefutable. If only lawful votes cast by eligible American citizens  are counted, President Trump won the electoral college and a second  term as President. Congress can either support illegal voting, voter  fraud, and election theft or not.   Because I believe in the rule of law and our Republic, it is my duty  as a Member of Congress to, on January 6, object to and vote to reject  the electoral college submissions of all States whose election systems  are so badly flawed as to render their vote submissions unreliable,  untrustworthy, and unworthy of acceptance.   Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what I intend to do.                            ____________________
