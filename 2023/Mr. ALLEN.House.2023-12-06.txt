 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4468, the Choice  in Automobile Retail Sales Act, or CARS Act.   The American people shouldn't be told by unelected bureaucrats which  car best suits their needs and the needs of their families, but the  Biden administration is seeking to do so through some backdoor  policymaking aimed at taking gas-powered engines off the market.   Let me be clear: This is not about being anti-electric vehicle. This  is about being pro-consumer choice. Demand should be driven by consumer  preferences and budgets.   Let's look at the facts. According to a report from the Alliance for  Automotive Innovation, gasoline-powered cars and trucks represented 93  percent of all new vehicle sales in 2022. According to Congressional  Budget Office projections, electric vehicles will account for only 30  to 56 percent of new car sales by 2032.   Even with the outrageous incentives for electric vehicles that are  being subsidized by taxpayers, which are included in Biden's so-called  Inflation Reduction Act, this policy will fall well short of EPA's goal  of two-thirds of new car sales being electric vehicles.   No matter how much the government floods the market with requirements  that squeeze out internal combustion engines and require electric  vehicles, if consumers don't want to buy the cars, then they should not  be forced to do so.   The CARS Act will stop the EPA's current light- and medium-duty  vehicle regulations and, instead, allow consumers and the market to  determine the cars and engine technology needed and save billions in  taxpayer subsidies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill and consumer choice.    Mr. Chair, had I been present, I would have voted ``no''  on rollcall No. 700.
