 Mr. President, I rise today as the Senate considers  this week the resolution to rescind the Comprehensive Policing and  Justice Amendment Act, passed by the DC City Council on January 19,  2023.   As a general matter, I believe that the people of Washington, DC, and  their elected representatives should have the autonomy to govern  themselves. For years, I have cosponsored and fought to pass the  Washington D.C. Admission Act, which would admit the District of  Columbia as a state.   I have also long supported funding for the police, as well as  reforms, to help ensure that our justice system works for everyone.  That includes being the lead sponsor of the COPS Reauthorization Act to  provide Federal funding to law enforcement departments across the  country to hire and retain police officers. I also support police  reform measures focused on holding officers who break the law  accountable for misconduct, increasing transparency in police  practices, and improving police conduct and training.   The DC City Council's bill included many changes to strengthen  accountability measures and improve conduct, including reforms to  prevent the use of chokeholds, limit the use of force, and expand the  use of de-escalation tactics. The bill also takes steps to prevent  officers who have committed serious acts of misconduct or were fired  for disciplinary reasons from serving on the DC police force. I support  these efforts, which is why I oppose the resolution.   It is also important to note that the Comprehensive Policing and  Justice Amendment Act does not include changes to qualified immunity.  As Congressman  Jim Clyburn has said, as we work toward common ground  on police reform, we cannot ``sacrifice good on the altar of perfect''  and let disagreements about qualified immunity stand in the way of  reform. The men and women in law enforcement who risk their lives every  single day must have the confidence to make split-second decisions that  can make the difference between life and death. I would not support  this measure if changes to qualified immunity were made that put law  enforcement officers who act in good faith at risk.   While there are a significant number of critical reforms included in  DC's police reform bill, I am not in agreement with the provisions that  prevent the unions that represent DC police officers from including  disciplinary procedures in their collective bargaining agreements. All  other unions that represent public servants in the District of Columbia  negotiate for fair disciplinary proceedings, and while police officers  serve a unique role that requires oversight, we should not deny police  unions the same opportunity. The DC Council should ensure that police  officers who break the law are held accountable, but it should not do  so by undermining the right of law enforcement to collectively  negotiate.   I also think changes could be made to provisions that set a fixed  timetable for the release of data related to incidents involving the  use of force. Law enforcement, working with City officials, should have  some measure of flexibility to determine the appropriate timing for  releasing information to protect public safety.   It is my hope that DC government officials will address these issues  as they continue to work with law enforcement and other interested  parties to make needed reforms to their justice system.                            ____________________
