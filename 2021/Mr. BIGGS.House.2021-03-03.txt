 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office confirmed earlier this  week that the Justice in Policing Act contains an unfunded mandate by  requiring onerous data collection reporting from State and local law  enforcement. This includes granular data collection on such basic law  enforcement activities, like traffic stops. CBO estimates that this  unfunded mandate placed on State and local law enforcement will cost  several hundred million dollars.   The consequences of H.R. 1280 are clear. It will drain resources away  from important public safety activities. Instead, law enforcement  officers will have to spend their time reporting data to Washington,  D.C., from behind a desk. Make no mistake. This bill defunds the  police.   Additionally, any Member who is opposed to defunding the police  should be opposing this bill. This legislation will also lower the mens  rea standard when charging an officer with criminal misconduct. It  removes qualified immunity, which will result in an ineffectual police  force and leave our communities vulnerable to crime, and it also  severely limits the Department of Defense's 1033 program.   Mr. Speaker, but make no mistake, regardless of whatever else you may  feel about this bill, this bill defunds police. We can never forget  that. If you oppose defunding the police, you should be opposing this  bill, like I am.
