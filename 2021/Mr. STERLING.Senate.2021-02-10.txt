 Mr. President, it looks like you likely lost       the State of Georgia. We're investigating. There's always a       possibility--I get it--and you have the right to go through       the courts. What you don't have the ability to do--and you       need to step up and say this--is stop inspiring people to       commit potential acts of violence. Someone's going to get       hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get       killed.    Mr. Sterling put this perfectly. In this country, we can  appropriately challenge a close count or go to the courts or disagree  with others or make bold statements, but what Trump was doing was  different.         Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot,       someone's going to get killed.    Mr. Sterling saw what Trump's conduct was fomenting. He warned him on  live TV that violence was already happening and that more violence was  foreseeable and inevitable. Sterling's pleas were played over and over  on every network.   Rather than heed that warning, Trump escalated again. In early  December, Trump called Brian Kemp, the Governor of Georgia, and  pressured him to hold a special session of the State legislature to  overturn the election results and to appoint electors who would vote  for Trump.   A few weeks later, on December 23, Trump called the chief  investigator for the Georgia Bureau of Investigations, who was  conducting an audit, an audit of the signature-matching procedures for  absentee ballots. Trump urged him, ``[F]ind the fraud,'' and claimed  the official would be a ``national hero'' if he did.   Let's call this what it is. He was asking the official to say there  was evidence of fraud when there wasn't any. The official refused, and  the investigation was completed. And on December 29, Raffensperger  announced that the audit found ``no fraudulent absentee ballots'' with  a ``99 percent confidence'' level.   On January 3, Trump tweeted about a call he had with Georgia election  officials the day before. He said:         I spoke to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger yesterday       about Fulton County and voter fraud in Georgia. He was       unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the       ``ballots under the table'' scam, ballot destruction, out of       state ``voters'', dead voters, and more. He has no clue!    On January 5, the Washington Post released a recording of that call  which had occurred on January 2--remember, just 4 days before the  attack on the Capitol. Here is what President Trump said:   (Text of audio presentation of 1-2-2021.)         President TRUMP. It's more illegal for you than it is for       them because you know what they did and you're not reporting       it. That's the--you know, that's a criminal--that's a       criminal offense. And you know, you can't let that happen.       That's--that's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer.       That's a big risk.    Let's be clear. This is the President of the United States telling a  secretary of state that if he does not find votes, he will face  criminal penalties--and not just any number of votes. Donald Trump was  asking the secretary of state to somehow find the exact number of votes  Donald Trump lost the State by.   Remember, President Biden won Georgia by 11,779 votes. In his own  words, Trump said:         All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes.    He wanted the secretary of state to somehow find the precise number,  plus one, so that he could win.  [[Page S626]]    Here is what he said.   (Text of audio presentation of 1-2-21.)         President TRUMP. So, look, all I want to do is this. I just       want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have.    He says it right there, the President of the United States, telling a  public official to manufacture the exact votes needed so he can win.   Senators, we must not become numb to this. Trump did this across  State after State, so often, so loudly, so publicly. Public officials  like you and me received death threats and calls threatening criminal  penalties, all because Trump wanted to remain in power. These public  officials exercised great political and personal courage in the face of  unprecedented pressure from a President of the United States.   Senators, ours is a dialogue with history, a conversation with the  past, with a hope for the future.   Senators, I thank you today for your kind attention   Mr. Manager LIEU. Good afternoon. I am Congressman Ted Lieu. My  colleague Congresswoman Dean went through President Trump's efforts to  overturn the election through the courts and, when that started  failing, his deeply disturbing attacks on State and local officials.   I am going to walk through President Trump's extraordinary efforts  remaining until January 6, when he tried again to overturn the  election.   I first want to highlight Representative Raskin's question to all of  you today: Is this America?   Like all of you, I love this country. I am an immigrant. My parents  came to Ohio, and we started off living in the basement of a person's  home. We were poor, and they went to flea markets to sell gifts to make  ends meet. Over many years, they built a small business, opened six  gift stores, and achieved the American dream.   That is one reason I joined the United States Air Force on Active  Duty. I believe America is an exceptional country. I was trained as a  prosecutor at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, and I remain in the  Reserves because we are the greatest country in the world.   But how did our exceptional country get to the point where a violent  mob attacked our Capitol, murdering a police officer, assaulting over  140 other officers? How did we get to the point where rioters  desecrated, defiled, and dishonored your Senate Chamber, where the very  place in which you sit became a crime scene, and where National Guard  troops still patrol outside wearing body armor?   I will show you how we got here. President Donald J. Trump ran out of  nonviolent options to maintain power. After his efforts in courts and  threatening officials failed, he turned to privately and publicly  attacking Members of his own party in the House and in the Senate. He  would publicly bait Senators, naming them in social media.   For example, on December 18, President Trump named ``@senatemajldr  and Republican Senators,'' telling them they ``have to get tougher'' or  they ``won't have a Republican Party anymore. We won the Presidential  Election, by a lot. FIGHT FOR IT. Don't let them take it away!''   President Trump was suggesting to Members of this Senate that if they  didn't help him try to overturn the election, there would be  consequences. On December 24, President Trump wrote:         I saved at least 8 Republican Senators, including Mitch,       from losing in the last Rigged (for President) Election. Now       they (almost all) sit back and watch me fight against a       crooked and vicious foe, the Radical Left Democrats. I will--    And in all capital letters he wrote--         NEVER FORGET!    President Trump was telling you that you owe him; that if you don't  help him fight to overturn the results, he will never forget and that  there will be consequences. These are threats, just like the threats he  made to State and local officials.   And it continued. On December 29, President Trump tweeted:         Can you imagine if the Republicans stole a Presidential       Election from the Democrats--All hell would break out.       Republican leadership only wants the path of least       resistance. Our leaders (not me, of course!) are pathetic.       They only know how to lose! P.S. I got MANY Senators and       Congressmen/Congresswomen Elected. I do believe they forgot!    President Trump targeted Senators and Members of Congress on social  media, calling them pathetic for letting the election get ``stolen''  from them.   On January 4, 2 days before the attack, President Trump tweeted:         The ``Surrender Caucus'' within the Republican Party will       go down in infamy as weak and ineffective ``guardians'' of       our Nation, who were willing to accept the certification of       fraudulent presidential numbers!    Now he is mocking some Republican Members as the ``Surrender  Caucus,'' calling them ``weak and ineffective guardians of our Nation''  because they would not pretend that he had won when, in fact, he had  not.   And then, the very day before the attack, President Trump's threats  were even more heated and specific toward Republicans that he  considered to be part of that ``Surrender Caucus.''   Now, we have shown you this tweet before, but I want to draw your  attention to how the President was not just inciting his base but how  he was also calling out specific Senate Republicans at the end of this  tweet. This is a specific warning to anyone who won't help him overturn  the results. Anyone who was against the President became an enemy.   And let me be very clear. The President wasn't just coming for one or  two people or Democrats like me; he was coming for you, for Democratic  and Republican Senators. He was coming for all of us, just as the mob  did at his direction.   In addition to going after Senators and Members of Congress,  President Trump also pressured our Justice Department to investigate  the false claims that the election was stolen. At the President's  direction, Attorney General William Barr, a loyal member of the  President's Cabinet, authorized Federal prosecutors to pursue  ``substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation  irregularities.''   Bill Barr pursuing these allegations sparked an outcry. Sixteen  assistant U.S. attorneys in the Trump administration urged the Attorney  General to cease investigations because they had not seen evidence of  any substantial anomalies. That means they did not find any evidence of  real fraud.   Attorney General Barr pursued the investigation anyway, and after his  investigation, this is what he found:         [W]e have not seen fraud on a scale that could have       effected a different outcome in the election.    Two weeks later, on December 14, the electors voted to give Joe Biden  306 electoral votes and ensured his victory. The following day, Bill  Barr resigned.   Attorney General Barr had loyally served President Trump. He had  never publicly come out against the President. But for Bill Barr,  making up election fraud claims and saying the election was stolen was  a bridge too far.   Bill Barr made clear that attempting to overturn election results  crossed a line. According to a news report, Bill Barr, the highest law  enforcement official in the land, told President Donald Trump to his  face that his theories of election fraud were ``bullshit.''   When Bill Barr resigned, his former Deputy, Jeff Rosen, took his  place. President Trump initially tweeted about Mr. Rosen that he was  ``an outstanding person'' when he announced that he would become Acting  Attorney General, but when Rosen took over, President Trump put the  same pressure on him that he had done with State officials and Members  of Congress, U.S. Senators, and his former Attorney General.   President Trump reportedly summoned Acting Attorney General Rosen to  the Oval Office the next day and pressured Rosen to appoint special  counsels to keep investigating the election, including unfounded  accusations of widespread voter fraud, and also to investigate  Dominion, the voting machines firm.   According to reports, Mr. Rosen refused. He maintained that he would  make decisions based on the facts and the law and reminded President  Trump what he had already been told by Attorney General Bill Barr--that  the Department had already investigated and ``found no evidence of  widespread fraud.'' But President Trump refused to follow the facts and  the law, so the President turned to someone he knew would do his  bidding. He turned to Jeffrey Clark, another Justice Department lawyer,  who had allegedly expressed support for using the Department of Justice  to investigate the election results. Shortly after Acting Attorney  General Rosen followed his  [[Page S627]]  duty--and the law--to refuse to reopen investigations, President Trump  intended to replace Mr. Rosen with Mr. Clark, who could then try to  stop Congress from certifying the electoral college results.   According to reports, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone advised  President Trump not to fire Acting Attorney General Rosen. Department  officials had also threatened to resign en masse if he had fired Rosen.   President Trump's actions time and time again made clear that he  would do anything and pressure anyone if it meant overturning the  election results. We watched President Trump use any means necessary to  pursue this aim, feverishly grasping for straws at retaining his hold  on the Presidency, but all his efforts prior to January 6 kept failing.   Finally, in his desperation, he turned on his own Vice President. He  pressured Mike Pence to violate his constitutional oath and to refuse  to certify the vote. President Trump had decided that Vice President  Pence, who presided over the certification, could somehow stop it.   As Pence later confirmed, the Vice President does not have that power  in the Constitution. And President Trump never tried to explain why he  thought the Vice President could block the certification of the  election results; he just began relentlessly attacking the Vice  President.   Publicly, President Trump attacked Pence on social media and at  rallies, getting his supporters to believe that Mike Pence could stop  the certification on January 6. Here is what President Trump said in  Georgia on January 4.   (Text of video presentation of 1-4-2021.)         President TRUMP. And I hope Mike Pence comes through for       us, I have to tell you. I hope that our great Vice-President,       our great Vice-President comes through for us. He's a great       guy. Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him       quite as much.    Behind closed doors, President Trump applied significant pressure to  his second-in-command. Multiple reports confirmed that President Trump  used his personal attorneys and other officials to pressure the Vice  President. Trump reportedly told almost anyone who called him to also  call the Vice President. According to reports, when Mike Pence was in  the Oval Office, President Trump would call people to try to get them  to convince the Vice President to help him.   And President Trump kept repeating the myth that Pence could stop the  certification to his base to anger them, hoping to intimidate Mike  Pence.   On the morning of the rally on January 6, President Trump tweeted:         All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States,       AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!    President Trump later went on to attack Pence nearly a dozen times in  his speech at the Save America March.   Privately, in person, before Pence headed to oversee the joint  session on January 6, President Trump again threatened Pence. ``You can  either go down in history as a patriot,'' Mr. Trump told him, according  to two people briefed on the conversation, ``or you can go down in  history as a pussy.''   As a veteran, I find it deeply dishonorable that our former President  and Commander in Chief equated patriotism with violating the  Constitution and overturning the election.   You will see and hear the consequences of President Trump's repeated  attacks on the Vice President, the chants of ``Traitor'' and the chants  of ``Hang Mike Pence.''   Thankfully, Vice President Mike Pence stood his ground, like our  other brave officials stood their ground. He refused the President and  fulfilled his duty on January 6. Even after the Capitol was attacked,  even after he was personally targeted, even after his family was  targeted, Vice President Pence stood strong and certified the election.  Vice President Pence showed us what it means to be an American, what it  means to show courage. He put his country, his oath, his values, and  his morals above the will of one man.   The President had tried everything in his power to seize the-- everything in his attempt to seize power from the rightful victor of  the election. President Trump's extraordinary actions grew increasingly  more desperate. You saw him go from pursuing claims in the courts to  threatening State and local election officials, to then attacking  Members of Congress in the Senate, to compromising our Justice  Department, and then to attacking the Republican Vice President.   These great public servants were being pressured by our Commander in  Chief to overturn the results. Some of them and their families got  death threats. Thankfully, at every turn, our democratic processes  prevailed, and the rule of law prevailed. It is only because all of  these people stayed strong and refused President Trump that our  Republic held fast and the will of the electorate was seen through. And  at this point, President Donald J. Trump ran out of nonviolent options  to maintain power.   I began today by raising the question of how we got here. What you  saw was a man so desperate to cling to power that he tried everything  he could to keep it, and when he ran out of nonviolent measures, he  turned to the violent mob that attacked your Senate Chamber on January  6.   As you cast your vote after this trial, I hope each of you will think  of the bravery of all of these people who said no to President Trump  because they knew that this was not right, that this was not America.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Next, Representative Stacey Plaskett of the  Virgin Islands will show in quite chilling detail, I should say, how  President Trump was well aware of the threat of violence on January 6  and how he welcomed and amplified his supporters' plans for  insurrection against the Union.   I should say as lead manager, this is a moment of special pride for  me because Representative Plaskett is not only the first delegate ever  to be on a team of impeachment managers in American history, but she  was also my law student at American University Washington College of  Law. I hope I am not violating any Federal educational records laws  when I say she was an A-student then, and she is an A-plus student now.   Stacey.   Ms. Manager PLASKETT. Thank you so much.   Hi. Mr. President, distinguished Senators, I am Stacey Plaskett, and  I represent the people of the Virgin Islands of the United States.   Over this past weekend, my 11-year-old daughter--I overheard her  telling one of my sons: Mommy doesn't seem really nervous about the  impeachment trial, to which that son, sounding like an older brother,  said: Taliah, you will learn that most of the time, Mommy really seems  to have it under control.   We know as parents that is not always the case, but I have learned  throughout my life that preparation and truth can carry far, can allow  you to speak truth to power. I have learned that as a young Black girl  growing up in the projects in Brooklyn, a housing community on St.  Croix, sent to the most unlikeliest of settings, and now, as an adult  woman representing an island territory, speaking to the U.S. Senate.  And because of truth, I am confident today speaking before you because  truth and fact are overwhelming that our President, the President of  the United States, incited a mob to storm the Capitol to attempt to  stop the certification of a Presidential election.   My fellow managers have shown and will continue to show clear  evidence that President Trump incited a violent mob to storm our  Capitol when he ran out of nonviolent means to stop the election. Once  assembled, that mob, at the President's direction, erupted into the  bloodiest attack on this Capitol since 1814.   Some of you have said there is no way the President could have known  how violent the mob would be. That is false because the violence--it  was foreseeable. I want to show you why this violence was foreseeable  and why Donald Trump was different than any other politician just  telling their fighters, their supporters to fight for something.   The violence that occurred on January 6, like the attack itself, did  not just appear. You will see that Donald Trump knew the people he was  inciting, he saw the violence that they were capable of, and he had a  pattern and practice of praising and encouraging that violence, never  ever condemning it.  [[Page S628]]    And you will see that this violent attack was not planned in secret.  The insurgents believed that they were doing the duty of their  President. They were following his orders. And so they publicized  openly, loudly, proudly exact blueprints of how the attack would be  made.   Law enforcement saw these postings and reported that these insurgents  would violently attack the Capitol itself. This was months of  cultivating a base of people who were violent, praising that violence,  then leading that violence--that rage--straight at our door.    The point is this: By the time he called the cavalry of his thousands  of supporters on January 6, at an event he had invited them to, he had  every reason to know that they were armed, that they were violent, and  that they would actually fight. He knew who he was calling and the  violence they were capable of, and he still gave the marching orders to  go to the Capitol and ``Fight like hell'' to ``Stop the Steal.''   Make no mistake, the violence was not just foreseeable to President  Trump; the violence was what he deliberately encouraged. As early as  September, Trump set the precedent that, when asked to denounce  violence, he would do the opposite and encourage it.   Now, if the President had only said something once about fighting to  stop the steal, and violence erupted, there would be no way to know he  intended to incite it or saw it coming. But just as the President spent  months spreading his big lie of the election, he also spent months  cultivating groups of people who, following his command, repeatedly  engaged in real, dangerous violence. And when they did, when the  violence erupted as a response to his calls to fight against the stolen  election, he did not walk it back. He did not tell them no. He did the  opposite--the opposite. He praised and encouraged the violence so that  it would continue. He fanned the flame of violence and it worked.   You will see this over time. These very groups and individuals whose  violence the President praised helped lead the attack on January 6. And  that is how we know clearly that President Trump deliberately incited  this and how we know he saw it coming.   There are many examples where the President engaged in this pattern.  I am just going to walk you through a few of them.   Let's start with President Trump's incitement of the Proud Boys. Many  of you have heard of this group, which since 2018 has been classified  by the FBI as an extremist organization. Since that classification, the  group has repeatedly engaged in serious acts of violence, including at  pro-Trump rallies. In one such act on September 7, the Proud Boys  attacked a man with a baseball bat and then punched him while he was  down on the ground.   On September 29, during a Presidential debate, President Trump was  asked specifically if he was willing to condemn White supremacy and  militia groups, if he was willing to tell them to stand down and stop  the violence. Let's watch.   (Text of video presentation.)
