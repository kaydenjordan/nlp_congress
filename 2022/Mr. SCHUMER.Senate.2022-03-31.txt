 Madam President, first on COVID negotiations, yesterday,  I met with a group of my colleagues--Senators Murray, Coons, Romney,  Blunt, Burr, and Graham--for another round of talks as we work toward a  bipartisan COVID agreement. We spoke throughout the day; we talked late  into the night; our staffs are continuing talks this morning.   The gap has been narrowed greatly, and we are intent on working with  Republicans to cross the finish line because this is vital for our  country if, God forbid, a new variant arises in the future, and that is  all too likely. We would like considerably more money than our  Republican colleagues, but we need to reach 60 votes to get something  passed through the Senate, and so we are going to push as hard as we  can.   When it comes to replenishing COVID response funding, we simply can't  afford to kick the can down the road. The White House has been more  than clear and more than transparent about the fact that public funds  for COVID are at risk of running out. We all know that a possible  future variant can quickly undo much of the progress we have made  against the virus, so it makes no sense whatsoever to hold off on COVID  funding that we know is very much needed right now. The more we wait,  the bigger the problem will be later, God forbid a variant hits.   The bottom line is this: Both sides should work to complete COVID  funding soon because that will mean more vaccines, more therapeutics,  and more testing so we can keep schools and communities open. We can  stay ``back to normal,'' which we are doing right now. Woe is us if a  future variant extends its nasty tentacles across the country, and we  don't have the resources in place to respond. Woe is us. So, again, I  am pleading with my Republican colleagues: Join us. We want more than  you do, but we have to get something done. We have to get something  done.   We will keep working to arrive at a deal in good faith, and we hope-- hope, hope, hope--our Republican colleagues ultimately join us in  supporting a robust enough package to deal with this problem.   As I said, we are making good progress. We are getting closer and  closer, but the sooner we get this deal done, the better for the  country.                          Business Before the Senate    Madam President, on cost cutting, it has been a productive few days  here on the Senate floor as we pass legislation that will help reduce  costs, relieve supply chains, and build on the incredible economic  growth we have seen under President Biden.   I am glad to announce that the Senate is on track to pass bipartisan  legislation by Senators Klobuchar and Thune to reform unfair shipping  practices that are clogging up our ports, diminishing American exports,  hurting our farmers, and ultimately hurting consumers. It hurts both  ways when shipping costs go way up, as they have. The exports we send  over--a lot of it agricultural goods--the imports that come back--a lot  of it consumer goods--all are higher priced, and Americans pay that  higher price.   So the bipartisan shipping bill is exactly the sort of thing the  Senate should focus on because when there is a logjam at the Port of  Los Angeles, it hurts farmers and small businesses in Minnesota, North  Dakota, and across the country, and it hurts consumers in every corner  of the country, from Portland, ME, to San Diego, from Seattle to Miami,  New York, and everywhere in between.   So I am glad we are making progress to getting this legislation done.  The sooner the better, again.   The legislation, of course, is not the only step we have taken this  week to strengthen supply chains to help lower costs throughout the  economy. Earlier this week, the Senate passed a strongly bipartisan  jobs and competitiveness bill in the works for over a year, which will  help increase our domestic manufacturing, help address the critical  chip shortage, and grow our economy by investing in American  innovation.   Yesterday, the House passed a motion requesting a conference  committee, and the Senate will soon do the same. We are on track to  initiating a conference, hopefully, before the end of this work period.   Off the floor, committees held numerous hearings zeroing in on the  many dimensions of our lowering cost agenda. To name just a few  examples, the Banking Committee held a hearing on Monday on the growing  burden of medical debt, a problem that is facing so many Americans.   The Small Business Committee also held a hearing yesterday exploring  the supply chain crisis and its implications for smaller businesses,  including struggling restaurants.   And, today, the Banking Committee is on the matter of seniors who  struggle with affordable housing.   These are just a few examples of how, both off the floor and on,  Democrats are continuing our focus on legislation that will lower  costs, help American families, and solve the deep and difficult  challenges that everyday Americans face to make ends meet. And we are  going to keep pushing in the months ahead to translate these ideas into  legislation we can consider here in the Chamber, as we are doing with  shipping right now.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have an update on today's floor  schedule. At 1:45, the Senate was scheduled to hold a procedural vote  related to a shell legislative vehicle we could use to pass COVID  response funding. Our Republican colleagues have requested that we do  not hold a cloture vote on the motion to proceed at the present as we  are getting close to a final agreement that would garner bipartisan  support.   We are working diligently to finalize language, scoring, and a final  agreement on what should be funded in the final COVID package, both  domestic and international. As a sign of good faith and to encourage us  to come to a final agreement, I will reschedule today's procedural vote  to a later time.                                  H.R. 4373    Mr. President, now, when it comes to replenishing COVID response  funding, we simply cannot afford to kick the can down the road. We need  more money right away so we have enough vaccines and testing and  lifesaving therapeutics.   We want our communities to go back to normal and stay normal.   If a new virus comes--if a new variant comes, and we are not  prepared, we could lose that ability to go back to normality, for our  schools to stay open, for events to occur, for people to gather. We  don't want to do that.   Well, the best way to avoid that from happening if, God forbid, a new  variant comes--and it is likely that it will--is to have us prepared,  and this COVID legislation has us prepared by having an adequate supply  of these new, almost miraculous therapeutics that can greatly reduce  the severity of any illness and that can be given right after testing.   We need tests, and we need to make sure that the vaccines we have are  ready and updated. We can't wait. We can't wait until COVID is upon us  to do this.   The prospect of not being prepared is scary, and Americans should  all--Democrats, Republicans--be able to unite in making sure we are  prepared. We need to get COVID funding done for the country before the  end of the work period. It is very much needed, and so we are going to  keep talking with the Republicans so we can hopefully agree to a robust  package that keeps our country prepared.                    Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 4373    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion with  respect to the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 310, H.R. 4373, ripen  at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with  the Republican leader.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 309, H.R. 3197.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 297, S. 1320.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported amendment be considered and agreed to; that the  bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 311, S. 3580.    Mr. President, I further ask that the committee-reported  amendment be withdrawn; that the amendment, which is at the desk, be  considered and agreed to; and that the bill, as amended, be considered  read a third time.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, the Senate has just passed very  significant and much needed legislation that will reduce costs for the  American people by passing a bipartisan bill to reform unfair shipping  practices hurting exports and consumers alike.   We have all seen pictures of scores of ships lining up in ports from  Los Angeles to Seattle, to New York, to Savannah. Supply chain backlogs  have made it harder for goods to leave these ports and get to their  international destinations.   Every single day that goods lie idle in our ports, it costs producers  more and more money. It is a serious problem, rippling from one coast  to the other.   These backlogs have created serious price hikes. Today, according to  one study, the price to transport a container from China to the west  coast of the United States costs 12 times as much as it did 2 years  ago--12 times. Talk about supply chain backlogs. This is it--a glaring,  glaring example.   And, of course, it hurts both ways when shipping costs go up. It  affects exports that we send overseas. It affects many of our farmers,  who need to export their goods. It also affects the imports that come  back. It affects all the goods that Americans buy from overseas-- appliances and food and so many other things.   When the cost of shipping is higher, the cost of the goods are  higher, and people have to pay too much--a whole lot more.   At the end of the day, it is the American consumer that pays the  higher price. Thankfully, this bill will make it harder for ocean  carriers to unreasonably refuse American goods at our ports while  strengthening the Federal Maritime Commission's ability to step in and  prevent harmful practices by carriers.   This bipartisan shipping bill is exactly the sort of thing that the  Senate should focus on. It is cost cutting; it is bipartisan; and it  will directly give relief to small businesses and consumers alike.   And I would like to thank a good number of my colleagues who helped  with this legislation. It was put together and sponsored in a  bipartisan way by Senators Klobuchar and Thune. And Senator Cantwell,  who understands the maritime industry probably better than any other  Member in this Chamber, was relentless in pushing this legislation. It  went through her committee, and now it has passed the Senate and,  hopefully, will become law soon, and she deserves our kudos and  accolades for the good job she has done for American consumers,  farmers, manufacturers, and everybody else.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, due to the current events happening in  Europe, the minority leader and I have  [[Page S1902]]  agreed to increase the membership of the Senate NATO Observer Group by  two additional Senators. For the additional Democratic Senator, I ask  that Senator Rosen be added to participate in the Group.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the third criminal trial arising out of  the events of January 6, 2021, is scheduled to begin on April 4, 2022,  in Federal district court in the District of Columbia. One of the two  defendants in this case pleaded guilty earlier this month. The  remaining defendant, Thomas Robertson, is going to trial and is charged  with six counts: obstructing the counting by Congress of the electoral  ballots for President and Vice President; obstructing the grand jury  investigation related to the events of January 6, 2021, and his Federal  prosecution by altering and destroying one or more cell phones;  impeding and interfering with law enforcement officers during a civil  disorder; entering and remaining in a restricted area within the U.S.  Capitol and its grounds; and two counts of engaging in disorderly and  disruptive conduct.   The prosecution has requested trial testimony from Daniel Schwager,  formerly counsel to the Secretary of the Senate, related to the  obstruction count, including his knowledge and observations of the  process and constitutional and legal bases for Congress's certification  of the electoral college vote. The prosecution is also seeking  testimony at trial, if necessary, from Nate Russell and Diego Torres,  custodians of records in the Senate Recording Studio, which operates  under the authority of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the  Senate, to authenticate Senate video of the proceeding that day. Senate  Secretary Berry and Senate Sergeant at Arms Gibson would like to  cooperate with these requests by providing relevant testimony in this  proceeding from Messrs. Schwager, Russell, and Torres, respectively.   In keeping with the rules and practices of the Senate, this  resolution would authorize the production of relevant testimony from  Messrs. Schwager, Russell, and Torres, with representation by the  Senate Legal Counsel.
