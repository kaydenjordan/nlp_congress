 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Hospital  Corpsman Maxton William ``Max'' Soviak of the United States Navy, who  made the ultimate sacrifice while securing safe passage for his fellow  Americans in Afghanistan on August 26.   Max grew up in Berlin Heights, part of the Fourth District of Ohio.  He attended Edison High School, where he played for the football team  and was a member of the State championship wrestling team. His proudest  decision, according to his family, was to enlist as a Devil Doc in the  Navy after high school.   A Devil Doc's mission is to perform lifesaving work even as unknown  dangers advance. Amid the deteriorating security conditions at Hamid  Karzai Airport in Kabul, with the likelihood of an attack increasing,  Max stood at the gates to help evacuate American citizens and our  Afghan allies.   Throughout his career, and especially during his service in  Afghanistan, Max embodied the words of the Corpsman's Pledge: ``I shall  do all within my power to show in myself an example of all that is  honorable and good.''   Mr. Speaker, Maxton Soviak is an American hero who will never be  forgotten. He served his Nation bravely and honorably. We will never be  able to repay his sacrifice, but we must always remember it.                            ____________________
