 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two Members of our  congressional delegation, and two of my friends, Congressman Steve  Stivers and Congressman Brad Wenstrup, upon their military promotions.   Now Brigadier General Stivers in the Ohio National Guard, and Colonel  Brad Wenstrup in the United States Army Reserve, they both have served  their country beyond the boundaries of their district.   Today I am humbled and honored to join my colleagues in  congratulating them on their distinguished public and military careers.   Congressman Stivers, 30 years ago as a young Buckeye, assumed the  title--one very important to him and to us--as citizen soldier.   In 1998, Congressman Wenstrup joined the U.S. Army Reserve after  already establishing himself as a doctor in the Cincinnati area.   To Congressman Stivers and Congressman Wenstrup, as faithful  Representatives to your constituents, as members of our military, and  veterans of the Iraq war and recipients of the Bronze Star, you have  always put service to our country first.   Thank you from a grateful Congress and a grateful nation.  Congratulations on your respective promotions.                            ____________________
