 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  congressional interns who serve in our offices here in Washington,  D.C., in my State of Oregon, and around the country, and to ask all my  colleagues to make internship opportunities available to more qualified  applicants by paying interns for their work.   Congressional internships are highly desirable. They provide students  and recent graduates with valuable experience, learning firsthand how  Congress and how our government works.   Many current staff members and, in fact, many Members of Congress  started their careers as congressional interns and were able to use the  skills they learned and the connections they made to leverage future  opportunities.   The reality is, however, that most young people do not have the  option of coming to work on Capitol Hill as an intern because most  internships are still unpaid. Many bright and motivated people simply  cannot afford to take an unpaid internship, no matter how prestigious  it might be, because they need to earn money to continue paying for  college or to support themselves or their families.   No one who is qualified who wants to intern on Capitol Hill should be  precluded because of financial barriers.   I am proud that I offer paid internships in my office, so students  and recent graduates have an opportunity to work and learn and gain  experience.   But paying interns doesn't just help them. It helps us, too. My staff  and I benefit greatly from having interns from all backgrounds and all  walks of life working in our office. The diversity of perspectives is  critical as I consider legislation and think about how to best serve my  constituents who are also from diverse backgrounds and all walks of  life.   Many of my colleagues understand the importance of equitable intern  opportunities and, through the leadership of Representative Tim Ryan  and others, are working to increase funding and cut red tape so that  all our offices will be able to offer and support paid internships.                                time  1030    Capitol Hill is best served when our offices reflect the diversity of  our districts and our country.   I will continue to work with my colleagues to make sure that all  qualified applicants can apply for internships and serve as interns  regardless of their financial situation. It helps our offices, it helps  the interns, and it helps the country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, there is bipartisan consensus that our Nation's  families, on behalf of our Nation's children, who are our future and  our future leaders, must be able to access affordable, high quality  childcare and other early learning opportunities to fulfill their  potential and succeed in college and career and in life. In fact, a  recent poll done by the First Five Years Fund found that 89 percent of  voters, including 82 percent of Republicans, support making quality  early childhood education more affordable for working families.   Last year, I joined Ranking Member Bobby Scott and more than 120 of  my colleagues to introduce the Child Care for Working Families Act.   This bill would ensure universal access to quality early learning  programs for all families making less than 150 percent of their State's  median income.   Today, the average annual cost of full-time, center-based childcare  in the United States exceeds the average annual cost of in-state  tuition.   In Oregon and other places around the country, lower and middle- income families are forced to pay up to 30 percent of their annual  income on childcare, with many of the lowest income families unable to  afford care at all.    The Child Care for Working Families Act is a bold solution to fix  this national problem. The legislation would mean that no family of  four earning an annual household income below $139,000 per year would  pay more than 7 percent of that income for quality childcare.  [[Page H7884]]    This legislation would also ensure that early learning teachers and  caregivers finally get the time, attention, training, and resources  they deserve. Whether in childcare, preschool, prekindergarten, or in  other early learning environments, every child should receive quality  care.   Parents are out working hard. They deserve the peace of mind that  comes from the confidence of knowing that childcare and early learning  professionals are well trained, and that means well paid. No longer  would a full-time early learning professional have to enroll in public  assistance to make ends meet.   Decades of research shows that properly nurturing children in the  early years of life is instrumental in supporting enhanced brain  development, cognitive functioning, and emotional and physical health.  Research also shows what all of us know: investing in quality early  learning programming leads to better educational outcomes, stronger job  earnings, and lower crime rates.   Quality early learning helps prevent and mitigate academic  achievement gaps, it provides indisputable long-term benefits for our  Nation. And nothing returns more money to the Treasury than investments  in early learning programs. Our Nation receives $7 in economic benefit  for every $1 invested in these programs. That, my colleagues, is a good  investment in our future, our children. This bill is not only the right  thing to do, but also the smart thing to do.   The Child Care For Working Families Act lays out the path of what  early learning in America could and should look like. If we want a  promising future for our children, if we want strong and stable  families, we must make sure that all families can access high quality  early learning opportunities. Quality childcare is a national priority.  This bill deserves immediate attention and, importantly, bipartisan  support. Our future is at stake.
