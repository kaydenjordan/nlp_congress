I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons), the Senator from California (Ms.  Harris), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from  Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren)  are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend  Michael Bauer, who died in late August after a battle with cancer.   You couldn't miss Michael--he was the outspoken, critical ally of  scores of boards and organizations in the LGBTQ community of Chicago;  the first call they made when they needed an effective advocate. When  the conversation turned to political friends and foes, issues of the  moment and candidates in the hunt, he never had a private thought or  waited his turn to share it. And when the music started, Michael was  the first on the dance floor.   I met Michael more than 20 years ago as a downstate Congressman  running for the U.S. Senate. After an introductory dinner with Michael,  his partner, Roger, and my wife Loretta, Michael gave me a passing  grade, but I always knew he liked Loretta more.   His name was first on the list of must-calls for political  candidates. But if you only knew the public side of Michael, you might  not have known the fire inside that drove his life. Over time we became  friends, and that friendship led to trust between us. Michael shared  with me the private stories, the journey of his life.   At the center were his parents, survivors of the Holocaust who spent  their whole lives facing the memories of friends and family who  perished. Michael knew that they were victims of forces they did not  have the power to control. He was determined to know more about the  cruelty and hate they faced. This search took him to the Holocaust  Memorial Museum, where he carefully reconstructed his family's  experience. Michael believed that through these efforts, his mother,  Tema, now 103, was given back the real story of her life in a war that  sent her to slave labor camps. He said with this research his mother's  entire memory of the horror of the Holocaust was validated. This search  for the truth was personal to Michael as the Jewish son of a survivor  and as a gay man who knew the Nazis targeted and murdered homosexuals  as well.   Personally facing the massive loss of life in the Holocaust, I think  Michael felt a special pain with the AIDS crisis. I remember when he  told me that fellow members of a board he served on were still not  taking care to protect themselves. He was truly saddened as he feared  for their fate.   But if life had been cruel to his family and the world outside could  be perilous, Michael had one constant, one protector. He talked to me  so many times about Roger, truly the center of his life, his partner,  his love, and ultimately his husband. For me, it was a personal insight  into a loving relationship at a level I had never before witnessed so  closely. I could not imagine Roger without Michael, as now we must.   When it came to the world of politics, Michael willingly, frequently  shared his opinion of every candidate and every issue. No one escaped  his penetrating, outspoken scrutiny.   But Michael was always ready to help his friends, often in memorable  ways. In 2000, with Joe Lieberman as the first Jewish candidate for  Vice President, Michael and Roger made a point of heading to Los  Angeles for the convention. When they heard I had an event planned  there, they insisted on giving me a ride from the hotel. When they  arrived in their rented convertible, Michael and Roger were properly  dressed in muscle t-shirts and ready to drive through Beverly Hills. As  we cruised through Wilshire Blvd and Rodeo Drive, Michael insisted on  prepping me for the upcoming Gore-Lieberman campaign--he taught me  valuable Yiddish words and phrases. Michael was always there with  advice for his friends.   In 1996, we celebrated my first Senate election night together. I  remember his trademark smile and the tears in his eyes. After I was  elected to the Senate, Michael wasted no time bringing an issue to my  attention. It was not an ask for a job or a contract or anything that  would benefit him personally; he asked if I could find time to visit  the Howard Brown Health Center on Halsted. Of course I agreed--how  could you say no to Michael? The visit led to a conversation where  Michael looked me in the eye and said the Howard Brown Center was  critical in fighting the AIDS crisis. He told me of friends who were  afraid of other health venues and afraid to face the realities of their  lives. Howard Brown was their best chance and for some, their only  chance. He wanted me to see firsthand the impact of the AIDS crisis in  our country.   Michael Bauer used his knowledge and connections to help others, to  protect others, to fight a deadly crisis that was burying his friends.  In his heart, Michael was a caring, loving person who used his talents  and his access to help those on the outside of the halls of power.  Loretta and I join Roger, Tema, Michael's extended family and so many  friends in mourning the loss of Michael.   Farewell, Michael. You will be missed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Margaret Blackshere was a trailblazer as  the first woman to serve as president of the nearly 1-million strong  Illinois AFL-CIO. In July, she passed away at the age of 79, and I rise  today to honor her memory. I share the privilege with countless others  to call her a friend.   Margaret and her sister were raised by their single mother, Frances,  and Aunt Margie in North Venice, IL. Her mother made sure her daughters  knew that they could do anything. There were no boy chores or girl  chores; there were just chores. Laundry and rewiring a lamp were normal  activities.   She started off studying to be a nun, but she changed course and  ended up studying elementary education at Southern Illinois University,  Edwardsville. Her religious convictions remained an essential part of  her life, but education was her calling.   After college, Margaret began teaching in a school in Madison, IL.  She and her fellow teachers were making only $3,000 a year and weren't  treated with respect, but they noticed that the steelworkers and  mineworkers in the area were respected and doing well because they  belonged to a union and worked together to secure better working  conditions. Margaret and her colleagues decided they needed to form a  union and demand adequate pay from the superintendent. The  superintendent refused so Margaret took action and organized a 5-week  strike. One small issue--because she and the other teachers were public  employees, their strike was illegal. Margaret and her colleagues were  jailed, but the jail only had two cells. This meant that every day,  Margaret arrived at the jail with her children, ages 3 and 5, and every  [[Page S5469]]  night, she went home because there wasn't enough space. Her fellow  teachers saw her dedication and elected her president of the teachers'  union in Madison.   Margaret went back to Southern Illinois University to earn a master's  degree in urban education. She became focused on issues about children  living in poverty.   Her work with the union and its attempts to earn greater pay for  teachers opened the door to politics. She began working on local  election campaigns. It wasn't just about money anymore; it was about  having a voice. With her hard work, Margaret was elected vice president  of the Illinois Federation of Teachers, IFT, and chair of its  legislative committee.   Eventually, Margaret reluctantly gave up teaching, which she loved so  much, and became a lobbyist for the IFT. She worked in Springfield to  improve the salaries and working conditions of teachers. Margaret also  began building networks and alliances. In 1993, the Illinois AFL-CIO  needed a secretary-treasurer. Margaret was easily elected because she  was respected by so many people from her time campaigning and working  for the IFT.   In 2000, Margaret became president of the Illinois AFL-CIO. When  Margaret came into office, she inherited a staff of 25. None of them  was a person of color. The executive board had no women on it. Illinois  AFL-CIO also didn't have health insurance that covered well-baby care  or mammograms. Margaret brought these benefits into place. She also  transformed the executive board by making it more diverse. Before long,  seven African Americans, two Latinos, and eight women had positions on  the board.   Under Margaret's leadership, the Illinois AFL-CIO helped lead the  fight to raise the State's minimum wage--not once but twice. She led  efforts to guarantee women equal pay for equal work, to expand  healthcare, and to improve Illinois' workers' compensation system.   Margaret excelled at bringing people of different backgrounds  together to achieve goals. She used to say, ``If you've got a good  cause, people will join it.'' She helped create Transportation for  Illinois with the Illinois Automobile Asphalt and Pavement Association,  the Chicago Transit Authority, and other businesses, organized labor,  industry, governmental, and nonprofit organizations to support strong  transportation investments for Illinois. The groups may have fought  each other on a host of issues, but she gave them a unified voice for  infrastructure.   Margaret devoted much of her life as well to charitable organizations  and served on many boards, including the Illinois branches of United  Way and the American Red Cross, Alliance for Retired Americans, Voices  for Illinois Children, Unemployment Insurance Advisory Board, and the  Federal Reserve Board of Chicago. She served as an inspiration to the  Illinois Women's Institute for Leadership alongside my wife, Loretta,  encouraging and training women to become effective leaders in Illinois.   Over the years, Margaret received more awards and accolades than can  be recounted here. She was delighted to be the guest of honor for  Chicago's St. Patrick Day Parade in 2003. Margaret loved celebrating  her Irish heritage.   Loretta and I will miss her great humor and her willingness to always  wish others well unless they were playing her beloved St. Louis  Cardinals.   Margaret is survived by her two sons, Michael and Thomas; her sister,  Patricia; and four grandchildren.                            ____________________
