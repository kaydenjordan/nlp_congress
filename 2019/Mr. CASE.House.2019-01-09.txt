 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1,  the For the People Act, of which I am a very proud cosponsor.   H.R. 1 is a critical step toward reversing the accelerating  deterioration in our Nation's most cherished democratic foundation--the  consent of the governed--and taking back our government for all  citizens. It would fight voter suppression; simplify voting; promote  election security; curb special interests and dark money in politics;  incentivize smaller, broader donations; and fortify ethics laws.   I wish especially to recognize contributions of Issue One and its  ReFormers Caucus. These over 200 now-former Members of Congress,  Cabinet members, and Governors have dedicated themselves on a  nonpartisan basis to ``Fix Democracy First.'' My own motivation to  return to Congress arose from my membership in this caucus, and my  pledge to my constituents in Hawaii and throughout the country was and  is to fight to fully return our government to the governed again.   H.R. 1 is first and foremost for the people, and I urge its prompt  passage. Everything else depends on that.                            ____________________
