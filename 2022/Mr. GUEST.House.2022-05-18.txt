 Madam Speaker, Scriptures tell us: ``Blessed are the  peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.''   As Police Week comes to a close, it is important that we continue to  thank our law enforcement officers that protect our communities and  tackle the huge recruiting and retention issues that our police  departments are seeing.   At a time when violent crime is at an all-time high, and our police  departments are understaffed and overworked  [[Page H5134]]  because of the impact of the defund the police movement and antipolice  rhetoric, it is more important than ever that we support our law  enforcement officers.   Former President Ronald Reagan once said: ``There can be no more  noble vocation than the protection of one's fellow citizens. . . . No  single group is more fully committed to the well-being of their fellow  Americans and to the faithful discharge of duty than our law  enforcement.'' Law enforcement, we know, lives by creed. That creed is  to serve and to protect.   Sheriff Rutherford's bill, H.R. 7809, would help law enforcement  accomplish that mission. It would put law enforcement back into our  communities and take criminals off the streets by allowing Federal  grant dollars to offer a $5,000 hiring and retention bonus to law  enforcement officers.   I am grateful for the men and women of law enforcement and for their  service, and I will continue to work with these heroes to see that our  communities are safe places to live, to worship, and to raise a family.
