 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to mark, with sadness, the  47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. This tragic Supreme Court decision has  resulted in the loss of over 60 million unborn babies' lives. This  surpasses the number killed by Stalin and Hitler, combined.   In a country, today, where so many social and technological  advancements have been achieved, how is it that we still fail to value  the most fundamental part of human society--a human life?   The repercussions of Roe have been disastrous. Over 60 million  children have lost their lives because of Roe.   I am dismayed by the arguments I hear coming from those who call  themselves pro-choice. Those 60 million unborn were not given a choice.   I have two wonderful and lovely daughters-in-law who are expecting  babies as we speak right now. I am so glad that these two principled  women and their husbands value life.   Now, our choice is to be the voice for the voiceless. I am proud to  stand here with my colleagues in Congress for the cause of life.
