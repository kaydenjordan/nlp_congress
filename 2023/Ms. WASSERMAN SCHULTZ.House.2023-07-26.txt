 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4366, with great  respect to both of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle,  Chairwoman Granger and Chairman Carter, who are friends but with whom  we strongly disagree on this legislation.   The FY 2024 military construction, veterans affairs, and related  agencies bill is, sadly, not one that I can support.   Back in May, the subcommittee mark of the MILCON-VA bill cut the Cost  of War Toxic Exposures Fund by $14.7 billion in 2024 and completely  eliminated the toxic exposures fund in 2025, less than a year after we  passed the bipartisan Honoring our PACT Act that promises dedicated  funding for veterans of all wars exposed to Agent Orange, burn pits,  and other toxic substances.   This was in addition to the default on America act introduced in  April by Republicans, which included a $2 billion rescission to  immediately cut critical funding for VA and include no protections for  veterans funding. We pushed back hard on these cuts as Democrats, and  we were successful.   Thankfully, as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023,  President Biden was able to undo that grievous harm by delivering the  promise we all collectively made to our veterans by fully funding the  toxic exposures fund.   However, the problems did not stop there, and Democrats made  significant efforts to right the other major wrongs in this bill, but,  unfortunately, to no avail.   The MILCON-VA bill is traditionally one of the more bipartisan  bills--actually, so often that it is almost indistinguishable who is in  the majority and who wrote those bills.   That is not the case, sadly, this year because it is riddled with  partisan riders, coming out of the full committee on a party-line vote  significantly worse off than where it started. Riders include  preventing VA from implementing its interim final rule that provides  access to abortions for the life or health of the mother and in the  case of rape or incest, as well as abortion counseling to provide  healthcare services for women who desperately need it, and,  importantly, to ensure that veterans have equal access to healthcare  regardless of what State they live in because they get their healthcare  from a Federal agency.  [[Page H3977]]    It includes riders that do everything from prohibiting VA from  implementing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives as well as  training; prohibiting VA from flying the Pride flag over VA facilities;  creating a license for people and organizations to discriminate against  LGBTQI+ people under the guise of religious liberty and prevents the  Federal Government from adequately responding; and prohibiting access  to gender-affirming care, further disenfranchising veterans from VA.   VA is a place where all veterans should feel welcome, included, and  cared for. All veterans means all veterans, and what this bill does is  shameful.   On the MILCON side, this bill cuts funding for servicemembers and  their families by $1.5 billion compared to the enacted level, compared  to current services.   The Republicans have cut military construction funding by $1.5  billion compared to the current funding. In fact, this bill is $200  million lower after the full committee markup than when it was first  introduced in subcommittee. Even after the agreement with President  Biden was signed into law, this bill cuts even more.   We have a recruitment and retention problem, Mr. Chairman, and this  bill cuts funding for military construction.   We have major quality-of-life issues for our servicemembers, and this  bill cuts funding for military construction and cuts funding for things  like childcare centers, training centers, and airplane hangars that  house and protect our billions of dollars of military equipment.   This bill cuts dedicated funding for PFAS forever chemicals  remediation and cleanup, which is a cut of $200 million from the  current level, and dedicated funding for military installation climate  change and resiliency projects, which is a cut of $90 million from the  current level.   There is an enormous need for funds to clean up PFAS forever  chemicals contamination at BRAC sites as the services are still in the  early stages of dealing with PFAS forever chemicals contamination.   Dedicated PFAS forever chemicals funding has previously been provided  in this bill so we can ensure continued progress in remediating  contamination at closed bases and minimize the impact for those  surrounding communities. This is critical funding needed to fulfill our  commitment to ensure those pieces of land are safe for future use and  for people who live nearby. This is poison that Republicans are  refusing to provide funding to clean up.   Furthermore, neglecting to continue investing in protecting our  installations from climate change is a national security risk. We all  know how extremely costly disaster assistance funding is. I am from  Florida. I certainly know about that better than most.   Last year, we provided DOD with $90 million, a comparatively small  sum of funding now, which will pay huge dividends in the future and  ensure our national security in the face of our changing climate. By  eliminating the dedicated resilience funding this year, this bill would  threaten future military readiness.   Cutting military construction by $1.5 billion slows our historically  bipartisan efforts to reduce the infrastructure backlog to strengthen  our national security and to improve the quality of life of our  servicemembers and their families. We are backtracking on our  commitment to our servicemembers and their families.   To make matters worse, veterans rely on programs throughout the  Federal Government, not just programs in this bill. Instead of honoring  the bipartisan budget agreement that this Chamber voted into law just  last month, the FY 2024 House appropriations bills collectively break  the commitment that was negotiated, agreed to, passed by a majority of  Congress, and signed into law by President Biden to adequately fund  critical domestic investments. Instead, these bills are written to the  same exact number used before negotiations even began.   These drastic cuts diminish access to education, transportation, job  opportunities, and food assistance that veterans and their families  rely on.   Is there no line that Republicans won't cross? Is there no population  that is off-limits?   The MILCON-VA bill is just one piece of the puzzle, Mr. Chairman, and  gutting all the other programs that veterans and their families rely on  throughout the Federal Government breaks our promises to veterans and  pulls the rug out from under those who served our country and whom we  promised to take care of upon their return. I cannot and will not  support it.   The House MILCON-VA bill, as well as all 11 other appropriations  bills, are headed for a collision course with the Senate, which got to  work in a bipartisan manner. By the way, their version of this bill  passed unanimously out of full committee. They got to work in a  bipartisan manner to complete appropriations bills on time, consistent  with the Fiscal Responsibility Act.   These appropriations bills renege on the agreement and risk an  automatic, across-the-board cut with a CR, toward which we are clearly  headed--or, worse, toward a government shutdown.   I will follow, Mr. Chairman, one of the first tenets that I learned  as a legislator many years ago: Your word is your bond. I will stand by  our veterans and our servicemembers by opposing this bill that deprives  them of the services, care, and quality of life that they have earned  and deserve.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the  House Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), a fierce advocate for our  communities' veterans and a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   The gentlemen from Tennessee and California understand what kind of  money really matters here. It is very nice to say that you are $800  million above the President's budget request.   The money that matters is where we are now and what Republicans are  proposing to spend going forward. Republicans are cutting--which, of  course, Mr. Cline neglected to mention--military construction $1.5  billion below what we spend now. That is a cut by anyone's definition.  They can play games with the language and the way they describe things,  but there is no getting around that they are cutting $1.5 billion from  military construction.   What does that mean? That might just sound like, oh, we will build a  few less buildings, it is not going to be that bad. Understand that DOD  has assessed that 30 percent of our military infrastructure around the  world is in fair or poor condition. Many of us have traveled around the  world to inspect military bases, and we talk to our troops and pledge  to our servicemembers how much they mean to us and how we have their  backs. I have had the opportunity to be shown places where our hangar  doors are held together with wax and spit, particularly in places like  Okinawa and other areas where there is a lot of erosion and metal rusts  more quickly. I live in a coastal State, and I have a coastal district,  so I understand what happens there when you are on the coast from the  salt air. I watched a servicemember try to pull closed a hangar door  that was jury-rigged with a coat hanger because they couldn't get the  door closed the way it normally  [[Page H3979]]  should, and we did not provide them funding anywhere in the near future  to ensure that we can keep billions of dollars' worth of military  equipment safe.   Republicans are standing here and saying things that absolutely do  not pass the straight-face test when they are trying to suggest that  they are doing right by our servicemembers.   We have a retention problem in our military. We have people who have  testified to the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee who are current servicemembers who talked to us  about how they intended to spend their careers in the service, but  because of the way they and their families felt treated, the decrepit  housing that the military can't seem to get straight when it comes to  dealing with mold and broken items and repairs that are necessary, they  chose a different career path.   If we continue on the path that Republicans have proposed, then what  that means is that we are going to lose servicemembers, like we are  already losing. That is irresponsible and unacceptable.   Mr. Chairman, I will have more to say at a later time. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Lee), who represents tens of thousands of  military servicemembers as well as veterans and is an incredible  advocate on their behalf.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Nevada.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, as the expression goes: Show me your budget, and I will  show you what my values are.   It is very clear with the lollipop tree of culture war riders that  this bill that funds the quality of life and the national readiness and  security of the United States of America and the protection and quality  of life of our military servicemembers, it is clear that because this  bill cuts $1.5 billion below what we are currently funding in military  construction, the Republicans have shown where their values are.   They can put all the lipstick on the pig that they have developed in  this  [[Page H3981]]  bill that they want, but at the end of the day, they are still cutting  $1.5 billion from military construction. That is cutting funding for  airport hangars, for training centers, for childcare centers, for  infrastructure that ensures that we can keep our servicemembers safe  when they are serving overseas, while they are serving in the United  States, and that is something that we have not done in modern times in  this bill.   Why? Because generally the military construction, veterans affairs,  appropriations bill is, on a bipartisan basis, written as a commitment  that we make to take care of our servicemembers while they are serving  in the military on Active Duty and to take care of our veterans when  they transition to retirement and spend the rest of their lives as  veterans.   This committee has a special responsibility. We are the only  committee in the Congress that is responsible for the entire life cycle  of an individual from when they start their service on Active Duty all  the way through Active Duty and through their life as a veteran. We  have a special responsibility to make sure that we are taking care of  them, and cutting $1.5 billion is the opposite of that.   The values that our friends on the other side of the aisle have shown  is very clear. What they were more interested in doing, and the  priority that was at the top of their agenda, included riders that  prevent all veterans from getting equal access to healthcare no matter  where they live. What they want to do in this bill--and you will see in  subsequent amendments that will be offered--is they want to take away  women veterans' right, their ability to make their own reproductive  healthcare decisions.   Furthermore, because veterans get their healthcare from the VA, it is  essential that we do not discriminate against those veterans, those  women veterans, no matter where they live; that they be able to get  that access to healthcare whenever they need it to ensure that they can  make their own reproductive healthcare decisions regardless of the  State they live in.   We spent the bulk of our time in the subcommittee and the full  committee debating riders that do everything from prohibiting VA from  implementing diversity and equity policies so that all veterans, no  matter their religion, their culture, their ethnicity, their sexual  orientation, that all veterans are treated equally; that we can ensure  that no one feels alienated when walking through the doors of the VA  facility.   The Republicans zap any program, any policy related to treating  veterans equally and making everyone feel welcome when they walk in  that door.   It was a top priority for them to prohibit VA facilities from flying  the Pride flag over VA's facilities. If that is one of their top  priorities, it is no wonder that they are cutting a billion-and-a-half  dollars out of military construction, because our friends on the other  side of the aisle have their policies backwards when it comes to taking  care of the people who have served our country and continue to serve  our country.   They have given a license to discriminate against people who are  LGBTQIA+ under the guise of religious liberty. They are preventing the  Federal Government from adequately responding to that and from VA to  provide healthcare services to everyone equally, and they are  prohibiting access to gender-affirming care, which no matter what you  might like to believe on the other side of the aisle, there are people  who have served our country who deserve those services.   All veterans should feel welcomed, included, and cared for. The fact  that they are cutting funding for PFAS forever chemical cleanup means  that we are going to be causing cancer and severe illness--which people  are already getting by being exposed to these forever chemicals. We are  going to ensure, because of the Republican values that are reflected in  this bill, cutting funding for PFAS forever chemicals, we are going to  ensure that more people who served our country and who live nearby  facilities that need to be cleaned up from these chemicals get sick and  eventually die. That is on them.   There is enormous need for more funding to help make sure that we can  do right by our veterans. This bill does the opposite, and I stand in  opposition to it. I urge all Members to join me in voting against this  bill so that we can go back to the drawing board.   We will likely go back to the drawing board, I am quite sure, as this  bill is on a crash course with the Senate bill which does a much better  job at living up to the values that we all should adhere to, and that  is taking care of people who have served our country and are serving  our country nobly now.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I strongly support the gentleman's  amendment and commend him for his efforts to address the severe  flooding problems that have occurred in and around West Point.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I strongly oppose this amendment to cut the NATO Security Investment  Program. It is hard to imagine a worse time for us to be cutting  funding from our international obligations when Russia has illegally  invaded Ukraine and our international obligations and cooperation are  so essential in order to ensure that Ukraine can maintain its  sovereignty and ensure that Russia is not allowed to be successful here  and then repeat the same thing across the globe.   The program, also known as NSIP, is a core part of America's  contribution toward shared territorial defense with its allies.  Moreover, the projects that NSIP funds often are already aligned with  U.S. European Command needs.   Our NSIP contributions often closely align with U.S. requirements,  like projects for safety and runway upgrades at airfields that our  planes use and fuel and dock improvements at ports that our ships use.   The program is experiencing a period of growth as the alliance seeks  to address necessary deferred infrastructure needs. This amendment  would cut funding for the program below the requested level,  shortchanging America's commitment to its allies, and instead move it  to the spending reduction account.   Military construction programs are already funded at $1.5 billion  below the enacted level, as I have talked about, and this amendment is  seeking to cut it further.   The United States contribution to NSIP, as a percentage of the  overall program, is much smaller proportionally than the United States  share of the alliance's gross national income. Simply put, our allies  are more than paying their fair share in the Security Investment  Program.   NSIP funding is necessary for NATO, and it is necessary for American  national security. We should not jeopardize it with this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in opposition to this grossly irresponsible amendment. This  amendment would take a huge cut, $73 million, from the NATO Security  Investment Program during a time when increased funding is essential  for long-deferred projects.   Cutting funding for the NATO Security Investment Program is not only  shortsighted from a national security perspective, but it isn't even  sound long-term fiscal policy. These investments ensure a robust  American and NATO presence to deter hostile nations and prevent even  greater costs to American taxpayers down the road.   One only has to look at the news to understand that we have hostile  nations that wish to do us and our allies harm. A $73 million cut from  the NATO Security Investment Program would put us in more jeopardy  alongside our allies.   The Russian invasion of Ukraine shows that international cooperation  and strong alliances are as essential as ever. These projects are not  America paying other countries' bills. In fact, America pays a  proportionally small amount to the program compared to the size of our  economy in relation to the rest of NATO.                                time  1530    Regardless of your stance on overall defense spending levels of  various NATO countries, it is simply not true that the United States is  paying more than its share of this direct contribution program.   These projects are agreed-upon NATO requirements and oftentimes have  a direct benefit to supplement existing U.S. requirements. These sites  include ones directly benefiting U.S. forces through the use of  upgraded ports, airfields, and communications.   Our contributions to NATO represent only a small portion of overall  defense spending, but the strength of the alliance is an outsized and  irreplaceable part of American national security.   This amendment would not even reinvest the funding into other  priorities, it simply cuts funding from the bill, shortchanging the  military construction portion by over $73 million. It is irresponsible.  It is dangerous.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this  amendment. It includes 28 amendments: 2 bipartisan, 14 for Republicans,  and 12 for Democrats. I am glad to see that we can at least come  together around certain aspects of this bill to support our veteran  servicemembers and their families and the leadership of colleagues on  both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Perez), who is here as an advocate on  behalf of her constituents serving in the military as well as our  veterans.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), who is here to  stand up to make sure that our veterans get access to legal care.    Mr. Chairman, I support the amendments en  bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.   The VA strives to fairly represent and support the communities that  it serves, and all veterans deserve equitable and fair access to the  healthcare and benefits that they deserve. Diversity and inclusion  foster a healthy workplace environment and promote equal opportunity  through smart outreach, retention, and education.   Our veterans--despite the sponsor's denial of a more greatly diverse  VA--increasingly are diverse themselves, and they deserve that.   The bill already rejected the budget request to fund the Office of  Resolution Management, Diversity and Inclusion at the levels needed to  support the department in 2024 and instead holds the office flat at the  same funding level provided in 2023, and now this amendment seeks to  eliminate the already inadequate funding in the bill entirely.   What is so threatening about the Office of Resolution Management,  Diversity and Inclusion?   This office, among the many things it does, prevents harassment and  discrimination problems.   I can't imagine why we wouldn't want to combat that, why we wouldn't  to make sure that everybody is able to come to work or to be treated at  the VA in an evenhanded and fair way.   It heads off costly legal problems for the VA and saves taxpayer  money in the long term which I thought was something that our friends  on the other side of the aisle are interested in.   I believe the real issue is that our friends on the other side of the  aisle don't like the increasing diversity that is occurring in this  country, and there is an effort underway as a result across all  appropriations bills to excise that word and any policy related to it  and to cut anything related to diversity regardless of the purpose and  need of the office.   Mr. Chairman, this is an inherently discriminatory, unfair, and  bigoted amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, during the process of applying  for disability benefits, VA determines whether or not a beneficiary can  manage their own financial affairs. If not, VA will assign them a  fiduciary to protect the veteran.   VA will only determine an individual to be unable to manage his or  her financial affairs after receipt of medical documentation or if a  court of competent jurisdiction has already made that determination.   In assigning a fiduciary, VA must also report the beneficiary to the  National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the NICS system, as,  under the law, they are adjudicated as mentally defective. This  reporting prevents the beneficiary under Federal law from purchasing a  firearm.   The program has a full due process system, and veterans can file an  appeal. This is an example of generating a controversy where there is  none.   The process of applying for disability benefits is entirely separate  from the processes by which veterans receive VA healthcare. The  Veterans Health Administration, which handles disability benefits, does  not take away veterans' firearms.   However, by implying that VA bureaucrats are going to take guns away  from veterans, this amendment not only does nothing to increase access  to care but its very introduction seeks to dissuade veterans from even  seeking healthcare that they have earned in the first place.   Moreover, this amendment deals with an authorizing issue and should  not be debated on an appropriations bill. This is policy, not funding.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the distinguished ranking  member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time  is remaining.    Madam Chair, let me make clear that the  Department of Veterans Affairs has robust due process policies and  regulations in place for incompetency determinations and remind our  colleagues that one of the three ways in which someone is denied an  opportunity to possess a firearm is when they have been declared  mentally incompetent.   There are very robust provisions in the processes at the VA to ensure  that there is due process in place. On top of that, the VA has the  ability to grant relief from disability in the event that clear and  convincing evidence is presented that affirmatively, substantially, and  specifically shows that the beneficiary is not likely to act in a  manner dangerous to the public and that granting relief will not be  contrary to the public interest.   That is the kind of safety measure that we want, to make sure that  when a veteran has been declared mentally incompetent, Madam Chair,  that they are not able to get access to a firearm.   Due process is important. Protecting the public and the individual is  important, as well.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I think it is important to make  clear that this debate is not about whether veterans in a State where  it is legal can get access to marijuana. It is not even about whether  doctors at the VA can communicate about those options with their  patients because they can. VA already does that. We allowed that  several years ago.   What it does do and what this debate is about is to ensure that  because marijuana is still an illegal substance under Federal law, if  we allow this amendment to pass, it would potentially put VA employees,  healthcare providers and other VA employees at risk of DEA enforcement  actions. That is not something that we can change with this amendment,  no matter how much you might want to have this amendment move forward.   While some States might have legalized marijuana for medical purposes  and allow physicians to prescribe it to patients, VA providers are  still subject to Federal enforcement actions through the Drug  Enforcement Administration. The VA has policies in place prohibiting  physicians from completing forms, not from communicating with their  patients, and they can't register veterans in a State medical marijuana  program themselves. However, veterans certainly can register themselves  to do that.    There is a concern that if legislation forced the VA to change or  stop enforcing its policies, as this amendment is proposing, in the  absence of systemic changes to Federal drug policy outside the VA that  providers could be at risk of penalties or other legal action.   The proper place for this discussion, Madam Chair, is in the  authorizing committee, which my colleague, the sponsor of the amendment  serves on. Have a discussion and a debate over policy to change the  Federal enforcement action risk that we would be placing VA employees  in if this amendment moved forward. Move it to the Commerce, Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee and prohibit  DEA enforcement action.   This debate is happening in the wrong bill on the wrong topic. I  oppose the amendment for that reason, while separately not opposing the  idea that there are legal ways that veterans are able to get access to  cannabis and marijuana. However, we do have to make sure we can  continue to allow VA employees to be protected from prosecution as a  result of the potential impact that this amendment would have.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the gentleman's amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment would prohibit the  enforcement of any COVID-19 mask mandates. However, the VA has already  relaxed mask mandates except in high-risk areas where patients could be  put in danger by someone who has a respiratory infection.   For example, the VA continues to require masks near chemotherapy  units, transplant units, and emergency rooms. In other words, this  amendment would override safety precautions put in place for the VA's  most at-risk patients.   It would block masking requirements near chemotherapy patients, whose  immune systems have been brutally weakened by treatments to fight  cancer. It would block masking requirements in the vicinity of surgery  patients, where a dangerous respiratory virus could be deadly. It would  block masking requirements near intensive care units filled with  patients with severe, life-threatening illnesses.   This amendment is reckless, and it would endanger the lives of our  most vulnerable patients at the VA. This amendment is not about a mask  mandate at the office, it is not about a mask mandate at the grocery  store. This amendment would block mask requirements at VA hospitals and  healthcare facilities. How ludicrous could anything be?                                time  1630    It is astonishing that the gentleman would suggest that, in a  hospital setting, around vulnerable individuals, particularly those  that are extremely vulnerable, that we would be prohibiting a hospital  from requiring people to wear masks so that people don't die of an  illness contracted as a result of being exposed to someone who might be  carrying germs that they are not aware of.   Our veterans have sacrificed so much for this country. It is our  responsibility to protect their health, not to risk their lives for a  political stunt.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close. I reserve  the balance my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Extreme MAGA Republicans are once again trying to prevent people-- trying to make sure that we have more people get sick rather than  fewer.  [[Page H4003]]    In a hospital setting, with medical experts, neither of whom have  spoken on this amendment today, it is imperative that we listen to  medical experts.   When you are in an intensive care unit, when you are receiving  chemotherapy, when you are in a medically risky situation, ensuring  that the people around you that come in from the outside don't get you  sick and potentially risk you severe illness and death, that is a  responsible medical policy.   What Republicans are proposing is to make sure that the VA can't keep  its patients safe. That is irresponsible, in the name of the extreme  MAGA opposition to doing anything to ensure that people don't get  COVID. The stunning irresponsibility is surprising, even for them.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Madam Chair, I really can't believe I have to  say this out loud, but vaccines have been essential in reducing the  severity of COVID.   I would note that VA's vaccine requirement currently applies  specifically to healthcare personnel, who are the people most in danger  of not only contracting, but spreading this disease, especially to the  vulnerable patients that VA serves, many of whom are at high risk for  the long-term effects of COVID.   Additionally, at its highest point during the pandemic, VA had over  15,000 staff unable to work due to either infection or exposure, with  over 9,000 of those clinical staff. That has a significant impact on  patient care, and I think we should all agree that no veteran should be  turned away from care because there wasn't a provider available to  treat them.   VA took extremely reasonable steps to protect its patients and its  workforce, and we shouldn't be tying VA's hands when it comes to  managing their workforce and pursuing workplace safety and protecting  its patients.   It was a responsible decision to limit the vaccine requirement to  care providers in clinical settings, and this amendment, if it passes,  will ensure that more VA employees get sick, more of their patients  will get sick, and there is a certainty that more people will die if we  don't ensure that VA employees who treat patients are vaccinated. That  is just common sense and should be understood based on the experience  of the time we all spent battling the pandemic.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I think it is important to point  out that it is not just healthcare providers that work in VA healthcare  facilities. Maintenance workers work in VA healthcare facilities and  interact with patients and they move back and forth throughout the  facility.   Cafeteria workers, other people who are not healthcare professionals  work in VA facilities in and around the most sensitive patients being  provided with care in the most intense healthcare environments. They  can infect people with COVID. They can infect healthcare providers who  work at the VA who interact with patients even more closely, and they  can infect patients directly.   It is a responsible policy to ensure that where there is a severely  ill patient or someone who is extremely vulnerable and has their  immunity lowered--as a breast cancer survivor, I can tell you that when  you go through chemotherapy, which I did not, but I have obviously  spent a lot of time on understanding what breast cancer patients and  people who go through chemotherapy experience, your immunity is knocked  out.   So we are going to prohibit people who work in VA healthcare  facilities from wearing masks to ensure that someone who has had their  immunity system knocked out from being protected from an individual who  might have COVID, while they are at work? That is grossly  irresponsible, and it would result, potentially, in people getting sick  and dying from something other than what they are being treated for at  the VA.                                time  1645    That is the height of irresponsibility, and I can't believe that our  friends on the other side of the aisle would be willing to risk the  life and health of VA patients with this irresponsible policy.   We have to make sure in a healthcare setting that people who interact  with patients in any way are protecting the patients from getting sick,  and that is why this amendment should be defeated.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, in March of this year, VA  announced it is updating its 1959 mission statement: ``To fulfill  President Lincoln's promise to care for those who have served in our  Nation's military and for their families, caregivers, and survivors,''  and that was a way to make VA a more inclusive and inviting place.   VA's previous mission statement read: ``To fulfill President  Lincoln's promise: `To care for him who shall have borne the battle,  and for his widow, and his orphan.' ''   The VA is a place where all veterans should feel welcomed, included,  and cared for, and the previous mission statement did not adequately  reflect the true veteran population. Only men were really reflected in  the statement.   Today, women are the fastest growing group of veterans, and it is  about time that we are reflected in VA's mission statement.   I am pleased the VA made this important and monumental change,  honoring the past by making sure that we continue to make reference to  President Lincoln's words and honoring the spirit of President  Lincoln's intent, but also making sure that we truly honor all of our  Nation's veterans, not just the men who have served our country.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment because  this is exclusionary, and we want to make sure that the VA continues to  be a more inclusive place and recognizes all veterans who serve, not  just those who are men.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I think it is important to point  out that the new motto still is reflective of President Lincoln's  beliefs, and his promise is one that was developed after surveying  veterans who receive care from the VA and their employees.   Perhaps we should listen to the veterans who are served by the VA and  the people who work with them every single day about the need for a  more inclusive motto. The more inclusive motto says, ``To fulfill  President Lincoln's promise to care for those who have served in our  Nation's military and for their families, caregivers, and survivors,''  making sure that the motto of the VA ensures that all patients who are  served there, all employees who work there, all the surviving families  who interact with the VA every single day understand that the motto  applies to them and the more outdated motto that dates back to  President Lincoln's time is no longer reflective of who is served at  the VA.   This is 2023. It is hard to imagine that we are actually debating a  motto on the floor of the House of Representatives and have a Member of  Congress suggesting that that motto should remain exclusive of women  instead of ensuring, as the motto voted on as a result of the surveys  of VA employees and VA patients, is more reflective of who the VA  treats today.   Madam Chair, I urge opposition to the gentleman's amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.   Despite the wildfires, smoke-covered skies, life-threatening heat  waves, and extreme weather we now face nearly every day in the United  States, this amendment would hamstring our ability to address the  accelerating threat of climate change.   The scientific consensus is clear, and we need to get serious about  preventing further damage by transitioning to clean energy sources  while also working to mitigate the costs we already bear today.   The Department of Defense has repeatedly recognized that climate  change is a direct threat to the U.S. military's readiness, mission  effectiveness, and resilience. From rising sea levels that can flood  coastal installations to more frequent extreme weather events that can  damage our military infrastructure, these climate-related effects put  our security at risk.   Don't take my word for it. Just look at the news. Just yesterday, the  news reported that the ocean temperature in south Florida was more than  100 degrees yesterday, 101.1 degrees to be specific, in Everglades  National Park in Manatee Bay.   Do you know what happens at temperatures like that? At temperatures  like that, we start seeing massive coral bleaching. Coral bleaching,  high temperatures, sea level rise are not someday things in Florida.  They are right now things.   In 2018, a Category 5 hurricane devastated Tyndall Air Force Base in  Florida, necessitating billions of dollars to repair and rebuild. We  can only mitigate against those costly scenarios if we can acknowledge  that the changing climate and increasing extremes we must adapt to are  real.   Further, climate change directly impacts the health of our most  vulnerable veterans. Increases in extreme heat, extreme weather events,  and disease pose a threat to those who have served, particularly those  who are older or who have preexisting conditions and those who have  respiratory conditions, which often older veterans do.   The policies targeted in this amendment provide a path to help us  future-proof our military, incorporate climate risk analysis into  military planning, enhance our energy security, address the health  effects of climate change, and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.   The gentleman from Texas might want to wish away or amend away global  warming and climate change and its effects, but that simply isn't  possible. This amendment would result in leaving our military woefully  unprepared and our Nation on a path toward climate catastrophe in  decades to come.   Madam Chair, I urge opposition to the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, it is astonishing to me that our  friends on the other side of the aisle are fossil fuel warriors. I  mean, that is what this is all about. This is about Big Oil and fossil  fuel supporters and making sure that the coffers continue to be filled.   It is absolutely irresponsible. It is essential that we make sure  that we are preparing and aggressively pursuing and making sure that we  can stave off and mitigate the effects of global warming and climate  change. These are not risks that are somewhere in the distant future.  They are happening right now.   Madam Chair, in my own district, in neighborhoods in south Florida,  during the king tides in particular, you have sunny day flooding  because the sea level rise is nearly unstoppable at this point. That is  costing us precious resources that we should be spending on other  quality-of-life issues. Yet, the gentleman's amendment would further  prevent us from being able to mitigate the effects of global warming  and climate change. It is dangerous.   In particular, as it relates to our military, it puts our national  security at risk and the health of our servicemembers at risk. We need  to make sure that we can continue to aggressively pursue protecting our  national security interests, which is why, on both sides, no matter who  is in charge of the Department of Defense, the Department continues to  pursue policies that will ensure that we can mitigate against global  warming and climate change. They understand the risk to our  servicemembers and to our safety.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.  [[Page H4007]]     Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  this amendment.    Madam Chair, this executive order is a whole- of-government approach for addressing climate change by reducing  greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to clean energy and  sustainable technologies. It ensures that we set responsible targets  for how we invest our Federal dollars to incentivize the private sector  to expand on these technologies, and it creates unionized jobs.   We cannot turn a blind eye to the extreme heat, flooding, and  wildfires across this Nation. We are seeing the impacts of climate  change in real time.   In south Florida, like I mentioned earlier, yesterday, we had a  101.1-degree registered temperature in the ocean around south Florida.   From California to Vermont and across Republican and Democratic  districts, if we want to leave our planet better for our children and  our grandchildren, then we must strategically invest in products that  improve energy and water efficiency, reduce emissions, and generate  clean energy.   We need a coordinated, governmentwide approach to ensure that there  is no duplication of effort or unnecessary red tape that  disincentivizes public-private partnerships. This amendment prevents  that.   The focus on elevating fossil fuels and thwarting the advancement of  clean energy will not help this Nation build a strong economy for the  future.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, at the appropriate time, I will  offer a motion to recommit this bill back to committee. If the House  rules permitted, I would have offered the motion with an important  amendment to this bill.   My amendment strikes section 258, which prohibits funding for  abortions and the implementation of the VA's interim final rule on  access to reproductive healthcare. My Republican colleagues want to  make abortion illegal nationwide.                                time  1715    Section 258 of this bill furthers that mission, putting women at risk  and making it harder for veterans to access healthcare. Let's ensure  that doesn't happen.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record the text of my amendment.        Ms. Wasserman Schultz of Florida moves to recommit the bill       H.R. 4366 to the Committee on Appropriations with the       following amendment:        Strike section 258.     Madam Chair, I hope my colleagues will join me  in voting for the motion to recommit, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at  the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
