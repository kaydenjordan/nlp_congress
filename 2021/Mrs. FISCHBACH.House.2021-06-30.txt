 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 503,  and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   There is no doubt that what transpired on January 6 was a dark day,  but instead of a good-faith effort to reach an objective conclusion,  Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have placed partisan, divisive  politics ahead of the interests of the American people.   Most fundamental to any objective investigation is being free from  political influence and partisan bias. Unfortunately, this resolution  fails to meet that basic benchmark, as Democrats refuse to put together  a truly bipartisan commission, with equal authority given to all  members, not just the majority.   It appears my colleagues are more interested in reaching the  predetermined outcome of their own narrative than truly investigating  the January 6 attack. The resolution itself is full of charged language  that implies an outcome.   In fact, two bipartisan committees in the Senate have already  conducted wide-ranging investigations and issued their joint report.  Their report, which is more than 100 pages, outlines a timeline of  events and a series of recommendations for moving forward.   The Architect of the Capitol has also already been given $10 million  to investigate the security failures on January 6. Why are we  replicating that work?   The Department of Justice and the FBI have already arrested and  charged more than 500 people for crimes ranging from disorderly conduct  to theft of government property to assaulting a Federal law enforcement  officer. Those individuals are being adjudicated by the courts as we  speak. That process will continue for some time. That is the way it  should work.   Instead, Democrats are injecting partisanship into the equation,  hoping to stretch out an investigation long enough to distract from  their abject failure to govern, while the American people are left to  suffer the consequences of that failure.   While we spend time discussing this partisan committee, American  farmers are facing a severe drought, gas prices are going up, inflation  is rising, businesses can't find employees, and there is a crisis at  the southern border. We need to spend our time finding solutions and  helping Americans, not creating partisan commissions to do work that  has already been done competently by the U.S. Senate and by law  enforcement.   Not only would this select committee not prohibit interfering with  ongoing law enforcement investigations that are already yielding  significant results, but it would lack the enforcement powers of those  existing investigations. Even worse, Speaker Pelosi would have the  ability to handpick the entirety of the committee.   If Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats were serious about this, they  might have considered acting sooner than 6 months after the fact. The  standing committees of this body already have the jurisdiction and the  authority to investigate January 6, and the Speaker could have directed  them to open an investigation at any time.   But perhaps most important is our obligation to the brave men and  women of law enforcement who responded to the Capitol and surrounding  areas on January 6, members of the U.S. Capitol Police, the D.C.  Metropolitan Police, the National Guard, and the many other State and  Federal agencies who assisted in restoring order. We owe it to them to  ensure that any investigation we undertake is one that is fair,  bipartisan, and honorable, absent the ulterior motives and partisan  politics that so often plague us.   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, H. Res. 503 falls far short. For that  reason,  [[Page H3326]]  I oppose the legislation, and I urge other Members to do so.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I will remind the gentleman from  Mississippi that it was not this body that stopped the commission. It  did not receive the required support from both sides of the aisle in  the Senate to move forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. The gentleman from Massachusetts continues talking about how  this select committee has been modeled after the Select Committee on  Benghazi, but ``modeled'' is a very loose term, given that this  committee obviously has a far more skewed ratio than the Benghazi  committee did.   In addition to that, this committee can all be appointed by the  Speaker. In her own words, she agreed that, yes, she could appoint them  all. In the Select Committee on Benghazi, there were recommendations  taken from the minority to the majority in order to appoint that  membership.   So to say that this has been modeled after Benghazi, maybe because  they have the name ``select committee,'' and that is the model they  use, but certainly the membership and the makeup of this is not the  bipartisan issue that it was on the Select Committee on Benghazi.   Madam Speaker, I have been listening to some of my colleagues on the  other side, and you would think that nothing is being done to  investigate the January 6 attack, and that is wrong.   In addition to the bipartisan Senate investigation that has already  been mentioned, numerous other investigations are under way by both law  enforcement and congressional bodies.                                time  1415    And as I have mentioned, we have already allocated $10 million for  the Architect of the Capitol to investigate what went wrong that day,  and law enforcement continues to conduct its investigation.   The majority ignores the fact that more than 500 individuals--which  has been mentioned several times--have been arrested or charged in  connection with the January 6 attack, and that investigation will  likely continue for some time.   Instead of ignoring legitimate investigations and launching one of  partisan politics, we ought to let the processes that are already  underway continue. If we don't, we risk undermining the work that is  already being done.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I wanted to comment a little on the  comments regarding the makeup of the select committee.   Madam Speaker, it is my understanding that when Speaker Pelosi was  asked if she could veto Republican picks for the select committee,  Speaker Pelosi responded: Yes, we will see who they nominate.   That opens the door for the committee's work to be corrupted even  before it begins, and she continues to have full control over the  members of that committee.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, our country is facing enormous challenges, but instead  of addressing those challenges, we are focused on duplicating work that  has already been done. And I have to repeat that. These investigations  have been done and are ongoing. And it appears as though this select  committee is being done purely for political purposes.   In early June, two Senate committees issued a joint report focusing  on ``security, planning, and response failures related to the violence  and unprecedented attack on January 6.''  [[Page H3329]]    That report was signed by Democrats and Republicans, and it included  a comprehensive audit of the security, intelligence, and authority  failures of that day. It also included substantive recommendations for  moving forward, including tangible action items that can be addressed  by this Congress.   But instead of working in tandem with our Senate counterparts,  Democrats want to politicize this issue even further. At a time when  the American people have little trust in the government, we need to be  working to restore that trust. Unfortunately, this kind of partisan  move will not advance that shared goal.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the bipartisan  Senate Homeland Security report.  Examining the U.S. Capitol Attack: A Review of the Security, Planning,                     and Response Failures on January 6       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs      U.S. Senator Gary Peters, Chair,      U.S. Senator Rob Portman, Ranking Member.      Committee on Rules and Administration      U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Chair,      U.S. Senator Roy Blunt, Ranking Member.                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY         On January 6, 2021, the world witnessed a violent and       unprecedented attack on the U.S. Capitol, the Vice President,       Members of Congress, and the democratic process. Rioters,       attempting to disrupt the Joint Session of Congress, broke       into the Capitol building, vandalized and stole property, and       ransacked offices. They attacked members of law enforcement       and threatened the safety and lives of our nation's elected       leaders. Tragically, seven individuals, including three law       enforcement officers, ultimately lost their lives.        Rioters were intent on disrupting the Joint Session, during       which Members of Congress were scheduled to perform their       constitutional obligation to count the electoral votes for       President and Vice President of the United States and       announce the official results of the 2020 election. Due to       the heroism of United States Capitol Police (``USCP'')       officers, along with their federal, state, and local law       enforcement partners, the rioters failed to prevent Congress       from fulfilling its constitutional duty. In the early hours       of January 7, the President of the Senate, Vice President       Pence, announced Joseph Biden and Kamala Harris as the       President-elect and Vice President-elect of the United       States.        This report addresses the security, planning, and response       failures of the entities directly responsible for Capitol       security--USCP and the Capitol Police Board, which is       comprised of the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms and the       Architect of the Capitol as voting members, and the USCP       Chief as a non-voting member--along with critical breakdowns       involving several federal agencies, particularly the Federal       Bureau of Investigation (``FBI''), Department of Homeland       Security (``DHS''), and Department of Defense (``DOD''). The       Committees also made a series of recommendations for the       Capitol Police Board, USCP, federal intelligence agencies,       DOD, and other Capital region law enforcement agencies to       address the intelligence and security failures.        The Committees' investigation uncovered a number of       intelligence and security failures leading up to and on       January 6 that allowed for the breach of the Capitol. These       breakdowns ranged from federal intelligence agencies failing       to warn of a potential for violence to a lack of planning and       preparation by USCP and law enforcement leadership.        The federal Intelligence Community--led by FBI and DHS--did       not issue a threat assessment warning of potential violence       targeting the Capitol on January 6. Law enforcement entities,       including USCP, largely rely on FBI and DHS to assess and       communicate homeland security threats. Throughout 2020, the       FBI and DHS disseminated written documents detailing the       potential for increased violent extremist activity at lawful       protests and targeting of law enforcement and government       facilities and personnel. Despite online calls for violence       at the Capitol, neither the FBI nor DHS issued a threat       assessment or intelligence bulletin warning law enforcement       entities in the National Capital Region of the potential for       violence. FBI and DHS officials stressed the difficulty in       discerning constitutionally protected free speech versus       actionable, credible threats of violence. In testimony before       the Committees, officials from both FBI and DHS acknowledged       that the Intelligence Community needs to improve its handling       and dissemination of threat information from social media and       online message boards.        USCP's intelligence components failed to convey the full       scope of threat information they possessed. Although USCP       mainly relies on the FBI and DHS for intelligence and threat       information, USCP has three components responsible for       intelligence-related activities. These components, and the       materials they produce, are supposed to inform USCP's       security and operational planning. This, however, was not the       case for January 6.  [[Page H3331]]         USCP's lead intelligence component--the Intelligence and       Interagency Coordination Division (``IICD'')--was aware of       the potential for violence in the days and weeks ahead of       January 6. It received information from a variety of sources       about threats of violence focused on the Joint Session and       the Capitol Complex and the large crowds expected to gather       in Washington, D.C. on January 6. Yet, IICD failed to fully       incorporate this information into all of its internal       assessments about January 6 and the Joint Session. As a       result, critical information regarding threats of violence       was not shared with USCP's own officers and other law       enforcement partners.        USCP's preparations for the Joint Session also suffered       because of the decentralized nature of its intelligence       components. On January 5, an employee in a separate USCP       intelligence-related component received information from the       FBI's Norfolk Field Office regarding online discussions of       violence directed at Congress, including that protestors were       coming to Congress ``prepared for war.'' This report, similar       to other information received by IICD, was never distributed       to IICD or USCP leadership before January 6.        USCP was not adequately prepared to prevent or respond to       the January 6 security threats, which contributed to the       breach of the Capitol. Steven Sund, the USCP Chief on January       6, and Yogananda Pittman, who was designated as Acting Chief       after Steven Sund announced his resignation on January 7,       both attributed the breach of the Capitol to intelligence       failures across the federal government. USCP leadership,       however, also failed to prepare a department-wide operational       plan for the Joint Session. Similarly, USCP leadership did       not develop a comprehensive staffing plan for the Joint       Session detailing, among other things, where officers would       be located. USCP could not provide the Committees any       documents showing where officers were located at the start of       the attack and how that changed throughout the attack.        USCP leadership also failed to provide front-line officers       with effective protective equipment or training. Although       USCP activated seven specialty Civil Disturbance Unit       (``CDU'') platoons in advance of the Joint Session, only four       of those platoons were outfitted with special protective       equipment, including helmets, hardened plastic armor, and       shields. The many other USCP officers who fought to defend       the Capitol were left to do so in their daily uniforms. Many       of those front-line officers had not received training in       basic civil disturbance tactics since their initial Recruit       Officer Class training. While some CDU officers were issued       special protective equipment, the platoons were not       authorized to wear the equipment at the beginning of their       shifts. Instead, USCP staged equipment on buses near the       Capitol. In at least one instance, when the platoon attempted       to retrieve the equipment, the bus was locked, leaving the       platoon without access to this critical equipment. USCP also       failed to provide equipment training to support the CDU       platoons and did not authorize CDU platoons to use all       available less-than-lethal munitions, which could have       enhanced officers' ability to push back rioters.        These operational failures were exacerbated by leadership's       failure to clearly communicate during the attack. USCP       leadership gathered in a command center, blocks away from the       Capitol building. Two incident commanders identified as       responsible for relaying information to front-line officers       were forced to engage with rioters during the attack, making       it difficult for them to relay information. As a result,       communications were chaotic, sporadic, and, according to many       front-line officers, non-existent.        Opaque processes and a lack of emergency authority delayed       requests for National Guard assistance. The USCP Chief has no       unilateral authority to request assistance from the National       Guard; the USCP Chief must submit a request for assistance to       the Capitol Police Board for approval. Steven Sund never       submitted a formal request to the Capitol Police Board for       National Guard support in advance of January 6. Instead,       Steven Sund had informal conversations with the House       Sergeant at Arms, Paul Irving, and the Senate Sergeant at       Arms, Michael Stenger, regarding the potential need for       National Guard support. No one ever discussed the possibility       of National Guard support with the Architect of the Capitol,       the third voting member of the Capitol Police Board.        The members of the Capitol Police Board who were in charge       on January 6 did not appear to be fully familiar with the       statutory and regulatory requirements for requesting National       Guard support, which contributed to the delay in deploying       the National Guard to the Capitol. In their testimony before       the Committees, Paul Irving and Steven Sund offered different       accounts of when Steven Sund first requested National Guard       assistance during the attack. Phone records reveal a number       of conversations between Steven Sund and Paul Irving on       January 6. However, because there is no transcription of the       conversations, there is no way for the Committees to       determine when the request was made. National Guard       assistance was delayed while Steven Sund attempted to contact       the Capitol Police Board members and obtain the required       approvals. Regardless of what time the request was made, the       need to await Capitol Police Board approval during an       emergency hindered the ability to request District of       Columbia National Guard (``DCNG'') assistance quickly.        The intelligence failures, coupled with the Capitol Police       Board's failure to request National Guard assistance prior to       January 6, meant DCNG was not activated, staged, and prepared       to quickly respond to an attack on the Capitol. As the attack       unfolded, DOD required time to approve the request and       gather, equip, and instruct its personnel on the mission,       which resulted in additional delays. Prior to January 6, USCP       informed DOD officials on two separate occasions that it was       not seeking DCNG assistance for the Joint Session of       Congress. The D.C. government, by contrast, did request       unarmed troops for traffic support, and on January 6, 154       unarmed DCNG personnel were staged at traffic control points       throughout the city. As the attack unfolded, USCP and the       Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia       (``MPD'') both pleaded with DOD officials for immediate       assistance. DOD officials claimed they received a       ``workable'' request for assistance from USCP at       approximately 2:30 p.m. The request was presented to the       Acting Secretary of Defense and approved at approximately       3:00 p.m. For the next ninety minutes, DOD officials ordered       DCNG personnel to return to the Armory, obtain necessary       gear, and prepare for deployment as leaders quickly prepared       a mission plan. Miscommunication and confusion during       response preparations, demonstrated by conflicting records       about who authorized deployment and at what time, contributed       to the delayed deployment. DCNG began arriving at the Capitol       Complex at 5:20 p.m.--nearly three hours after DOD received       USCP's request for assistance and more than four hours after       the barriers at the Capitol were first breached.      The Committees' Recommendations        Based on the findings of the investigation, the Committees       identified a number of recommendations to address the       intelligence and security failures leading up to and on       January 6. Recommendations specific to the Capitol Complex       include empowering the USCP Chief to request assistance from       the DCNG in emergency situations and passing legislation to       clarify the statutes governing requests for assistance from       executive agencies and departments in nonemergency       situations. To address the preparedness of the USCP, the       Committees recommend improvements to training, equipment,       intelligence collection, and operational planning.        The Committees further recommend intelligence agencies       review and evaluate criteria for issuing and communicating       intelligence assessments and the establishment of standing       ``concept of operation'' scenarios and contingency plans to       improve DOD and DCNG response to civil disturbance and       terrorism incidents. These scenarios and plans should detail       what level of DOD or DCNG assistance may be required, what       equipment would be needed for responding personnel, and the       plan for command-and-control during the response.      The Committees' Investigation        Two days after the January 6 attack, the Senate Committee       on Rules and Administration and Senate Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs Committee announced a joint bipartisan       oversight investigation to examine the intelligence and       security failures that led to the attack. On February 23,       2021, the Committees held the first public oversight hearing       on the attack. The hearing, entitled Examining the January 6       Attack on the U.S. Capitol, featured testimony from the USCP       Chief, House Sergeant at Arms, and Senate Sergeant at Arms in       charge on January 6. The Committees also heard testimony from       the Acting Chief of MPD. One week later, on March 3, 2021,       the Committees held a second oversight hearing, which       included witnesses from DOD, DCNG, FBI, and DHS.        As part of their investigation, the Committees reviewed       thousands of documents. The Committees also received written       statements from more than 50 USCP officers about their       experiences. In addition, the Committees interviewed numerous       current and former officials from USCP, Senate Sergeant at       Arms, House Sergeant at Arms, Architect of the Capitol, FBI,       DHS, MPD, DOD, and DCNG. Most entities cooperated with the       Committees' requests. There were notable exceptions, however:       the Department of Justice and DHS have yet to fully comply       with the Committees' requests for information, the Office of       the House of Representatives Sergeant at Arms did not comply       with the Committees' information requests, and a USCP Deputy       Chief of Police declined to be interviewed by the Committees.       The Committees will continue to pursue responses from those       who have failed to fully comply. The oversight of events       related to January 6, including intelligence and security       failures, will continue.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I know we do live in a highly polarized time, but  despite the partisanship that so often plagues the House of  Representatives, there is no reason this select committee should not be  wholly bipartisan. In fact, that is what the American people demand.   Unfortunately, the resolution ensures that bipartisanship will not  happen. The result will be a divided report focused more on a narrative  than a solution, and that is why I asked that we  [[Page H3332]]  submit that Senate report as part of the Record.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup).    Madam Speaker, that is it.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   Madam Speaker, I oppose H. Res. 503. The events of January 6 were  tragic in so many ways and certainly demand a real investigation, but  bipartisan investigations have already taken place in the Senate, and  law enforcement also continues to investigate.   We all share the concern for what happened here in Washington, D.C.,  on that day, and it can never happen again. But unless Democrats  abandon their desires for a predetermined outcome, we are doing the  American people a disservice.   Moving forward and making sure that it never happens again requires a  fully bipartisan solution, not a partisan committee rigged from the  start. This resolution is rife with partisan politics at its worst.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to oppose H. Res. 503, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
