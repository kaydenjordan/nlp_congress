 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 729,  the Coastal and Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act.   As we have heard today, this bill helps communities like mine on the  central coast of California prepare for and respond to climate change,  and it does this with scientific data to address coastal and ocean  management.   More importantly, this bill establishes the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration's Digital Coast program, a web-based  collection of tools, training resources, and data that informs coastal  managers on their climate-related decisions.   Now, my amendment will expand that data set, and it will do that by  encouraging collaborations and partnerships between higher educational  institutions and Federal agencies.   Now, in my district, there are coastal colleges and universities that  are pursuing cutting-edge research focused on coastal resilience. At  the same time, there are Federal agencies like NOAA that are doing  innovative work on this very same topic.   My amendment will ensure that there is communication, coordination,  and collaboration between academic scholars and the policymakers when  it comes to digital data focused on coastal management issues. This  will not only improve the relevance and applicability of our Nation's  efforts to protect coastal communities, but it will help our Nation  gather the evidence it needs and continue being the leader it needs to  be when it comes to mitigation and adaptation in dealing with climate  change.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
