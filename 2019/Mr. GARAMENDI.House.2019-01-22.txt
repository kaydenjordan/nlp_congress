 Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to, once again, ponder  the inevitable: that the government of the United States is important  in this world; that the strongest country in the entire world ought to  have the strongest operating government; that all across this globe  people once looked to America as the symbol of leadership, as the  symbol of opportunity, as the country where things got done, and a  government that functioned, sort of functioned. We have had our ups and  downs, but really the United States was always a symbol that other  countries would point to and say: Well, there is a democracy. It has  its ups and downs, but it has worked. It has been a place where we  could look to for leadership.   We are now 32 days into the shutdown of the government of the most  important country in the world.   What in the world is our President thinking? What is going on here?  How did we come to this situation?   Before we get into all of the harm that is being done by this  government shutdown, let's understand how we got here.   Every January, early February, the administration--the President-- puts forward his proposed budget for the coming year. The House and the  Senate take that under submission and begin the process of preparing  the appropriations and the laws, the changes to enact, or not enact,  the proposals that the President has put forth.                                time  1930    In that submission, President Trump proposed $1.6 billion for border  security. The House looked at it, the Senate looked at it, and,  ultimately, the Senate passed an appropriation of $1.6 billion.   Unfortunately, that appropriation was caught up in other debates and  other arguments, and the Department of Homeland Security that was  supposed to receive the $1.6 billion, together with the Department of  the Interior, the EPA, Department of Transportation, Department of  Justice, and several other agencies, was not funded for the whole year  but, rather, funded from October 1 until the following Thanksgiving.   Then an additional CR, continuing resolution, was passed until  December 11, and that $1.6 billion was part of that discussion. On  December 10, maybe December 11, the Senate unanimously passed another  continuing resolution that had $1.6 billion in it, and that continuing  resolution was to go until February 8.   The next morning, when that bill arrived over here in the House of  Representatives to be taken up and to pass through to keep the  government open until February, in the intervening 13 hours, something  happened. The President changed his mind and said, not $1.6 billion. He  demanded $5 billion. And in a conference at the White House with the  leaders, he said: ``If we don't get what we want . . . I am proud to  shut down the government . . . I will take the mantle. . . . ''   So on that morning of the 11th, the House of Representatives amended  the bill and said, nope, it is not $1.6 billion. It is $5 billion,  because that is what the President wanted, and the government shut  down.   I thank the President. At the very last moment, he changed the game:  not $1.6 billion, which we were prepared to accept and keep the  government open, but $5 billion, and the government shut.   In the intervening days, as the debate went on, the $5 billion grew  to $5.7 billion for a border wall.   Now, don't misunderstand. Changes during the course of a year are  common, and it is common for the administration to make a change in its  budget. That is called a budget change proposal.   It comes to the Congress, the House and the Senate, with all of the  reasons--a big stack of paper--all of the reasons why the change should  take place: some new; something happened and we have got to deal with  it; or, we need more money for this. And a budget change proposal comes  to us with all of the justification.  [[Page H985]]    To this day, 32 days into this shutdown, Congress has not received a  formal budget change proposal, nor has Congress received any detail  about where the $5.7 billion wall will be built--somewhere on the  Mexican-American border. That is 1,900 miles.   Will it be used to repair fences?   Will it be added in some areas?   What are the reasons why it would be added?   None of that has been provided here. So here we are 32 days into it,  and the most important government in this world is shut down.   This border wall is supposed to bring security to America. Wow, wait  a minute. You are talking about security? You are talking about safety?  You are talking about making the lives of America more secure? How do  you do that when the government is shut down?   All of the military is working. Thank God that appropriation passed.  But the Department of Homeland Security is not, except for those  frontline officers who are considered to be essential. All of the  backroom operation isn't operating.   The Coast Guard is out there on the water, in the ports, but those  men and women are not being paid, 40,000 of them, a few more, not being  paid. Many of them cannot pay for gas to get to their jobs.   TSA is operating, but the rest of that backroom operation is not.  Transportation is not operating. The parks are closed. The Smithsonian  is closed. The kind of safety that the American public depends upon  from its government is not operating.   There were headlines a week ago about the President somehow being  compromised by Russia. What would be the best that Putin could ever  want?   You go to war to take over a government, to shut down a government.  You don't have to go to war to shut down the American Government. You  go to the President, who gladly says that he is proud to shut down the  American Government.   Putin has to be incredibly happy that his nemesis, America, the  government is shut down.   I have got a lot to talk about tonight, and joining me are some of my  colleagues who will be talking about the effect of the shutdown in  their area.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa), my  colleague and dear friend of many years.    Mr. Speaker, I believe so.    Over and over.    Mr. Speaker, if I might, I say to Mr. Costa that is  exactly what he did. In the negotiations, before inviting the leaders  in, agreement had been reached with both Houses. We were going to move  forward. The President changed his mind, demanded $5 billion, and took  credit. He said: I will shut the government down, and I will take  credit for it.   Indeed, the credit goes to him.   The gentleman said things that are very interesting. The gentleman  went back to the Gingrich shutdown. That reminded me, at that time, I  was actually at the Department of the Interior. There was nobody in the  Department of the Interior except three of us in that entire department  who were working.   Then there was the Ted Cruz shutdown, and then there were two other  short shutdowns having to do with one or the other of the fiscal  cliffs. In every case, our Republican colleagues--Gingrich, Ted Cruz,  other leadership, and now the President--have used the American  Government as a hostage to get something that they wanted. Senator Cruz  wanted to kill the Affordable Care Act. I don't recall, but I think  Gingrich was over some tax issues or some financial issues, fiscal  issues. But in every case, they used the government as the hostage.   Now, over in the Senate, Senate Majority Leader McConnell is cobbling  together a piece of legislation that would affect the rest of  Americans.   Let me just show you some things here. He is taking a piece of  legislation that we passed last week--it was the supplemental Disaster  Relief Act to provide additional money. In this case, this is Paradise,  California, where some 18,000 homes were destroyed and 87 people  killed. The President was there, together with Governor Brown and our  new Governor, Mr. Newsom. It is a supplemental disaster recovery  program that we passed last week. It is over in the Senate.   I understand that Senator McConnell is going to take that bill and  literally hold not just Paradise, California, but also Puerto Rico.   Does the gentleman remember the hurricane in Puerto Rico?    Mr. Speaker, he intends to hold Puerto Rico hostage,  along with South Carolina; Houston, Texas; and southern California, the  Ventura area, all of which have incurred a natural disaster and, in  this case, a dam breaking in Puerto Rico.   In the case of Paradise, California--the great fire that occurred  there and the wipeout of a community of 30,000 people--it is now being  held hostage for the border wall. So not only do we have the U.S.  Government hostage--and the American economy with 800,000 employees who  are not getting paid--we are now using the supplemental disaster  recovery, some $12 billion that would go to recover these communities  that have been wiped out that are now being held hostage.   So the gentleman said earlier that there is something immoral about  this, that to use people's lives and their ability to recover, their  ability to sustain their family, to get a paycheck, to work for the  American Government to keep this economy moving, to be held hostage  somehow is terribly, terribly wrong. But that is what the President is  doing. And, apparently, that is what Senator McConnell wants to do with  this new bill that he intends to introduce that would hold the disaster  recovery program hostage for a $5.7 billion wall somewhere on the  border, undefined. Something is terribly, terribly wrong here.   Now, there is an alternative, and I think Mr. Costa mentioned it. We  passed legislation repeatedly beginning on January 3, the first day of  the new Congress, and every day thereafter. I think it is about 8 days  now that we passed legislation to open the government. That is, the new  Democratic majority has done that to open the government. All of those  bills are over on the Senate side.   There is a clean bill that is also open for discussion on the Senate  side this week. It is the bill that we passed last week. It would fund  the government at the appropriations level that the Senate agreed to,  $1.6 billion for border security and all the other programs all worked  out in a great compromise. That bill passed the House last week. It is  sitting over in the Senate.   There would be one exception to full funding for the remainder of  this year--that is until September 30--and that is the Department of  Homeland Security, which controls the border. That would be a temporary  continuing resolution until February. I think it is the 28th of  February.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Costa mentioned the Subway sandwich  shop. When I was back in my district over the weekend, I was contacted  by a small company operating in Davis, California, that has technology  that the TSA would employ at the airports to keep us all safer. They  will go out of business. They have 13 employees. Their contract is  sitting, not finished. They are not getting paid for past work that  they have done. They just said: We don't know how we will continue  here.   It is a good program. It is necessary for security at the airports.  That is just one example.   The gentleman mentioned the farmers. I have farmers in my district  with the same problem. I have universities with research contracts that  are being held up. All of that is being held up.   The reality is that the most important government of the world is not  operating. When they say it is just 25 percent, that is 25 percent of  the money. It happens to be 80 to 85 percent of the activities of the  government.    And the ripple effect all the way through.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so very much for  joining us and bringing to our attention the issues in his district, as  well as his experience.   The final words that he has said ring in my ears, and I am sure they  ring in the ears of people around this world who are looking at the  United States and saying: What is going on there? What is this all  about?   There is much, much more to say. I will go through a couple things  very, very quickly here.   There are 800,000 government employees across the Nation--in  California, there are 37,542--who are not being paid but still working.  They are furloughed, and they are wondering how they will meet their  mortgages and how they will meet their bills.                                time  2000    We also know that this shutdown is approaching the 1-month mark. And  very, very soon, if we don't act and we don't get this government back  up and working, there are 45,714,688 people in the United States who  will lose their SNAP benefits--these are the food stamps--in other  words, their ability to have food on their tables--45,714,000 people.   The day of reckoning for these people is coming very soon. The exact  day is not exactly known, but it is toward the end of this month or the  first weeks of February. So let's keep in mind those 45 million people  who depend upon food stamps.   In my own district, just upstream from the district is the Oroville  Dam, which came close to collapsing and put at risk nearly 200,000  people downstream from it. Part of the disaster recovery is to shore up  the levees downstream from the Oroville Dam, but that is now being used  as a hostage by Senator McConnell.   It is unconscionable what is going on here in America, and it is not  necessary.   Democrats have always supported border security--always supported  border security--and we have supported walls along the border. In 2006,  almost 700 miles of border fencing and walls were built. In California,  in the Tijuana-San Diego border area, those walls have been there for  nearly 30 years, maybe even longer than that.   The point here is border security is more than a wall, and if the  President wants a wall, he needs to tell us where and why.   Why is it more important than upgrading the ports of entry, as Mr.  Costa talked about, where we know 80 to 90 percent of the drugs come  through the ports of entry, the legal ports of entry? One out of five  cars is checked; four are not.   The containers, the trains, the planes, the ships all coming through  legal ports of entry, but we don't have the technology to check all of  them, nor do we have the operations to be able to check all of the  cars, all of the planes, all of the containers. So the drugs come in-- even through the post office.   Wouldn't it be wise that we spend money where 80 to 90 percent of the  drugs enter the United States? It is not in a bunch of children  carrying backpacks who are bringing drugs into the United States. That  is not where the problem is. The problem is at the ports of entry.   Mr. President, you have the authority and you have the budget today,  the appropriation today, to fill 3,000 positions that have remained  unfilled for more than a year, positions at the ports of entry, U.S.  Customs and Border Patrol positions--3,000. Why are they not filled? If  there is such an emergency, why are you not out hiring?   You were given $1.2 billion a year ago to enhance the border  security. Less than 20 percent of that money has been spent. Why? Why?   If we have a national emergency, why are you not hiring the necessary  people who are authorized? Why have you not spent the money that was  appropriated previously?   Why did you shut down the American Government for an ill-defined  border wall that seems, in the minds of most of us, to simply be a  fulfillment of a campaign pledge? What is that all about?   What is going through your mind that you ignore things that we know  create security: better devices to observe what is going on, unmanned  aerial vehicles to observe what is happening, sensing devices to know  what is in those containers, men and women to conduct the inspections,  all of those things? Why are you not doing it? Why?   Why, Mr. President, did you say that, unless you get your way, you  are going to shut down the American Government; in your own words, you  will take the mantle of the shutdown? In so doing, you created a real  serious national security threat. Yes, you did.   You shut down the government, and, in doing so, you have created a  real--a real--national security threat.  [[Page H988]]                              Honoring Harris Wofford, Jr.     Mr. Speaker, before I terminate this, I want to change  subjects.   A very, very dear friend died, and I want to bring to the attention  of the House Harris Wofford.   Harris Llewellyn Wofford, Jr., was born in New York City on April 9,  1926. At the age of 11, he had the opportunity to travel around the  world with his grandmother, in 1938. He experienced many defining  events during that time, including what was going on in Italy with  Benito Mussolini and in Germany with Hitler, the Japanese aggression in  Shanghai, and Gandhi's movement in India.   His passion for creating change and fighting for progress began in  earnest during those years. As the civil rights movement began, Mr.  Wofford quickly became a fervent supporter of Reverend Martin Luther  King, Jr., whom we remembered yesterday.   He marched alongside Reverend King for civil rights and voting rights  in Selma. And during John F. Kennedy's campaign for President, Mr.  Wofford played a key role in Kennedy's efforts that freed Reverend King  from prison, a move that galvanized the civil rights movement and  helped carry President Kennedy to the White House a year later.   Following that election, he served as President Kennedy's special  assistant for civil rights and later served as the head of two  colleges. And during his time with the Kennedy administration, he  helped launch the Peace Corps, which my wife and I joined shortly  thereafter; and that inspired Patti and me as we served 2 years in  Ethiopia.   In 1991, Mr. Wofford became Pennsylvania's first Democratic Senator  in more than 20 years, unseating the former Republican Governor and  U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.   As Senator, he led the effort that established the community service  program, AmeriCorps. My wife, Patti, had the opportunity to work with  Mr. Wofford as they, together, created the AmeriCorps program in the  1990s.   In 2008, he introduced then-Senator Barack Obama before his defining  ``A More Perfect Union'' speech that is often credited as the origin of  Obama's successful campaign for President.    In 1995, Mr. Wofford left the Senate and began serving as the chief  executive at AmeriCorps, where my wife was able to work with him.   In a 2005 speech commemorating the work of French philosopher  Teilhard de Chardin, Mr. Wofford, in considering the impact of the  invention of nuclear weapons during World War II, said this: `` . . .  the burning question, above all other questions in the political world,  is: How do we crack the atom of civic power and start a chain reaction  of constructive force to do for peace what man has shown can be done  for war? You may say that is the old question that vexed the 20th  century in its occasional search for the moral equivalent of war. For  the 21st century, let's accept Teilhard's challenge and set out to  discover the moral and political equivalent of fire.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record all of Mr. Wofford's speech on  that day, April 11, 2005.                 [From the Woodstock Forum, Apr. 11, 2005]      The Global Legacy of Teilhard de Chardin--Georgetown University                            (By Harris Wofford)         It's a special honor to participate in this 50th       Anniversary commemoration of Teilhard's death--but really       this is much more a celebration of his birth, his new birth       that came to pass after his death when his words began to be       published and spring to public life.        I would have been here earlier today listening and learning       but for our family's memorial service in Philadelphia this       morning for my 96-year-old stepmother, who died this week.       Phyllis Taylor Wofford was the first woman Minister of the       Riverside Church of New York, ordained at age 50 in 1959,       just as Teilhard's books were spreading around the world.        Remembering our many discussions in the 43 years since she       married my father and reading her sermons and poems this       weekend, I know she was a reader of Teilhard--and I think he       would have liked one of her most recurring metaphors that she       attributes to her mentor, the great preacher Harry Emerson       Fosdick: The Sunset of Spirit that people fear as death.       ``Sunset,'' she believed, ``is only our limited human way of       looking at things. Nothing has happened to the sun.''        You can say that about Teilhard. The limited human way of       looking at his writings led to perhaps the greatest       intellectual mistake made by the Church since Galileo. The       earth does move around the sun, and the sunlight of Teilhard       is still there for us, even if he did not live to see it       shine on the world during his lifetime.        Teilhard would have understood what my mother the       Congregational minister meant when she said in her ordination       statement that her studies at Union Theological Seminary       started ``an adventure in faith'': ``Doors which had been       closed opened and beyond them were tremendous vistas.'' She       said that ``All the little scattered fragments of existence       as I know it were at last caught up and knit together in one       comprehensible whole.''        In the late 1950's that is what seemed to be happening to       me, in a more amateur fashion, as my heart leaped up when I       first started to read Teilhard. I was ready for Teilhard--for       his vision that knit together in one comprehensible whole,       not only a view of the world and human destiny but a view of       the ever-expanding universe of universes--the existence we       are all trying to comprehend. Before there was anything of       Teilhard's to read, I had committed my mind and heart to his       proposition: ``The Age of Nations is past. The task before us       now, if we would not perish, is to build the Earth.''        At age 12, in the spring of 1938, while Teilhard was in       China or briefly back in France, I was looting Shanghai.       Literally looting. Except for the international quarter       protected by the French and British forces and the United       States Marines, Shanghai had been bombed almost out of       existence, and then occupied by the Japanese army. They sold       looting permits to tourists and my grandmother and I were       driven into the deserted Chinese city to the roofless remains       of a teahouse. I went in to find some loot. Other tourists       came out with china, silver and works of art. To my       grandmother's dismay, I emerged with a 4-foot stuffed       ostrich--which later I tossed overboard when we sailed into       Yokohama harbor.        That six-month trip around the world on the eve of World       War II is no doubt what led to my later readiness for       Teilhard. It sparked a lasting love affair with the world--      with the Earth, Teilhard would say--and a deep-seated sense       that the world is truly our stage and the frame in which all       the burning questions of our time must be seen.        I returned to 7th grade as an ardent interventionist; a       presumptuous, know-it-all, politically active boy who wanted       America to join the war to stop Hitler and the Japanese       militarists from conquering the world.        After Pearl Harbor, before entering the Army Air Corps, I       started what grew into the nation-wide Student Federalist       organization that became an enthusiastic part of the campaign       for a union of democracies to win the war and be a nucleus of       a post-war world federation with power to keep the peace.        When the United Nations was established without the power       to control the atomic bomb we campaigned to strengthen it and       to establish nuclear control backed by a world police force.       But by then the Cold War was closing in, and the vision       without which we thought people would perish became distant       and dim.        Then came Teilhard's books, one by one, re-lighting the       vision of world unity in the broader context of the Human       Phenomenon--and of a Divine Milieu. To our realistic       discouragement from the vicious circle of international power       politics, he offered a different possibility: ``the       passionate concern for our common destiny which draws the       thinking part of life ever further onward. The only truly       natural and real human unity is the spirit of the Earth.''       This ``sense of the Earth'', he prophesied, would become       ``the irresistible pressure which will come at the right       moment to unite humanity in a common passion.''        And as a scientist, he spoke to the skeptics: ``To the       common sense of the `man in the street' and even to a certain       philosophy of the world to which nothing is possible save       what has always been, perspectives such as these will seem       highly improbable. But to a mind become familiar with the       fantastic dimensions of the universe they will, on the       contrary, seem quite natural, because they are simply       proportionate with the astronomical immensities.''        One last personal account of Teilhard's impact. In the       presidential campaign of 1960 and for years afterward, I had       the privilege of working with Sargent Shriver, the most       creative social inventor of the 20th century and a lover of       the words of Teilhard. A brother-in-law of President Kennedy,       Shriver organized the Peace Corps and later led President       Johnson's War on Poverty, along the way launching the       domestic Peace Corps, the Volunteers in Service to America       (VISTA), the forerunner of AmeriCorps; the Job Corps: Foster       Grandparents, Community Action agencies, and Legal Services       for the Poor. On nights when we worked late I often found       myself staying in Shriver's suite at the Mayflower Hotel or       in some hotel while traveling to other countries. Each night       before he turned out the lights he would read in his bed for       a while, usually a book of spiritual import. Often it would       be Teilhard de Chardin and the next morning he would talk       about it on the way to an early mass.        Then in the Presidential campaign of 1972, after George       McGovern asked Shriver to become his running mate, I was       helping Sarge work on his acceptance address. As we were due       to leave and the police motorcade was revving up, he was       still unsatisfied with its ending. ``I know how to end it,''       he said, ``It's Teilhard de Chardin! I'm going to find the       quote on a plaque in a pile upstairs.'' We  [[Page H989]]       physically tried to stop him but he bounded out and in two       minutes, came back with the plaque. He ended the address with       these words of Teilhard that brought the delegates to their       feet:        ``The day will come when, after harnessing the winds, the       tides and gravitation, we shall harness for God the energies       of Love. And on that day, for the second time in the history       of the world, man will have discovered fire.''        No one on that day is likely to have forgotten the fire       with which Shriver said that word ``fire''. Teilhard's       watchwords became the theme of his Vice Presidential campaign       and recurred again when he ran for the Democratic       presidential nomination in 1976. And Sargent Shriver       practiced what Teilhard preached, as he went on to help his       wife Eunice and son Tim spread Special Olympics to the far       corners of the world.        Let me note that those and many other words of Teilhard       played a significant part in my own little journey from the       Angelican Episcopal Church of my father to the wider Catholic       Church centered in Rome (as the world well-observed this week       of the Pope's funeral)--the church of Teilhard and the       Society of Jesus. As an advocate of civil disobedience of the       Gandhian and Martin Luther King kind on fundamental matters       of conscience I should confess that I find it hard to fathom       the faith it took for Teilhard to accept the silencing of his       most important thoughts. But we can respect his agonizing       decision to choose what he may have viewed as ``divine       obedience.''        What does Teilhard's vision say to politics today--and to       the burning questions of our times? To the world-wide       poverty, including the poverty of spirit? To the epidemics       sweeping Africa and other places that seem to be behind God's       back? To the maybe a billion children who are not learning to       read and go to sleep hungry at night? To all those suffering       violence in the streets or in their homes, from crime or       terrorism or war?        Teilhard's vision tells us to do everything in our power to       find the ways and means to harness the energies of love in       order to end as soon as possible the scandal that such       conditions exist anywhere in the world. This requires We the       People of this earth to do in the political world what       wartime America did with the physical atom; to win the war       scientists, backed by all the necessary resources of our       society, worked with fierce urgency to produce the quantum       leap and chain reaction that put in man's mortal hands the       power to end human life on earth.        Therefore, the burning question, above all other questions       in the political world, is: How do we crack the atom of civic       power and start a chain reaction of constructive force to do       for peace what man has shown can be done for war. You may say       that is the old question that vexed the 20th century in its       occasional search for the moral equivalent of war. For the       21st century, let's accept Teilhard's challenge and set out       to discover the moral and political equivalent of fire.        This Woodstock Forum's other question: What is Teilhard's       literary legacy? is not a burning one, but it brings to mind       Gertrude Stein's explanation for her famous line: ``A rose is       a rose is a rose.'' When Gertrude was asked what in the world       was the reason for such repetition, she said that for       thousands of years poets have been writing about roses, so       often and so sentimentally that the rose had lost its       redness. Her intent, she said, was to restore redness to the       rose.        Teilhard was a far better poet than Gertrude Stein, but as       I've been re-reading him after many years, it seems to me       that his most repeated metaphor, which he delivered in a       hundred different ways, is indeed Fire--the fire that will       blaze forth when we do discover how to harness for God and       for all human beings the power of love, and achieve the unity       of man that Teilhard foresaw.        The poet in Teilhard, I think, is seeking, in politics as       in science, philosophy and religion, to restore to the       ancient idea of creative fire the energy, heat and light that       our divided world so sorely needs. So we can hope the sparks       that Teilhard's words sent out will catch fire in the dry       tinder of these times.        ``The world is very different now,'' John Kennedy began in       stating the first proposition of his Inaugural Address. ``For       man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms       of human poverty and all forms of human life.'' To follow       that proposition where it leads, we can do no better than to       lift our sights to the perspective and the passionate concern       for our common human destiny that pervades the writings of       Teilhard de Chardin. But we let's not leave it to hope, to       time, or to Teilhard to discover this fire, ``knowing,'' as       Kennedy said in closing his summons to a New Frontier, ``that       here on earth God's work must truly be our own.''     Mr. Speaker, it is with considerable sorrow that Patti  and I bid farewell to a very dear friend and an incredible leader who  spent his life fighting for justice, civil justice, civil rights, and  world peace.   Harris Llewellyn Wofford Jr. was born in New York City on April 9,  1926 and grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. with his 2 younger siblings.  Growing up in an upper-middle class family, at age 11 he had the  opportunity to travel the world with his grandmother in 1938. During  this formative trip, he experienced many of the defining events of that  time including Benito Mussolini speaking about the League of Nations,  the results of Japanese aggression in Shanghai and the movement of  Mohandas Ghandi in India.   His passion for creating change and fighting for progress began in  earnest. After his return to the United States, he quickly established  the first chapter of the Student Federalists, which would later become  a central pillar of what is now Citizens for Global Solutions. After  serving in the Army Airforce, he graduated from the University of  Chicago in 1948 and married his fellow student Clare Lindgren.   As the civil rights movement began, Mr. Wofford quickly became a  fervent supporter of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. He marched alongside  Rev. King for civil and voting rights in Selma and, during John F.  Kennedy's campaign for President, Mr. Wofford played a key role in  Kennedy's efforts that freed Rev. King from prison--a move that  galvanized the civil rights movement and helped to carry President  Kennedy to the White House later that year.   Following the election, he served as President Kennedy's special  assistant for civil rights and later served as the head of 2 colleges.  During his time with the Kennedy administration, he helped to launch  the Peace Corp, which helped to inspire me to enter the realm of public  service as one of the first Peace Corp officers serving in Ethiopia.   In 1991, Harris became Pennsylvania's first Democratic Senator in  more that 20 years, by unseating the former Republican governor and  U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. As Senator he led the effort  that established the community service program, AmeriCorp and in 2008  introduce then-Senator Barack Obama before his defining ``A More  Perfect Union Speech'' that is often credited as the origin of Obama's  successful campaign for President.   In 1995, he left the Senate and began serving as Chief Executive at  AmeriCorp. Harris Wofford, a Democratic Senator from Pennsylvania, a  university president and a defining colleague of President John F.  Kennedy died yesterday on the Federal Holiday commemorating the work  and vision of Martin Luther King, a vision that as a lifelong champion  of civil rights he shared. He was 92.   In a 2005 speech commemorating the work of French philosopher  Teilhard de Chardin, Mr. Wofford in considering the impact of the  invention of nuclear weapons during World War II said this:   ``. . . the burning question, above all other questions in the  political world, is: how do we crack the atom of civic power and start  a chain reaction of constructive force to do for peace what man has  shown can be done with war. You may say that is the old question that  vexed the 20th century in its occasional search for the moral  equivalent of war. For the 21st century, let's accept Teilhard's  challenge and set out to discover the moral political equivalent of  fire.''   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to talk about the  necessity of reopening our government, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
