 Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Women's  History Month to recognize the extraordinary achievements of past  generations of women, and to pay tribute to the vital role they have  played in the political, economic, and social development of this  nation.   Women's History Month provides a special opportunity to reflect upon  women's countless accomplishments that touch all aspects of our  society--from government, to business, the arts and sciences, the  military and much more. I look upon the courage our predecessors  displayed with great admiration, and I continue to be inspired by those  who blazed the trail for women like me.   In December of this past year, I was incredibly proud to see the  Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act, which I co-led with Senator  Susan Collins, enacted into law. This law will create a long overdue,  permanent museum to collect, study, and create programs that celebrate  women's experiences and contributions.   However, the last year also brought with it the loss of a number of  pioneering women, including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, NASA  mathematician Katherine Johnson, and the brave Civil Rights Movement  champion Lucille Bridges. Though these icons are no longer with us,  their contributions will live on and their accomplishments have  shattered glass ceilings for future generations of women. May we honor  their work and memory with a commitment to elevate and support future  women leaders.   This past election year marked a new high water mark for women in  politics, as more women ran for and were elected to office in 2020 than  ever before. Of the many notable wins, I was overjoyed to see my friend  and former Senate colleague, Vice President Kamala Harris, elected to  the nation's second-highest office. The election of more women to  places of power is crucial for our continued progress.   I am eager to work with Vice President Harris and the 144 women  serving in Congress in 2021 to address the challenges before us.   One of our first priorities must be to address the ongoing pandemic,  which  [[Page S1654]]  has had devastating consequences for the health of our country and  economy. The pandemic has also uniquely harmed women and girls-- especially women of color. A disproportionate number of women have lost  their jobs as a result of the pandemic, and are often unable to  maintain work commitments with children learning from home while  schools are closed. As far as we have come, this unequal harm borne by  women during the pandemic reminds us of the work toward equality that  is yet to be done. We must continue our work to ensure fairness and  equity for women everywhere.   As we undertake to celebrate Women's History Month, I ask my  colleagues to celebrate with me how far we have come and to continue  the fight for the progress of all women--especially those who are  struggling during these trying times.   Thank you Mr. President and I yield the floor.                            ____________________
