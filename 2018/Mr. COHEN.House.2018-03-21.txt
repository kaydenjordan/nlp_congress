 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, I addressed this House on the  issue of Mr. Mueller and his important investigation in the Special  Counsel's Office.   I am concerned, as we leave on Thursday or Friday, that the President  could fire Mr. Rosenstein--who has authority over Mr. Mueller--or fire  Mr. Sessions and put somebody in who will jeopardize Mr. Mueller's  investigation.   Accordingly, a bill I have, H.R. 4669, was filed in December to  protect Mr. Mueller. It gives him due process rights--if he is fired-- to go to court before a three-judge Federal panel to show that he was  fired for purposes which were political and not relating to his job  performance.   I am filing a discharge petition today. I will be filing it in 10  minutes, asking all Members of the House to sign it; to bring this bill  to the floor immediately for a vote so that we can protect the special  counsel, protect Mr. Mueller, and protect America.   God Bless America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Would it be appropriate to announce to the House that  there is a discharge petition at the desk for H.R. 4669 to give Mr.  Mueller due process rights in case he is fired for other than good  cause?
