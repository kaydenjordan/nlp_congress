 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to thank the Lord  Jesus Christ, my constituents, and my colleagues for your thoughts and  prayers and tender mercies that you have showed my family over these  last trying months.   I am here today to report to you that prayer works. As of yesterday,  our daughter's cancer is in remission.   Mr. Speaker, I will never forget the kindness shown to me by both  sides of this aisle, and I humbly remain your servant.                            ____________________
