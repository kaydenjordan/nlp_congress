 Mr. President, Oregon is mourning a Portland treasure,  Dave Frishberg, who passed away on November 17.   While perhaps best known for writing the song ``I'm Just a Bill'' for  the iconic Schoolhouse Rock television series, Dave was also a virtuoso  pianist with a songwriting gift that reached far beyond his work for  that classic series. During his career, Dave worked with a wide array  of talented musicians, including Rosemary Clooney, Gene Krupa, and Zoot  Sims. A versatile composer, his compositions ranged from melancholy  ballads to satirical ditties, and his wry wit was well known as one of  the sharpest in the business.   Dave has left an indelible mark not only on Capitol Hill, where one  frequently sees references to ``I'm Just A Bill'' on floor charts and  in press releases, but also in the minds of generations of young  Americans lucky enough to grow up watching Schoolhouse Rock with the  lyrics still etched in their memories decades later.   David Lee Frishberg was born on March 23, 1933, in Saint Paul, MN. He  took an early interest in jazz, bebop, and boogie woogie as a teen,  while playing as a house musician in Saint Paul. Noting in his memoir,  ``Jazz musicians were hip, they were funny, they were sensitive, they  were clannish, and they seemed to have the best girlfriends.'' In 1957,  Dave moved to New York City, where he established himself as a pianist  in the vibrant music scene of Greenwich Village. While in New York, he  wrote and performed other well-known songs such as ``My Attorney  Bernie'' and ``Peel Me a Grape.'' He moved to Los Angeles in 1971,  where he earned acclaim in the jazz and comedy scenes through his work  with Schoolhouse Rock and his ``Dave Frishberg Songbook'' series. An  unassuming vocalist with a reedy voice, Frishberg was nominated four  times during his career for Grammy awards, all for Best Jazz Vocals.   Dave, who called Portland his home for the past 35 years and is  survived by his wife April Magnusson and two sons from a previous  marriage, inspired millions of schoolchildren and music lovers across  Oregon and the entire country. He will be greatly missed, even as his  legacy lives on for generations to come.                            ____________________
