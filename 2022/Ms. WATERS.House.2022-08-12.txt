 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the very long and  difficult negotiations that have taken place following the Build Back  Better Act, led by President Biden and the Democrats. I applaud all the  beneficiaries of the reconciliation bill in what is now the Inflation  Reduction Act.   This act includes historic climate change legislation. It will lower  prescription drug costs, reduce the cost of Medicare, and, hopefully,  force major corporations to pay their fair share of taxes.   However, as chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, I have  worked with members of my committee and many Members of Congress to  confront the housing crisis in this country. We organized a request for  $150 billion in the Build Back Better Act, which included rental  assistance with Section 8 vouchers, development of more affordable  housing units, support for first-generation home buyers, repairs to fix  deteriorating public housing, and fair housing enforcement to eliminate  discrimination and unlawful evictions.   However, there is not one nickel, not one dime, not one dollar, for  the development of housing in this bill. We can no longer afford to  have housing as an afterthought, a ``nice to have,'' or simply  something that can wait until later. It is foundational to the  prosperity of families, key to a healthy economy, and crucial to  fighting inflation.   Yes, I am disappointed. I am going to vote for this bill because so  many people are going to benefit in different ways, but I am  disappointed that housing does not show up anywhere in this  legislation.
