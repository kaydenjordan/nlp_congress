 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Dr. Joshua  Feldstein, president emeritus of Delaware Valley University, who passed  away on June 19 at the age of 97.   Born in Lithuania and raised in Belarus, Dr. Feldstein was the very  embodiment of the American Dream. After fleeing Nazi persecution, Dr.  Feldstein arrived in Bucks County, where he eventually received degrees  in horticulture and agricultural mechanics before earning a doctorate  at Rutgers University.   Dr. Feldstein's legacy is one of diversity and expanding civil  rights. In the 1960s, he played a significant role in the university's  admission of women, and upon taking the helm as president in 1975, he  oversaw the expansion of women faculty members.   More than anything, Dr. Feldstein was a man of kindness and good  faith who relentlessly sought to open doors and brighten futures for  the students who attended the school he cared so deeply about.   I send my condolences to Dr. Feldstein's sons, Ted and Dan, along  with the rest of his family and the entire DelVal community. May they  take comfort in knowing his life was one extraordinarily well lived.   Congratulations to 2018 Graduates of Bucks County Technical High School     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2018  graduates of Bucks County Technical High School, who graduated last  week.   Watched by over 1,000 family members and friends, the nearly 300  graduates walked across the aisle at the CURE Insurance Arena to  receive their diplomas.   I am proud to report that this impressive class earned approximately  $1.2 million in scholarships, and 72 percent of the class is moving on  to continue their education.   I would especially like to recognize the students who have decided to  join the Armed Services, and I speak on behalf of all of us in Bucks  County when I say we appreciate your dedication to service and passion  for keeping America safe.   I also applaud Principal Robert Azar and Administrative Director Dr.  Leon Poeske for their work in molding the minds of the next generation.   I wish the 2018 graduates of Bucks County Technical High School and  all of those who are graduating this year the best of luck in their  next chapters. I encourage them to use their skills to strive to make  our communities a better place.                                time  1015                           Recognizing Irene Molloy     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  constituent,  [[Page H5653]]  Irene Molloy, for her artistic accomplishments both in Hollywood and in  our home of Bucks County, Pennsylvania.   This week, Irene will begin a new path in her illustrious career, as  she will make her debut as director of the Bucks County Center for  Performing Arts' rendition of ``The Fantasticks.'' This production of  the 1960s musical will take place at Delaware Valley University in  Doylestown Township.   A native of Chalfont and a graduate of Archbishop Wood Catholic High  School, Irene had worked both on Broadway and in Los Angeles before  founding the firm Radiant Bloom Productions.   I applaud Irene for using her artistic talents to make Bucks County a  more vibrant place.   I would also like to recognize Howard Perloff of Carversville, the  founder and artistic director of the Bucks County Center for the  Performing Arts for his contributions to our community and those where  he has produced a multitude of plays over a decades-long career.                            ____________________
