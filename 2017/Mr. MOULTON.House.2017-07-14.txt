 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and the ranking member  for including this amendment in the en  [[Page H5845]]  bloc package, because I remain concerned about the lack of a clear plan  or strategy in Syria.   As the Syrian opposition supported by U.S. and coalition forces fight  to liberate Raqqa from ISIS control, we are confronted with the complex  and critical question of what comes next. Freeing Syrians from the  brutality of ISIS is but one part of a complex, grinding civil war that  began with the Assad regime's heinous violence against civilians and  has endured for over 6 years, with over 400,000 Syrians killed, 6  billion Syrians displaced within Syria, and over 4.5 million forced to  flee as refugees.   We now have over 500 U.S. troops deployed to Syria to advise and  assist Syrian opposition forces. However, we have yet to have a clear,  comprehensive political strategy that describes what the end goals are  for U.S. involvement and how we hope to achieve those goals.   This amendment requires just that, and follows a similar effort I led  with General and Representative John Bacon on Iraq that received  bipartisan support in the Armed Services Committee last year.   This amendment requires a comprehensive political and military  strategy for U.S. policy in Syria to be submitted by the Departments of  Defense and State to Congress and the American people within 90 days of  enactment.   We owe it to our troops, those young men and women whom we ask to  risk their lives in Syria today, to tell them what their job is, what  it entails, what the end goal is, and why it is worth the risks that  they take every single day.
