 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for his  extraordinary efforts.   Twenty-five years ago, NAFTA passed over strong opposition, with  serious flaws.   At the beginning of this Congress, we were given a bill by the  administration that didn't address those problems. It didn't have the  votes to pass and it didn't deserve to pass.   I am proud of the work with our chairman; with our working group; the  Speaker, who periodically invested huge amounts of time to keep it on  track; and, of course, Ambassador Lighthizer, who was a great partner  working with us.   We are voting today on an agreement that has fundamentally been  rewritten and strengthened.   A personal priority for me was stripping unnecessary and harmful  special provisions for Big Pharma. We have strengthened labor  protections and enforcement. These are game changers. The help of AFL- CIO President Richard Trumka and, again, the Speaker were invaluable.   We have had environmental improvements. My colleague from Oregon,  Suzanne Bonamici, deserves great praise for being tenacious on that. We  will attack the raw sewage many of us saw flowing into the Pacific in  Tijuana.   We finally have come to an agreement that can and should be passed.   I appreciate the hard work of all our colleagues, and hope that this  is a foundation that we can move forward on to deal with challenges we  have with a global economy with the same spirit of cooperation and  innovation.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's hard work  on this.   This is the largest transfer of wealth in American history with the  tax bill of the Republicans. They kept the tax break for corporations  and they are hitting middle class families in my district. Four in ten  average about $15,000 a year.   But one of the things we haven't talked about is the hit to home  values.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article by Allan Sloan in  Fortune magazine that talks about Trump's trillion dollar hit to  homeowners.                 Trump's Trillion-Dollar Hit to Homeowners         By reducing deductions for real estate taxes, Trump's 2017       tax plan has harmed millions--and helped give corporations a       $680 billion gift.                              (by Allan Sloan)         In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has been talking       about plans for, as he put it, a ``very substantial tax cut       for middle income folks who work so hard.'' But before       Congress embarks on a new tax measure, people should consider       one of the largely unexamined effects of the last tax bill,       which Trump promised would help the middle class: Would you       believe it has inflicted a trillion dollars of damage on       homeowners--many of them middle class--throughout the       country?        That massive number is the reduction in home values caused       by the 2017 tax law that capped federal deductions for state       and local real estate and income taxes at $10,000 a year and       also eliminated some mortgage interest deductions. The impact       varies widely across different areas. Counties with high home       prices and high real estate taxes and where homeowners have       big mortgages are suffering the biggest hit, as you'd expect,       given the larger value of the lost tax deductions. But as       we'll see, homeowners all over the country are feeling the       effects.        I'm basing my analysis on numbers from two well-respected       people: Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics;       and Hugh Lamle, the retired president of M.D. Sass, a Wall       Street investment management company.        Zandi's numbers are broad--macro-math, as it were. Lamle       (pronounced LAM-lee) is a master of micro-math. It was Lamle       who first got me thinking about home value losses by sending       me an economic model that he created to show the damage       inflicted on high-end, high-bracket taxpayers in high-tax       areas who paid seven digits or more for their homes.        Lamle starts with the premise that homebuyers have       typically figured out how much house they can afford by       calculating how much they can spend on a down payment and       monthly mortgage payment, adjusting the latter by the amount       they'd save via the tax deduction for mortgage interest and       real estate taxes. His model figures out how much prices       would have to drop for the same monthly payment to cover a       given house now that this notional buyer can't take advantage       of the real estate tax deduction and might not be able to       take full advantage of the mortgage interest deduction.        After I showed Lamle's model to my ProPublica research       partner, Doris Burke, she steered me to Zandi's research,       which I realized could be used to calculate national value-      loss numbers.        Ready? Here we go. The broad picture first, then the       specific. This gets a little complicated, so please bear with       me.        Zandi says that because of the 2017 tax law, U.S. house       prices overall are about 4% lower than they'd otherwise be.       The next question is how many dollars of lost home value that       4% translates into. That isn't so hard to figure out if you       get your hands on the right numbers.        Let me show you.        The Federal Reserve Board says that as of March 31, U.S.       home values totaled about $26.1 trillion. Apply Zandi's 4%       number to that, and you end up with a $1.04 trillion setback       for the nation's home owners. That's right--a trillion, with       a T.        Please note that Zandi isn't saying that house prices have       fallen by an average of 4%. That hasn't happened. What he's       saying is that on average, house prices are about 4% lower       than they'd otherwise be.        Given that the Fed statistics show that homeowners' equity       was $15.76 trillion as of March 31, Zandi's numbers imply       that homeowners' equity is down about 6.6% from where it       would otherwise be. (That's the $1.04 trillion value loss       divided by the $15.76 trillion of equity.)        This is a very big deal to families whose biggest financial       asset is the equity they have in their homes. And there are       untold millions of families in that situation.        While Zandi and I were having the first of several phone       conversations, he sent me a  [[Page H12276]]       county-by-county list of the estimated home-price damage done       to about 3,000 counties throughout the country. I was       fascinated--and appalled--to see that the biggest estimated       value loss in percentage terms, 11.3%, was in Essex County,       New Jersey, the New York City suburb where I live.        In case you're interested--or just snoopy--the four other       counties that make up the five biggest-losers list are:       Westchester County, New York, suburban New York City, 11.1%;       Union County, New Jersey, which is adjacent to Essex County,       11.0%; New York County, the New York City borough of       Manhattan, 10.4%; and Lake County, Illinois, suburban       Chicago, 9.9%.        You can find Zandi's county-by-county list in our Data       Store. Eyeball the list, and you'll see that counties       throughout the country have home values lower than they would       otherwise be.        Here's how it works. Zandi took what financial techies call       the ``present value'' of the property tax and mortgage       interest deductions that homeowners will lose over seven       years (the average duration of a mortgage) because of changes       in the tax law and subtracted it from the value of the       typical house. That results in a 3% decline in national home       values below what they would otherwise be.        The remaining one percentage point of value shrinkage,       Zandi says, comes from the higher interest rates that he says       will result from higher federal budget deficits caused by the       tax bill. He estimates that rates on 10-year Treasury notes,       a key benchmark for mortgage rates, will be 0.2% higher than       they would otherwise be, which in turn will make mortgage       rates 0.2% higher.        Even though interest rates on 10-year Treasury notes are at       or near record lows as I write this, they would be even lower       if the Treasury were borrowing less than it's currently       borrowing to cover the higher federal budget deficits caused       by Trump's tax bill.        If Zandi's interest-rate take is correct--it's true by       definition, if you believe in the law of supply and demand--      even homeowners who aren't affected by the inability to       deduct all their real estate taxes and mortgage interest       costs are affected by the tax bill.        How so? Because higher interest rates for buyers translate       into lower prices for sellers and therefore produce lower       values for owners.        You can argue, as some people do, that real estate taxes       should never have been deductible because allowing that       deduction is bad economic policy that inflated home prices       and favored higher-income people over lower-income people.        But even if you believe that, there's no question that       eliminating the deduction for millions of homeowners       inflicted serious financial damage on homeowners who had no       warning that a major tax deduction that they were used to       getting would be wiped out.        As a result, homebuyers who had taken the value of the real       estate tax deduction into account when buying their homes had       their home values and finances whacked without warning.       Interest deductions on mortgage borrowings exceeding $750,000       were cut back, compared with interest deductions on up to $1       million under the old law--but that doesn't affect anywhere       near as many people as the cap on real estate tax deductions       does.        (A brief aside: Among the modest winners here are first-      time buyers who purchased their homes after the tax law took       effect and benefited by paying less than they would have paid       under the old tax rules.)        Now, to the micro-math.        Lamle's model isn't applicable to most people because it       works only for taxpayers with a household income of at least       $200,000 a year who paid at least $1 million for their homes.       But the principle underlying Lamle's model applies to       everyone who owns a home or is interested in owning one. To       wit: You calculate the tax-law-caused loss of value by       figuring out how much a house's price needs to fall for       buyers' or owners' after-tax costs to be the same now as they       were before the tax law changed.         ``People buying large-ticket items typically focus on       after-tax costs of ownership,'' Lamle told me. ``The amount       that many buyers can afford is affected by limits on their       financial resources. Therefore, as their tax costs increase       substantially because of the loss of tax deductions, they       have less money available to pay for homes and to take on       mortgage debt.''        At the suggestion of one of my editors, I asked Lamle to       use a modified version of his economic model to estimate the       tax law's impact on the value of a theoretical house in the       New York City suburb of West Orange, New Jersey, purchased       for $800,000 in 2017 by a theoretical family with a $250,000       annual income. Those home value and income numbers are very       high by national standards--but middle class by the standards       of large parts of suburban Essex County.        Real estate tax on that theoretical house would run about       $28,900 a year, according to statistics from the New Jersey       state treasurer's office. That tax used to be fully       deductible for federal tax purposes. Now, it's not deductible       at all if you assume that the house's owners are taking the       standard deduction on their federal returns. Or that even if       they're itemizing deductions, they're paying at least $10,000       of state income taxes, which means they don't get any benefit       from deducting property taxes.        According to Lamle's calculations, this inability to deduct       real estate tax has reduced the home's value by $138,720,       assuming a 5% mortgage rate. At a 4% rate, the value loss is       $173,400. (For the math and assumptions underlying these       numbers, see his methodology below.) So if the family put up       $200,000--25% of the purchase price--to buy the house, more       than half of that investment has been wiped out.        Obviously, it's impossible to prove that Zandi and Lamle       are right about the impact they say the tax law is having       (and will continue to have) on home prices, because there's       no way to gauge the accuracy of their numbers. But the logic       is compelling.        The loss in home values is crucial because it turns out       that lots more people have bigger financial stakes in their       houses than in their stock portfolios, which have thrived as       the Trump tax law turbocharged corporate earnings and stock       prices.        In fact, 73.5% of households that own homes, stocks or both       had bigger stakes in the home market than in the stock       market, according to David Rasnick, an economist at the       Center for Economic and Policy Research, who parsed Federal       Reserve data at my request.        Now, let's put things in perspective, set aside home value       losses for a minute and talk about the cash that people are       getting from Trump's 2017 tax law. It isn't all that much for       most families. Households' average federal income tax has       fallen by $1,260 a year, according to the Tax Policy Center.       That average is skewed by big savings realized by people with       big incomes; the median family's tax cut is only about half       as much as the average cut, by the Tax Policy Center's math.        This means that--for taxpayers of higher income and more       modest income--the income tax savings are likely small beer       compared with the hidden loss inflicted on many of them by       lower house values.        Back to the main event. And some final--but important--      numbers.        According to the Tax Policy Center, the Treasury will get       $620 billion of additional revenue over a 10-year period       because people can't deduct their full state and local taxes.        That, in turn, covers most of the 10-year, $680 billion       cost of the income tax break that corporations are getting.       So you can make a case that my friends and neighbors and co-      workers in New York and New Jersey--and many of you all over       the country--are paying more federal income tax in order to       help corporations pay less federal income tax.        That, my friends, is the bottom line.     By denying the full SALT deduction, you are making it  more expensive to buy homes, you are having a lower resale value, it is  a loss of net worth, plus there is about a 1 percent hit because of the  higher interest rates that are going to come because your tax bill of  $2 trillion is on the collar.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to look at this to see  how pervasive the hit is, not just to their income tax, but to their  most precious asset, their home value.
