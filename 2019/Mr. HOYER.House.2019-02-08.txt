 Mr. Chairman, my fellow colleagues, I rise with great  sadness to announce the passing of one of this House's great and good  Members, former Representative John David Dingell, Jr., who served in  this House for almost a full six decades. His father preceded him for  22 years, and his wife, our beloved colleague, Debbie Dingell, serves  now.   At the request of his beloved wife, I have the sad task of informing  the House that John died yesterday after a long, distinguished, and  committed career of service to community, to this House, and to his  country.   John served with honor in wartime and with distinction in this House.  He worked for the advancement of his fellow veterans and their care and  benefits in peacetime, and he fought all of his life for fairness and  opportunity for all. He defended vigorously the working men and women  of the auto industry and working families everywhere.   His wit, his humor brought smiles to our faces, and his fearless  questions of witnesses in committee brought grimaces to those who  believed they had undermined the safety and health of our citizens.   Much will be said. I know that each of you have your own memory of  Chairman Dingell. I know that each of you will want to rise at some  point in time over the next number of days to give your observations of  this colleague with whom we were honored to serve.   Let us begin our remembrances of him, however, by celebrating the  love that he had for this great institution about which he cared so  deeply. He believed its powers to be: improving people's lives and  delivering on the promises of those who came before us and to those who  will come after us.   May John's legacy guide us forward as we seek to make this House all  he believed it could be and all he did to make it so better than it  might have been.   I now yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the  distinguished Speaker of the House of Representatives.    Mr. Chair, I thank the Speaker for her retelling, very  briefly, the extraordinary record of our friend and colleague, John  Dingell, who made America better, who made this House better, and who  believed that in doing so, it was critically important to reach across  the aisle, to have legislation that would enjoy the support of both  sides of the aisle.   In that regard, I am blessed now to yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the Republican leader and my friend.    Mr. Chair, I thank the majority leader for his remarks.    Mr. Chair, the spirit of John Dingell was so present in  that remark.   Now, John Dingell apparently was not always right. He wanted to  repeal the Senate, but then he wanted to replace it.   Mr. Chair, John Dingell, I will tell you, I was with him Wednesday  from approximately 4 p.m. on Wednesday until 6:30 p.m., and Debbie was  there. Your dad was there, Andy, our dear colleague. Sandy Levin was  there and John Orlando, who served with John on the Energy and Commerce  Committee for such a great time. He remembered all of you. He asked me  to give each of you his best, to wish you well, and to say that our  country needs each of us to work together.   Would that we could leave just some of the legacy that John Dingell  has left behind. We are so blessed that we have the opportunity to  serve with his wife, his beloved wife, his lovely Deborah. What an  extraordinary relationship, what an extraordinary man. How lucky we  were and are to serve with them.   The Speaker will be shortly notifying us of when the funeral will be,  opportunities to go to the funeral. There will be a memorial service as  well, here, and probably a service in the Capitol as well. So there  will be opportunities for each of us to stand and testify to the  greatness and goodness of John David Dingell, Jr.   Mr. Chair, I ask all the Members of Congress and all the ladies and  gentlemen in the gallery to join us in a moment of silence in  remembrance of our friend John Dingell.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend Mr. Scalise, the  Republican whip, for his comments. It is a testimony to the love and  respect that John Dingell enjoyed in this House from both sides of the  aisle.   As I said earlier, Madam Speaker, there is no one in this House who  doesn't have a particular story about John Dingell. So, before we begin  this colloquy, I want to again express my gratitude for the life and  service of my friend John Dingell.   Madam Speaker, I was with him Wednesday. He died yesterday. I was  with him the day before he died. We sat together for 2\1/2\ hours and  talked. As I left, I leaned down and I kissed him on the forehead, and  I said: ``I love you, John.''   I think I was speaking for, literally, scores of Members who worked  with him on the committee, who worked with him on the floor, and who  saw him in various different venues as a colleague.                                time  1145    They loved him as well for his integrity and for his fairness. And,  yes, as the gentleman from Louisiana said, he could be tough, and he  could be rough, but he also could be gentle and accepting and open.   All of us in this country were blessed by his time on this Earth, so  much of  [[Page H1483]]  which he gave back to the rest of us in the form of service in the  Armed Forces and in this House and in his community.   History will remember him as its longest serving Member of the House  of Representatives, but we who knew him well remember John Dingell as a  man of extraordinary character, intellect, courage, and purpose.   From healthcare to the environment, from workers' rights to veterans'  care, John worked tirelessly over six decades in the House to make sure  Congress was doing right by the people who the House represents. His  legislative record of achievement speaks volumes about who it was he  believed he was fighting for every day in office.   Medicare, Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, Clean Air Act, Safe  Drinking Water Act, Endangered Species Act, all of these bore his  imprint. What an extraordinary record of service and accomplishment.  And that is because he was a champion of affordable healthcare,  equality under the law, the right to vote, economic opportunity, and a  healthy future for our children and grandchildren.   To his beloved Michigan, he was an indefatigable defender of  autoworkers and their role in the American economy.   John was steadfast in his belief that the best way to serve them and  all his constituents was to work, whenever possible, in concert with  those across the aisle and not against them.   We are, after all, all Americans. We serve Americans. We serve a  great country. He believed in Congress, and, oh, how he believed in his  country. He believed in sitting down together and working through our  differences in a way that was respectful and civil.   Madam Speaker, I hope that spirit and his example will imbue in us a  resolve to find compromise in these challenging times. John, as  everybody knows, followed his father into service--22 years of service.   In 1955, in December, his father passed away, and John was sent by  the voters to continue the service of the Dingell family. John Dingell,  Sr., was a major proponent of New Deal legislation in this House,  serving from 1933 to 1955.   John was followed in service here by the ``lovely Deborah,'' as he so  affectionately and lovingly called her. His wife is an extraordinary  Member of Congress herself, and we are blessed to have her. Debbie is  an extraordinary woman, an outstanding Member of the Congress of the  United States.   We stood in a moment of silence just a few minutes ago. I hope that  we will adjourn in his honor today.   Debbie has been carrying on the Dingell legacy of seeking bipartisan  results while remaining steadfast to the progressive values that  brought her into public service.   I offer, Madam Speaker, my condolences, as I do to John's children  and grandchildren and to their entire extended family.   I thank the minority whip for his comments and expression, which  demonstrates what we have all said. John Dingell was, of course, a  Democrat, but John Dingell was more than that, by far. He was an  American and a fierce promoter of the people's House and the work that  was done by all the Members of the people's House, so I thank my  friend.   Madam Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning- hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed  until 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m.  for morning-hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business,  with last votes expected no later than 3 p.m.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A  complete list of suspensions will be available by the close of business  today.   The House will also consider H.J. Res. 37, a war powers resolution on  U.S. involvement in Yemen. This legislation will force a much-needed  conversation about how to bring to an end the violence and the  humanitarian crisis that we see in Yemen.   In addition, Madam Speaker, the House is expected to consider the  conference report that finishes fiscal year 2019 appropriations. I  understand that progress is being made, and I am hopeful--I am  hopeful--and optimistic that we can have a deal that comes together  early next week. Members are advised that additional legislative items  are possible.   Let me simply say that Members ought to know that there is a  possibility as well, given the death of our colleague, John Dingell,  and the desire of so many to attend his funeral, that the schedule may  be modified to accommodate that effort and that travel to Michigan.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question. I  am not a member of the conference committee.   He quoted me in what I said. We are for border security. I am hopeful  that the conference committee reports out a bill that all sides can  support that does, in fact, try to make our borders more secure. I look  forward to having that bill, hopefully, on the floor next week prior to  the 15th or on the 15th, so we can: A, ensure that the government is  not shut down; and, B, ensure that we have a bipartisan agreement on  how we can make our borders more secure.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the question. As  the gentleman knows, this bill was introduced in the last Congress in  which the Republicans, his party, were in charge of the House and the  Senate and the Presidency, and it did not pass the Congress and go to  the President.   We will pursue the regular order. This bill, like every other bill,  will be referred to committee, and the committee will handle its  consideration as the committee sees fit.   The gentleman has talked about, or there has been discussion about, a  discharge petition that is obviously available. We were trying very  hard to have people we call Dreamers allowed to stay in the only  country they know. Unfortunately, the leadership was against that  discharge petition, and it never got to the floor.   For many bills that either side may want, some come to the floor,  some don't. But this will go through the regular process, and it is  going to be referred to the committee of jurisdiction. We will see how  that proceeds.    My answer, however, is the same to the gentleman, Madam  Speaker. We have a process. The bill has just been introduced. It will  be referred to committee, and the committee will have it under regular  order to consider. I cannot predict what the committee will do with  that bill, but I understand the gentleman's strong feelings. I respect  those; and I respect the fact that this is an issue that is current.   But, again, my answer to the distinguished Republican Whip is that we  will be considering that in the regular order and, at that point in  time, I am sure that he will be able to testify before the committee,  if and when there  [[Page H1485]]  is a hearing, and that others will as well, including the sponsor. But  we are going to pursue the regular order on this bill and other bills  as well.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.
