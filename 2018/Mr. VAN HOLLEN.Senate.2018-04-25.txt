 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Thank you.   Mr. President, as the Senate considers the nomination of Mike Pompeo  to be Secretary of State, we have to ask ourselves many questions.  Among them are these: Will Mr. Pompeo offer the kind of independent  judgment that is necessary to help restrain President Trump's worst  impulses, or will he be somebody who becomes a ``yes'' man to the  President of the United States? Will Mr. Pompeo continue in his past  attitude, which reflects a ``shoot first, ask questions later''  approach to foreign policy? And can somebody like Mr. Pompeo, who has  made very divisive, polarizing, and, in fact, hateful remarks here in  the United States be able to reflect American values abroad?   I regret to conclude that I do not think Mr. Pompeo can pass these  tests, and I will oppose his nomination for Secretary of State.   We all know that our country is facing formidable challenges. Armed  conflicts are raging in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, creating  refugee crises across borders. Russia's campaign to undermine Western  democracies continues at pace and has sharpened divisions in our  society. It has bolstered populous movements at home and abroad, and we  have seen terrorist networks continue to expand their reach into  information space. Changes in our climate have resulted in drought,  natural disaster, and famine, and as the President of France reminded a  joint session of Congress today, there is no planet B.   Of the many crises we are confronting, at least one of them is  entirely of President Trump's own making, and that is the potential  unraveling of the Iran nuclear agreement. Let me say that I agree with  all of those who believe that we should never allow Iran to have a  nuclear weapon. That is exactly why it is so important to keep that  agreement in place.   In just a few weeks, President Trump will make a decision. He will  decide whether to waive the nuclear-related sanctions on Iran in order  to keep the Iran agreement intact or whether to blow up that agreement.   As the President of France reminded us today, that agreement was  forged with our European allies, Russia and China, and yet it has cut  off Iran's pathways to nuclear bombs, it has imposed very tough  constraints on their nuclear program, and it has subjected Iran to the  most comprehensive inspection and monitoring regime ever negotiated--an  inspection regime that would disappear if we backed out of that  agreement, leaving us blind to exactly what the Iranians were doing  with respect to their nuclear program.   Our State Department, our Defense Department, and our intelligence  community have all assessed time and again that Iran is in compliance  with the nuclear agreement. Secretary of Defense Mattis testified  before the Senate Armed Services Committee just last fall that the Iran  deal was in the national security interest of the United States.  Despite that consensus even  [[Page S2424]]  among the President's current team, the President is talking about  recklessly shredding the agreement.   As President Macron of France warned us today, such a move would be  very reckless and it would be reckless to replace what we have today  without having something to substitute for it.   Mr. Pompeo has weighed in on this issue over the years. It is not  only that he has been a fierce opponent of the Iran deal, but he has  proposed military strikes against Iran. In 2014, he said that it would  take ``under 2,000 sorties to destroy the Iranian nuclear capacity.  This is not an insurmountable task for the coalition forces.''   That is a dangerous illusion--the notion that there would be  absolutely no response to an American attack on Iran's nuclear  facilities.   Iran, of course, is right next door to Iraq, where the United States  spent an ill-fated number of years, at a great loss of lives both to  Americans and Iraqis and at great cost to the public. To just talk  offhand about bombing Iran as the solution is not the kind of sentiment  or mindset that we want in the Secretary of State for the United States  of America.   The idea that he somehow had a conversion to diplomacy is difficult  to believe, given the testimony that he has provided and the statements  that he has made.   We also know that we are at an inflection point when it comes to the  situation in North Korea. In a span of just a few months, President  Trump has veered from taunting Kim Jong Un over Twitter to recently  calling him ``very honorable.'' We are all rooting for diplomacy to  succeed in North Korea, but we all know that the opening rounds are, in  fact, the easiest legs, and that reaching a credible and lasting accord  with North Korea will take significant time, hard bargaining, and the  support of our partners and allies in the region.   When it comes to Russia, President Trump's affection for President  Putin continues unabated. Two weeks ago, he rejected the sanctions on  Russian companies found to be assisting Syria's chemical weapons  program, contradicting his own U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.  Then, he earlier congratulated Putin on winning the election--an  election that we all know was a sham election and that the outcome was  never in doubt. It was marred by ballot stuffing and forced voting, and  it was hardly what you would call a fair and free election.   When it comes to Russia, despite appeals from Republicans and  Democrats in this body and in other parts of the country, the President  has decided not to take action to address the threat of Russian cyber  attacks in our upcoming elections. In fact, Admiral Rogers, the former  head of the U.S. Cyber Command, testified just in February that  President Trump had not directed him to confront Russian cyber  operations at their source.   So while Mr. Pompeo has said that Russia will meddle again in our  midterm elections, he has been much quieter and softer since his  nomination was presented by the President with respect to President  Trump's soft approach to Russia and Putin.   It is also a fact that our next Secretary of State will be  responsible for managing tens of thousands of Foreign Service officers,  civil servants, and locally employed staff of the State Department at  our embassies and consulates overseas.   We all know that at the State Department today, we are witnessing  historically low morale. In his budget, President Trump has tried to  gut the State Department of its personnel and resources, issuing two  budgets in a row that cut the State Department's budget by over 30  percent. You cannot conduct the diplomacy of the greatest country on  Earth with two hands tied behind your back. Yet I heard nothing from  Mr. Pompeo about challenging the President with respect to the deep  cuts to the State Department and the resources that he will have  available to him to conduct American diplomacy.   There is also the very long history of really awful remarks that Mike  Pompeo has made toward various minority groups here in the United  States, including Muslims and the LGBT community. You have to wonder  how somebody who has made these comments is going to be able to oversee  a State Department that has patriotic Americans who are Muslim  Americans, who are LGBT, and who come from other minority groups. How  do you lead an agency when you have made those kinds of comments about  people in your workforce? And how do you represent American values  overseas when you have disregarded those important values here at home?   Mr. Pompeo has said that Muslims ``abhor Christians.'' He has said  that all Muslim leaders were ``potentially complicit'' in acts of  terrorism. He has made other statements and has not condemned  statements made by groups that were supporting him.   We have heard today from the President of France, Mr. Macron, a  speech that uplifted the best of American values and French values. It  was a speech that could have been given by earlier American Presidents,  Republican or Democrat. He called upon America, France, the NATO  allies, and other freedom-loving democracies and countries that respect  the rule of law to seize the mantle of leadership.   He said:         We can actively contribute together to building the 21st-      century world order for our people, for all people. The       United States and Europe have a historical role in this       respect, because it is the only way to defend what we believe       in, to promote our universal values, to express strongly that       human rights, the rights of minorities, and shared liberty       are the true answer to the disorders of the world.    He warned against using anger and fear to divide us. He said:         We are living in a time of anger and fear because of the       global threats, but these feelings did not build anything.       You can play with fear and anger for a time, but they do not       construct anything.    What we have heard from President Trump is exactly the stirring of  anger and division that the President of France warned about in his  talk today to the Congress. It is those fears that President Trump has  sought to exploit rather than to rise above and to lead.   As I look at the record of Mr. Pompeo and as I listen to the  statements he has made, including many repulsive statements about  different groups within the United States, I have to conclude that he  does not reflect the great tradition in American foreign policy of  standing up for those universal values that the President of France  talked about today. It is a sad moment in our history when it requires  a President from France to remind us of those universal values.   France has been a leader in the world, but the United States has been  the chief organizer of the post-World War II era. And our friends in  France, in England, in Germany, and other allies not just in Europe but  around the world have stood with us. Yet, in this administration, we  see a full retreat from that kind of American leadership around the  world.   I regret to conclude that, looking at Mr. Pompeo's record and  statements, he is part of the retreat and not part of the leadership  that we need in the 21st century. So I ask my colleagues to oppose this  nomination. We can do better. We need to remind every Member of this  body that the United States has always stood up for those values that  are in our Declaration of Independence and in our Constitution, and we  need to uphold those values in the conduct of our foreign policy.   Thank you, Mr. President.
