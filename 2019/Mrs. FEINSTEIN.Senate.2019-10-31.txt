 Mr. President, I would like to say a few words in  memory of my good friend and former colleague Kay Hagan, who passed  away this week.   One of the hardest aspects of this work in the Senate is the loss of  a colleague. So my thoughts are with Senator Hagan's family and friends  in this difficult time.   I recall well her 6 years here with both deep respect and friendship.   In the time we served in this body together, I was able to get to  know Kay very well, and I can honestly say I am lucky to call her a  friend. She was always kind and a positive face and worked hard for her  constituents and the Nation.   Kay was a dedicated public servant who served North Carolinians for  16 years. She got her start in politics in the 1970s when she interned  right here in the Senate. As an elevator operator during her  internship, she brushed shoulders with some of the biggest names of the  day. Kay later described the experience as ``infectious,'' and it  inspired her own political ambitions.   In 1998, that political career took her to the North Carolina State  Senate. It didn't take long for Kay's talents to be noticed. She rose  through the ranks quickly and became cochair of the budget committee.   Her trademark pragmatism and focus on problem solving served her well  in that position. Her hard work earned her a ranking as one of the top  10 most influential members in the State senate.   In 2008 Kay won a race that brought her here, to the U.S. Senate,  where her passion and focus continued to distinguish her. Kay was a  fierce advocate for her State, using her position on the Armed Service  Committee to help North Carolina's military families. Whether it was  asking the tough questions on water contamination at military bases or  mustering support for veterans' caregivers, Kay was always there for  our servicemembers.   Kay was also a breath of fresh air in the Senate. There were only 15  women serving in the Senate when she came to Washington in January  2009. When she first arrived, she soon learned that the Senate pool was  only open to men. She thought that was wrong and got the rules changed.  She was a firm believer in equality and making the changes you want to  see in the world.   No matter how big or small the issue, Kay always tried to help the  people of North Carolina. Just a few months ago, she made one of her  last public appearances at a groundbreaking for a new air traffic  control tower at Piedmont Triad International Airport. When she was  first elected to the Senate, she toured the old air traffic control  tower at Piedmont and learned that a project to replace it was stalled  in Washington. Kay took on the project and fought for funding to  finally get it moving forward. It is through her work and diligence  that the tower is being built today.   From reproductive rights to veterans' healthcare to transportation  infrastructure, you could always count on Kay to deliver. She will be  missed by many for her warmth and devotion to public service.   I send my deepest condolences to her husband, Charles ``Chip'', and  her three children, Jeanette, Tilden, and Carrie.
