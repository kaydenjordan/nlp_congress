 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Courtney Ann Neale, my office's press secretary and digital manager.  Courtney passed away suddenly on May 23.   It is still hard to fully express how much my staff and I feel  Courtney's spirit, her energy, and her strength, and we miss her. She  was an activist to the core and a dedicated public servant, an untiring  advocate for women, for working-class people, immigrants, and  communities of color.   In the year before she joined our office, Courtney was diagnosed with  several medical conditions that changed her daily life. Still, she  continued her fight for a world where healthcare and education are  guaranteed rights. Courtney stood strongly by her principles and--this  I can tell you from personal experience--challenged those around her to  do the same.   As press secretary and digital manager, Courtney was a member of my  office's communication team. Now, communications on the Hill can feel a  bit like a one-way street, getting the message out fast before turning  to the next thing. But Courtney took the meaning of communications  seriously. Even under the greatest time crunch, she seemed to approach  each tweet, each press statement, as a two-way dialogue.   She not only got out our message; most mornings she would bring new  messages in, raising attention to feedback on social media or local  angles on national news. True to her title as a communicator, Courtney  didn't just tell, she also learned and responded, ensuring that  constituents were heard.   And while she was known as our office's authority on all things  social media, she gracefully filled many other  [[Page H2750]]  roles in her personal life. She was an adventurous traveler; an avid  reader; a doting dog mom; and beloved daughter, sister, and friend.   Despite the hectic Hill schedule, she still prioritized time with  colleagues, friends, and family. Principled work was a passion, but a  principled life was the goal.   So her memory is more than a legacy. It is a call to action, to take  care of yourself, and take care of others as well, to give selflessly,  and to savor what you have. Courtney dared to dream. She challenged us  to act.   Alongside the many joyful memories she leaves with us, it is those  actions that we remember. On and off Capitol Hill, Courtney helped  advance the progressive cause and, through it all, remained a kind and  grounded person.   As my staff and I mourn her passing, we also resolve ourselves to  honor her legacy by continuing to fight for the better, fairer world  that she so passionately believed in.   My prayers are with Courtney's parents, Jill and Kevin; her sister,  Marissa; and the incredible network of friends she made along the way  in Milwaukee, Chicago, and Washington, D.C.   Rest in peace, Courtney.                            ____________________
