 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 88, the Congressional  Review Act on Saving on a Valuable Education plan.   Last August, the Department of Education launched the SAVE plan, a  new, generous, income-driven repayment, IDR, plan to significantly  lower payments for many low-and moderate-income borrowers.   Additionally, if borrowers make their full payment but their full  required payment is not enough to cover the accrued interest, the  government covers the rest of the interest. This means that the SAVE  plan eliminates the indignity of balances growing due to unpaid  interest.   The improved application allows borrowers to have their income  securely assessed through the Internal Revenue Service so that they  don't have to recertify their incomes every year.   Finally, repealing the SAVE plan would be extremely disruptive for  millions of Americans enrolled in this program.   In fact, the Department reported last month that 5.5 million  borrowers have already enrolled in the program, including nearly 18,000  borrowers in my district and about 8,600 in the district represented by  the gentlewoman from North Carolina. They are already enjoying the  improvements in the plan and the lower payments.   Mr. Speaker, we are responsible for strengthening support for those  seeking a college degree, not just because everyone should be forced to  get one, but because those who want a college degree should have access  to that opportunity.   As President Johnson noted when he signed the Higher Education Act  into law in 1965, he said that it meant that a high school senior  anywhere in this great land of ours can apply to any college or  university in any of the 50 States and not be turned away because the  family is poor.   Repealing the SAVE plan does nothing to make higher education more  affordable or accessible, and for that reason, Mr. Speaker, I oppose  the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues that in my colleague from  Virginia's district, there are over 11,000 borrowers already enrolled  in the SAVE Plan, which significantly lowered their monthly payments.   I will quote from a letter that we received from the AFT, the  American Federation of Teachers, which says, in part: ``For decades,  students have been told that a college education is one of the most  important vehicles to get ahead, but years of disinvestment and the  actions of predatory loan servicers drastically tightened the shackles  of debt, destroying students' budgets. And COVID-19 made that  predicament far worse. Fortunately, the Biden administration stepped up  with a plan to help student loan borrowers.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this letter from AFT and another  letter from the National Education Association.                                                             AFT,                                                   December 4, 2023.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.7 million members       of the American Federation of Teachers, I strongly urge you       to reject H.J. Res. 88, a joint resolution providing for       congressional disapproval of the Saving on a Valuable       Education student loan repayment plan, the Biden       administration's improvements to income-driven repayment       plans.        The SAVE plan is the most affordable student loan repayment       plan ever--and is sorely needed.        For decades, students have been told that a college       education is one of the most important vehicles to get ahead,       but years of disinvestment and the actions of predatory loan       servicers drastically tightened the shackles of debt,       destroying students' budgets. And COVID-19 made that       predicament far worse. Fortunately, the Biden administration       stepped up with a plan to help student loan borrowers.        Even as some members of Congress and outside groups have       moved to undermine efforts to achieve a more permanent       solution for the broken student loan system and its wide-      ranging impacts, and have refused to move forward on bold       solutions to make college more affordable on the front end,       like free college, the president has recognized that there       must be a relief valve for those drowning in student loan       debt. We fully support the administration doing what is in       its power and building on the tool of income-driven repayment       to create the SAVE plan.        This plan is the result of a thorough negotiated rulemaking       process and of the administration's commitment to helping       student loan borrowers who've had their lives derailed by       overwhelming student debt. Congress should be building on the       Biden administration's actions to make student loans       affordable, not undermining those actions.        The SAVE plan will ensure that borrowers never see their       balance grow because of accruing interest, as long as they       keep up with their required payments; this is particularly       significant for public service workers, who all too often       nervously watch their balance balloon while working toward       Public Service Loan Forgiveness, even as they work hard to       make their monthly payments.        The plan also cuts payments on undergraduate loans in half       (from 10 percent to 5 percent of a borrower's discretionary       income), updates the formula for determining a borrower's       discretionary income (to 225 percent of the federal poverty       guidelines based on family size), and provides a shorter time       to earn forgiveness (10-24 years) for those borrowers who've       carried low-balance loans for at least a decade.  [[Page H6723]]         Tens of millions of families are struggling under the yoke       of $1.7 trillion in student debt, and Congress and the       administration must do all they can to provide a lifeline to       those drowning in student loans. The SAVE plan is an       important piece of that relief, which we fully support. This       resolution will show Americans which members of Congress are       going out of their way to support loading them up with       additional student debt. I urge you to reject this callous       resolution.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Weingarten,                        President, American Federation of Teachers.                                                   December 5, 2023.      Hon. Robert C. Scott,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Scott: On behalf of the National Education       Association's 3 million members and the 50 million students       they teach and support in public schools and colleges, we       urge you to vote NO on H.J. Res. 88, as the Senate has       already done. The resolution would use the Congressional       Review Act to overturn the Biden-Harris Administration's new       rule implementing the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE)       Plan for federal student loan borrowers. Votes on this issue       may be included in the NEA Report Card for the 118th       Congress.        Millions of borrowers--many of whom are facing significant       financial struggles--are coping with their first student       bills since the COVID-19 pandemic. The Consumer Financial       Protection Bureau found that about 1 in 5 borrowers has risk       factors that suggest they will struggle with the resumption       of payments. Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans are a key       safety net; borrowers enrolled in IDR plans default at much       lower rates than those in non-IDR plans. However, for too       many borrowers, these plans were not working well enough to       protect them from hardship. Many borrowers struggled to       navigate the bureaucratic hurdles of enrolling in and staying       enrolled in a plan. Even for those who were enrolled, their       monthly payments were often too high. In addition, due to       interest accrual, many borrowers watched their balances       balloon despite making on-time payments for years.        NEA's 2021 report on student loan debt found that no       segment of the educator workforce is spared the burden of       student loan debt. Four out of 10 educators said struggling       to pay off their loans and financial worries about the loans       were negatively affecting their physical, mental, and       emotional well-being.        The Biden-Harris administration created the SAVE Plan to       provide meaningful financial relief to borrowers and help       ease their transition back to repayment. More than 4 million       borrowers are already enrolled and tens of millions more,       including educators, are eligible. The SAVE Plan is crucial       for educators and other public sector workers, because being       enrolled in an IDR is an essential requirement for those       seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness.        The SAVE Plan targets benefits to low- and moderate-income       borrowers by lowering their monthly loan payments and       protecting more of their income--up to 225 percent of the       federal poverty level--to enable them to better cover basic       needs such as food, housing, and child care. It also ensures       that borrowers never see their balance grow as long as they       keep up with their required payments. The White House       estimates this change will mean that 85 percent of community       college borrowers will be debt-free within 10 years. That       would not only improve the lives and financial future of the       borrowers themselves; it has the potential to change the       trajectory for their entire families.        Most Americans--even those without student loans--      understand the severity of the student debt crisis and how it       affects those they love. Please vote NO on H.J. Res. 88 and       support the administration's efforts to protect millions of       current and future borrowers from financial harm.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,                                    National Education Association.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues that in the gentleman from Texas'  district, there are over 8,000 borrowers already enrolled in the SAVE  Plan. They are already saving money, and the passage of this resolution  would increase their monthly payments.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues that in the gentleman from Texas'  district, over 6,600 borrowers have already enrolled in the SAVE Plan.  They are already saving money, and the passage of this legislation  would significantly increase their payments.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, my Republican colleagues clamored and  complained about President Biden's plan to provide debt relief for  millions of borrowers. Now, House Republicans are trying to saddle  millions of Americans and future borrowers with more debt by repealing  the SAVE Plan, which has already significantly lowered monthly payments  for many low- and middle-income borrowers.   Repealing the SAVE Plan would cause significant disruption, but that  seems to be the theme for my colleagues in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, it is imperative and important to know how we got into  the student loan crisis. It was created because the buying power of the  Pell grant has fallen dramatically over the years. Originally, it  covered about 80 percent of the cost of the tuition, room and board at  a State college. Now, it covers less than 30 percent. All of that cost  has been shifted over to the students.   The people who are debating today went to college when the Pell grant  covered 80 percent, and you didn't have to take out a student loan. Now  that we have shifted the cost to students, that is where the student  loan problem comes from.   The States are supporting a significantly lower portion, covering a  lower portion of the cost of the college--again, putting more of the  burden on students.   We should be covering more of a percentage for students, and this is  one of the ways to do that. By helping them pay their student loans, we  can help pay their way through college.   We should pass proposals to make college more affordable for current  and future students, not less. That is what the Biden administration  has been doing.   We have heard complaints about the shift of this burden onto the  taxpayer. I will tell you that we didn't hear any of that during the  debate on the PPP loans, where businessmen got millions of dollars of  PPP loans with handshakes and everything else and didn't have to pay  them back. We didn't hear any complaints about that, about the people  who didn't own businesses. Yet, when a student tries to get an  education, all of a sudden, we can't help them pay their loans.   We should be passing proposals to make college more affordable for  these students and future students, yet here we are, wasting our time  with passing this resolution. Everybody knows this isn't going  anywhere.   In fact, the Senate last month took up a similar proposal, and it  didn't pass. Whatever happens here, it is not going to pass the Senate,  and the President is going to veto it anyway.   Again, the bottom line is that we are responsible for strengthening  the support for those seeking a college degree, not because everybody  should be forced to get one but because those who want a college  education and to move up in life should be able to have access to that  opportunity, not just the privileged few that can write the $50,000 a  year checks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.J. Res. 88, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
