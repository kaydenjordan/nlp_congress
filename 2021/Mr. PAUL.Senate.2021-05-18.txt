 Mr. President, during Memorial Day weekend in my home  community, a fleet of cars will depart a local funeral home and make  the 25-mile trip to Merry Oaks United Methodist Church Cemetery in  neighboring Smiths Grove, KY. This will be the final leg of a journey  that began over 6,000 miles and nearly 80 years ago.   U.S. Navy Seaman 2nd Class Howard Scott Magers was one of the 429  crew members who perished aboard the USS Oklahoma on December 7, 1941.  Scott was 18 years old. The tragedy of his death was made ore  unbearable because he was buried in a mass grave alongside those of his  shipmates who were also unable to be identified.   Thankfully, beginning in 2015, new dental, anthropological, and  mitochondrial DNA analyses were employed to identify those who had  fallen  [[Page S2571]]  at Pearl Harbor. As a result, the remains of Scott Magers will soon  return to beautiful Barren County, KY where he grew up. Among those  welcoming him home will be Betty Magers, who was only 11 when Scott  said his goodbyes to family and friends and headed to basic training.   As on every Memorial Day, we want to honor those men and women who  have lost their lives in the service of their country in our Armed  Forces. But today, we remember one very specific young man, Howard  Scott Magers, and, on behalf of all the other fallen, say to him,  ``Welcome home. Fair winds and following seas.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, Ernest Edison West not only served  his country in the U.S. Army during the Korean war but embarked on a  lifetime of service, consistently demonstrating courage, selflessness,  and, above all, brotherhood. Orphaned at an early age, Mr. West was  raised in a children's home that stressed this important concept--a  value that was repeatedly put to the test in the Korean war. Once,  despite losing an eye under intense enemy gunfire, he retreated and  saved two wounded fellow soldiers and carried his injured patrol leader  to safety while killing three enemy combatants. In the immediate  aftermath, he said he had no idea that he was even wounded and that his  fellow soldiers would have done the same for him.   President Dwight Eisenhower was set to award Ernest the Medal of  Honor. His sense of brotherhood on full display, West initially  declined, asserting that everyone was doing his duty and that all were  equal to him. He reluctantly accepted the Medal of Honor and was later  awarded a Purple Heart.   Fortunately, Mr. West's selfless service did not end with his  enlistment.   In 1954, he married Gwendolyn Stafford in a nationally televised  ceremony on an episode of the CBS show ``Bride and Groom.'' He and Gwen  moved back to Wurtland, KY, along the Ohio River in beautiful Greenup  County. There, Ernest would later serve as mayor and play a huge part  in creating a State veterans cemetery, where he is now buried.   Mayor West was admired for his willingness to get his hands dirty-- quite literally--like digging water lines along county roads. He  coached youth basketball and football and used sports to pass along his  strong sense of brotherhood. How can we even measure the impact he made  on all of those young lives?   Ernest Edison West, who was born in Russell, KY, on September 2,  1931, died this year on May 1, at the age of 89. While his daughter,  Amy Hogsett, his many grandchildren, his community, and the  Commonwealth are saddened to say goodbye to this extraordinary man, we  are not left emptyhanded. We are left with a powerful example of  brotherhood lived out.                            ____________________
