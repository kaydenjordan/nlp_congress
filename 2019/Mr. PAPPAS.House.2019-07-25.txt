 Mr. Speaker, this morning, I rise in support of the  42,000 men and women of the United States Coast Guard, the vital public  safety, humanitarian, and national defense missions they perform, and  this House's passage yesterday of the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act  of 2019.   Coast Guard members are the first responders of America's oceans,  waterways, and coastlines, conducting varied missions, often at a  moment's notice, including search and rescue, securing our Nation's  ports and waterways, and conducting law enforcement operations.   In my district in New Hampshire, we have been home to the Coast Guard  since its founding, and the Granite State has relied on its work to  keep us safe and strong for generations.   Last month I had the privilege of meeting with the crew of the Coast  Guard Cutter Tahoma at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. As I met officers  and crew members and toured their vessel, I was struck by the critical  nature of their missions and the challenges they encounter in executing  them.   Cutters like Tahoma patrol international waters and interdict drugs  coming to America's shores. Their work saves lives and makes our  communities safer. The Coast Guard has been doing this work despite  being chronically underfunded and under-resourced.   The Coast Guard faces cartels and smugglers with staggering resources  and advanced technology, and studies show that only 20 to 30 percent of  the illegal drugs coming to our shores are interdicted.   According to the leaders of the Coast Guard, the most significant  factor in its inability to meet drug interdiction targets has been  insufficient inventory of vessels and aircraft to support operations.   At a time when our Nation is facing a profound crisis of addiction,  we can and must do more to ensure that the Coast Guard is fully funded  and has the resources it needs to keep our country safe.   That is why yesterday's action to pass the Coast Guard  Reauthorization Act of 2019 in a bipartisan way was so critical. This  act supports the Coast Guard for the next 2 years with more than $11  billion in discretionary funding each fiscal year, allowing them to  address a backlog created by previous cuts.   An important bill I introduced was also included, the Fair and Equal  Treatment of Women in the Coast Guard Act. This seeks to increase the  recruitment and retention of women in the U.S. Coast Guard and improve  gender diversity in this branch of the Armed Forces.   This comes in response to a study commissioned by the Coast Guard  that identified barriers to attracting, recruiting, and retaining  women, and recommended ways to improve gender diversity in the service.  It is one important step to assure that the Coast Guard can continue to  attract our Nation's best and brightest.   When we talk about keeping this Nation safe, let's remember the  incredible work performed by our Coast Guard close to home and around  the globe.   Let's show the Coast Guard Members that Congress has their backs, and  let's continue to work collaboratively to ensure the Coast Guard has  the proper support and policies in place to carry out its missions.                            ____________________
