 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I take this time to urge my colleagues to  support S.J. Res. 52, which would reinstate the free and open internet.  I thank my colleagues, Senator Markey and others, for bringing this to  our attention. It deals with the Congressional Review Act to block  regulation which had been suggested that would repeal the protections  we have on the free internet. Let me just give a little bit of  background so we can put this in context.   Internet service providers--known as ISPs--are basically utility  companies that provide internet service to our constituents, to our  businesses, and to America. Without the protection for net neutrality,  these utilities have the ability to block or throttle content on the  internet or charging what is known as being in the fast lane, charging  more. So this is a debate between whether we are on the side of the big  utility companies that provide internet service and their special  interests or the individuals and small businesses of America to  guarantee them equal access to this critical service. Let me give one  example, and there are many that can be given.   I am sure, in every one of our communities, we have a lot of small  businesses. They recognize that they can now do business on the  internet, and they have an opportunity to compete with the large  companies that do most of their business through the internet.   In Baltimore, in Maryland, I have small shop owners. One I am  particularly familiar with sells bikes. This shop owner now is using  the internet in order to get to customers so he can show his wares on  the internet and be able to compete against one of the large, giant  retailers that does a lot of business on the internet.   If a consumer in Baltimore goes onto that bike shop's website, and if  the product that consumer is interested in will not pop up within a  couple seconds, the consumer is gone. There has been study after study  that shows that about 3 seconds is the maximum attention span of a  consumer shopping on the internet.   The large store that has access to the fast-service broadband will  have an incredible advantage over our small businesses if we allow the  utility that provides the internet service to discriminate against the  smaller users. That is what this debate is about. It is about  protecting individual consumers, and it is about protecting small  businesses.   There is a reason why, in 2015, the open internet order was passed to  protect utilities that provide internet service from blocking or  slowing down internet service.   Broadband internet service is a public utility. It is interesting  that almost half of the consumers have no choice in whom they have to  provide their internet service. They have basically one internet  provider to choose from. Competition does not exist. So this is not a  matter of competition; this is a matter of preventing discrimination.   I have had the honor of being the ranking member of the Small  Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, and I can tell you, on behalf  of the small businesses of Maryland and around the Nation, on behalf of  farm owners around the Nation, they need to have access to the  internet, and they depend upon net neutrality. Fifty-six percent of the  small business owners oppose the FCC's repeal of net neutrality; 70  percent of small business owners feel they are at a disadvantage  compared to a large corporation due to their size and market power. The  internet gives them that capacity to try to equalize that disadvantage.   John Duda is co-owner of Red Emma's, a cooperative bookstore and  restaurant in my hometown in Baltimore. He summed it up best by saying:         I don't have the money to pay an internet service provider       to guarantee my website will load quickly for all users, so       I'm concerned the end of net neutrality means customers will       buy from retailers that have the resources to pay for faster       service. Additionally, if my internet service provider slows       load times for--or blocks access to--my web content, we'll be       up against more than just larger book sellers or       restaurants--we're suddenly competing against any website       that loads quickly because those are the ones that will draw       people's attention.    This is a matter of economic survival for small businesses. Everybody  wants to make sure they have access and that we have superhighways for  broadband. We have that in Maryland, and we need the last mile to make  sure you can get connected. Absolutely, we have to do  [[Page S2695]]  more to make sure all communities have access to internet service, but,  like healthcare, if you don't have quality care, access is not going to  help you. You need to be able to have reliable broadband service.   Net neutrality has lowered the barriers to starting and growing a  small business, and that is undeniably good for our economy. We all  brag about the fact that small businesses are the growth engine of  America and more jobs are created by small business, innovation, et  cetera. Let's make sure we give small business what they need. Let's  preserve net neutrality.   As FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel put it, ``For the first time,  small business could think big and consumers could shop small, from  anywhere in the world.'' Think about that for a moment: Small  businesses can think big because they have access to the internet, and  consumers can shop anywhere in the world and shop in small companies  anywhere in the world. The loss of net neutrality jeopardizes that  progress.    In every State, community, and home across our Nation, Americans  expect the water coming out of their tap to flow on demand and be safe  to drink. They expect the lights in their homes to go on thanks to the  utility company that provides the electricity. And, yes, they not only  want but need to have access to broadband internet in the very same  way. This is a utility, and it needs to be regulated as such.   These providers should not have the last word in what any American  can see on the internet. Access to the information vital for our  democracy and our economy to function must be preserved.   Congress has a chance to put consumers and small businesses first and  prevent the FCC from bowing to corporate interests instead of serving  the public interest. I urge my colleagues to vote for S.J. Res. 52.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
