 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  hosting this Special Order, it is so important.   Madam Speaker, I rise to bring needed attention to the ongoing  overdose crisis in our country that is ruthlessly taking lives. I can't  speak on this without focusing on a major culprit: fentanyl. The CDC  recently announced 101,263--again, 101,263--Americans died of drug  overdoses during a 12-month period ending June 2021. The number of  deaths is going up, not down.   The vast majority of these preventable deaths were caused by fentanyl  and illicit fentanyl analogs, which are 50 times stronger than heroin  and 100 times stronger than morphine. From October 2020 to September  2021, Customs and Border Patrol seized 11,201 pounds of fentanyl, which  is enough to kill 2.5 million, or the entire United States population  seven times over. This is what they were able to interdict. We don't  know how much more got into the country.   Fentanyl is temporarily scheduled as a Schedule I drug, but that is  set to expire in just a few weeks on February 18. Congress must act to  provide a permanent solution.  [[Page H901]]    That is why I am co-leading legislation with my friend, the gentleman  from the Ninth District of Virginia. Our bill, the HALT Fentanyl Act,  would permanently schedule fentanyl-related substances as a Schedule I  and cut red tape enabling researchers to continue to study Schedule I  substances for the purposes of identifying any possible medical  benefits.    Let's put politics aside and do what is right. I encourage all of my  colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and help us provide immediate  assistance to those in need. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  hosting tonight.
