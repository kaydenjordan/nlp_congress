 ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Young Guns at Quail Creek for winning the 2017  Scholastic Clay Target Program National Championship. Based out of my  hometown, Okeechobee, Florida, the Young Guns have won the SCTP State  championship for the past 3 years.   The Young Guns had the highest combined team score of all 38 teams  competing. Specifically, one participant, Nicholas Blenker, had the  highest overall score in the competition for trap, skeet, and sporting  clays. Over the course of the 2-day competition, Nicholas shot 575 out  of 600, only missing 25 shots.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the whole team on their success and for  making Okeechobee proud.                            ____________________
