 Mr. President, today, I wish to honor COL Joel  Warhurst as he relinquishes command of the Anniston Army Depot,  effective on July 25, 2019. In July 2017, Colonel Warhurst became the  35th commander of the depot. His command tenure oversaw an annual $850  million operating revenue and led a workforce consisting of 2,800  people. He has devoted over 20 years of loyal service to our country  and has acquired important leadership positions and notable  recognitions along the way.   Colonel Warhurst is a graduate of the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for  National Security and Resource Strategy at Fort McNair, VA. He holds a  bachelor of science degree in industrial technology from the Technical  University in Cookeville, TN, and a master of science degree in  logistics management from the Florida Institute of Technology in  Melbourne, FL. He is decorated with a Bronze Star Medal, which is the  fourth highest individual military award.   Thank you, Colonel Warhurst, for your dedication to our Nation and  for a job well done serving at the Anniston Army Depot. Your tenure as  commander will be remembered by your remarkable leadership. The  commitment you have shown during your time in Alabama is inspiring, and  your command serves as an example for Alabamians, as well as Americans,  from all across the country.   I join Colonel Warhurst's friends, family, and colleagues in wishing  him the best of luck as he transitions into a new chapter of his life,  and I thank him for his commitment to Alabama and to the United  States.                            ____________________
