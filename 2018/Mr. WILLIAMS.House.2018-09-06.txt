 Mr. Speaker, today I want to take a moment to talk  about something very dear and near to my heart.   This year, over 160,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in  the United States. That is one man every 3.2 minutes.   Many of my colleagues here today may not know this, but 3 years ago,  I was one of those men. Fortunately, the cancer was caught early, and I  was able to survive the diagnosis. Unfortunately, and it pains me to  say this, this is not the case for roughly 30,000 men every year.   Mr. Speaker, the month of September is National Prostate Cancer  Awareness Month, and we need to talk about this. It is the most common  cancer among American men, and over 12,000 will be diagnosed this year  in just Texas alone.  [[Page H7881]]    Education and early detection is critical to stopping prostate cancer  in its tracks, and, therefore, we need to better educate our fathers,  brothers, sons, and friends. All men are at risk, and as a survivor, I  encourage the men of Texas District 25 to participate in regular  screenings. Together, we can beat prostate cancer.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
