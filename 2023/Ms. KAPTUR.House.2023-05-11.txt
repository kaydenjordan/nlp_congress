 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about an extremely  dangerous situation in rail corridors across America. This includes the  busy mainline rail corridor between Pittsburgh and Chicago that cuts  across northern Ohio, including most of my district.   In northern Ohio, rail is the spine of our economy. To stay  competitive in today's economy and avoid expensive supply chain delays,  industrial and agricultural America must think big about modernizing  rail solutions. Our Nation must prioritize rail safety, give people  more transportation options, and expand access to national and  international markets.   In the past year, three significant train derailments by Norfolk  Southern have taken place in Ohio. In October 2022, a 21-car derailment  occurred in my district at Sandusky, where Norfolk Southern has dragged  its feet for over half a year in cleaning up the mess. That job is  still not finished. This rail corridor again drew national attention  with the major derailment earlier this year in East Palestine, Ohio.   The imperative topic of rail safety has many clear and sometimes  deadly impacts on students across our Nation.                                time  1030    I include in the Record a recent ProPublica news article which  highlights the risks for students in Hammond, Indiana.                           [From the ProPublica]     As Rail Profits Soar, Blocked Crossings Force Kids to Crawl Under                          Trains to Get to School  (By Topher Sanders and Dan Schwartz, ProPublica, and Joce Sterman, Gray                         Television/InvestigateTV)         Jeremiah Johnson couldn't convince his mother to let him       wear a suit, so he insisted on wearing his striped tie and       matching pocket square. It was picture day and the third       grader wanted to get to school on time. But as he and his mom       walked from their Hammond, Indiana, home on a cold, rainy       fall morning, they confronted an obstacle they'd come to       dread:        A sprawling train, parked in their path.        Lamira Samson, Jeremiah's mother, faced a choice she said       she has to make several times a week. They could walk around       the train, perhaps a mile out of the way; she could keep her       8-year-old son home, as she sometimes does; or they could try       to climb over the train, risking severe injury or death, to       reach Hess Elementary School four blocks away.        She listened for the hum of an engine. Hearing none, she       hurried to help Jeremiah climb a ladder onto the flat       platform of a train car. Once up herself, she helped him       scramble down the other side.        ProPublica and lnvestigateTV witnessed dozens of students       do the same in Hammond, climbing over, squeezing between and       crawling under train cars with ``Frozen'' and ``Space Jam''       backpacks. An eighth grade girl waited 10 minutes before she       made her move, nervously scrutinizing the gap between two       cars. She'd seen plenty of trains start without warning. ``I       don't want to get crushed,'' she said.        Recent spectacular derailments have focused attention on       train safety and whether the nation's powerful rail companies       are doing enough to protect the public--and whether federal       regulators are doing enough to make them, especially as the       companies build longer and longer trains.        But communities like Hammond routinely face a different set       of risks foisted on them by those same train companies, which       have long acted with impunity. Every day across America,       their trains park in the middle of neighborhoods and major       intersections, waiting to enter congested rail yards or for       one crew to switch with another. They block crossings,       sometimes for hours or days, disrupting life and endangering       lives.        News accounts chronicle horror stories: Ambulances can't       reach patients before they die or get them to the hospital in       time. Fire trucks can't get through and house fires blaze out       of control. Pedestrians trying to cut through trains have       been disfigured, dismembered and killed; when one train       abruptly began moving, an Iowa woman was dragged underneath       until it stripped almost all of the skin from the back of her       body; a Pennsylvania teenager lost her leg hopping between       rail cars as she rushed home to get ready for prom.        In Hammond, the hulking trains of Norfolk Southern       regularly force parents, kids and caretakers into an       exhausting gamble: How much should they risk to get to       school?        The trains, which can stretch across five or six       intersections at a time in this working-class suburb of       77,000, prevent students and teachers from getting to school       in the morning. Teachers must watch multiple classrooms while       their colleagues wait at crossings; kids sit on school buses       as they meander the streets of an entirely different city to       be dropped off a half-hour late. Brandi Odom, a seventh grade       teacher, estimates that at least half her class is delayed by       trains multiple times a week.        The adults entrusted with their safety--parents and       teachers, police and fire officials, the mayor--say they are       well aware of the pressures on students' minds when they face       a blocked crossing on foot. They know some are hungry and       don't want to miss breakfast; the vast majority in this 86       percent Black and Latino district qualify for free or       reduced-price meals at school. And they know that many of       their parents commute to work an hour away to Chicago,       trusting older brothers or sisters to pick up or drop off       their siblings.        ``I feel awful about it,'' said Scott E. Miller, the       superintendent. His district has asked Norfolk Southern for       its schedule so that the schools can plan for blockages and       students can adjust their routines. The company has       disregarded the requests, school officials said.        Mayor Thomas McDermott Jr. said that his experience with       the rails has been similar, and that company officials have       reminded him the rails ``were here first,'' running through       Hammond before it was even a city. ``To them, I am nobody,''       he said. ``They don't pay attention to me. They don't respect       me. They don't care about the city of Hammond. They just do       what they want.''        In written responses to questions, a spokesperson for       Norfolk Southern said children climbing through their trains       concerns the company.        ``It is never safe for members of the public to try to       cross the cars,'' spokesperson Connor Spielmaker said. ``We       understand that a stopped train is frustrating, but trains       can move at any time and with little warning--especially if       you are far from the locomotive where the warning bell is       sounded when a train starts.''        He said trains routinely sit in Hammond for a number of       reasons: That section of track is between two busy train       intersections that must remain open; Norfolk Southern can't       easily move a train backward or forward, because that would       cut off the paths for other trains, which could belong to       other companies. And Hammond is a suburb of Chicago, which is       the busiest train hub in the nation, creating congestion up       and down the network.        He said Norfolk Southern is working to identify an area       where trains can stage further down its line and to have less       impact on the community. The company will also review its       procedures to see whether its trains can give louder warnings       before they start moving. (ProPublica reporters witnessed       trains in Hammond start moving without warning.) Spielmaker       said that train schedules vary so much that giving Hammond       one might not be helpful. He said that the company is in       ``constant communication'' with local officials, and that       representatives will discuss any proposed fixes with Hammond.        Rail companies around the country could better coordinate       their schedules, parking trains far from schools that are in       session.  [[Page H2253]]       They could also build shorter trains that fit into railyards       so their tail ends don't block towns' crossings. Hammond       essentially serves as a parking lot for Norfolk Southern's       trains, creating a problem so pressing that Indiana plans to       spend $14 million--about $10 million of which is coming from       federal grants--to build an overpass for cars. The bridge       won't help many students, who would need to walk at least a       mile out of their way just to reach it. Norfolk Southern, the       multibillion-dollar corporation causing the problem, is       contributing just $500,000 of the bridge's cost, despite the       city asking for more.        Norfolk Southern did not respond directly to questions       about whether it should chip in more to the upcoming project,       but the company said it contributes to many safety projects       and maintains more than 1,600 grade crossings in Indiana       alone. Read the company's full response here.        On three separate occasions during the fall and winter,       reporters witnessed Norfolk Southern trains blocking       intersections leading to an elementary, a middle and a high       school for four, six and seven hours. ProPublica and       InvestigateTV showed footage of kids making the crossing,       including an elementary student crawling under a train, to       representatives of Norfolk Southern, lawmakers and Secretary       of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, whose remit includes rail       safety.        He was shocked.        ``Nobody,'' Buttigieg said, ``can look at a video with a       child having to climb over or under a railroad car to get to       school and think that everything is OK.''        The video also stunned state officials who had long known       about the problem. ``That takes my breath away,'' said       Indiana state Rep. Carolyn Jackson, who represents the       Hammond area and has filed a bill attempting to address       blocked crossings every session for the past five years. None       has ever gotten a hearing. ``I hope that they will do       something about it and we won't have to wait until a parent       has to bury their child.''        The blocked crossing problem is perennial, especially in       cities like Hammond that are near large train yards. But in       the era of precision scheduled railroading, a management       philosophy that leans heavily on running longer trains,       residents, first responders, rail workers and government       leaders told ProPublica it is getting worse as trains stretch       farther across more intersections and crossings. ``The length       of the long trains is 100% the cause of what's going on       across the country right now,'' said Randy Fannon, a national       vice president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and       Trainmen. ``No engineer wants to block a crossing.''        The Federal Railroad Administration, the agency that       regulates rail safety, started a public database in late 2019       for complaints about blocked crossings and fielded more than       28,000 reports of stopped trains last year alone. Among them       were thousands of dispatches from 44 states about       pedestrians, including kids, crossing trains. Someone in       North Charleston, South Carolina, summarized the situation in       three letters: ``Wtf.''        A rail administration spokesperson said the agency shares       the data monthly with companies. ``When railroads fail to act       quickly,'' and if a crossing is reported as blocked three       days in a calendar month, officials will contact a company to       determine the cause and try to work out solutions, Warren       Flatau said. ``We are receiving various levels of cooperation       . . . and welcome more consistent engagement.'' Read more       about what the agency says it is doing here.        Buttigieg said that this spring or summer, he expects to       announce the first grants in a new U.S. Department of       Transportation program designed to help alleviate blocked       crossings. The federal government is putting $3 billion into       the program over five years.        State lawmakers have tried to curb blocked crossings by       restricting the lengths of trains. Since 2019, in Arkansas,       Iowa, Kansas, Georgia, Nebraska, Virginia, Washington,       Arizona and other states, lawmakers have proposed maximum       lengths of 1.4 to about 1.6 miles. (There is no limit now,       and trains have been known to stretch for 2 or more miles.)       Every proposal has died before becoming law.        Opponents, including the nation's largest railroad       companies, claim that the efforts are driven by unions to       create jobs and that the measures would violate interstate       commerce laws. As ProPublica has reported, train length has       been essential to creating record profits for rail companies       in recent years.        The industry has also sued to block more modest measures.       In Hammond, for instance, police used to be able to write       tickets for about $150 every time they saw a train stalled at       a crossing for more than five minutes. Instead of paying the       individual citations, Hammond officials told ProPublica,       Norfolk Southern would bundle them and negotiate a lower       payment.        ``We weren't getting anything,'' McDermott, the mayor,       said, ``but it made our residents feel good.'' An Indiana       court took the industry's side--as many courts in other       states have done--ruling that only the federal government       held power over the rails. ``We can't even write tickets       anymore,'' the mayor said. ``It was more of an illusion, and       we can't even play the illusion anymore.''        He said the blockages have forced Hammond to keep more       firefighters and stations than would normally be needed for a       city its size. ``I have to have a firehouse fully staffed on       both sides of the rail line so that we can respond in a       timely manner to an emergency, which is very expensive,''       McDermott said.        The problem has become so endemic in Hammond that getting       ``trained,'' or stalled at crossings, has become a verb.        Police officers are delayed several times a day, said       Hammond Police Department spokesperson Lt. Steve Kellogg.       Last October, an officer couldn't get backup as he confronted       a man who was holding a knife, bleeding and not responding to       commands. The officer pulled his weapon and the man       ultimately cooperated, but someone could have died, Kellogg       said. Hammond's powerlessness over the rails is frustrating,       he added. ``They're all controlled by the feds, and they do       whatever the hell they want to do.''        Spielmaker, the Norfolk Southern spokesperson, said: ``We       work with first responders on a daily basis to assist however       we can. For example, there was a situation in Georgia where a       train was stopped on a crossing due to a broken down train       ahead. The train could not be moved, so we worked with the       first responders to make sure the train was safe for them to       maneuver through with it in place.''        In his 24 years fighting fires in Hammond, Mike Hull,       president of a local union, said not once has he seen       railroads do that for first responders. ``They've never come       back and said, 'We're going to move this train for vou;'' he       said.        State and local officials grew hopeful on March 20 when the       U.S. Supreme Court invited the federal government to comment       on a petition from Ohio seeking the authority to regulate how       long a train can block a crossing. The high court will likely       hear the case if the solicitor general recommends it, said       Tom Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog, which is widely seen       as an authority on the court. Nineteen other states have       signaled their support for a Supreme Court case. Goldstein       expects the solicitor general to respond in November or early       December. A favorable court opinion could allow other states       to finally enforce their laws on blocked crossings.        In the meantime, Buttigieg believes federal lawmakers must       intervene to give the Federal Railroad Administration the       power to compel rail companies to keep crossings clear. This       time of intense public interest in railroads has opened a       window for action, Buttigieg said, but it is fleeting. ``Any       moment that the public attention starts to fade, the       railroads are then once again in a position to assert       themselves in Washington and to ignore some of the phone       calls they are getting in the communities,'' he said.        Buttigieg said his staff is ready to participate in a       federal hearing in which it can tell lawmakers what new       authorities they would need to regulate blocked crossings.        U.S. Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, said she is eager for new       law. A fire chief in her district, which covers parts of the       Houston area, told her the department has had to detour 3,200       times since 2019 because of blocked crossings. She and other       congressional Democrats introduced the Don't Block Our       Communities Act in early March, but it has not yet gained       bipartisan traction. The proposed law would prohibit rail       companies from blocking crossings for more than 10 minutes       and would allow the rail administration to fine companies for       repeated violations.        Like the other officials, Garcia said she was aghast, but       not surprised, about the situation in Hammond. ``That is       outrageous, look at the little bitty baby,'' she said while       watching a video of a young girl crawling under a train car.       ``That's what I mean about making sure we do more to protect       the safety of our children. That happens too in Houston.''        In Hammond, a public meeting is scheduled for Wednesday at       5:30 p.m. at Scott Middle School to discuss the overpass       project. Among those who hope to voice their concerns about       the blocked crossings are rail workers themselves who worry       about the kids. ``It's just a matter of time until there is a       catastrophic incident,'' said Kenny Edwards, the Indiana       legislative director for the nation's largest rail union.        Efrain Valdez, president of the parent teacher association,       said he hopes officials can adjust plans to help students who       need to walk to school. ``To see our children in danger like       that, that's just downright crazy,'' he said. ``I'm just       appalled and heartbroken that [the railroad] would think       that's OK. That their money means more to them than a child's       life.''        Until there's a better solution, the ritual continues. Some       parents act as de facto crossing guards, standing beside       trains to help their children and others cross. Others ask       their kids to call them before and after they make the climb,       while warning them about the worst that can happen.        Rudy Costello tells his daughter, who is in high school, to       be careful, because if the train moves she ``could slip and       then there goes your leg and your foot. Or you get pulled       under the train and there goes you all together.'' He added:       ``That's been my biggest fear, her foot slipping off. . . .       But what can you do? Because those trains are always stopping       over there, for hours.''        Akicia Henderson said she has tried to avoid making the       dangerous climb with her 10-year-old daughter. ``I called a       Lyft,'' she said. ``The Lyft driver actually canceled on me       twice because he couldn't get around the train.''  [[Page H2254]]         So she walks toward the tracks, picturing all that can go       wrong--a jacket snags, a backpack tangles, the wheels begin       to turn. She prays that this will be one of the days their       path isn't blocked and that she doesn't hear the sound she       has most come to fear, a horn in the distance.        ``It's like, `Oh my God, the train is coming.' ''     Mr. Speaker, children are forced to crawl over or under  very long parked trains that block their path to school. ProPublica and  InvestigateTV witnessed dozens of students in Hammond climbing over,  squeezing between, and crawling under the train cars just to make their  way to and from school.   Railroads of America, wake up.   In my district in northwest Ohio, I have also witnessed situations  with students in extremely dangerous and deadly situations.   In December of 2009 along that same mainline rail crossing at McCord  Road in Lucas County, Ohio, a train hit two students on foot in my  district, killing one of them and putting the other in critical  condition at Toledo Hospital where she underwent surgery.   Cody L. Brown, a 15-year-old freshman, was pronounced dead at the  scene. Brianna Mullinger was taken in critical condition to Toledo  Hospital. The students, both band members, were walking to school when  that westbound Amtrak train struck them.   In the wake of this tragedy, our community constructed an underpass  below the Norfolk Southern rail line at McCord Road to try to avoid  future tragedies at this same rail crossing.   There are numerous such places across this corridor. Our effort  protects students, pedestrians, and drivers without interrupting  traffic or flow of trains, pedestrians, or cars that pass through this  intersection.   These stories are emblematic of some of the longstanding and  unaddressed real issues America continues to face to this day.   Railroads of America, wake up.   Let us use our bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to  fix these rail problems that exist and take steps to address them coast  to coast. Now is a pivotal point where our Nation can fix these  challenges with funds available from the Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and  President Biden to pay particular attention to this regional corridor  from Pittsburgh to Chicago. It is so dangerous. Help us convene rail  stakeholders to relieve congestion and identify key infrastructure  improvement projects.   This is a time freight companies like Norfolk Southern, CSX, and  Amtrak should come together at the same table. Let us craft solutions  to address longstanding issues regarding rail safety.   Communities are begging to work with these companies that never  return phone calls to help fix these longstanding, solvable challenges.  We must look to the future and join together to protect the public: our  students, our rail workers, and our communities.   Let us deliver both transformative and safe commercial and passenger  rail solutions. The tools are at our disposal. The money is there.   Where are the rail companies?   The time is now. Let's do what we in the industrial Midwest do best.  Let's get to work.                            ____________________
