 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland for yielding.   Boy, is Adam Schiff powerful. He can, at once, be the chairman of the  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the special counsel  investigating Donald Trump, manage and run the FBI, and be a judge  ruling on FISA applications. It is remarkable that he from his perch in  Congress can do all of that.   Of course, he didn't do any of that. All he did was properly impeach  the President of the United States for his gross abuse of power.   Mr. Speaker, do you want to talk about collusion?   Let me ask my Republican colleagues: If a campaign manager for a  campaign is giving internal information to a Russian intelligence  agent, is that collusion?   Because that was the once-classified information that is now public  and now constitutes collusion. There are so many other issues. There is  nothing in this resolution that is true.    Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues said that  we will hold Members accountable.   The Republicans are the party of George Santos.  [[Page H3018]]    Whom are they holding accountable?   The guy is an alleged and acknowledged liar and indicted, and the  Republicans protect him every day.   Mr. Speaker, don't lecture us with your projection and your defense  of Donald Trump. It is pathetic, it is beneath you, and it is beneath  this body.
