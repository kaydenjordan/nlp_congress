 Madam Speaker, I am proud to be here today. I worked  with my colleague, Diana DeGette. We had hearings on the cost of  diabetes and on the supply chain, and we said this is something we can  work on together. And we did work on it together. And most of those  provisions are in a bipartisan H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures  Act.    Madam Speaker, I am fighting for my constituents to have lower  insulin costs. But I think, more importantly, I am fighting for my  constituents to deliver a cure for diabetes. Our experts say it is not  impossible to have a cure for diabetes in the next decade. And we need  to continue to push policies that promote innovation, not slow it down.  So the Lower Costs, More Cures Act will help patients, including  seniors, afford monthly insulin prescriptions without discouraging  future investments in breakthrough medications.   I encourage the majority to come back with H.R. 19, Lower Costs, More  Cures Act, and let's work together, instead of the rhetoric that we  just heard from our respected leader. Let's work together and do it in  a bipartisan way, the way we tried to do it in the Committee on Energy  and Commerce.
