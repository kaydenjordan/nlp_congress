 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Inflation Reduction Act.   This historic legislation will make real, tangible differences in the  lives and livelihoods of people back home in southern California and  across the Nation. It is imperative we pass this once-in-a-generation  bill today.   The American people are struggling to afford medications, health  insurance, and their energy expenses, all while battling the impacts of  climate change every day. They are desperate for Congress to take  action to address the real challenges they are facing in their everyday  lives.   This is exactly what this bill does. It lowers the costs of  prescription drugs for seniors to no more than $2,000 yearly. It curbs  the rising costs of utilities  [[Page H7670]]  and creates good-paying jobs nationwide in the process. It makes  healthcare more affordable for millions of Americans by shoring up the  Affordable Care Act.   Today, we are going to combat climate change, ensure corporations pay  their fair share, and reduce prices for workers and families. In fact,  we are making the largest and most ambitious investment in clean and  renewable energy in our Nation's history, finally reversing years of  underinvestment at the IRS and building a fairer tax system that will  invest in workers without raising taxes on families and small  businesses.   Today, we are delivering on a promise made to Americans by passing  this critical bill. We must commit to putting people over politics.  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.
