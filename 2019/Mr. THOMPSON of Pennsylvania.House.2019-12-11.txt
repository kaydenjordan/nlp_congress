 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Computer Science Education Week.   Ten years ago, this awareness week was established to highlight the  important skill set and the role it plays in all industries.   Every year, Computer Science Education Week serves as an opportunity  for students in kindergarten through their senior year of high school  to learn about the importance of computer science and the opportunities  that abound with a skills-based education.   As the co-chair of the bipartisan House Career and Technical  Education Caucus, or CTE Caucus, I am proud to support Computer Science  Education Week.   Our Nation is facing a skilled worker shortage. With more than 7  million open jobs in the United States, CTE opportunities can offer  rewarding professional futures for learners of all ages while  simultaneously closing the Nation's skills gap.   One field in particular that needs workers trained in computer  science is cybersecurity. I was pleased to cosponsor H.R. 1592, the  Cybersecurity Skills Integration Act, alongside my fellow CTE Caucus  co-chair, Congressman  Jim Langevin from Rhode Island. H.R. 1592 will  aid in the development of a critical infrastructure workforce that is  well trained to handle cyber threats from bad actors.   The bill authorizes $10 million to create a competitive grant program  within the Department of Education to incorporate cybersecurity  education into new and existing CTE programs. Additionally, the bill  requires the Department of Education to coordinate with the Department  of Homeland Security to better support cybersecurity education  programs.   A successful career in any field starts with effective counseling.  Far too many students begin their educational careers without fully  understanding their options, but empowering students with counseling  resources can better prepare learners of all ages for the workforce.   That is why Congressman Langevin and I introduced H.R. 5092, the  Counseling for Career Choice Act. H.R. 5092 would authorize $40 million  for grants to be used by States and local education agencies to assess  counseling services and create new counseling frameworks.   The bill also provides professional development opportunities to  counselors so that they can better improve their skills to assist their  students. We need a workforce that can meet modern technical demands,  and students who choose a career in technical education are best suited  for that challenge.   Through career and technical education programs like computer  science, we can begin to close our Nation's skills gap with helping  learners of all ages take control of their professional futures.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, food banks and food  pantries play a valuable role in our communities all year long, but  around the holiday season their impact on families in need is  magnified.   In 2018, more than 37 million Americans were considered food  insecure, including 11 million children. The Department of Agriculture  defines food insecurity as ``a lack of consistent access to enough food  for an active, healthy life.''   Access to quality food and nutrition is necessary for healthy  families, and as the former chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on  Nutrition, this is an issue that I feel very passionately about.   We can all help our neighbors in need by contributing to our local  food banks and food pantries by making a donation or volunteering our  time. Just a small contribution or a few hours out of our day can make  a big difference in our communities.   During this holiday season, it is especially important that we  support families who have fallen on hard times.                            ____________________
