 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the  untimely loss of Sergeant Daniel Martinez.   I express my deepest condolences to my friends and neighbors, the  Martinez family. There is no greater pain than that of losing a child,  and there are no words I can provide to mend your pain. But I want you  to know that the entire Southwest Side of the region has your back.   Sergeant Daniel Martinez served his country with pride, forming close  bonds with his fellow marines during his 4 years of service.   He will be remembered as a young man with a sense of humor who  enjoyed watching movies and television with his siblings and loved to  travel.   Daniel will be remembered by his family and our community for his  commitment to his country. Above all, he will be remembered for his  kindness and devotion to his family and friends.   Rest in peace, Daniel.                            ____________________
