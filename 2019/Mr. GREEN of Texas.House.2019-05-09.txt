 Mr. Speaker, last night at a rally in Florida,  the President referred to me as ``that man.''   Mr. Speaker, I love my country, and still I rise. And I rise today to  address the comment that the President made in referring to me as  ``that man.''   Mr. Speaker, the video of what I said speaks for itself. The  President indicates that I said the only way to get him out of office  is to impeach him, but the video speaks for itself.   But I do want to share with the President that he is right; I am  ``that man.'' I am ``that man,'' a liberated Democrat, a liberated  Democrat in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm. I am unbought and unbossed.   Mr. President, you finally encountered at least one person that your  money can't buy and your power doesn't scare.   You have a date with destiny, Mr. President. Your fate is in the  hands of 435 Members of Congress. You are not above the law. No one is.   Impeachment is in the hands of this Congress. ``That man,'' Mr.  President, is a Member of this Congress.   Mr. President, I assure you that the long arm of the law is reaching  out for you. In this country, we will not allow you or any other person  to hold yourself out as being above the law.   You have an appointment with history in this House of  Representatives. If no one else will bring you to justice, I will, Mr.  President.   Lawsuits and delay tactics will not deter me. You will not engage in  the paralysis of analysis, as Dr. King put it. You won't engage in this  paralysis of analysis such that we will put this off until the next  election.   Mr. President, your case will be brought before this House. It is  just a matter of time, Mr. President; it is just a matter of time.  [[Page H3506]]
