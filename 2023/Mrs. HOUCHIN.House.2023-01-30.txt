 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Financial  Exploitation Prevention Act, a bill that I am proud to be a cosponsor  of.   Every day, seniors and other vulnerable adults become targets of  financial fraud. While not all the cases are known or discovered, about  one in five senior investors in the United States are victims of  financial scams. In 2021 alone, there were over 1,500 reported cases of  financial fraud against Hoosier seniors. This is unacceptable.   As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, this is  exactly the type of legislation my constituents sent me here to  support. That is why, today, I will be voting ``yes'' on this important  bill to keep our seniors' pocketbooks safe.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues will join me in doing the  same.
