 Mr. President, tomorrow Washington will play host to  one of our Nation's proudest examples of peaceful activism: the 49th  annual March for Life.   Hundreds of thousands of Americans--from different States, different  faiths, different ethnic backgrounds--will speak with one voice on  behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves. I would like to  welcome the marchers, especially my fellow Kentuckians, including  Margie Montgomery, executive director of Kentucky Right to Life. I  welcome all the marchers with gratitude. I am grateful they are helping  shed light on this great shame of our society and bearing witness to  the fact that human dignity and human rights are for everyone.   As they march tomorrow, our friends can take pride in knowing our  beliefs are not just consistent with morality and supported by science;  they are also squarely within the mainstream of our society. According  to one recent survey, a sizable majority of American adults hold views  on the subject that are far, far from the absolutist position of the  far left.   Seventy-five percent of all Americans, including more than 60 percent  of those who call themselves pro-choice, support more protection for  the lives of unborn children.   The far left is wedded to the most extreme positions on this subject.  For example, the radical left wants America to remain one of only  seven--seven--countries in the entire world, including China and North  Korea, that allow elective abortions to occur after 20 weeks and even  after the child is capable of feeling pain. The American people,  however, know better. That survey also found that a majority of  Americans oppose taxpayer-funded abortions. So I am proud today to  stand with that majority of Americans and urge every Member of this  body to join me in supporting the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act  this afternoon.   Thanks to the dedication of Senators Wicker, Roberts, Ernst,  Lankford, Daines, Blunt, and many others, the bill before us would  supplement existing law and bolster the important, longstanding  protections of the Hyde amendment.   By implementing a governmentwide, statutory prohibition on taxpayer  subsidies for abortion and abortion coverage, S. 109 would close off  Federal support for abortion that flows outside of the Hyde-protected  regular appropriations process.   In addition, it would explicitly ensure that Federal healthcare  facilities are not party to abortions and increase transparency  requirements for federally subsidized healthcare plans.   I am proud to support this important step forward in protecting  Americans' rights of conscience, and I urge every one of our colleagues  to vote to advance it.    I yield back our time.    I object.    Objection.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 259, which was received  from the House.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration and the  Senate now proceed to S. Res. 10.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 21, submitted earlier  today.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  [[Page S298]]  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Friday,  January 18; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S.  1.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   Thereupon, the Senate, at 6:32 p.m., adjourned until Friday, January  18, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
