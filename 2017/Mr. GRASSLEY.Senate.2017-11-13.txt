 Madam President, in the last several weeks, there has  been a lot of discussion regarding the blue-slip courtesy that applies  to judicial nominations. I want to take a moment to clarify a few  things. My position hasn't changed. Like I said in November of last  year, I intend to honor the blue-slip courtesy, but there have always  been exceptions.   First, the blue slip has always been a Senatorial courtesy. It is  premised on the idea that home State Senators are in a very good  position to provide insights into a nominee from their State for the  Federal judiciary. It is meant to encourage consultation between the  White House and home State Senators about judicial nominations. That is  why I value the blue-slip tradition and ask for the views of Senators  on all nominees to courts from their respective States.   Throughout its history, the many chairmen of the Senate Judiciary  Committee have applied this blue-slip courtesy differently. That is a  chairman's prerogative. The chairman has the authority to decide how to  apply the courtesy. Over the past 100 years, there have been 18  chairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee who recognized the value of  the blue-slip courtesy, but only 2 out of these 18 chairmen required  both Senators to return positive blue slips before scheduling a  hearing.   The practice of sending out blue slips to home State Senators started  100 years ago, in 1917. Chairman Charles Culberson started the blue- slip practice to solicit the opinions of home State Senators, but he  did not require the return of two positive blue slips before the  committee would proceed on a nominee. In fact, in the blue slip's very  first year, Chairman Culberson held a hearing and a vote for a nominee  who received a negative blue slip. His successors over the next nearly  40 years had the same policy. It was not until 1956 that the blue-slip  policy changed under Chairman James Eastland, a Democrat from the State  of Mississippi. Chairman Eastland began to require both home State  Senators to return positive blue slips before holding a hearing and a  vote.   Chairman Eastland, as history tells us, was well known for his  segregationist views. Unfortunately, it is likely that he adopted a  strict blue-slip policy to veto judicial nominees who favored school  desegregation. This is what Villanova Law School Professor Tuan Samahon  explained: ``When segregationist `Dixiecrat' Senator John Eastland  chaired the Judiciary Committee, he endowed the blue slip with veto  power to, among other things, keep Mississippi's federal judicial  branch free of sympathizers with Brown v. Board of Education.''   After Chairman Eastland retired in 1979, Senator Kennedy became  chairman. He got rid of Senator Eastland's policy. He didn't want a  single Senator to be able to unilaterally veto a judicial nominee.  Senator Kennedy's policy was that an unreturned or negative blue slip  wouldn't prevent the committee from conducting a hearing on a nominee.  Then along comes Senator Strom Thurmond, continuing this policy when he  became chairman. So did Senator Joe Biden. So did Senator Orrin Hatch.  Each of those chairmen allowed hearings for nominees who had negative  or unreturned blue slips.   In 1989, Chairman Biden sent a letter to the White House articulating  his blue-slip policy. This is what Chairman Biden wrote: ``The return  of a negative blue slip will be a significant factor to be weighed by  the committee in its evaluation of a judicial nominee, but it will not  preclude consideration of that nominee unless the Administration has  not consulted with both home State Senators prior to submitting the  nomination to the Senate.''   Obviously, chairmen from both parties saw the danger of allowing one  or two Senators to veto a nominee for political or ideological reasons.  My predecessor, Chairman Leahy, reinstated Chairman Eastland's strict  blue-slip policy. Some believe he did so in order to exert firmer  control over the new Bush administration nominees, but even he said he  wouldn't stand for Senators abusing the blue slip to delay or block  nominees. Chairman Leahy said the blue-slip courtesy was ``meant to  ensure that the home state Senators who know the needs of the courts in  their state best are consulted and have the opportunity to make sure  that the nominees are qualified'' and should not be ``abused simply to  delay [the Committee's] ability to make progress filling vacancies.''   Chairman Leahy also said:         I assume no one will abuse the blue-slip process like some       have abused the use of the filibuster to block judicial       nominees on the floor of the Senate. As long as the blue-slip       process is not being abused by home-state Senators, then I       will see no reason to change that tradition.    As I have said all along, I will not allow the blue slip to be  abused. I will not allow Senators to block nominees for political or  ideological reasons. This position is consistent with the historical  role of the blue-slip courtesy. It also matches my personal experience  with the blue slip.   I am going to tell you about a personal experience I had when I first  came to the U.S. Senate. In my first year in the Senate, a vacancy  arose on the Eighth Circuit. At the time, I served with a Republican,  my senior Senator from Iowa, Roger Jepsen, and we had a Republican  President, Ronald Reagan. Senator Jepsen and I thought the nominee  should be a State judge from Des Moines so we recommended his name to  the White House--not like we do now in Iowa, submit two or three names,  four names sometimes, for the President to pick from. In 1981, the  White House decided they would like to consider another name for the  vacancy. The other individual, Judge Fagg, was a State court judge in  Iowa. The White House interviewed the judge who was supported by both  Senator Grassley and Senator Jepsen along with having interviewed this  other nominee.    President Reagan, ultimately, nominated the other nominee for the  vacancy. He was not the person Senator Jepsen and I recommended, but  the White House thought that he was better suited to the circuit court,  and that ended up being the correct decision. Judge Fagg served with  great distinction for more than two decades. Even though he was not our  pick, Senator Jepsen and I returned our blue slips on the nominee. That  was not unusual as more deference has always been given to the White  House, particularly for circuit court nominees, which is different from  district court nominees.   When Judge Fagg was nominated to the Eighth Circuit, both Senators  from Iowa were Republicans, and the blue slip practice did not change  when Senator Harkin, a Democrat, was elected to the Senate, succeeding  Senator Jepsen.   Senator Harkin and I served together for 30 years, and we did not  have any problems with judicial nominees. Generally, when there was a  Republican  [[Page S7175]]  President, I sent a list of names to the President, and when there was  a Democratic President, Senator Harkin sent a list of names to the  White House. We served together for those 30 years and never had any  problems with blue slips, not once.   During the Clinton administration, a vacancy arose on the Eighth  Circuit. The White House nominated Bonnie Campbell for the court. Ms.  Campbell was originally from New York and had previously worked for two  Democratic Senators. For 6 years, she served as chairwoman of the Iowa  Democratic Party. Ms. Campbell was elected as Iowa's attorney general  after having defeated the Republican candidate. She also ran for  Governor against Gov. Terry Branstad. After she lost that election, she  was appointed by President Clinton to a position within the Department  of Justice.   It happens that I liked Ms. Campbell very much. She was not the type  of nominee I would have picked for the court, but that did not stop me  from returning my blue slip.   Ms. Campbell was a controversial nominee. During the campaign for  Governor, she was quoted discussing Christian conservatives. She said:  ``I hate to call them Christian because I am Christian, and I hate to  call them religious, because they're not, so I'll call them the radical  right.''   Ms. Campbell had a very liberal record and had spent most of her  career as a politician, and a lot of people did not want me to return  her blue slip. So why did I return her blue slip? In the process, I was  criticized extensively by the conservative base of my State of Iowa.   I did that because the blue slip is not supposed to allow the  unilateral veto of a nominee. A Senator cannot use a blue slip to block  a nominee simply because he or she does not like the nominee's politics  or ideology. A Senator cannot use a blue slip to block a nominee  because it is not the person the Senator would have picked.   The President gets to nominate judges. The White House should consult  home State Senators, and it is important that they do so in a  meaningful way. The White House may disagree with Senators and may  determine that a different individual is more suited to serve on the  circuit court, but so long as there is consultation, the President  generally gets to make that call. So I will not let Senators abuse the  blue slip to block qualified nominees for political or ideological  reasons.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
