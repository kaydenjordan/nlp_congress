 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4979) to extend the Generalized System of Preferences and to  make technical changes to the competitive need limitations provision of  the program, as amended.

SEC. 2. TECHNICAL MODIFICATION TO PROCEDURES FOR COMPETITIVE                     NEED LIMITATION AND WAIVERS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4979, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today in support of H.R. 4979, a  bill to  [[Page H1101]]  extend the Generalized System of Preferences and to make technical  changes to the competitive need limitations provision of the program.  This bipartisan bill helps keep U.S. companies globally competitive by  eliminating tariffs on certain imports from developing countries in a  manner that does not hurt U.S. producers.   GSP saved U.S. companies more than $865 million in import duties in  2017, providing benefits to thousands of companies and their employees  as well as their customers. GSP also provides an important enforcement  tool to require all 121 beneficiary developing countries to continue to  make progress on eligibility criteria set by Congress. These include  critical issues like intellectual property protection, market access  for U.S. exporters, and elimination of the worst forms of child labor.   In my home State of Washington, GSP saved companies about $11 million  in import duties in 2017, and that is up 30 percent from 2016. As just  one example, TRInternational, a small but quickly growing, veteran- owned chemical distributor in Seattle, relies on GSP to obtain certain  chemical raw materials at globally competitive prices. Our last renewal  of GSP in 2015 allowed TRI to hire more employees and invest in more  equipment. Many of TRI's customers are U.S. manufacturers, and TRI's  use of GSP to obtain raw materials at lower prices also makes these  manufacturers more competitive.   For TRI and other Washington companies like Rain City Music that use  the GSP program, their employees, and American consumers, GSP provides  significant benefits.   And of course, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this  bill, and I am pleased to be working with my good friend Bill Pascrell,  who joins us here tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), one of the distinguished members of the Ways  and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Curbelo), another member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman), who has been a leader on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank my friend from New Jersey because we have worked on a lot of  issues together over the past almost 14 years now, and I do agree with  him. There are few moments where we have a chance to sort of have a  kumbaya moment. MTB, a week or two ago, was one of those.   Tonight, on GSP, is another one that doesn't sound--you know, GSP,  people ask: What is that? And we tried to explain it tonight.   It is a complicated issue, but the bottom line is that this is good  for American businesses. It creates jobs, energizes the economy.  Coupled with tax reform and fair trade agreements that we are also  working together on, I think we can look forward to a bright, bright  future here in the United States for our working men and women and our  families.   So our last renewal of GSP in 2015 allowed TRI to hire more  employees, as I said. So we are looking forward to, you know, more jobs  being created. And TRI, I know, is going to be very pleased by the fact  that this is going to be voted on tonight.   It is clear that H.R. 4979 has strong bipartisan support, and for  good reason. Renewing GSP will benefit U.S. companies, workers, and  consumers. Any additional delay in renewing this important program has  real costs in  [[Page H1103]]  my home State, as I mentioned, and throughout the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
