 Mr. Speaker, I proudly represent North Carolina's 12th  Congressional District, leader in transportation and infrastructure.   We have Norfolk Southern's state-of-the-art intermodal yard  connecting trucking, rail, and air to East Coast seaports. We are home  to the Charlotte Douglas International Airport, eleventh busiest in the  Nation, nearly 700 American Airlines flights departing daily.   I-85, I-77, Route 21, and Highway 115 move our 800,000 residents and  products from businesses like International Paper and Coca-Cola  Consolidated. Our LYNX and rapid bus transit lines are making our  cities greener. And as we say in Charlotte, we've got a lot.   I am committed to ensuring we remain a national leader. I am hosting  a regional transportation summit to help promote Route 21 and Highway  115 projects, continue developing our rapid transit systems, move our  Red Line project forward, and to ensure that our airport can complete  its new terminal and runway projects.   We are ``One Meck.'' Transportation has made us an economic  powerhouse and southern hub of cultural diversity. During National  Infrastructure Week, I urge my colleagues to work to make greater  investments in our Nation's infrastructure.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on May 9, President Trump abruptly fired FBI  Director Comey, who was leading the investigation into ties between his  administration and Russia.   On May 10, the President met with the Russian Ambassador in the Oval  Office, and the White House changed their reasoning for firing Comey.   On May 11, in an interview with Lester Holt, President Trump admitted  that the Russia investigation was a factor in firing Comey.   On May 12, he appeared to threaten Comey, saying he had ``better hope  that there are no `tapes' '' of their conversations.   On May 15, we learned Trump shared code word classified intelligence  with the Russian Ambassador.   On May 16, Comey's memo of his conversation with President Trump  quoted him saying: ``I hope you can see your way clear to letting this  go.''   Every day brings a new scandal.   The appointment of Director Mueller as special prosecutor is a good  first step, but it shouldn't be our last. We need an independent  commission, free of meddling from the Trump administration. Our  democracy depends on it.                            ____________________
