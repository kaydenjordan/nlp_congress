 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor McCall Lake Cruises as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for September 2022.   For the last 10 years, McCall Lake Cruises has operated The Idaho on  Payette Lake, sharing with visitors and locals alike a history of the  area, the ship, and Sharlie, the lake monster. The Idaho is a 62-foot,  85-passenger cruise vessel built in northern Idaho in 1983. Its 360- degree view allows passengers to take in the scenic views and landscape  that surround Payette Lake on both afternoon and sunset cruises  throughout the summer.   McCall Lake Cruises was acquired by Kyle and Jade Enzler, Steven and  AJ Lee, and Ryan and Kelsey Parke at the start of the 2022 cruise  season. All three couples have a deep love of McCall and, over the  years, have translated that love into various ventures in the area,  from renovating and running the Scandia Inn, to coordinating beautiful  McCall mountain weddings. This group of self-proclaimed Idaho  enthusiasts knew a great opportunity when they saw one, so when the  prospect of purchasing McCall Lake Cruises came about, they jumped at  the chance. With the generous guidance of the previous owners and the  help of The Idaho's knowledgeable captains and crew, these six  enthusiastic entrepreneurs kept this special Payette Lake tradition  alive.   Congratulations to McCall Lake Cruises for being selected as the  Idaho Small Business of the Month for September 2022. Thank you for  serving Idaho as small business owners and entrepreneurs. You make our  great State proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
