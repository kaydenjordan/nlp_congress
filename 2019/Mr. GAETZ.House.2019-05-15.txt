 Madam Speaker, by expanding American energy, expelling  diplomats, and ensuring that the United States takes its position in  the world, President Trump has been tougher on Russia than any  President in a generation.   But the fact remains that the Russian military attacked the U.S.  election. And so it would seem reasonable that, along with the  Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the CIA, we would want  the United States military offering the full suite of capabilities,  both offensive and defensive, to combat Russian election interference.   Today, the House Armed Services Committee held a classified briefing  on the U.S. military and their participation in this critical mission.  I was deeply disappointed in what I learned.   The U.S. military is not sufficiently engaged or informed on critical  aspects of the Russian election interference campaign. They don't even  know which two Florida counties were hacked.   And when DOD sent 11 people to go work with the Department of  Homeland Security to have the full suite of  [[Page H3800]]  authorities available to respond to Russia, they were told they weren't  needed.   Russia has a whole-of-government approach to this problem, and I  would urge us to work in a bipartisan way in the Defense Authorization  Act to ensure that we are ready with our full authorities to defeat  Russia and their efforts to interfere with our election.                            ____________________
