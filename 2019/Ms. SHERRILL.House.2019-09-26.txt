 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bruce Springsteen,  the New Jersey legend who turned 70 years old this week.   There is so much that this Jersey girl could say to honor Bruce  Springsteen on his birthday. I could remind you of his 19-plus albums,  15 world tours, sold-out Broadway shows, best-selling autobiography,  countless GRAMMYs, an Oscar, Kennedy Center Honors, Presidential Medal  of Freedom, and membership in the New Jersey Hall of Fame.   I could recount his lyrics that are poetic stories of everyday people  just trying to get by. I could tell you of his epic concerts and the  way he connects with each audience member in sold-out stadiums, and how  he makes them feel as though he is singing directly to them.   If you are lucky enough to experience it, as I have, a live  Springsteen show is not something you watch, but nearly 4 hours of  power, raw beauty, and sweat that you actively participate in.   Or maybe, to best honor him for his 70th birthday, I should proudly  say that Bruce Springsteen is the unofficial spokesperson and  ambassador of our great State.   He sings for the underdog, for the quiet hero, and for every New  Jerseyan who has dared to dream of a better life for themselves.                            ____________________
