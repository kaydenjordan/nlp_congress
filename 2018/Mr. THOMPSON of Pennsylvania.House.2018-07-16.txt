 Mr. Speaker, Sunday was World Youth  Skills Day. The United Nations General Assembly started this initiative  to raise awareness about the importance of investing in youth skills  development.   Young people are almost three times more likely to be unemployed than  adults. Young people around the world are exposed to lower-quality  jobs, greater labor market inequalities, and a longer school-to-work  transition period.   That is why I am pleased the House unanimously approved my  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act  last year, and it has seen action in the Senate as well.   Too often, we have seen students pushed down the college-for-all  pathway that just doesn't work for some students. CTE has established  itself as a path that many students choose in pursuit of industry  certification and hands-on skills they can use right out of high  school, in skill-based education programs, or in college.   By modernizing the Federal investment in CTE programs, we will be  able to connect more educators with industry stakeholders and close the  skills gap.   CTE is an important part of youth skills development, not only in the  United States, but in nations around the world.                            ____________________
