 Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to thank  Congresswoman Speier for calling us together to speak on behalf of  these courageous women and for her tireless work on their behalf, but  also on behalf of women throughout the world.   Today, I join my colleagues in standing in support of the FAIR Act  and in solidarity with women like Saturnina Plasencia, a Latina single  mother of four who was working for $13 an hour in a Dollar store in New  York.   Now, her general manager subjected her to frequent sexual harassment,  and after she refused his sexual demands, she alleged she was given  fewer hours than new female hires. When she told him she was pregnant,  he angrily responded: ``The baby could have been mine.''  [[Page H7590]]    Sadly, Saturnina did not realize when she started work that she had  signed a mandatory arbitration agreement, and her case is now in  arbitration.   Her attorney noted that New York passed a law that would have allowed  Saturnina to take her case to court, but the law was struck down based  on the Federal Arbitration Act. So Saturnina is forced to arbitrate her  claims.   Her case is supported by the TIME'S UP Legal Defense Fund, which is  housed and administered by the National Women's Law Center Fund.   Forced arbitration is just what it says; it is forced. So let's pass  the FAIR Act so women will finally have the justice that they so  deserve.   Enough is enough.   I thank Congresswoman Speier for allowing us to give voice to these  injustices, and hopefully, soon, these women, because of the  gentlewoman, because of the FAIR Act, will be able to move forward with  their lives.
