 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the clock is ticking ever closer to the  end of the year. We still need to fund the government by Friday. We  still need to lift the spending caps equally for defense and urgent  domestic priorities,  [[Page S8082]]  such as combatting the opioid crisis, improving healthcare for  veterans, and building rural infrastructure. We must extend the FISA  program and shore up pensions for over 1 million Americans. We still  need to reauthorize CHIP and end the sabotage of our healthcare  markets. We have had a bipartisan deal on a stabilization package for  months now. It is a product that should have been easy to include in  the end-year deal. After all, it is the product of bipartisan  negotiations between Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray, two  of our most effective Senators. But now, because the Republicans are  repealing the individual mandate in their tax bill, the Alexander- Murray deal will not have its intended effect. Even worse, Speaker Ryan  has just said the agreement will not pass the House unless the Hyde  language is attached to it--another eleventh hour partisan demand on a  bill that has already been negotiated in the Senate. What should have  been an easy addition to the year-end package is getting more difficult  by the hour because of Republican demands.   We still need to pass disaster supplemental funding to aid storm- stricken parts of our country--California, Puerto Rico, the Virgin  Islands, as well as Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. The disaster  supplemental bill coming out of the House, while it has much better  funding levels than the administration's proposal, still does not treat  Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands fairly. It does not provide for cost- sharing waivers, and it doesn't include enough funding for resiliency,  mitigation, Medicaid, or drinking water infrastructure. It is a step in  the right direction but not good enough.    I would reiterate my plea. Texas and the Texas delegation have  constantly criticized government funding. All of a sudden, now that  there is a disaster, they want money. Fine. Yet what about that $10  billion rainy day fund? Let Texas spend that. I guarantee you that if  it were in a blue State, some of our friends from Texas would be  calling for it--the very same people who opposed aid to Sandy, the very  same people who have relished putting State and local deductibility in  the bill. Well, what is good for the goose is good for the gander. Let  Texas dip into its $10 billion fund before it gets FEMA money. That is  what seems fair and right, particularly for those who don't want to see  Federal Government spending increase.   Of course, last, but certainly not least, we still need to protect  the Dreamers--young people brought into this country through no fault  of their own, many of them who know no other country but ours. These  are people who are in our Armed Forces--over 800--who are going to our  schools, who are working in our factories and offices and stores. They,  like everybody else--like our ancestors--want to be Americans. They  contribute to America. They help America.   Yet there are people on the other side of the aisle who have this  nasty immigration attitude that affects the Dreamers and everybody  else. It is so un-American. It is so against the statue with the torch  in the harbor in the city in which I live. It is so against what the  American people believe. Eighty percent want to help the Dreamers. Yet  we are stymied so far, and 1,000 Dreamers are losing their status each  week.   On all of these things, the time to act is now. Bipartisan  negotiations continue to seek a compromise to ensure DACA protections  as well as to provide additional border security. We Democrats are all  for that--real border security that makes a difference. We should  strive to reach a deal as soon as is humanly possible.   If we are not able to reach a global deal by this Friday on these  many issues, there will be a temptation to do a short-term funding bill  with some of these items but not others. That won't work. We should be  doing all of these things together instead of in a piecemeal, week-by- week fashion. Our Republican friends cannot pick and choose what they  want and do what they did on the tax bill and do what they did on the  healthcare bill in saying that Democrats are not welcome to be part of  the deal--because this one ain't under reconciliation.   We want to work in a bipartisan way, but a bipartisan way means just  that, not Republicans deciding on their own and telling us that we  should just be for it. The best way to get a good, bipartisan result,  which by the Senate rules is necessary for spending bills, is for us to  work together.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I will have further comments on the tax  bill that I will deliver on the Senate floor late tonight after the  conference report, but I just want to say that this bill will be an  anchor around the ankles of every Republican. It so helps the wealthy  and the powerful corporations, and it does so little and even hurts  many in the middle class. It is a loser.   In a CNN new poll, a majority of Americans oppose the tax bill. When  did you ever hear that Americans are against a tax cut bill? Well, you  are hearing it now.   It is because our Republican friends are listening to the thousands  of really greedy multibillionaires who want their taxes cut, even  though they are doing great, and don't want to share those benefits  with the middle class even if they make millions of middle-class people  pay more.   The Republicans will rue the day that they passed this tax bill--will  rue the day--because it is so unfair to the middle class. It so blows a  hole in our deficit. It so threatens Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid. They will rue the day.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we have a lot of business to get to this  week, but because the topic is so important, I would like to address  Special Counsel Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in  our elections and the Trump campaign's potential involvement.   Over the past several months, the investigation and the FBI have been  the target of a smear campaign by Republicans, in the media primarily-- in a media outlet that is hardly regarded as down the middle, in a  media outlet that just seems to ask ``how high'' when President Trump  says to jump.   Now it has been joined, quite naturally, by several Republicans here  in Congress. Their intent is not to push back on the special counsel's  findings or to introduce exculpatory evidence on behalf of Manafort,  Gates, Papadopoulos, or Flynn, who have been indicted or convicted.  Their intent is not to make an argument about the substance of the  investigation at all. Their intent is to discredit the investigator and  the investigation itself, by falsely painting it as biased or partisan.  That way, whatever its findings are at the end of the day, they have  created a permission structure to dismiss them.   When you are afraid of the result, you attack the process. When you  are afraid of the message, you shoot the messenger. That is what is  happening right now with the escalating rhetoric in the rightwing echo  media chambers. The commentators at FOX News have actually called Mr.  Mueller's investigation a coup--an outrageous charge that has been  repeated by a Republican Congressman on the floor of the House. That is  how overblown this rhetoric has gotten.   Mr. Mueller is one of the most trusted and respected public servants  in America. He has served administrations of both parties. He was first  appointed by a Republican and was installed as a special counsel by  President Trump's pick for Deputy Attorney General, Republican Rod  Rosenstein. As everyone in America knows, he is as straight a shooter  as one comes. Impugning his motives and calling his investigation a  witch hunt or a coup is, frankly, hysterical.   I regret even repeating those ridiculous comments because there is  not a shred of evidence to back them up--not a shred. If any of these  critics had evidence, they would pursue their claims in court, but, of  course, there is no evidence. So, instead, they wage a warped campaign  in the press, fueled by an avalanche of trumped-up allegations and  disinformation.   What are they so afraid of?   We all know why. The special counsel's investigation is an important  one for our democracy. We have to get to the bottom of what happened in  last year's election no matter who ends up on the short end of the  stick when those results are announced: How was  [[Page S8083]]  Russia able to wage a successful information campaign to influence our  election? To what extent were any members of Trump's Presidential  campaign coordinating with that foreign attack on our democracy for  political benefit?   These are vital questions that every American should know, and it is  an outright disgrace that our Republican colleagues have not joined in  in asking for this--so many of them--being as partisan as can be and  putting their party over country. If Russia continues in these types of  investigations, woe is America--woe is America.   Rather than this concerted campaign to sully the investigation and  the FBI, President Trump and his allies should be encouraging them to  do their job, to do it right, and to do it thoroughly. The stakes are  too high and the topic too serious.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays, and I yield  back all time.    Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague Ron Wyden  for the excellent job he has done in leading the opposition to this  bill. I am incredulous that someone on the other side of the aisle said  that this will decrease the deficit. That is just amazing. The lack of  factual fidelity for what is in the bill and what the other side is  saying is unparalleled--unparalleled. I want to thank Senator Wyden for  his valiant efforts in pointing that out. I want to thank Senator  Sanders and Senator Cantwell as well, the ranking members of our  committees, who worked so hard on this bill.   In closing, very soon the Senate will vote for the final time on the  Republican tax bill. When future generations look back at the short and  messy history of the Republican tax bill, its most enduring lesson will  be what it has taught us about how not to legislate. After only a few  months of frantic, backroom negotiations by only one party, we are left  with a product as sloppy and as partisan as the process used to draft  it. Even today, three provisions of the bill were found to violate  Senate rules. So now, all of a sudden, the House will have to vote  again tomorrow. That is a perfect microcosm of the hasty and reckless  process--can we have order?    It is a perfect microcosm of the hasty and reckless  process that produced this legislation.   If my Republican friends think these are the only mistakes that will  be found in their bill, they are sorely mistaken. Many more will almost  certainly be unearthed. But the bigger issue is the failure of this  legislation to live up to each and every one of the promises made by  Republicans about what it would mean for our country.   What has been sold as a middle-class miracle will instead deliver a  hefty windfall to the wealthy and only paltry, temporary relief for  some in the middle class. Others will see an increase right from the  get-go. So all of the talk--no middle-class person will pay a tax  increase--gone, gone. And in a few years, a majority of the middle  class will see their taxes go up. What kind of middle-class relief is  that?   What has been sold as a deficit reducer will instead balloon the  deficit by at least $1.5 trillion, maybe more. Our children and  grandchildren will be asked to clean up the mess made tonight by our  Republican colleagues in their eagerness to give the very wealthy, the  very powerful corporations, a big tax break.   What has been sold as a bill to give people more freedom to choose  their healthcare will instead raise premiums and reduce the number of  Americans with health insurance by 13 million. The number of people who  get a small tax cut and still have to pay more than that tax cut in  premium increases is large. What a huge mistake my colleagues made by  eliminating that provision in the healthcare bill, because the middle  class is going to pay the price.   What has been sold as a job creator and wage-booster will do little  of either, as companies--large, big, powerful companies--are already  initiating stock buybacks instead of hiring more workers and raising  wages. Is that what you intended? Give them more money so they can buy  back more stock, increasing the wealth of corporate CEOs, increasing  the wealth of the very wealthy, sending billions of dollars overseas to  overseas investors. That is what is happening already. Corporation  after corporation has said: Aha, with this new money, we will do even  more stock buybacks.   Ultimately, the American people will learn that Republicans have  squandered their so-called ``once-in-a-generation opportunity'' on  corporate welfare and taxes for the rich, financed by tax increases and  healthcare increases on the middle class.   The Joint Committee on Taxation just released a report that found  that by 2027, nearly 145 million middle-class families earning under  $200,000 will either get tax hikes--can we have order, Mr. President?    This is serious stuff. We believe you are messing up  America. You can pay attention for a couple of minutes.   Nearly 145 million middle-class families earning under $200,000 will  get either tax hikes or a tax cut of less than $100. Eighty-three  percent of the middle class will either pay more in taxes or get little  but crumbs. Is that what you intended? Is that this great bill that is  helping the middle class? Absolutely not.   Meanwhile, according to the Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of  earners in our country will reap 83 percent of the benefits of the tax  plan. The top 5 percent--the top 5 percent--will reap 99.2 percent of  the benefits. Is that what you intended? That is what you are doing.  The very, very wealthy--the highest spectrum--get almost all the  benefits. Some bill for the middle class.   The raw numbers are a staggering indictment of the Republican tax  plan, as they have been throughout the course of this debate. The data  reveals what the Republican tax plan truly is--a tax scam that will rob  middle-class families to pay for corporate tax breaks and giveaways to  the wealthy.   In an age of extraordinary income inequality, when the upper echelons  of our economy are capturing an ever-greater share of the pie, the  Republican tax bill is like pouring gasoline on a raging fire, making  income inequality, as bad as it is now, even worse. It will exacerbate  all the bad trends in our economy that over the past few decades have  produced dramatically more wealth for the already wealthy, while  producing less work and less pay for working people. That fundamental  imbalance in our economy will be made even more precarious. What a  disgrace. That is what this bill is. It is an absolute disgrace.   It is not just an ideological difference; it is something  dramatically opposite of what America needs. There is no reason for a  single middle-class family to pay more while every single corporation  pays less. If you want to help the middle class, give them a real tax  break. The rich get far more dollars back than the middle class. That  is fact--an irrefutable fact.   On top of that, as Senator Wyden warned everybody a few minutes ago,  this tax bill will endanger Social Security and Medicare. Republicans  have already said, led by Speaker Ryan, that they will use the deficit  they are about to create as an excuse to come after those earned  benefits. The AARP is very reluctant to take stands on bills like this,  but it was so bad for the elderly, the AARP felt compelled to publicly  oppose it.   Elderly Americans are not the only ones who should be worried,  although they certainly should be. If you are 40, 45, or 50, working  hard, trying to put money away for retirement while sending your kids  to college, and you are counting on these programs to be there when you  retire, know this: Cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are  likely to fall on your shoulders because of this monstrosity of a bill.  The Republican tax bill is the first shoe to drop. The second will fall  on the social safety net that allows millions of hard-working Americans  to retire with dignity and security.   For all of these reasons, it is not a surprise that in poll after  poll after poll, the American people overwhelmingly oppose this bill.   My Republican colleagues have done what is nearly impossible. It is a  bad trick, but they have accomplished it.  [[Page S8141]]  They have managed to make a tax cut bill even less popular than  previous tax hikes. Who would have thought they could accomplish that?  Who would have thought? In fact, it is the second-least popular piece  of major legislation in 30 years, opposed 2 to 1 by the American  people, and the more they learn about the bill, the less they like it.  By the way, what was the first? The Republican healthcare bill earlier  this year.   It is not hard to understand why the dark heart of the Republican  policy agenda easing burdens on those who already have so much, while  punishing or ignoring those who have too little, is a profoundly  unpopular idea. My Republican friends ought to listen to the American  people, the fount of wisdom in our democracy, or there will be a  reckoning.   The American people do not believe in trickle-down, as all of you  seem to. Give the very top money, and they will create jobs. It hasn't  happened. AT&T--do you know what their tax rate was over the last 10  years? Eight percent. Do you know how many jobs they created? Zero.  They cut 80,000 people. Let's give them more money while hurting the  middle class. It makes no sense.   The American people are saying in a loud, clear voice that they  oppose tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy. They don't believe  in trickle-down, as you do. They oppose gutting healthcare, as you want  to do, and they oppose this one-party approach to legislating. The  American people know that a slapdash partisan process will not result  in good law. My Republican colleagues ignore the warnings of the  American people at their own peril.   In just a short time, Republicans will have a choice whether or not  to affix their name to this awful legislation. Although the Republican  propagandists may call its passage a political victory, it will be very  fleeting and illusory. The substance and polling are so rotten that a  year from now, Republicans will be running away from this bill in shame  for voting yes this evening.   There is an alternative: Vote no. Come to the table with Democrats.  Begin serious, bipartisan talks on tax reform. Get a good bill, and  work in the way this Chamber is supposed to work: bipartisan, moderate,  thoughtful, open. You have done none of those--none of those.   I have little faith that, at this late hour, my colleagues will  choose the better course, but if they do, we could do something great  for the country and for this body at the same time. We could return to  regular order, where the legitimate policy differences between our  parties are argued in broad daylight, and with painstaking effort, we  compromise even after we fiercely debate one another. Isn't that what  we came here to do?   I challenge a single one of my Republican colleagues to say they are  proud of the way this tax bill was written and passed. I challenge a  single one. I know this isn't what they would like to see. I know this  isn't what so many of you came here to do. I know it is not what you  tell your constituents the Senate ought to be. I know so many of you  lament the steady erosion of bipartisanship here in the Senate, as do  I, as do my fellow Democrats. So rather than resign to the failures of  the current moment, I plead--plead--with my Republican colleagues to  imagine a better path forward. Vote no. Vote no and prevent taxes from  going up on millions of middle-class families. Vote no and stop 13  million Americans from going without health insurance. Vote no, so we  don't add $1.5 trillion to the deficit, putting the burden on our  children and grandchildren. Vote no and say that you want to have the  kind of bipartisan debate befitting the grand traditions of this United  States Senate. Vote no. Otherwise, I believe the entire Republican  Party and each of you will come to rue this day.   I yield the floor.   I yield back all time.                           Vote on Motion to Waive
