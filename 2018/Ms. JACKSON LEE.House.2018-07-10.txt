 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 644, which  strongly condemns ongoing slave auctions in Libya of migrants and  refugees.   Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we swiftly and unequivocally condemn  these acts of unspeakable cruelty that have no place in the civilized  world.   According to reports, an estimated 150,000 people--refugees fleeing  conflict and economic migrants in search of better opportunities in  Europe--cross Libya's borders each year.   But a clampdown by the Libyan Coast Guard meant fewer boats made it  out to sea, leaving the smugglers with a backlog of would-be passengers  on their hands.   With estimates of 400,000 to almost one million people now stranded  in Libya, smugglers have become masters and the migrants and refugees  have become slaves who are sold for as little as $400 each.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with this chamber the story of a  young man named Victory, a 21-year-old Nigerian who fled his village  and spent a year and four months--and his life savings--trying to reach  Europe.   Victory made it as far as Libya, where he says he and other refugees  were held in grim living conditions, deprived of food, abused, and  mistreated by their captors.   When his funds ran out, Victory was sold as a day laborer by his  smugglers; after weeks of being forced to work, Victory was told the  money he had been bought for was not enough.   He was returned to his smugglers, only to be re-sold several more  times--the smugglers also demanded ransom payments from Victory's  family before eventually releasing him.   We know of at least 9 sites in which these horrors reportedly are  commonplace.   The open sale of humans into slavery exposed in Libya in 2017 shocked  the world.   United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley denounced the practice, saying  ``there are few greater violations of human rights and human dignity  than this.''   However, without a capable government in the country, the practice  has continued unabated while media interest ebbed.   Mr. Speaker, it is contrary to the values of this nation to stand by  and watch these atrocities continue.   H. Res. 644 denounces the trafficking of--and violence against-- innocent migrants in Libya, and proposes several concrete measures to a  lasting infrastructure that upholds basic human rights for migrants in  Libya.   First, the resolution calls on the Libyan government to investigate  and end the slave auctions, as well as provide for humane management of  migration flows.   Second, the resolution calls upon the United Nations to investigate  the allegations of forced labor and demands that Libyan authorities to  allow the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to regularly monitor  and publicly report on the situation of refugees and migrants in Libya,  and impose sanctions against Libya if the nation fails to end forced  labor.   Third, the resolution calls upon the African Union to conduct an  independent investigation of forced labor in Libya, to assist migrants  who wish to return to their homelands, and to impose sanctions against  Libya should the forced labor continue.   Fourth, the resolution highlights the importance of adequately  staffing, funding, and supporting the United States State Department  and the Agency for International Development to provide humanitarian  assistance for migrants and to develop a comprehensive strategy to  address the political and security situation in Libya including issues  related to migrants and refugees in detention centers.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H. Res. 644 and  standing true to our nation's commitment to advancing human rights in  Libya, and around the world.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1700,  the SCORE for Small Business Act of 2017.   H.R. 1700 amends the Small Business Act to reauthorize the SCORE  program (Service Corps of Retired Executives) for FY2018-FY2019.   The program is renamed as simply the SCORE program.   The Small Business Administration (SBA) shall award a grant to the  SCORE Association (or any successor group) in order to strengthen  resources for entrepreneurs.   By passing this bill, we are ensuring that the program and each of  its chapters develop and implement plans and goals to provide services  more effectively and efficiently to individuals in rural areas,  economically disadvantaged communities, and other traditionally  underserved communities.   Such requirements includes plans for electronic initiatives, web- based initiatives, chapter expansion, partnerships, and the development  of new skills by participating volunteers.   The SBA's SCORE program embodies the power of public-private  partnerships and is dedicated to educating and assisting entrepreneurs  and small business owners in the formation, growth and expansion of  their small businesses.   I want to thank all the trained volunteers that serve as counselor's  advisors and mentors to aspiring entrepreneurs and business owners.   Further, there are approximately 13,000 volunteer business counselors  with 348 chapters across the country.   Established in 1965, the Houston chapter has more than 130+  volunteers covering the 9-county Greater Houston Area.   These services are offered at no fee, as a community service.   According to the SCORE Association, in FY13, SCORE estimates that it  served over 400,000 clients, and helped to create more than 40,500 new  businesses and more than 67,098 new jobs.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1700 as it is  vital that we support.    Mr. Speaker, headlines of the New York Times:  ``Conservatives Close in on Three-Decade Dream: Tipping Court to the  Right.''   Mr. Speaker, no court should be to the right or to the left. It  should be for the American people.   I ask the Senate, and I commit to my constituents, to fight for a  thorough and long review of the nominee's record, and to determine  whether we are now appointing to the court a political biased  aficionado; a person who has worked in politics and as well has shown  his bias by way of his extensive and detailed and over-the-top report  in the Starr report.   It will be interesting to find whether Mr. Kavanaugh has concern  about all of America, because the Supreme Court holds in his hands that  responsibility.   The USA Today says, ``Family Separation Combines Cruelty and  Incompetence.''   I ask for the Secretary of Homeland Security to immediately come to  the House of Representatives, and I ask the Speaker to provide that  opportunity for him to be able to speak to us about why he has lost  children and why they are separated from their families.   We need to stop the shooting of babies by those who leave guns for 2- year-olds to shoot themselves.                            ____________________
