 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to speak as in morning business.    Mr. President, I want to start by addressing the news  last night that Republican leaders have decided to try to make their  awful TrumpCare legislation even worse. TrumpCare wasn't enough of a  giveaway to insurance companies, and it didn't do enough harm to women,  seniors, and people with preexisting conditions, so Republican leaders  decided to double down in efforts to appeal to their extreme  conservative base.   They are now claiming that they can take away essential health  benefits like maternity care, mental health care, and preexisting  conditions through the reconciliation process, but here are the facts:  Republican leaders know, just as Democrats do, that measures to take  away these critically important protections cannot survive the  reconciliation process and could never get 60 votes in the Senate. They  are simply trying to sell conservatives a bill of goods today in the  rush to jam this through, but the more they scramble, the more harmful  this bill gets for patients and families and the worse it will be for  any House Republican who will be held accountable for their votes on  it.   As we all know, today marks 7 years since the Affordable Care Act was  signed into law. While some here in Congress may view this as an ideal  opportunity to ram through a reckless, harmful repeal of the law, I,  for one, think about today a little differently.   I remember 7 years ago, standing with a young constituent of mine  from Seattle, Marci Owens, as we watched President Obama sign the  Affordable Care Act into law. I had met Marci when she was about 11  years old, in the midst of some of the most heated moments of the  healthcare reform debate, and to this day, I will never forget the  story she told me about her mom, who all of a sudden had become sick,  was forced to miss work, and because of that, she lost her job and lost  her health insurance. Ultimately, because she wasn't even able to see a  doctor or get any care, she died as a result of her illness.   I took that story with me, along with countless other stories of  families unable to access care, pay for medication, or see a doctor. I  used them as motivation as my colleagues and I worked tirelessly to  pass the Affordable Care Act.   Just last month, I was proud to have Marci, who is now 18, attend  President Trump's joint address to Congress as my guest. Today, Marci  is still sharing her story and advocating for affordable healthcare, as  well as transgender rights. She, along with millions of others across  the country, is once again standing up, speaking out, and making it  clear that we cannot go backward.   I come to the Senate floor to share some of the stories of families  in my home State of Washington who are worried, who are afraid, and  whose lives will be at risk if President Trump and Republicans take us  down this dangerous path to repeal, people whose voices need to be  heard more than ever.   I want to make it very clear why we are here and what is at stake.  The House Republican TrumpCare bill would have a profoundly negative  impact on the lives and the well-being and the financial security of  people across the country, people who are truly terrified about the  uncertain path forward. Yet, for having such a profound impact,  Republicans are seemingly doing everything they can to limit public  discussion on TrumpCare. This bill was rushed through four House  committees without a single public hearing, no testimony, no expert  view. House Republicans voted the bill out of two of these committees  without a CBO score, without knowing how many people would be impacted.   In the Senate this week, every Senate Democrat on the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee called on the chairman to  allow for a hearing to talk about this bill, but he refused. He ignored  the request, and he held a hearing on other health policy instead. That  the Health Committee--the Health Committee--has not been allowed to  hold a single hearing to talk about and debate TrumpCare is appalling  and shameful.   Not to be outdone, of course, the majority leader, instead of  committing to give all Senators time to review and evaluate the bill,  has now said the bill will go straight to the floor for a vote as soon  as next week, prompting even Members of his own party to come out  against this plan.   In all, these efforts are unprecedented. They are wrong, and they  speak volumes about the kind of bill they are trying to ram through,  because we now know many of the facts of the bill.   This bill will kick 24 million people off their coverage. It will  cause premiums to skyrocket. Seniors will pay more for their care. It  will put at risk those who are struggling with mental illness and  substance use disorders, including opioid addiction. It would end  Medicaid as we know it.   Predictively, it attacks women's constitutionally protected  healthcare and rights. It defunds Planned Parenthood and puts insurance  companies back in charge of other critical parts of women's healthcare,  including maternity care, cancer screenings, and contraception. This  bill undermines women's access to healthcare and women's ability to  make their own healthcare decisions in virtually every way a piece of  legislation could.   I oppose this bill in the strongest terms. I am going to be doing  everything I can to fight back against it, and I know Senate Democrats  will as well.   Families across the country are looking to us, and they have nowhere  else to turn. Like many of my colleagues, I have constituents coming up  to me constantly when I am at home, asking me what is going to happen  if TrumpCare becomes law. They are bravely sharing deeply personal  stories about their health, their families, and their fears--something  they should not have to do. They deserve to be heard.   Erin Zerba from my home State of Washington deserves to be heard. She  has been a teacher for 19 years and teaches in two rural school  districts, but because of her part-time standing in both districts, she  is ineligible for insurance. If it weren't for the Medicaid expansion  under the Affordable Care Act, she would have no options.   As Erin puts it, she is ``terrified'' to learn that Medicaid would be  gutted under TrumpCare. She has multiple disabilities, including autism  and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. She has had repeated surgeries following a  difficult pregnancy. The medication she has to take every day is very  expensive. There is no generic form. She is one of those millions of  people.   I have to say that we are going to fight back in every way we can  because the TrumpCare bill that is being rushed through the House with  giveaways being given to Senators for their votes is not the way we  take care of people in this country. I am deeply worried about the  process of this bill.   I see the Democratic leader on the floor, and I know how important it  is for him to speak. I just want to say, as the ranking member on the  Health Committee, it is appalling to me that we have had no hearings,  no expert witnesses, no markup. We have not seen this bill, and it is  being rushed through. It will impact every single American and deserves  the time of day, not some created chaos and deadline timeline that was  created simply to fulfill a campaign promise and not to do the right  thing for the American people.
