 Mr. President, today Senator Crapo of Idaho, Senator  Merkley of Oregon, Senator Risch of Idaho, and I are introducing the  Forest Management for Rural Stability Act. This legislation replaces  the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act (SRS) to  provide revenue sharing with and compensation to over 700 rural  forested counties in the over 40 States that host America's treasured,  public forested lands and wildlife refuges.   In 2000, then-Senator Larry Craig, also of Idaho, and I, had signed  into law SRS: a 6-year long safety-net program to stabilize county  budgets following years of depleted revenue sharing payments from the  U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the Oregon and California Grant Lands  managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Over its lifetime,  SRS has been a success, providing more than $6.8 billion nationwide for  rural roads, schools, and healthy forest projects. SRS also provided  the basis for the beginning of, and the now growing propensity for, the  USFS and the BLM to collaborate with local people and interests on the  management of these public lands, and for local folks and counties to  collaborate together and with the USFS and BLM, in return.   Despite its many successes, the continuation of SRS is in jeopardy.  The program expired in fiscal year 2016. Congress passed a two-year  extension of the program, but after its expiration. And this was not  the first time nor the last time Congress allowed it to expire--SRS is  expired right now, though Senator Crapo and I are attempting, in these  last moments of the 115th Congress, to reauthorize it again for at  least a year, perhaps two.   This stop and start existence of this program hits at the heart of  any attempts at collaboration. And it certainly undermines any attempts  for a county to budget. Our rural counties should not continue to  suffer neither this uncertainty, nor the market based uncertainty that  comes with simply relying on revenue sharing and forest management for  support.   That is why Senator Crapo and I propose an SRS modernization, funding  certainty while supporting active forest management. The Forest  Management for Rural Stability Act establishes a permanent endowment  fund,  [[Page S3110]]  the Natural Resources Permanent Fund, to provide stable, reliable,  increasing payments to counties, in perpetuity, removing them from the  vagaries of Congress or the market.   Under this legislation, Congress charters a fiduciary corporation,  the Forest and Refuge County Foundation, to manage the endowed fund.  The corporation will be independent from any instrumentality of the  U.S. government, including Congress, to ensure the principle balance is  held in perpetuity and is separate from annual appropriations. The  corporation will be overseen by a board of directors responsible for a  transparent governance structure. The principle of the fund will be  invested to earn interest. To grow the fund, in addition to the  investment income, the USFS, BLM, and the Fish and Wildlife Service  will deposit their annual revenue sharing receipts into the fund. The  interest the fund generates will constitute the payments to the  counties, distributed annually using the existing SRS formula. Initial  payments to counties will be equal what counties received for Fiscal  Year 2017 SRS payments.   The Forest Management for Rural Stability Act continues Congress's  commitment to fostering economic growth in rural counties by continuing  Forest Service Resource Advisory Committees. In addition, the bill  gives county governments greater flexibility in how these funds are  spent for economic development and rural jobs.   Passing the Forest Management for Rural Stability Act will update SRS  for 2018 and beyond--looking forward for our forested counties, rather  than backward to last century efforts.   This bill updates an already successful program that deserves action.  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Leahy,          Ms. Warren, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr.          Merkley, and Mr. Schatz):   S. 1649. A bill to restore protections for Social Security, Railroad  retirement, and Black Lung benefits from administrative offset; to the  Committee on Finance.    Mr. President, Social Security provides vital benefits to  millions of Americans who work and pay into the system with each  paycheck. Because Social Security is fundamental to workers' retirement  security, the law protected benefits from creditors. The only  exceptions were unpaid Federal taxes, child support or alimony  payments, and court-ordered victim restitution. These protections  ensured that the social safety net programs would be there for basic  needs. That protection was weakened over 20 years ago when the law was  changed. Now, more and more seniors face cuts in their Social Security  benefits because of student loan debts. The Wall Street Journal  recently highlighted the issue with an article titled, ``Over 60, and  Crushed by Student Loan Debt.'' We need to take action to restore the  strong protections to Social Security and other benefit programs.   We now realize what a profound effect the loss of these protections  has had on retirees and individuals with disabilities, who often live  on fixed incomes. More and more seniors and people with disabilities  are having their Social Security and other lifeline benefits taken away  to pay Federal debts. For example, according to recent data from the  U.S. Bureau of Fiscal Service, over 167,000 Americans had their  benefits garnished for student loan debt. Those 167,000 had nearly $200  million garnished from their earned benefits. This is just the tip of  the iceberg as more Americans start receiving benefits. Between 2008  and 2018, the number of individuals whose Social Security benefits were  offset to pay student loans debt increased by 133 percent, from about  72,000 to 169,000. Over that same period, the amount collected from  Social Security benefits ballooned from almost $63 million to nearly  $200 million, a 217 percent increase.   Social Security plays a critical role in keeping seniors and people  with disabilities out of poverty. In Oregon alone, Social Security cuts  the poverty rate of the elderly from about 35 percent to 5 percent.  However, despite Social Security's critical role in the safety net,  close to 1 out of every 10 seniors over age 65 and 1 in 5 disabled  workers still live in poverty and that is simply unacceptable.   I, along with Senators Brown, Whitehouse, Leahy, Warren, Hirano,  Sanders, Gillibrand, Merkley, and Schatz are reintroducing the  Protection of Social Security Benefits Restoration Act. The bill would  restore the strong protections in the law that prevented the government  from taking earned benefits to pay Federal non-tax debts, and help  ensure beneficiaries will be able to maintain a basic standard of  living. The bill is supported by AARP, the National Committee to  Preserve Social Security and Medicare, National Association of  Disability Representatives, AFL-CIO, National Organization of Social  Security Claimants' Representatives, Social Security Works, National  Organization for Women, Justice in Aging, American Federation of  Teachers, Alliance for Retired Americans, Economic Policy Institute.   I ask Unanimous Consent that a letter from the National Committee to  Preserve Social Security and Medicare endorsing our bill be printed in  the Record.                                                       May 15, 2019.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Wyden: On behalf of the millions of members       and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social       Security and Medicare, I write to endorse your bill the       ``Protection of Social Security Benefits Restoration Act.''        Since the inception of the Social Security program in 1935,       the Social Security Act provided strong protections against       loss of retirement income through the garnishment or       attachment of Social Security benefits for the purpose of       recovering debts owed by retirees. For decades the law       provided near iron-clad protection against impoverishment in       old age due to debt collection.        Unfortunately, in 1996 the Congress reversed course by       authorizing the garnishment of Social Security and other       earned benefits for the purpose of collecting debts owed by       seniors to the federal government. Figuring prominently in       this matter is the recovery of student loan debts from       seniors who are living on their all-too-modest monthly Social       Security benefits.        With student loan debt becoming an increasingly serious       problem in this country, we agree with you that now is the       time to act. The Congress must restore the historic       protections that once were provided by Social Security       against the spectacle of impoverishment in old age so that       the federal government can collect debts that all too often       were incurred years, even decades ago.        For these reasons, the National Committee endorses your       bill, the ``Protection of Social Security Benefits       Restoration Act,'' and urges other members of the United       States Senate to cosponsor this vitally important measure. We       thank you for your leadership on this matter and look forward       to working with you to enact this bill.            Sincerely,      Max Richtman,        President and CEO, National Committee to Preserve Social       Security and Medicare.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1649         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
