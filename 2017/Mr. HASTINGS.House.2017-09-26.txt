 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary 30  minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of  H.R. 2824, the Increasing Opportunity Through Evidence-Based Home  Visiting Act; and H.R. 2792, the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act  of 2017.   The first measure, H.R. 2824, reauthorizes the Maternal, Infant, and  Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, or MIECHV, and provides pregnant  women and families access to resources to improve maternal and child  health and promotes child development.   I am glad to see this bill getting the attention that I think we all  agree it deserves, considering the important role the program plays in  all of our communities. However, my concern is that, once again, we are  witnessing my Republican friends take a policy that should garner  broad, bipartisan support and instead scuttle the effort by playing  politics.   H.R. 2824's State matching provision is a threat to the core  existence of this program. Because of this change from the past  authorization, I fear that many States will lose Federal funding and  will be forced to cut off home visiting services altogether.   Where do you propose poorer States with lower investments in home  visiting get the money to meet the matching requirements?   Then, Mr. Speaker, what about Tribal programs? They are especially  vulnerable to the devastation that will be wrought by making them come  up with a 30 percent match. Native American communities struggle  enough, as it is, without having to put up with these absurd  requirements.   I do compliment Mrs. Noem for fighting along with our colleague on  the Rules Committee, Tom Cole, for a 5-year hiatus before they would  have to make the match. But as one who represents two Tribes, the  Seminoles and the Miccosukees, I don't even think, after 5 years, their  vulnerability to devastation is going to be avoided.   Mr. Speaker, I ask: Why are my Republican colleagues again choosing  to abandon bipartisanship in favor of partisan politics?   Our goals should be to reauthorize the vital program, not change  long-established and successful policies that will hurt the most  vulnerable in our country.   This program, as traditionally reauthorized, puts families first in  order to strengthen communities and improve outcomes for kids and their  families. Without the MIECHV Program, at-risk families will suffer.   I strongly support moving quickly to reauthorize this program before  it expires on September 30, 2017. But adding a provision that will make  it impossible for many States to fully participate in this program is  not only not the way forward, it is downright dangerous.   The second measure is H.R. 2792. It is a sidecar bill, as its only  purpose in being considered is to offset the cost of the MIECHV  Program.   H.R. 2792 would reinstate an old, failed policy that had damaging  effects for many seniors and people with disabilities by taking away  Supplemental Security Income benefits from every individual who has an  outstanding felony warrant, regardless of the seriousness of the  alleged violation, the age of the warrant, or the condition of the  recipient.   Mr. Speaker, over 110 national, State, and local organizations have  warned that H.R. 2792 is a cruel bill that could have catastrophic  consequences for some of our most vulnerable citizens.   Everyone can agree that dangerous criminals should not receive public  benefits while fleeing justice. In fact, the Social Security  Administration already provides regular notification to law enforcement  of any beneficiary who has an outstanding warrant. This bill, on the  other hand, despite its title, would harm seniors and people with  severe disabilities, not felons.   Mr. Speaker, a larger issue at hand is not simply the dangerous  policy changes in the first bill, nor the failed unnecessary policy  found in the second, but rather the partisan manner in which these  bills are being considered, especially in the face of the laundry list  of items that this body needs to urgently address in a bipartisan  manner.   We do not have the luxury of time to debate the majority's attempts  to legislate failed and dangerous policies that will threaten families.   We should be acting in the most exigent fashion to address issues  such as ascertaining the full scope of Hurricane Maria's devastation on  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and what we need to do to make  our brothers and sisters in those areas whole again.   We should not be spending our time taking a partisan approach to a  program that provides pregnant women and families access to resources  to improve maternal and child health. Rather, we should be working  across the aisle to address the real pressing issues facing our  country.                                time  1245    Congress should be addressing the plight of the millions of American  citizens living in total devastation in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands.   Five days after Hurricane Maria decimated what Hurricane Irma had  spared, 15,000 people remain in government shelters, thousands of homes  are destroyed, roads are blocked, bridges buckled, and a dam in Puerto  Rico is on the edge of collapse, threatening the lives of nearly 70,000  people with flash flooding. Two hospitals in the Virgin Islands have  been destroyed, and lest I  [[Page H7502]]  not mention that we have not dealt adequately with what is required in  Texas and in southwest Louisiana and in Florida.   Today, in my office, numerous representatives of government officials  and organizations came to present issues concerning ongoing matters  having to do with their concerns in our area. The Speaker of the House  and the chairman of appropriations were with several of us in the  Florida delegation last week to review and view the damage that has  occurred in the Keys. And here we are, rather than dealing with a  humanitarian crisis as towns are left without fresh water, power, and  fuel, we are dealing with a dangerous bill that will address vulnerable  people in a negative way.   Officials reported that 1,360 of Puerto Rico's 1,600 telephone cell  towers are down. The same holds in the Virgin Islands. With 85 percent  of aboveground and underground phone and internet cables knocked out-- the same in the Virgin Islands--officials still had not had  communication with 9 of the 78 municipalities. It has been difficult or  nearly impossible for individuals to reach or connect with their loved  ones.   Let me make something very clear that many Members of the House do  not understand. Everybody cries that FEMA should do all of the things  that we would want it to do as the Federal Emergency Management Agency,  but FEMA today is dealing with 30 disasters in this country.   I sat here a moment ago and heard our colleague from Montana describe  over a million acres of fire ongoing there. In southern California,  there is an extraordinary fire that is taking place in that particular  area.   This devastation, these disasters as in Puerto Rico, the Virgin  Islands, and elsewhere are only cracks of the service of the long to-do  list that Congress is confronted with. The list is long and time is  short.   In addition to the MIECHV program, which the majority has decided to  undermine here today, at the end of the week, the Children's Health and  Insurance Program--CHIP, the Children's Health and Insurance Program-- Medicare provisions, and the Community Health Centers Fund all expire  without any discussion at all in this House. We are leaving not only  our constituents, young and old, and the American people in a quandary  about their health insurance or treatment facilities, but adding  unnecessary anxiety to their lives.   Mr. Speaker, I would argue that the snowball is only going to grow  with the end of the calendar year looming right around the corner.   Let me just remind my colleagues in the majority what needs to be  addressed by December 8: reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance  Program--I don't know what that was yesterday that they were trying to  do with the FAA authorization--an absolute necessity in the wake of  these devastating storms; keeping the government open and EPA pesticide  registration fees. And by the end of the year, we must also act to  reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, which we  now know plays a critical role in the fundamental aspects of our  democracy.   The Affordable Care Act's annual fee on health insurance providers  needs to be addressed, important for the health of the marketplace, and  the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund financing rate.   Now, Democrats stand ready to work in a bipartisan fashion to address  each and every one of the matters that I just talked about, and all of  them must pass pieces of legislation. What we are witnessing today is a  clear indication that my Republican friends do not share the same  spirit, but would rather play politics.   Let me just add one little bit about that. In the other body, the  United States Senate, we saw an example of partisan politics play out  to its extreme, and it is not likely that there is going to be an  important measure dealing with the healthcare of Americans coming from  the United States Senate back to this body that passed something that  was an awful bill earlier in the year.   But what did it do?   It caused Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, who were working on  bipartisan measures, to stop their bipartisan efforts so that we could  go forward in the Senate on a partisan measure that is going nowhere.  People sent us here to work together. They did not send us here to be  partisan in every one of our moves. What we are witnessing here today  is another example of partisanship.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleague will support the  DelBene amendment, which will eliminate the matching funds for Tribes  altogether. I mentioned that earlier.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms.  DeGette), my good friend.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  associate myself with his remarks about everything we need to do by the  end of the fiscal year, which is the end of this week; in particular,  reauthorization of CHIP that has helped so many millions of kids get  health insurance and get the care that they need.   I rise today, though, to talk about the MIECHV bill, which is up  today, and to express my deep disappointment that my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle have chosen to walk away from yet another  opportunity to work on a bipartisan basis. We could extend this program  on a bipartisan basis just the way we started it. It is really a  success story.   The evidence-based models are proven to deliver results for kids and  families in every single State. Investments in MIECHV are investments  in the success of America's children and their futures. Peer-reviewed  evidence proves that MIECHV leads to improvements in health outcomes  for mothers and babies, school achievement, parenting practices, and  overall early childhood development.   On top of all that, MIECHV is a great return on investment for  Federal dollars. For example, for every Federal dollar in the Nurse- Family Partnership, we get $5.70 in return. Sadly, this bill that the  House is considering today would set MIECHV back. The partisan proposal  would make it more difficult for MIECHV models in all of our States to  continue their success stories.   Under current law, MIECHV only has enough funding to reach 6 percent  of eligible families. But instead of working together to help the  program reach more children, this bill curtails the reach. It cuts the  funding and, as my ranking member said, it imposes a harmful State- matching requirement that could force some of these home health visit  programs to shut down altogether.   It is really a shame that when you are talking about healthy starts  for kids, we can't work together on both sides of the aisle. I would  hope we would defeat this legislation and come back and do what we have  done before on this program, work together to have a robust piece of  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is shameful that President Trump would end the DACA program  without a single thought to the consequences  [[Page H7503]]  this decision would have on the 800,000 young lives this program  protects.   Do the American people even want DACA to end?   The answer is clearly no.   According to a Politico/Morning Consult poll: ``Support for allowing  these immigrants to remain in the United States spans across party  lines: 84 percent of Democrats, 74 percent of Independents, and 69  percent of Republicans think they should stay.''   Congress must act to protect our DREAMers.   Well, Mr. Speaker, here is our chance to rectify President Trump's  heartless decision and restore the American people's faith in us. If we  defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. This bipartisan, bicameral  legislation would help thousands of young people who are Americans in  every way except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, through the Chair, I would advise my  friend from Texas that I have no further speakers and that I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We stand here today with a to-do list a mile long, and we don't have  much time to cross items off that list. By kicking the can down the  road on nearly every past piece of legislation, this Republican  majority has shown itself completely unable to govern. They have  abdicated their duty to the American people to accomplish even the most  basic of legislative tasks: passing a budget. Without Democratic help,  they wouldn't be able to even keep the lights on.   My sincere hope is that the next time we meet we will take up  legislation that provides some much-needed relief to our brothers and  sisters in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as my home State  of Florida and Texas and southwest Louisiana; and address the other  disasters that are occurring throughout our country, more specifically  having to do with wildfires in Montana, in Oregon, and in California;  and that we will begin the process of addressing every single one of  the needs of this Nation, particularly its health and its healthcare in  a bipartisan way.   My colleagues on this side of the aisle stand ready to do so. I urge  a ``no'' vote on the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
