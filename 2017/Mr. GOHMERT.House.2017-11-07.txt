 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Biggs. I appreciate  your hosting this hour because this is critical stuff here. This is the  kind of thing that makes or breaks an experiment in self-government  because there is an attempted coup taking place.   We have heard over and over about, oh, gee, Mr. Mueller will come to  a fair and just conclusion. Well, the only fair and just conclusion  that Bob Mueller could come to would be that he should never have  accepted the position of special counsel, that he had conflicts so deep  that accepting the role of special counsel could not be ethical and  appropriate. You wonder, why would he take it?   Well, when you find out that, as FBI Director, he and U.S. Attorney  Rod Rosenstein were involved in the deep cover investigation into  Russia's effort to corner the market using American uranium, and that  Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder and others in the administration  approved the sale to a group, the stockholders of which donated, as I  understand, $145 million or so to the Clinton Foundation, in effect,  the Clintons hit the Russian megalottery--the megamillions lottery from  Russia.                                time  1930    As I understand, $145 million or so to the Clinton Foundation, in  effect, the Clintons hit the Russian mega lottery; the megamillions  lottery from Russia, and just a little tease was the half-a-million- dollar fee for just giving one little, short speech by Bill Clinton.   But if we look back at what has gone on, just look at some of the  facts, it was shocking that FBI Director Comey did not have Cheryl  Mills interviewed. She was Clinton's former Chief of Staff at the State  Department. Now we are finding out, well, I guess, gee, if Comey was  going to draft a statement saying that there was not sufficient  evidence to prosecute Hillary Clinton before he ever talked to Cheryl  Mills or talked to Hillary Clinton or followed up on the most critical  evidence, then clearly it makes sense why Director Comey would not want  to make Cheryl Mills' interview recorded, and would make an agreement  with Cheryl Mills and the other potential defendants in the case that,  gee, if they just got a look at their laptops, they promised they  wouldn't use anything in the laptop to prosecute them, and the FBI  would then, under Comey's direction, would actually participate in the  obstruction and destruction of evidence so that nobody could ever use  it against any of them.   Now, originally, we thought that might only be Hillary Clinton. But  as we find out, gee, Mr. Mueller, Mr. Comey, and Mr. Rosenstein were in  this up to their eyeballs when it came to the Russian investigation  regarding uranium. If they were doing their jobs, they should never,  ever have allowed that sale of American uranium to go to a company that  they knew would end up in Russian hands.   So if you look at Cheryl Mills, Heather Samuelson, John Bentel, Bryan  Pagliano, and Paul Combetta, these are people who were potential  targets. And what does Director Comey do?   He makes sure that they walk. Because if they were properly  interviewed, like good prosecutors or good investigators normally do,  you start there and you say: You help us with what happened and what  you were told by the person above you, and then we won't prosecute you  to the full extent of the law.   That is how deals are made. That is how you get to a Mr. Big in a  racketeer organized confederation.   Mr. Comey and the FBI apparently relied on the Fusion GPS  investigation knowing where it came from and knowing who paid for it.  This is incredible.   If you go back to the Washingtonian article of 2013, it makes pretty  clear that Comey and Mueller were basically joined at the hip.   In fact, a quote back in 2013 says: ``The stressed Comey had few  people he could turn to for advice; almost no one was allowed to know  the program existed, and disclosing the program's existence to someone  outside that circle could send him to prison. In fact, there was only  one person in government whom he could confide in and trust: Bob  Mueller.''   ``Comey thought, `A freight train is heading down the tracks, about  to derail me, my family, and my career.' He glanced to his left at his  fellow passenger, thinking, `At least Bob Mueller will be standing on  the tracks with me.' ''   ``The crisis over, Comey and Mueller shared a dark laugh.''   Well, it is not quite so amusing when you look at the stakes and  whether or not this little experiment in self-government will continue.  For example, we know that Comey admitted in testimony before Congress  before the Senate that he had leaked information in order to get a  special counsel appointed. That was his dear friend who would stand  beside him through thick and thin, Bob Mueller. This brought memories  of when Mr. Comey urged his boss, John Ashcroft, to recuse himself and  let them appoint a special counsel. So Ashcroft trusted Comey. He  probably shouldn't have, but he did.   Then Comey saw to it that his child's godfather, Patrick Fitzgerald,  would be the prosecutor. Much like Mueller, he got massive amounts of  money and a great powerful staff so they could go after Karl Rove and  Vice President Cheney. They were embarrassed there was no case there,  so they made up one on Scooter Libby, and he became the fall guy.   But we know from the leak that Comey admitted that he used an ex-U.S.  Attorney, identified as Columbia University professor Daniel Richman,  to leak to The New York Times the contents of the memo Comey wrote.   If you look at the FBI contract with agents and with people employed  by the FBI, it makes it very clear that memo that Comey prepared about  his conversation with the President was not supposed to ever be  provided to the press. That is FBI property, and he violated the law in  leaking it.   But if you look, then-professor Daniel Richman got that to The New  York Times author Michael Schmidt, who later wrote the Comey memo story  in which Comey told Congress he directed Richman to leak.   Well, if you go back through and you start looking for this common  thread, Michael Schmidt writing stories for The New York Times about  leaks, then you find a number of cases where it appears likely. Whether  it is March 1, March 4, March 5, March 6, it appears likely that this  was James Comey leaking again.   The only question is: Did he commit a crime in one or all of those  events?   The answer is: We will never know as long as Bob Mueller is special  counsel. He needs to have the decency to say that it was a mistake for  me to take this on, it was a mistake when Comey testified there was no  evidence of any collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians, it was  a mistake for him to leak out that night that now he is investigating  the President for obstruction of justice.   Why would he do that?   So he wouldn't get fired, because there was no purpose in his  investigation.   Why would he indict people when he did?   Because even The Wall Street Journal and others around this town  began to say: Do you know what? Mueller really should resign.   He had to get those indictments out quick so people would not keep  calling for his resignation. Well, some of us are. We have got to clean  this town up, and it will start with the resignation of Mr. Mueller and  a proper investigation of all of this underlying case involving Comey,  Lynch, the Clintons, Russia, and Rod Rosenstein who oversaw the Russia  case before he decided to seal it.
