 Mr. Speaker, 10 years and 17 days ago, I was given the  honor of working for the people of Texas 22 in Washington, D.C. They  are my bosses. And one of my bosses was born on January 30 of 1918. His  name is Al Towns.   Al was alive during World War I. Al fought in World War II. He  started as a lowly private. Twenty-two years later, he retired as an O- 6, a full bird colonel.   Al then joined NASA and helped us go to the Moon in 1969.   At Al's 101st birthday party next week, I am sure he will share  pearls of wisdom, like: ``If you want to get something done, give it to  a woman. She may step on some toes, but she will get it done.'' Or, the  key to living to 101 years old: ``Don't think too far ahead.''   Mr. Speaker, Texas 22 says to Al, ``Roger that. Wilco. Happy  birthday.''   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
