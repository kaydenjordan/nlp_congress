 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a former  female athlete, mother of two daughters who are athletes, lifelong  runner, and former coach of girls' sports teams. This week we will vote  on a bill to protect women and girls' sports. I led a similar bill in  the Virginia Senate and look forward to supporting this measure in the  U.S. House.   I feel passionately about this issue and want to convey how important  it is to protect women's sports for future generations.  [[Page H1770]]    This bill is not about discriminating against any group of people,  but rather protecting the benefits of allowing biological girls to push  themselves and bond over a shared physical goal. Allowing women to  excel in a physical activity promotes teamwork, sportsmanship, and  self-confidence. Women's sports offer opportunities for young girls to  discover their strengths and teach them that hard work pays off.   Title IX protected these opportunities and allowed young women in  this country to compete and win in fair fields of play. Biological men  and women are physically different and should be respected for those  differences.   Failing to acknowledge these differences takes away opportunities for  girls and women to succeed on the playing field. We cannot allow this  to happen.   I am proud to support the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports  Act, and I strongly urge all of my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
