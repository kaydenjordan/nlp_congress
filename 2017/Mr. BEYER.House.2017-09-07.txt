 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 134, strike lines 17 through 25.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment seeks to preserve our current  Clean Water Act protections for our rivers, streams, and wetlands. Our  Nation's river systems and wetlands provide values that no other  ecosystem can. These include: natural water quality improvement, flood  protection, shoreline erosion control, recreation, general aesthetic  appreciation, and natural products for our use at no cost.   Yet section 430 of this bill seeks to undermine the critical balance  between protecting these waters and the day-to-day operations of our  Nation's farmers, ranchers, and foresters. Under current law, farmers,  ranchers, and foresters can carry out their normal operations in any  waterbody without securing a Clean Water Act permit.   So what this means is farmers can continue to plow their fields,  including potential wet areas that have been farmed for decades, plant  their seeds, harvest their crops, without ever having to obtain  approval under the Clean Water Act.   Any normal farming, ranching, and forestry exemption is going to  include minor limitations. For example, a farmer cannot use the current  exemption to convert his farmland to a residential development without  obtaining a permit. And a rancher can't use the exemption to plow under  a wetland to expand his reach of grazing lands. And forestry operations  cannot use this exemption to change the course of a local stream to  improve drainage on their growing lands.   In short, the way the Clean Water Act currently operates is to allow  normal ranching, farming, forestry operations to continue without a  permit, unless the activities either change or convert the use of the  waterbody to a new purpose, or impair the historic flow or reach of a  stream or wetland.   So if the planned activity triggers any of these limitations, the  current law requires the activity to obtain a permit. That is perfectly  reasonable. But section 430 of this bill would, in essence, provide an  absolute clean water exemption for impacts to any streams or wetlands  that happen to be on agriculture, ranching, or forestry lands,  regardless if they have any relation to these activities.   Mr. Chairman, this is a fundamental change to the Clean Water Act,  and one where the impacts have never been explored. When the EPA was  asked what the impact of this amendment would be, here was their  response:         This amendment would be a significant departure from almost       40 years of implementation of the Clean Water Act by       eliminating the existing provision requiring that the       exemptions apply only to normal, as in established or       ongoing, farming practices.    This change could result in the loss or impairment of thousands of  acres of valuable wetlands and other waters where land is converted to  agriculture.   Mr. Chairman, we should not be using an appropriations bill to change  Federal policy related to the protection of our Nation's rivers and  streams. To the best of my knowledge, no hearings or investigations on  the impacts of this provision have been held.  [[Page H7150]]    If this Congress is interested in overturning almost 40 years of  Clean Water Act precedent, regular order would require hearings before  the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which has  sole jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act, and approval by that  committee before consideration on the floor.   This rider is bad policy for the protection of our environment, for  the protection of human health, and bad policy for the protection of  our public safety.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the perspective of the chairman of  the Appropriations Subcommittee on this. I think our clear  understanding is that the exemptions, as currently written, allow for  all normal farming, ranching, forestry activities, and that the permit  would only be required when there is a substantial difference from the  activity as it has gone on before, and that this is the way the law has  been interpreted and enforced for the last 40 years.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 135, strike lines 1 through 23.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike section 431.   Section 431 does two things. First, it withdraws the Clean Water  Rule. Second, and more importantly, it breaks procedure and creates a  loophole so that the removal of the Clean Water Rule does not have to  abide by the Administrative Procedure Act.   In essence, we are creating a loophole to eliminate a rule, a rule  requested by the Supreme Court and one that took several years to put  together. This elimination without allowing tweaks, thoughtful removal,  or comment is a radical and dangerous precedent.   In fact, 80 Members of Congress and I actually asked for an extension  of the 30-day comment period to eliminate the Clean Water Rule to allow  the American people to have a say. The Trump administration agreed with  us and extended the comment period an additional 30 days. I don't get  to say that too often.   So clearly, there is a desire for a comment period, as evidenced by  our letter and the administration's decision to appropriately extend  the comment period, but the language in this bill would eliminate that  process completely.   I include in the Record the request for extension.                                      Congress of the United States,                                     Washington, DC, June 29, 2017.      Re Request for Extension of Comment Period on EPA and Corps           Proposed Rule Defining Waters of the United States under           the Clean Water Act.       Administrator Scott Pruitt,      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),      Washington, DC.       Attention: Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OW-2017-0203        Dear Administrator Pruitt: We request a minimum 90 day       extension to the proposed 30-day comment period to rescind       the 2015 Clean Water Rule, 80 Fed. Reg. 37054 (Jun. 29,       2015).        The Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps       of Engineers (Corps) finalized the Clean Water Rule to       clarify the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water       Act. The EPA and the Corps solicited comments on the Rule for       over 200 days. In accordance with Administrative Procedure       Act, the agencies first established a public comment period       for 90 days and extended the comment period twice in response       to extension requests. The final rule reflected over 1       million public comments on the proposal, the substantial       majority of which supported the Clean Water Rule.        The agencies also initiated an extensive public outreach       effort, including over 400 meetings across the nation with       various stakeholders, including but not limited to: states,       small businesses, farmers, academics, miners, energy       companies, counties, municipalities, environmental       organizations, and other federal agencies. The agencies       incorporated these comments into the final Clean Water Rule.        President Trump's Executive Order 13778 directs EPA and the       Corps to evaluate whether to revise or rescind the Clean       Water Rule, ``as appropriate and consistent with law.'' We       ask that as you examine the Clean Water Rule, like the prior       administration, you engage in a thoughtful and comprehensive       process bound in scientific fact.        Americans depend on clean water for their health and       livelihood. More than 117 million Americans rely upon       drinking water from public water systems that draw supply       from headwater, seasonal, or rain-dependent streams that were       vulnerable to pollution before the Clean Water Rule. As such,       the decision to roll back the Clean Water Rule cannot be made       in haste.        We are concerned that the EPA has provided limited time and       opportunity for stakeholder involvement and official public       comment. Any proposed rulemaking must include sufficient time       and participation to gather input from concerned and affected       parties, including those whose legal rights and       responsibilities will be affected by this effort. For       example, the 2015 Clean Water Rule provided legal certainty       that regulatory-defined water features, such as stormwater       control features, wastewater recycling structures, and       puddles, are not covered by the Clean Water Act. However,       that certainty would be eliminated if the 2015 Clean Water       Rule were rescinded.        Given the history of engagement on this issue and the fact       that parties may be subject to greater regulatory uncertainty       by this effort, a comment period of 30 days does not allow       for meaningful engagement from the public and stakeholders.        The Clean Water Rule is robust and ensures that water       sources are protected by taking into account the connected       systems of water, from wetlands and seasonal bodies of water       to large rivers and lakes. The requirements of the Rule were       meticulously developed and addressed longstanding       uncertainty, improving our national commitment to protect not       only America's water, but the American people. If the Clean       Water Rule is revised or rescinded, the process must be       comprehensive and deliberative.        We ask that you take into consideration the opinions of the       American public by extending the comment period, allowing for       respectful debate. We look forward to hearing from you.            Sincerely,        Donald S. Beyer Jr., Brenda L. Lawrence, Gerald E. Connoll,       Grace F. Napolitano, Matthew A.

So is this our new status quo, that once an industry  decides it doesn't like how a regulation turns out, we eliminate that  regulation without comment or consideration for the various  stakeholders or its value.   We are eliminating the process here that we, Congress, put in place  to ensure that those regulations were being considered, adjusted, or  even removed, that they were done thoughtfully and while keeping  stakeholders, like the American people, in mind.   It could be any rule, but the rule at stake this time is the Clean  Water Rule. Over 100 Members of Congress joined me to reinforce the  value of the Clean Water Rule, because without it, the streams that  help supply public drinking water serving one in three Americans will  be at risk.   Rolling back the Clean Water Rule cannot be made in haste and without  stakeholder input. Clarity was needed in light of the Supreme Court  rulings in 2001 and 2006 about uncertainty of the scope of the waters  protected under the act.   The EPA and the Corps held a lengthy and inclusive public rulemaking  process, 200 days of public comment, 400 meetings across the Nation,  and the rule reflected over 1 million public comments on the proposal,  the substantial majority of which supported the Clean Water Rule.   So we are overruling, essentially, 1 million comments and 400  meetings to do this without the appropriate administrative process.   So if it is withdrawn, I simply ask that the process be comprehensive  and deliberative, and the bill does not allow for that.   With this rule at stake, this time it is the Clean Water Rule, but it  could be any rule going forward.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from Members of Congress  to Administrator Scott Pruitt opposing the proposed rule to rescind the  Clean Water Rule.                                  Congress of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, August 18, 2017.      Hon. Scott Pruitt,      Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington,           DC.        Dear Administrator Pruitt: We write in opposition to the       proposed rule rescinding the Clean Water Rule (Docket No.EPA-      HQ-OW-2017-0203), also called the Waters of the United States       (WOTUS) rule. Americans need an Environmental Protection       Agency that will use the best possible science to protect our       health and this nation's natural heritage. This rule to       rescind WOTUS and reports of plans to reduce protections       under the Clean Water Act are deeply concerning. Rather than       protecting Americans, these actions ignore science and       undermine our clean drinking water, our public health and our       outdoor recreation economy.        The Clean Water Rule finalized by the Obama Administration       protects the drinking water of roughly one-third of       Americans. 117 million people rely on drinking water sources       fed by headwater, intermittent or ephemeral streams--      waterways protected under the Clean Water Rule. Rescinding       this rule puts Americans' health at risk by endangering their       drinking water.        Eliminating this rule also threatens our safe access to the       great outdoors and the outdoor recreation economy, which       generates $887 billion in consumer spending annually and       supports 7.6 million American jobs. Pollution in unprotected       streams and wetlands can threaten the health of the lakes and       rivers that our constituents use for swimming, boating and       other recreation. Wetlands protected under the Clean Water       Rule provide some of the country's best habitat for hunters       and anglers. As EPA Administrator, it is imperative to       protect the water bodies that our constituents use for       recreation, both to protect public health and the millions of       jobs these places have helped create.        Rescinding this clean water safeguard ignores science.       Years of research and peer-reviewed science have told us that       intermittent and ephemeral streams and wetlands provide       critical services, from filtering our drinking water to       protecting communities from flood and drought. They also       connect directly to major waterways, which means they can       pose a danger to drinking water and recreation if polluted or       degraded. The science is clear--what we do to these water       bodies impacts large, continuous water sources.        Americans agree that we should protect these waterways. The       previous Administration crafted the Clean Water Rule using       the comments of over one million Americans, the vast majority       of which were in support of the rule. Some opponents have       used scare tactics to confuse the public by stating that       there are new requirements for agriculture and that the rule       covers new types of waters. This is not the case. In reality,       the rule provides certainty over streams and wetlands that       have historically been covered by the Clean Water Act while       preserving agricultural and other common sense exemptions,       including for things like drainage ditches and stock watering       ponds on dry land.        The Clean Water Rule is a science-based rule that keeps our       communities safe and our natural resources protected--exactly       what Congress intended the Clean Water Act to do. We would be       willing to work with an Administration that wants to develop       thoughtful changes that maintain protections for this life-      sustaining resource, but this repeal is reckless. In       rescinding this rule, the Agency is risking the health and       safety of the American people and our natural resources. We       urge you to reconsider this rescission and instead focus on       fairly and fully enforcing the Clean Water Act.            Sincerely,          Donald S. Beyer, Jr.; Doris Matsui; Gerald E. Connolly;             Jared Polis; Marcy Kaptur; Paul Tonko; Alan Lowenthal;             Matt Cartwright; Mike Quigley; Grace F. Napolitano.

Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support this amendment. The  rider that we are talking about here gives an unprecedented amount of  power to the EPA. It puts the agency above the law, letting it get away  with no public comment on its proposals, no  [[Page H7152]]  economic analysis on the cost and benefit of repeal, no justification  for repeal, and not having to defend repeal against court challenges.   As the Congressman pointed out, for some, this rider might serve a  purpose this time. But what about in the future? What do we really want  to say? That it is okay for the executive branch to circumvent laws we  create and that there is no accountability in our courts?   This rider removes the checks and balances that are essential to a  functioning democracy, so I support the gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Sanford) for yielding time.   Mr. Chair, moving forward with permits for seismic airgun surveys for  subsidy oil and gas deposits puts our vibrant Atlantic coast at risk.   I am a Virginia businessman, and I look at what seismic testing does.  Congressman Rutherford and I led a bipartisan letter to the  administration signed by over 100 of our colleagues expressing our  concerns about seismic airgun blasting.   Our coastal economy relies on healthy ocean ecosystems, which  generate $95 billion in gross domestic product, support nearly 1.4  million jobs each year. We have heard from countless businessowners, as  Congressman Sanford has said, elected officials, residents all along  our coasts who recognize and reject the risks.   NASA, the Department of Defense, the Florida Defense Support Task  Force have all expressed concern that offshore oil and gas development  will threaten their ability to perform critical activities.   The North, South, Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Councils, which are  responsible for the management of fish stocks and habitats in Federal  waters from Maine to Florida, also have significant concerns about the  risks associated with offshore drilling and seismic airgun blasting.   So you have numerous fishing and tourism interests, including all the  local chambers of commerce, tourism, restaurant associations, an  alliance representing over 41,000 businesses, and 500,000 fishing  families from Florida to Maine oppose offshore oil drilling activities  as well.   Opening up the Atlantic to seismic testing and drilling jeopardizes  our economy and these coastal economies in the most immediate terms.   I strongly support the LoBiondo-Sanford amendment and urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this critical  amendment.   Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Chair, this amendment sets a  dangerous precedent not only for the energy future of the Atlantic and  the Florida coasts, but for the Nation as a whole.   Although this is framed as an Atlantic amendment, I would make clear  that the residents from South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, and  Georgia support offshore seismic survey activities pursuant to the all- of-the-above energy approach that America needs.   Seismic surveys are routinely conducted off American coasts and  around the world for oil and gas. We have been conducting seismic  surveys around the globe in the oceans of the world for 50 years with  not a single verifiable instance of a marine mammal being harmed or  killed. In fact, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has confirmed  this. President Obama's own BOEM Director, Abigail Hopper, confirmed  this to me in a public hearing when I asked her last Congress.   Seismic surveys have not been conducted in the Atlantic region for  over 30 years. Today's advancement in technologies allows for 3-D and  4-D seismic work to actually look into the Earth and see what may be  there.   I would argue that the folks who are against seismic work really  aren't against seismic for the purpose of trying to save marine  mammals; they just don't like fossil fuel development. But we need to  see what is out there.   If Members are genuinely concerned about Russia, then voting in favor  of oil and gas exploration should be a no-brainer. Why would Members  vote to cut off the most significant tool in America's arsenal, that  is, our energy independence?   For these reasons, it is critical that we continue to permit safe G&G  geological studies in all areas off America's coasts, that includes the  mid-Atlantic, the south Atlantic, and all Florida.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, to respond to both my friends from South  Carolina, one of the dilemmas with the additional exploration is that,  by law, the data obtained from the seismic surveys are proprietary.  They will belong to the many different companies that will be doing  this, and they won't be available to the American public; they won't be  available to local government officials; they won't even be available  to Members of Congress.   So this inability to access information will leave coastal  communities without the opportunity to provide these substantive cost- benefit analyses that Congressman Sanford referred to.   Our constituents would take on significant risks without being  involved in the future development decisions. So, for that reason, I  encourage us to vote for the Sanford amendment.
