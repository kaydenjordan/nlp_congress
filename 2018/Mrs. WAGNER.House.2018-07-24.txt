 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of giving Americans  more choices when deciding how to save for healthcare expenses.   The legislation we are voting on this week will increase the number  of Americans who are eligible to contribute to tax-free health savings  accounts and expand the use of HSAs to cover direct primary care and  over-the-counter medicines.   HSAs make it easier for people to take a proactive approach to their  own healthcare. It is time to give Americans more access and more  choice and affordability when spending their hard-earned paychecks.   Our legislation will also reduce premiums, roll back burdensome  ObamaCare regulations, and give Americans more options and control when  dealing with personal issues of healthcare.   I look forward to casting my vote for all Missouri, especially those  in Missouri's Second Congressional District. They deserve the freedom  to do what is best for their families.                            ____________________
