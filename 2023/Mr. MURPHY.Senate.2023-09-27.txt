 Madam President, right now we are working through a  bipartisan proposal to keep the government open and operating, at least  for the next several months. But those who study the Constitution might  ask: Why is the Senate beginning debate on a continuing resolution?  Isn't it the responsibility, constitutionally, of the House to begin  debates on spending measures?   That is true. But the reason the Senate is using certain procedural  maneuvers to begin the debate on the continuing resolution is because  the House refuses to do its job. The House of Representatives is  currently pretending like the government isn't shutting down in 3 days.   Instead of doing their job, House Republicans are spending the week  impeaching Joe Biden, even though they admit they have no grounds to do  it. They are setting this country on a course toward ruin. Shutdowns  cost the economy billions of dollars. Starting on Saturday night, our  military won't get paid; Head Start teachers won't get paid; our  wildfire firefighters won't get paid; Federal prison guards won't get  paid; NIH and CDC scientists won't get paid; border agents won't get  paid. And yet the House is pretending that this isn't happening.   So we are attempting--the Senate--to come together, Republicans and  Democrats, to solve this problem. But it is absolutely extraordinary-- extraordinary--that the House is refusing to do their job. And the  reason for that is that there is this cabal of Republicans in the House  who want the government to shut down, who hate the government so much  that they want to burn it to the ground. And they are willing to  compromise the safety of this country. They are willing to put hard- working Federal employees out of work. They are willing to force our  military and our Border Patrol to forgo their paychecks. They are  willing to lose $10 billion in revenue to the economy.   So this is a pretty sad moment. The Senate is going to try to come  together, Republicans and Democrats, to do our job; but House  Republicans are causing this shutdown. They admit it. They go on TV  every day--House Republicans go on TV every day and admit that it is  their caucus that is causing this shutdown. And, hopefully, sometime  between now and this weekend, those arsonists in the House of  Representatives will come to their senses and put this country above  their politics, above their hatred of government, above their hatred of  Joe Biden. The consequences are pretty enormous otherwise.                                 Gun Control     Madam President, this past February, a woman by the name  of Maria Zapata Escamilla was startled out of her sleep in her home in  a relatively small city in Mexico. She was startled out of her sleep  because a band of men armed with powerful weapons and wearing military  fatigues broke into her family's home. They looked like soldiers, but  they weren't soldiers. They were, in fact, drug cartel members. That  night they dragged her husband away, and they dragged her 14-year-old  son, still in his pajamas, out of the house.   Two weeks later, 10 bodies were found in this town, all dead at the  hands of the cartel. One of them was Maria's husband. She still, to  this day, has no idea where her 14-year-old son is, but she presumes  that he is dead. Maria's story is the norm in this city, Fresnillo,  which, for much of this year, has been a war zone between Mexico's two  biggest cartels as they battle for space to make and transport drugs to  the United States.   Maria says:         Every day there are kidnappings, every day there are       shootouts, every day there are deaths. It's terror.    These cartels act with impunity in Mexico because they buy off local  officials and police because of endemic  [[Page S4707]]  corruption inside Mexico but, also, because these cartels are very  often more heavily armed than the police. And this ability of the  cartels to control so much space inside of Mexico because of corruption  but also because they are often carrying more firepower than law  enforcement, this is not just a nightmare for Mexico; this is a  nightmare for the United States of America. There is a straight through  line between the power of the cartels and the fentanyl trade that is  killing American citizens.   Fentanyl is a plague in my community in Connecticut, in my  colleagues' communities. And it is not enough for us just to tell  Mexico to do better. No doubt, Mexico does not have clean hands. Mexico  needs to get in the game to take on these cartels.    But on this question of heavily armed cartels, Mexico has actually  acted. It surprises many people to know that there is one single gun  store in all of Mexico. Mexico has essentially eliminated the  commercial trade of firearms. You can't buy a firearm in the commercial  market, for all intents and purposes, in Mexico today.   So why on Earth is Mexico flooded with weapons? Why on Earth do the  cartels trade weapons like water? It is because somewhere between 70 to  90 percent of the guns that are found in crime scenes--mostly crime  scenes connected to the cartel business--in Mexico can be traced back  to the United States.   This is absolutely stunning. It is U.S. guns bought here in the  United States, transited to Mexico that is fueling the violence that  ends up in fentanyl being made, produced, and transported freely into  the United States.   So it is time for the United States to recognize that if we want to  do something about fentanyl coming into the United States, if we want  to save our citizens from ruin, then we have to do something about the  guns that move from the United States into Mexico.   Now why is this happening? Why have the cartels been able to get  their hands on these weapons?   Well, there is a handful of reasons. First, without a universal  background check law in the United States, these cartel members, most  of whom have criminal records, can easily buy guns at gun shows and  online, even though they are criminals, because in those settings there  are not background checks applied in many of our States. So the cartel  members go into these gun shows in places like Texas; they buy the  guns; and they bring them to Mexico.   Second, there is no comprehensive effort to stop the trafficking. It  is largely Americans that are doing the trafficking--dual citizens,  often. We do lots of checks of cars and trucks going from Mexico to the  United States, but we don't do significant serious checks on vehicles  going from the United States to Mexico. And so the guns, along with the  cash, move freely north to south.   And so as long as this gun trade continues, the Mexican authorities,  even if they clean up their act, have very little chance to stop these  cartels. And what is so maddening is that this is just a choice. We  know what to do to stop these guns from being trafficked to the cartels  in Mexico, but we choose not to do it.   So for those of us that have relationships with leaders in the  Mexican government, we have very few good answers when the Mexican  government looks us in the eye and says: Do your part. Stop these guns  from moving into Mexico.   The things we can do are all politically popular. Universal  background checks are supported by 95 percent of Americans, first and  foremost because it will cut down on crime in the United States. But 41  percent of the guns that go into Mexico come from Texas; 15 percent  come from Arizona; the lion's share of these weapons comes from States  that don't have universal background check laws on the books and so  they have all of these loopholes and these ways for criminals to buy  guns and transfer them to Mexico.   Second, we can fund DHS to actually do the checks on the cars and the  vehicles that are moving into Mexico. Last year, for the first time,  because of an initiative that I pushed, we funded 200 more CBP officers  to do these outbound inspections. Yet we are still only doing the  inspections at a handful of ports of entry, and we should be doing them  all across the border. That is something that Republicans and Democrats  can come together on.    Last year, we did make progress. With the help of Senator Cornyn and  others, we made gun trafficking a crime in this country. It is amazing  that it wasn't. We made straw purchasing a crime, which makes it a  little bit harder for the traffickers to move weapons from north to  south, but it is just a start.   It is really important for us to own the mistakes we have made that  have allowed for these cartels to get so big and so powerful. There is  no doubt that the lion's share of work lands squarely with the Mexican  Government. The corruption there that is endemic is the biggest gift to  the cartels.   Second to the corruption is the flow of weapons that the United  States has permitted and, at times, facilitated. We need a massive,  laser-focused effort to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United  States. It is killing thousands of Americans. In my State, there have  been 10,000 overdose deaths just in the last 10 years.   We can't just lecture the Mexican Government to do better; we need to  do our part. So I am here on the floor today to ask my colleagues to  join me in taking some big, bold steps to stop the flow of these  weapons from the United States to the Mexican drug cartels.   I yield the floor.
