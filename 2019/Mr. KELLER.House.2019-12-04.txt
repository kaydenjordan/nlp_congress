 Mr. Speaker, after weeks of secret depositions, selective  leaks, and public hearings, the Democrats trying to tear down this  country with their impeachment sham have not proven any of their  assertions against President Trump.   Unfortunately for those Americans who expect Members of Congress to  work for their benefit, the majority in this Chamber is instead  obsessed with overturning the will of the people expressed in the 2016  election. That obsession caused substantive legislation to come to a  standstill.   While some Democrat Members of this House have pointed to the number  of bills passed as evidence of success, I would like to point out that  just because people are busy, it does not mean they are working. While  bipartisan bills to address issues like lowering prescription drug  prices, better trade deals, and funding our national defense are ready  to be voted on, Speaker Pelosi has instead chosen to focus on  [[Page H9230]]  partisan messaging that she knows has zero chance of ever becoming law.   Speaker Pelosi's partisan legislating must come to an end, and we  must get back to working together in the interest of the American  people.                            ____________________
