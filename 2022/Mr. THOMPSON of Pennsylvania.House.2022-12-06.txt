 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Winkler Gallery and congratulate them on their 20th anniversary.   Since its creation in 2003, the Winkler Gallery and Art Education  Center has provided a place for artists in DuBois, Pennsylvania, to  create art in many different forms.   The Winkler Gallery originally began as a fine art collaborative  named after the famed watercolor artist Perry Winkler. Today, the  Winkler Gallery features more than 20 different artists in their  collection and serves as a place for locals to come learn about the  different types of art available at the gallery.   The Winkler Gallery remains a staple in our community and currently  serves as the host to Pennsylvania-15 high school art students who  participate in the annual Congressional Art Competition. The gallery is  also home to a notable exhibit, the Children's Carousel. The exhibit  was originally built in London in 1896 and is the world's most complete  and original English carousel.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Winkler Gallery on  20 years of being a home to the fine art and culture available in  northern Pennsylvania. Their art brings even more beauty to a naturally  beautiful place in our region.                            ____________________
