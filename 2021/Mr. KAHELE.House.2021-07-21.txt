 Madam Speaker, ``Always Ready, Always There.'' That is  the motto of our National Guard, our citizen soldiers, who, since 1636,  have been prepared at all times as the first line of defense for our  country.   When a natural disaster strikes--hurricanes, wildfires, tsunamis,  earthquakes, volcanic eruptions--who do we call? We call the National  Guard.   When a human-made disaster strikes--chemical spills, large-scale  electrical power outages--who do we call? We call the National Guard.   When States and local governments get overwhelmed because of  situations beyond their control, who do those Governors, mayors, and  State legislatures call? They call the National Guard.   When a global health pandemic cripples the country, who do we call?  We call the National Guard.   And when an assault on our Nation's Capitol, a deadly insurrection,  happens, who do we call to protect this hallowed beacon of democracy,  to ensure a safe, peaceful transfer of power can occur? We called  the National Guard.    Every single time--``Always Ready, Always There''--the National Guard  has answered the call. Our National Guard keeps us safe and has done so  since the inception of our democracy.   Following the deadly January 6 insurrection and leading up to the  inauguration of our President and Vice President on January 20,  Congress called upon the National Guard, and an unprecedented 26,700  guardsmen from across the country were deployed to secure our Nation's  Capitol and protect the very lawmakers and staff that work in this  Capitol.   The Guard then continued to serve and support civil authorities in  Washington, D.C., for the next 137 days. They left their families. Many  took unexpected leave from their civilian jobs during a health pandemic  to report to our Nation's Capitol. They stood watch 24 hours a day, 7  days a week, many times in the frigid cold in the dark of night.   Many of us got to know them personally. We brought them food, coffee.  We met them on the ramp at Andrews Air Force Base. We took pictures on  the Capitol steps. We shook their hands and thanked them and their  families for their service.   Our National Guard fulfilled their duty bravely and completed their  mission. Now, it is Congress' turn to not only pay our respects but pay  the bill that is due. What bill? What am I talking about? Well, it cost  $521 million to protect our Nation's Capitol for those 137 days.   National Guard leadership, adjutant generals, and State Governors  sent their guardsmen to our Nation's Capitol with the promise that  those funds would be repaid in a timely manner. As a result, the Army  and Air National Guard paid for the Capitol Response mission and  fronted the money from their own fiscal year 2021 funding. Time is of  the essence, and we must pay them the money that we owe immediately and  before August 1.   The reality is, if we fail to issue reimbursements by August 1, there  will be real consequences. The National Guard Bureau has already sent  out notices to States regarding canceling the remaining annual training  days and/or canceling August and September drills. If training is  canceled, several thousand guardsmen will not have enough service time  this fiscal year to receive credit for a good year toward military  retirement.   Approximately 2,000 functional and occupational training schools will  be canceled, affecting their readiness, pay, and career progression.  Ground vehicle and rotary wing operations and maintenance will be  halted. Air National Guard flying operations will be negatively  impacted, as they just only now begin the recovery from the effects of  the pandemic. The 54th Security Forces Assistance Brigade combat  training center rotation next month, in August, will be canceled.   Without reimbursement by August 1, it will take years to recover our  readiness, which will be immediately impacted and decrease by up to 20  percent.   Those are some of the operational and readiness impacts of not  meeting that August 1 deadline. But the real damages, Madam Speaker,  are the profound personal impacts, which will have an immediate effect  on the morale of those soldiers and airmen, their families, and  retention across the 54 States and territories.   The increased psychological stress on our National Guard  servicemembers and families in an already highly stressed environment  is absolutely unacceptable. They are being asked to suffer, to  sacrifice, because this body,  [[Page H3764]]  Congress, is unable to meet its end of a good-faith agreement with  State leaders fully expecting to be reimbursed and not having to ``take  it out of hide,'' which is what the National Guard is being asked to do  now.   To put it simply, guardsmen--and I hear from them every single day-- are in absolute disbelief that after all they have done this last year,  answering our Nation's call, this is how they are being treated.   Madam Speaker, today is July 21. We have 11 days. We must take  immediate action. I urge all of us in Congress to swiftly come to an  agreement on an appropriations emergency bill that includes full  reimbursement of $521 million for our National Guard by August 1. That  is the least we can do for our citizen soldiers and their families who  are always ready and always there.                            ____________________
