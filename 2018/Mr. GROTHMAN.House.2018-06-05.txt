 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from  Minnesota for introducing this bill. As he said, the North Country  Trail is really a gem that goes across seven States.   But I take particular interest in it because the 173 miles that we  are adding today are so close to the State of Wisconsin. I know there  are many outdoor enthusiasts in my district for whom it is very  important to do what they can to complete the North Country Trail.   As was mentioned right now, to go through the trail you would wind up  in an area that would be very difficult to get through. So I am sure  there is an economic benefit to this to Minnesota, but to me far more  than the economic benefit is the huge benefit so many of our American  citizens take and experience in the outdoors, particularly in the area  that is relatively undeveloped.   I encourage passage of the bill. Add the new 173 miles. I am sure  there are plenty of constituents in Wisconsin's Sixth Congressional  District who look forward to walking across each one of those miles.
