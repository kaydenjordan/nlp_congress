 Madam Speaker, it is undeniable that religious freedom is  America's keystone. This great country was founded by men and women who  fled religious persecution and sought to govern themselves according to  their religious beliefs.   Despite religious freedom having been woven into our constitutional  system for well over two centuries, and the precedents it has  established, Democrats are choosing to play judge, jury, and  executioner in its trial.   Today, religious organizations are under attack by the woke agenda of  Democrats. Those on the left claim that faith-based organizations must  abandon their conscience and amend their employment practices, or they  should not have access to Federal contracts or funds.   It is a damning ultimatum. Imagine how many faith-based organizations  would be forced to close their doors because of this.   Madam Speaker, this coordinated campaign is being carried out by the  left, and it is guided by the assumption that a radical, progressive  dogma is more legitimate than religious beliefs. That assumption is  pure insanity.   In this country, faith is not subjugated or left at the door. It is  carried with us no matter where we may go.   I applaud every man and woman who is standing up to this egregious  assault from the left and is fighting for the right to live by  religious convictions at work and in business.   President Biden's so-called Build Back Better framework is riddled  with discriminatory provisions. One clause would have required faith- based childcare providers to abandon their faith during program hours  if they wanted to participate in the Federal program.   And in the Community Services Block Grant program, the Democrats want  to strip a provision that protects faith-based providers' right to  remain strong in their faith as they serve individuals in need.   This protection has been in place without controversy or harm to any  individual seeking assistance for decades. Why change it now? I think  we know.   This isn't just religious persecution; it is textbook coercion.  Unfortunately, there is more.   Democrats have also sought to remove protections for religious  nonprofit organizations and Federal contractors. Like their secular  counterparts, faith-based charities in the United States simply want to  serve the less fortunate, but discriminatory legislation could keep  them from being able to do that.   Faith-based charities and religious Federal contractors alike deserve  the chance to practice their religion freely without government  interference.   It appears Democrats need a refresher on the First Amendment.   The government does not bestow the freedom of religion upon us; it is  a freedom we have possessed since birth.   Whenever we see protections for religious freedom being chipped away  in this country, it is our solemn duty as Americans and people of faith  to take a stand.                            ____________________
