 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Waycross Area Community Theater for all of its work to support local  theater while preserving historical structures in the First  Congressional District of Georgia. Using local talent to provide live  family friendly musicals, this community theater is truly a gem.   Since 1913, theater has played a large role in the social scene of  Waycross, with the Ritz Theater hosting operas there. Noted as one of  Georgia's ``finest theater'' structures, the Ritz Theater transitioned  over time into showing only movies and then, finally, going dormant.   Now, the Waycross Area Community Theater maintains the historic art  [[Page H7226]]  deco-style theater with its live productions, and their work has not  gone unnoticed. Aside from the crowded audiences, the Fox Theater has  awarded grants to the Community Theater over the last 2 years to help  preserve the historic Ritz Theater.   Thank you to all who perform shows, attend musicals, and preserve the  wonderful theater culture in Waycross, Georgia.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and I thank the gentleman for hosting this here tonight.   This is extremely important, and the House Energy Action Team and the  Members who have spoken here and the Members who will continue to speak  play an important role in making sure that we get this message out,  because, Madam Speaker, I am here to join my colleagues in discussing  America's energy resurgence and to bring to light the many developments  and advances that have been made in our Nation, and there are many.  Lots of developments, lots of advances have been made in our Nation.   We are in the midst of an economic boom. We all know that. We know  that our economy is booming. We know that we have seen record low  unemployment rates and that we have seen growing incomes. Simply put,  jobs are being created and people are going back to work. As we look to  the Nation's energy needs and output, people will often forget about  how energy costs impact both people and the economy.   I have always said that I subscribe to the all-of-the-above type of  energy strategy, and I do; and I think it is extremely important for a  number of different reasons, not the least of which is to make sure  that we in America have energy independence, to make sure that we have  affordable energy, that we never put ourselves in the position that I  can remember us being in in the late seventies, where we were dependent  and were literally held over the barrel, if you will, by other nations  for our energy needs.   We as a nation benefit from lower energy costs, meaning our monthly  home energy bills are lower and the costs to do business are lower.  Lower costs translate into the ability of companies to invest in their  businesses and in their employees.   American energy independence has been crucial to the growth we have  seen since the recession. There is also significant investment by  companies across the United States to be good stewards of their  communities.   Yes, it can be done. Yes, we can have energy independence. Yes, we  can be good stewards of our communities.   We are seeing significant investments in new, cleaner technologies,  taking old and inefficient plants off-line, looking to energy  efficiency and actively managing emissions. As has been mentioned by  other speakers, we have done a great job in America of decreasing our  emissions and still keeping our economy growing. There is a lot to be  said for that.   Carbon management has really caught on for a number of employers, and  the technology that can make it more effective is very promising. For  instance, there are companies actively looking to pull carbon from the  air, to sequester it into the ground through direct air capture. This  technology continues to develop and to mature.   There are also important carbon capture systems being developed in my  home district. We are seeing incredibly efficient turbines being built  that produce much lower emission numbers than similar products or  plants.   In addition, I have the honor of serving on the Energy and Commerce  Committee, and we have done quite a bit of work addressing the  regulatory issues that would prevent these innovative and new  technologies from coming to market. We are doing everything that we can  to get the government out of the way.    I have always said that the greatest innovators, the greatest  scientists are right here in the United States of America, and they  are. That is why I look toward the future with great anticipation,  because I think this is going to be a great opportunity for us as  Americans.   I look at renewable energy. I look at everything that is going to be  done in the way of energy production, and I see America leading the  way, and it is important the Federal Government not be an obstacle, not  be a barrier to that.   As more regulatory hurdles are put up, the costs increase. That is  why we focus on innovation and technology, new ideas and making sure  that the private sector has the ability to explore these opportunities.   As I mentioned earlier, there are countless examples of employers  seeking new options to reduce their impact on their communities and  looking to ways to be good stewards. In manufacturing alone, companies  are looking at how to turn those challenges of reducing consumption  into new opportunities.   While one side of industry is looking at that, the energy sector is  also investing in researching ways to become more efficient and  effective when it comes to reducing emissions and expanding their  energy mix.   Madam Speaker, if you want to see a country that can innovate, if you  want to see a country that can lead, you look to the United States of  America. Again, that is why I am so excited about the future of our  energy production.   Just up the river from my district, Plant Vogtle has the only two  nuclear units under construction in the United States. For a nation  that once developed and dominated the nuclear sector, we have lagged  behind direct competitors.   As the largest carbon-free source of power in the world, it makes  sense to move forward with developing next-generation technology that  can lower costs. Nuclear energy is an area we can and should continue  to once again have a leading role in the world.   Whether it is nuclear, more efficient equipment, carbon capture, or  some  [[Page H7232]]  other form of energy, now is our chance to really drill down and focus  on the innovation and technology development that is needed.   I join my colleagues here on the HEAT team as we continue to work  towards policy solutions to these issues facing our country.
