 Mr. Speaker, this week, the nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office released its latest budget projections predicting that  the Republican tax plan will add a stunning $1.8 trillion to the  deficit.   It turns out major tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans do not pay  for themselves. With their tax scam cutting revenue and exploding the  deficit, Republicans have now set their sights on crippling Social  Security retirement and Medicare health insurance programs that  millions of Americans rely on.   They shamelessly proposed a balanced budget amendment to distract  from the reckless deficit spending, but I am here to say that the  public is smarter than they think. They recognize this is just the next  step in their plan to cut programs that strengthen retirement security  and ensure healthcare access.   I voted against this foolish budgeting proposal, and I urge my  colleagues to commit to responsible bipartisan spending reform.                            ____________________
