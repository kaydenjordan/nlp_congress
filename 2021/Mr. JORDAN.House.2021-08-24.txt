 Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), the ranking member of the House  Administration Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Thousands of Americans are stranded in Afghanistan, fearing for their  lives, and Democrats are focused on passing legislation to make sure  States can't require a photo ID to vote.   Thousands of Americans are stranded in Afghanistan, while hundreds of  thousands of illegal immigrants cross our southern border every single  month. March was the largest month on record for illegal crossings  until April; April was the largest month of illegal crossings until  May; May was the largest month until June; and June was the largest  month until July; and Democrats are focused on passing legislation  which says: States who want to go back to the election law they had  just a year ago before the virus, you can't do that unless you come get  permission from the Department of Justice.   As Mr. Davis said, in 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, a  good piece of legislation that did things that needed to be done, put  things in place that needed to be put in place. But we are a long way  from that and so much better.   In 2013, in the Shelby County v. Holder Supreme Court decision, the  Court said there is no need to continue preclearance requirements.  Here's a quote from the Chief Justice: ``The conditions that originally  justified'' these measures ``no longer characterize voting in the  covered jurisdictions,'' Justice Roberts stated. African-American  turnout today exceeds White voter turnout in five of the six originally  covered States. During the past election, voter turnout was higher  across all racial groups as compared to prior presidential elections.   The United States of America is the greatest country in the history  of the world. There is no question that our country has done more to  advance the cause of liberty and democracy than any other Nation. But,  unfortunately, it seems the Democrats do not want to acknowledge all of  that amazing progress that has been made and where we are at today.   H.R. 4 would subject States and localities to the whims of partisan  bureaucrats within President Biden's Department of Justice. They get to  decide--not States, as our Constitution says--no, no, no, you have to  go get permission from the big Federal Government, do what they say,  when it comes to your election laws, even if, as I said before, you  just want to go back to where you were a year before COVID.   Republican States that Democrats always want to target actually do  better than Democrat States, like President Biden's home State of  Delaware. But for some reason, you don't hear Democrats raising alarms  about Delaware, and you don't see the Biden administration bringing  lawsuits against Delaware.   Democrats want to focus on this manufactured crisis, because they  have no plans to deal with the real crises that are facing our country:  inflation; crime; the border; and, of course, what is going on in  Afghanistan as we speak.   Don't be fooled. Today, it is easier to vote than ever in our  country. We need to applaud the strides this Nation has taken. We need  to embrace the greatness of our country. This bill is not about  expanding voting rights; it is about Democrats consolidating their  political power. That is why they are focused on this. At a time when  there are so many critical issues and crises facing our Nation, they  are focused on consolidating their power and, I think, taking it away  from the States.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Issa).                                time  1630     Madam Speaker, I would just remind the gentleman that  Democrats have objected to the electors for every Republican President  this century--every single one.   I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Steil).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).    Madam Speaker, was it a big lie when the Democrats for 4  years questioned the 2016 election, when in October of 2020 Secretary  Clinton said the election was stolen from her in 2016? Was that the big  lie that the previous speaker was talking about?   I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Bentz).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, the Speaker of the United States House of  Representatives just applauded Texas legislators for not showing up to  work, for not doing their job. I mean, the things we see today, it is  truly amazing to me.   Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).
