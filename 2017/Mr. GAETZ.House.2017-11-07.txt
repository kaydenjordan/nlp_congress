 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we are at risk of a coup d'etat in this country if we  allow an unaccountable person with no oversight to undermine the duly- elected President of the United States, and I would offer that is  precisely what is happening right now with the indisputable conflicts  of interest that are present with Mr. Mueller and others at the  Department of Justice.   I join my colleague, the gentleman from Arizona, in calling for Mr.  Mueller's resignation or his firing.   Moreover, we absolutely have to see the Department of Justice appoint  a special counsel to look into the Clinton Foundation, the Uranium One  deal, and the Fusion GPS dossier that I will now have the opportunity  to discuss.   I really don't know who is investigating the Uranium One deal right  now. I know that, in July, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  along with 20 members of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to  Attorney General Sessions asking who would be looking into these  critical questions, demanding that a special counsel be appointed to  conduct a thorough review. It is extremely disappointing that the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee and my fellow members have received  no response from the Department of Justice as to that letter.    I don't know whether the Attorney General's recusal on matters  related to Russia impacts, influences, or, in any way, covers the  Fusion GPS challenge and the incredible threat to national security  raised by the Uranium One deal.   I do know that there is no world in which Mr. Mueller could  potentially investigate these matters. It is Federal law that even the  appearance of a conflict of interest means that someone cannot engage  in prosecutorial duties regarding allegations and investigations. That  conflict of interest is absolutely present.   As early as 2009, the FBI knew that we had informants alleging  corruption into United States uranium assets. There were allegations of  bribery, kickbacks, extortion. Even in 2010, Members of Congress were  raising these questions and asking the Obama administration to provide  answers that were never given.   I don't think it is a coincidence that at the same time we were  hearing from sources that there was bribery to influence our uranium  assets, you had former President Bill Clinton getting paid $500,000 by  a bunch of Russians to go give a speech. It must have been one hell of  a speech. It is deeply troubling to me that these circumstances seem to  be ripe for corruption and seem to demonstrate an ecosystem of  corruption that must be thoroughly investigated.   Now, why can't Mr. Mueller and Mr. Rosenstein conduct this  investigation? First of all, Mr. Mueller was the head of the FBI in  2009. He potentially had a role to play in these questions. At the very  least, the fact that the FBI never prosecuted any case, never raised  objections, never allowed Congress to be able to look into these  matters, that would be an act of omission.   So at best, there is an omission that creates a conflict for Mr.  Mueller; at worst, there might have been actual malfeasance or active  negligence. And in those circumstances, we need fresh eyes and clear  eyes to give the American people confidence that our justice system is,  in fact, working for them.   It is not only the Uranium One deal that gives us a great deal to  question. We also have this Fusion GPS dossier, which we have now  learned that the Democratic Party was paying for. The Democratic Party  was out paying people to stir up this salacious and inaccurate dirt on  President Trump both before and after he was elected.   In his own testimony before the Congress, Mr. Comey said that these  allegations were salacious and could not be relied upon. So it begs the  question, what was the Fusion GPS dossier relied upon for? Was it  relied upon so that there would be FISA warrants issued to go and spy  on the President and members of his team? We don't know, but until we  have a special counsel, we will never get those answers, because  Mueller and Rosenstein are conflicted.   Why did Congress never hear from these informants? Well, it is no  surprise to me. You actually have Mr. Rosenstein's name on the  signature block of the pleadings that sealed the information that could  have shed light on this entire scandal, but we didn't have that  opportunity.   Now, it may very well be that these were simply acts of negligence,  acts of omission or oversight. If that is the case, let's get someone  in who can give us the answers, because certainly the people who are  there now cannot give us answers, and they have these tragic conflicts  of interest.   The American people are well aware that the Clinton Foundation  functioned largely as a money laundering organization to influence the  State Department and to ensure that there were special people with  special access and special relationships to the Clintons who got  special treatment. That is not an America that abides to the rule of  law.   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, we have to see the rule of  law held up and cherished. We are a model for the world, but if we have  circumstances where our President, who was elected, is undermined as a  consequence of these things, if we do not replace Bob Mueller with  someone who can come in absent of association with the individuals who  may be implicated, then I fear this great, special place that we hold  in the world may be diminished.   So I have introduced legislation. I am very pleased that my  colleagues have joined me in sponsoring that legislation, calling for  Mr. Mueller to resign. I have also called for a special counsel to be  appointed.   To my colleagues on the other side who say, well, hey, you know,  there were a variety of agencies that were involved in approving the  Uranium One deal, there were eight or nine groups that could have said  no.  [[Page H8585]]                                     time  1900    Are Members of Congress really taking the position that the Clintons  don't have their tentacles in just about every agency of government?   How ludicrous. You are talking about the former President of the  United States and, at the time, the lady who was serving as our  Secretary of State.   The fact that this was a multiagency process only underscores the  conflicts of interest that lie with Rosenstein and Mueller.   I am calling on the Attorney General to appoint a special counsel to  preserve the rule of law and to help us save this great country from  those who are trying to undermine us and undermine our President.
