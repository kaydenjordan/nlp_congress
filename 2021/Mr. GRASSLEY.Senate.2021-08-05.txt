 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am reintroducing the Survivors' Bill  of Rights in the States Act of 2021. This measure, which Senator  Shaheen has joined me in sponsoring, builds on an initiative on which  the two of us worked together in 2016.   Entitled the ``Survivors' Bill of Rights Act,'' that earlier  legislation cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in June of 2016,  during my tenure as its chairman. The House of Representatives  introduced a similar package of rights some months later, and that  version was enacted in the fall of 2016 with my strong support.   The 2016 statute provides very important rights for victims of sexual  violence, but that act only accomplishes those cases that are Federal.  Such rights include, for example, the right to know the results of your  forensic exam, the right to have evidence preserved for a certain  period, and lastly, the right to notice before your forensic kit is  destroyed.   A young sexual assault survivor, Amanda Nguyen, who advocated for  these rights at the Federal level, now is leading the effort to  persuade other jurisdictions to adopt the same rights for all sexual  assault victims. One of those jurisdictions is my home State of Iowa,  which this summer adopted a package of rights that is closely modeled  after the Federal Survivors' Bill of Rights.   I want to take the opportunity to again thank Amanda, who arrived in  my office 6 years ago and convinced me of the importance of working  with her on this important initiative. Amanda also later testified  before the Judiciary Committee, not once but twice, at my invitation,  about the importance of protecting the rights of victims of sexual  violence in our criminal justice system.   Amanda worked with Senator Shaheen on this same legislation, as well  as this Senator, and I am pleased to partner with Senator Shaheen again  in introducing today's measure that will hopefully affect more States  adopting this legislation.   This bill that we sponsored, then, gives each State a financial  incentive to adopt new rights for survivors in all sex crime cases,  modeled on the same rights that victims in Federal cases now enjoy.  Each State that extends these same rights to survivors of sexual  violence would then be eligible to receive a Federal grant under the  legislation that we have introduced. The amount of each State grant  would be calculated based on the formula that is used to calculate STOP  grant funding to States under a program that is authorized by the  Violence Against Women Act.   Finally, this measure that we have introduced would authorize $20  million annually for each of the next 5 fiscal years to support the  implementation of the new grant program established by this bill.   Once again, I want to thank Senator Shaheen for joining me in leading  this legislation and for her commitment to working to increase  protections for victims of sexual violence.   I also want to thank the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence for  working with us on the bill's development.   Finally, I thank Congresswoman Jackie Speier and Congressman Kelly  Armstrong for initiating this measure in the other Chamber.   I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this bipartisan,  bicameral legislation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on January 27 of this year, the Biden  administration put out a wide-ranging Executive order on tackling  climate change. Tucked in that Executive order was a line directing  Secretaries of Agriculture, the Interior, and Commerce to develop a  plan to conserve at least 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030.  This plan is commonly referred to as the ``30 by 30.''   To reach the Biden administration's goal of 30 percent of the land in  conservation by 2030, the Federal Government will have significant work  ahead of them to accomplish that.   This is what 30 percent means. Thirty percent of the land would mean  that we will need 440 million additional acres in permanent  conservation.   To put 440 million acres of land into perspective, it is the  equivalent of taking the State of Iowa and putting all of Iowa's land  into permanent conservation. But that is still not enough to get to 440  million acres. You would repeat that 11 more times to reach the Biden  administration's goal of 30 percent of the land in conservation by  2030.   This is not really an attempt at conservation; it is an attempt at  confiscation, even though the confiscation would be rewarded,  presumably, by annual payments from the Federal Government. Between the  30 by 30 land grab and the Waters of the U.S. rewrite, it is clear that  this administration simply does not understand rural America. If they  did understand, then they would realize that farmers are the first and  best conservationists because it is good for their pocketbook and good  for the environment.   If the United States decides to go forward with the 30 by 30 plan, we  already know what will happen. This rhetoric empowers our Nation's corn  and soybean competitors to increase their output   Now, Brazil is the best example of our corn and soybean competitors,  so let's look at Brazil. This week, the Brazilian House of  Representatives advanced a bill that their President, President  Bolsonaro, supports, that allows the squatters on public lands in the  Amazon rainforest to more easily receive deeds to their properties.  Now, there is nothing wrong with deeds to property, but what this is  going to do is allow squatters to burn the forest to plant corn and  soybeans.   Let me tell you how significant this burning is, and this was a few  years ago that I read this. I read something from the astronauts in our  space station circling the globe. They said there were two significant  things that stand out on the Earth's surface when you look down: No. 1  is the Great Wall of China, and No. 2 is the smoke coming from the  burning of the rainforest.   Now, Brazil has already plowed under more than half of the Cerrado,  which is tropical savanna. The Cerrado is a vital storehouse for carbon  dioxide that has been disappearing at rates faster than even the Amazon  rainforest.   If we tie the hands of American farmers, our competitors, like the  ones in Brazil, will continue to meet the needs of a growing, hungry  world. By 2050, the world population will grow to 9 billion people, and  we are going to have to feed them.   I don't think the United States should cede our leadership in  production agriculture to other countries that already have poor  environmental standards. So what you are saying is, in this Cerrado,  where the carbon is already sequestered for millennia, that somehow we  ought to have a policy here to store more carbon by more conservation  to let them plow up more in Brazil.   The 5-year farm bill already does a great job of encouraging farmers  and landowners to preserve fragile lands, enhancing environmental  benefits for all Americans. These farm bill provisions are referred to  as ``working lands programs''--programs like the Environmental Quality  Incentives Program that goes by the acronym EQIP, or the Conservation  Stewardship Program we call CSP. These programs provide incentives to  help producers adopt management practices on their ground that allows  the land to stay in production while improving environmental outcomes.   If the Biden administration focuses on these longtime conservation  programs, my speech today would be praising those efforts; but,  instead, this administration has proposals that take productive  farmland out of production, placing the U.S. at a competitive  disadvantage.   We have learned from the Conservation Reserve Program--the CRP we  call it in agriculture--the CRP program we have had around for decades.  About 24 million acres is in CRP now. But we learned a lesson from the  early days of CRP that if you take too much land out of production in a  certain area, it hurts the small business people who either serve  farmers after the products leave their farm or serve farmers with input  into agriculture.  [[Page S5906]]    So later on, we had to put a requirement that no more than 25 percent  of one county can be put into the CRP. Even in doing that--we have  counties in southern Iowa that have 25 percent of their land in CRP-- and we know even there that with the limit of 25 percent, we still have  lost a lot of small business people who work with farmers, and we ruin  the small communities of States that have that problem.   So I would be praising these efforts if this is what the  administration was satisfied with, but, instead, they have these  proposals to take productive farmland out of production and putting our  competitors in a financial advantage.   These ideas also make it harder for new and beginning farmers to  compete on rental rates and gain access to land--another lesson we  learned in the years `13, `14, and `15. We changed it in the 2018 farm  bill, but what we learned in `13, `14, and `15, is when the Government  is paying more for farmers to take their land out of production than is  the going rate for cash rent in those areas, when the government  becomes an unfair competitor and pays more, then the farmer landlords  put their land in the CRP. Then those farmers that were farming that  land can't farm it anymore because they can't afford to compete with  what the Government is paying.   Now, there is a limit that cash rent from the Government can't be  more than 80 percent of the average cash rent in a particular county.  So we have kind of overcome that problem. But if you pay farmers now to  put 30 percent of the land out of production, you are going to lose a  lot of farmers that are cash renters, and we shouldn't be having the  Government be an unfair competitor against the farmers that pay cash  rent.   So these farmers understand how conservation and sustainable  agriculture affects productivity and generational prosperity. It is  important for us to leave the land better than we found it for our  children and grandchildren.   So far the Biden administration has said their 30 by 30 plan focuses  on voluntary measures. Well, farmers can make a choice to do it or not,  but to get to 440 million additional acres in conservation, you would  be foolish to think that voluntary measures are going to get to the  goal this administration wants.   Instead of focusing on taking more land out of production  agriculture, let's work on a strategy that allows farmers to continue  to farm their land while improving environmental outcomes.   I yield the floor.                          Remembering Richard Trumka     Mr. President, I rise to recognize the contributions of  the Ghost Army units of World War II and explain why I decided to join  the Ghost Army Congressional Gold Medal Act as a cosponsor. The 23rd  Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133rd Signal Service Company,  together known as the Ghost Army, used deception tactics to fool the  German Army about the location of American troops. These specialized  units used inflatable tanks and sound effects to give the impression of  a larger presence. While their role was theatrical, the units suffered  causalities and operated close to the front lines. For over 50 years,  these units and the contributions of the men who comprised them were  kept a secret. I  [[Page S5926]]  learned of the success of the Ghost Army from my constituent, Caleb  Sinnwell of Nashua, IA. He won first place in the National History Day  Project for his website about the Ghost Army and has been tirelessly  advocating for this legislation to award the unit a Congressional Gold  Medal. I thank him for his advocacy and for his admirable dedication to  ensuring that those who sacrificed to ensure that the freedom and  rights that we prize in America were protected are always remembered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in a little over a month, we will  remember one of the most horrific events to ever occur on U.S. soil.  The lives of those we lost can never be replaced. But their memories  forever live on through their spouses, children, family, and friends.   For the last 20 years, the Federal Government has failed these  individuals. Tens of thousands of pages of documents relating to the  September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks remain classified. Without their  release, victims, their families, and the public still do not have the  full picture of everything that led up to that day and who was  involved. While some of these documents must remain classified for  defense or national security reasons, a comprehensive review of these  materials is long overdue. In fact, in 2004, the chairmen of the 9/11  Commission, Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton, wrote that this declassification  review should be conducted no later than 2009.   We have fallen short. But today, I hope to remedy this wrong, and I  am proud to join my colleagues, Senators Menendez, Cornyn, and  Blumenthal, on the bipartisan September 11 Transparency Act of 2021.  The bill follows familiar legislative precedent, requiring that any  documents that can be released, must be released. It is the same step  Congress took in requiring the executive branch to conduct a full  review of the documents captured at Abbottabad during the Osama Bin  Laden raid and publish all materials to the fullest-extent possible.   This is not the first time I have requested this review. In 2018, I  coponsored a Senate Resolution calling on the administration to  declassify 9/11 documents to the greatest extent possible. I am sad to  say, that review was never conducted. Last year, I joined my colleagues  on a letter to Inspector General Horowitz, asking for an IG  investigation into the FBI's handing of the 9/11 classified documents.  We never received a response.   I have been a long-standing champion of victims of terror, injured or  killed both at home and abroad. For example, in 1992, I sponsored the  Anti-Terrorism Act, allowing Americans who fall victim to acts of  terrorism while abroad to seek damages in U.S. courts, and subsequent  clarifying laws. And I plan to continue to stand firm for these  individuals.   September 11 is a wrong that can never be righted. But we can be on  the right side of history and finally put lingering questions to rest  by expeditiously declassifying any documents  [[Page S5937]]  held by the Federal Government related to 9/11 to the greatest extent  possible.   Thank you.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Gillibrand):   S. 2669. A bill to ban the use of ortho-phthalate chemicals as food  contact substances; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.
