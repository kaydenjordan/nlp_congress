 I rise reluctantly in opposition to the motion to  instruct offered by our friend from South Carolina. I genuinely enjoy  his friendship. And working with him, I agree with him on many issues.  This is one where we just disagree.   I have serious concerns with the motion he is offering tonight to  prevent U.S. greenhouse gas emission mandates from being enacted unless  China enacts similar mandates. Greenhouse gases that drive climate  change threaten our planet, threaten our lives. They threaten our  livelihood.   They also present an opportunity for the United States to lead on the  global stage. We have an opportunity--a now-or-never opportunity--for  our country to lead in deploying clean, American-made technologies, to  lower greenhouse emissions, create American jobs, and position our  economy to compete with and beat competitors, including China, like a  drum.   Our ability to provide clean energy leadership or to collect climate  change data should not be contingent on the action of our foes, as this  motion to instruct recommends. The leadership is keeping out of step  when everyone else is marching to the wrong tune, including China.   In conclusion, our country should be leading by example--not from  behind--in tackling the climate crisis so that our businesses, our  workers, and our planet reap the benefits of a clean economy.   And that is why I will be voting reluctantly on this motion to  instruct our colleagues, and I hope you will join with me.   I ask for the yeas and nays.
