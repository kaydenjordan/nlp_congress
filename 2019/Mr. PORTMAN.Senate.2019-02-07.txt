 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, I want to talk about the U.S.  trade policy. This is something that affects every one of us. It  affects all the families I represent, it affects our economy in a big  way, and it affects our relations with other countries in significant  ways.   Right now, we are fortunate to have a strong economy. When you look  at the numbers, it is very encouraging. The tax reforms that were put  in place at the end of 2017 and the pro-growth regulatory relief that  has been put in place are actually doing exactly what many of us  thought they would do.   When you look at the growth projections before the tax bill and the  growth projections now, you will see that we have had a dramatic  increase. If you look at the job projections, there is a dramatic  increase in jobs. There were almost 2 million more jobs projected after  the tax reform bill was passed. Why? It is because the tax reform bill  was pro-growth and pro-jobs. It helps middle-class families, but it  also helps small businesses, like the ones I visit all across my State  of Ohio. They all have told me: You know, this is a nice shot in the  arm for us. It gave us the ability to invest more in our equipment, in  our people, and in our retirement savings.   Tomorrow, I will see it again. We will have a roundtable discussion  at an Ohio manufacturer. This company makes tooling that is used in the  aviation industry. They have already told me that they like the tax  bill. I am going to ask them tomorrow what I ask all of these  companies. I have visited with well over a dozen--several dozen--Ohio  small businesses since the tax reform bill was passed. Specifically, I  will ask them tomorrow: What happened to your bottom line, and what are  you doing with the extra tax savings you are getting? What I think I  will hear is what I have heard in other places, which is, We are  investing more in people, and we are investing more in equipment. That  is great.   The latest jobs report reflects all of this. When you look at the  jobs report from last Friday--it was for the January time period--it  showed an impressive 300,000 new jobs. That is way beyond  expectations--302,000 new jobs in January. It also showed wages going  up, which I think is even more impressive. In Ohio, wages have been  pretty flat. In fact, for the last decade and a half, on average, wages  have not gone above inflation. So when people say they are feeling the  squeeze, they are. Expenses are up. Healthcare costs are up. Other  expenses are up. Yet wages have been flat. I think that is one reason  people feel that despite working hard and doing everything they were  asked to do, they were not able to get ahead. Now they can feel they  are getting ahead a little bit. If you look at the numbers from Friday,  they indicate a 3.2-percent growth in wages for supervisory jobs, and  for nonsupervisory jobs--you might think of those as more blue-collar  jobs--there was a 3.4-percent increase in wages. That is just what we  want. We want to see those wages starting to go up. This is above  inflation.   By the way, the wage growth over the past 12 months is the highest it  has been since before the great recession a decade ago. Finally, we are  sort of climbing out of this great recession, and we are seeing the  kinds of numbers we all hoped for.   This is all good news. Again, a lot of it is due to the fact that in  this body and in the House, we passed legislation that helped to  stimulate more economic growth, more jobs, and higher wages.   What I am concerned about is that we not do something now to  jeopardize that economic growth. This is where trade policy is a risk.  Some would say it is already putting a damper on what would otherwise  be even greater growth. But what I am more concerned about than  anything is the possibility that, as a country, we start to put more  and more tariffs in place without showing that the imports coming in  from other countries are being traded unfairly. That is what our trade  laws basically say. They say: OK, if another country doesn't deal with  us fairly, we get to level the playing field. So if they are sending  their products to us and they are not fair, meaning that they are  subsidized by the government, which happens a lot in nonmarket  economies particularly--think of China--or they are sold at below their  cost, which is called dumping--if they are dumping their products on  us, that is not fair, is it? We have trade laws to deal with that.   I believe in trade, but I also believe strongly in trade enforcement.  My legislation with Senator Brown called the Level the Playing Field  Act has helped us win these trade cases when these countries are  dumping. As an example, there is a 269-percent tariff--that is a high  tariff--on some products from China, such as rolled steel products.  Why? Because we showed that they were, in fact, not following the rules  by subsidizing and dumping. We should do that.   There are also parts of our trade law that say: OK, on a temporary  basis--temporary relief--we should be able to respond when another  country sends a surge of imports into our country and there is material  damage to a U.S. industry. So if there is a surge of imports and a U.S.  company is materially damaged, we have a way to respond to that too. It  is not permanent relief, but it says: Wait a minute. Let's let these  companies get back on their feet and let these workers keep their jobs  while we deal with the surge of imports and figure this out. That is  kind of how our trade policy works, consistent with the international  rules. If there is some unfairness, then we are able to respond.    Right now, we are doing this with China. The 301 law is being used to  say to China: We are going to increase tariffs on your products because  you are not trading fairly with us. You are using nontariff barriers.  You are not treating our intellectual property properly. You are  forcing our businesses--to be able to work in China, many of them have  to have joint ventures or special licenses. That is not fair. We want  to level that playing field. That is the purpose of those tariffs.   I think most people get that and understand it and support it. Even  those who believe in more of a pure free-trade mentality know that we  shouldn't allow cheating and that we should help to level the playing  field. The problem is that over the last couple of years, we have  started to use a part of our trade law that really is an exception to  all of that. That is called the national security exception, which is  also called section 232.   Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 has been in place now  for 57 years. It has been used only half a dozen times in 57 years.  Why? Because it is kind of a dangerous tool.   When you think about it, as Americans, all we have to say is, this is  a national security issue, and therefore we are going to put tariffs on  your product. You don't have to prove anything, as I talked about  earlier. You don't have to prove that an industry has been damaged. You  certainly don't have to prove that the other country is sending product  that is dumped--sold at below its cost--or that is subsidized. You  don't have to show a surge of imports. All you have to do is say ``This  is a national security issue for us'' and put your tariffs in place.  When you do that, guess what other countries do to you. They put their  own tariffs in place because they are looking at this and thinking: Oh  my gosh, so the United States is just putting these tariffs in place  without demonstrating that this is a trade-enforcement measure because  of unfairness or damage to their industries.   Frankly, many of these countries are happy to put more protectionist  tariffs in place. It kind of works for them, too, because in many  countries, that sort of approach is a more populous approach, in places  such as Europe or the Middle East or Asia or Africa. They say: OK. We  are going to put tariffs in place.   That is often applauded, but who gets hurt? The consumers in both  countries get hurt. Think of that. Everybody has higher costs, higher  taxes, higher tariffs on both sides, and eventually you end up building  up tariffs to the point that it can be really dangerous for the  economy.   That is my concern with section 232, the national security exception  to our trade laws. Do I think it is a tool we  [[Page S1113]]  ought to have in the toolbox? Absolutely. I think that if there is a  true national security concern, we ought to have section 232 there to  ensure that we can respond.   As an example, if we are at a time of war and we need to be able to  produce tanks in this country and we don't have any steel production  here, in my view, it would be appropriate for us to put some tariffs in  place and to help a domestic industry be able to provide that steel.  Frankly, that is another avenue that other countries would take with us  if they had a true national security concern. So there is a sort of  level playing field there. That is permitted under the World Trade  Organization rules, and other countries would do it as well, but, in my  view, the way we have used it in the last couple of years is a little  different.   Again, I think trade enforcement is very important. I am a hawk on  going after countries that are not treating us fairly. I think with  regard to China and its overcapacity of steel, it is a huge issue. That  is one reason we have these huge tariffs in place on Chinese steel.  Then they transship it through other countries, and we have to be much  tougher on that. We have legislation called the ENFORCE Act. Senator  Wyden was here on the floor a moment ago. He and I have worked on that  together. That is important. Frankly, in my view, we need to do more to  enforce that to keep China from going around to a third country and  then sending it to the United States, if it is steel that is dumped or  subsidized. But to say that with regard to countries that are our  allies and countries that we trade with every day, we are going to use  this national security exception, the 232, I have to tell you, I think  that causes real problems, and we have seen it. Other countries have  done what? They have increased their tariffs on us.    Think of Canada. When you put tariffs on Canada saying it is a  national security concern--even though, by the way, with regard to  steel, a product we sell more to Canada than they send to us. We send  more steel to them from the United States than they do to us, and yet  we are saying: It is a national security concern with your steel from  Canada so we are going to slap on a tariff, say, 25 percent. What does  Canada do? They turn around and put tariffs on our products.   We have gotten hit on that in Ohio because Canada is our No. 1  trading partner. We send more stuff to Canada than any other country-- much more. Our farmers in Ohio, our manufacturers in Ohio are nervous  because they are seeing tariffs going up on their products going to  Canada because Canada is retaliating because they don't see this as a  fair thing we are doing. They don't think it is a national security  threat.   Section 232 was designed, I think properly, to deal with real  national security threats. I think it ought to be preserved for that. I  think it ought to be used for that. I think we ought to aggressively go  after countries that are trading unfairly, and when there is a surge  and when there is a proven material damage to a U.S. industry, we ought  to respond, but I think we have to be careful as to how we do it. I  think we are otherwise inviting this escalation of tariffs on both  sides, which is exactly what is happening.   I am pleased to say that yesterday a group of us introduced  legislation to try to get back to the original purpose of section 232.  It is called the Trade Security Act. I introduced it last year. We  reintroduced it again yesterday. I introduced it along with my  colleagues Doug Jones, Joni Ernst, Dianne Feinstein, Lamar Alexander,  Deb Fischer, Todd Young, Kyrsten Sinema, and Roger Wicker--not a group  of Members you would see on every piece of legislation; some on the  left, some on the right, some Republican, some Democratic--but a group  who all agree, in this case, it is best for us to have some constraints  on 232 to take it back to its original purpose, which is really for  national security.   With regard to steel and aluminum and the 232 tariffs that were put  in place back in 2017--you may know this, but when the administration  was asked to opine on it, the Department of Defense said it is not a  national security threat. That is now public. The memo from the  Department of Defense said: We have enough steel production in this  country to take care of our military needs. It is not a national  security issue for us.   The Department of Commerce had a different view. Their view was that  this is, broadly speaking, a national security threat so we should put  these tariffs in place--again, without having to show injury or damage  or without having to show unfairness.   Our legislation is a response to that. It doesn't affect what has  happened in the past; it is prospective. What it does say is, going  forward, we ought to have to prove it is a national security threat.   By the way, one reason this legislation is timely is, the  administration has said they are now interested in putting additional  232 tariffs in place, potentially--and I say potentially because I hope  they will not--not on steel and aluminum only but also on automobiles  and auto parts.   There is a lot of nervousness about that. I talked earlier about our  strong economy and working with the administration what we have been  able to do on regulatory relief and on tax cuts and tax reforms. That  is all good. I would tell you, the trade policy issues on 232 are  making a lot of people nervous. There is a lot of uncertainty about  what might happen, particularly with regard to autos and auto parts  now.   In just a few weeks, the Commerce Department is required to release  its report on 232. They will make a recommendation to the President on  whether to proceed with 232. A lot of people, including a lot of folks  in the U.S. auto industry and suppliers, are very concerned that the  Commerce Department might find that auto imports threaten our Nation's  security, and they will recommend the President take action. In my  view, again, this would be a misuse of our trade tools. This is  supposed to be for national security concerns. I don't think minivans  from Canada pose a national security threat to the United States of  America. I do know it poses a threat to the workers I represent. It is  going to be bad for the auto industry and bad for its workers. By the  way, all three of the Big Three U.S. auto manufacturers are against  extending 232 to automobiles, and that is why they are supportive of  our legislation.   I want to see more cars made in Ohio. I am OK if they are made in  other States, too, but I want to see them made in America. I don't want  to see more cars being made offshore. That is what I am concerned is  going to happen if those tariffs go into place. Why? Because it is  going to be a lot more expensive to make a car here. These cars are  global cars now. The supply chains are all over the place. They end up  being made in our States--including in Ohio, where we have a strong  auto industry, and we love that, and strong suppliers--but they bring  parts in from around the world.   The analysis I have seen shows that if we put 232 on automobiles, it  would increase the cost of making a car in the United States by about  $2,000--$2,000 a car. For imported vehicles, the cost would likely  increase to about $6,000 a car.   Think for a moment about the impact on the families we talked about  earlier who are finally seeing their wages begin to creep up. Working  families who have played by the rules, have done everything right, are  finally seeing this economy be strong enough that there is wage growth  happening above inflation, and now they are told: Guess what. You want  a new car? It is $2,000 more for your new car. That means that car  payment is going to be a lot more. That means, frankly, I think a lot  of people will delay buying a car. That is not good for the auto  industry. I think it is something we should try to avoid.    Second, compounding these costs is the fact that, guess who is going  to be in the crosshairs of retaliation if this happens: the auto  industry.   Guess what our No. 1 export is from the United States of America in  value, the No. 1 export of any product: cars and auto parts.  Automobiles and auto parts are our No. 1 export. It is very likely, if  we put in these tariffs on a national security basis, not because of  unfairness, not because it is a surge, not because of the domestic  industry being materially damaged--which is part of the international  rules that people understand--but if we do it because of our national  security exception, it is very likely, and I think it is  [[Page S1114]]  sure, that we are going to see retaliation, tariffs going up on their  side, which again is going to hurt our country because one of every  five cars and light trucks built in America is built for export, and we  export a lot of auto parts, the No. 1 export. I am worried it is going  to put a target on the autoworkers in Ohio and elsewhere if we move  forward with this.   The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that  section 232 auto tariffs would put 195,000 American jobs at risk. They  also say, when retaliation is included, that jumps to potentially  624,000 American jobs on the chopping block. That is the Peterson  Institute for International Economics. Check out their data on the  website and see what you think. It is a big risk. That is the point.   These auto tariffs don't work; they don't work for farmers; they  don't work for workers in other industries; they don't work, in my  view, for our autoworkers because of this big risk we are talking  about. About 25 percent of our State's factory workers are export  workers in Ohio. Exports are really important to us. We want more  exports. We want people to knock down their barriers to let us send  more of our great ``Made in Ohio'' and ``Made in America'' products to  them.   About one of every three acres planted in Ohio is planted for export:  soybeans, corn, wheat. We want more markets because we want higher  prices. Prices are low right now, partly because other countries are  retaliating against us on agriculture. We want to open more of those  markets to create more jobs and higher prices for our farmers.   Trade jobs, by the way, are good jobs too. These export jobs pay  well--on average, 16 percent higher than other jobs. So it is not only  more jobs, it is better jobs.   Instead of inviting retaliation and closing off international  markets, we want policies that are going to open more markets. Cracking  down on unfair trade--yes, absolutely. Cheating should never be  acceptable. A level playing field is important, and there is not  reciprocity now. We are a more open and free market than most other  countries. So, yes, but let's do it based on the rules, based on  fairness, and based on the kind of policies that aren't going to invite  retaliation.   It is not only that national security is something we ought to use  judiciously. When minivans from an ally like Canada are considered a  national security threat, something is wrong, but it is also that this  could be much broader than just autos.   After the Finance Committee's hearing on section 232 last summer, I  asked the Commerce Department a question for the record about whether  they believed there was an industry--any industry--in America that  could not meet the national security criteria in section 232. Their  response indicated they believe potentially every industry in America  could meet that criteria. So it could move from autos to other  industries, as far as they are concerned, even when, again, there is no  sense that industry is under pressure, is materially injured, or where  there is unfairness in the trade.   I think that is a huge departure from what this Congress meant 57  years ago when they wrote section 232. It was meant to be for national  security. Let's keep it to that. Let's use our other trade laws  appropriately and aggressively for other instances.   During the debate over section 232, Representative Cooper from  Tennessee, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee--the committee  in the House that deals with trade--underscored the importance of the  statute as a national security tool. He said:         The [purpose of the] national security exception is to       protect and preserve the national security. That is its sole       purpose. It is not intended to serve as a device to afford       protection to those industries who might claim it.    Don't take the chairman's word for it. I refer you to the Cabinet  Task Force on Oil Import Controls report. In 1970, President Richard  Nixon directed Secretary of Labor George Shultz--a friend of mine who  was later Secretary of State--to conduct a comprehensive analysis of  the national security implications of oil imports, and it remains today  the best historical resources we have on the proper meaning of section  232. The report states:         No determination under section 232 or its predecessors have       ever been made on the ground of economic impact alone. And in       a generally healthy economy it cannot be presumed that       unrestricted trade in any one sector would by itself impair       the national security.    That was George Shultz. As I see it, with our economic growth and job  creation right now, a trade deficit alone in automobile parts would  appear insufficient to trigger restrictions based on national security.   With this history in mind, it is worth noting that the 232 statute  has been used, again, very infrequently since 1962. We can find only a  half dozen cases when it has been used. There have been 26  investigations. Only six times did the President take action. By the  way, before this administration took action in 2017, the last one was  33 years ago in 1986. Again, one reason it has hardly ever been used is  because it is viewed as an exception to our trade laws. You don't have  to show injury to a domestic industry. You don't have to show a surge  or unfair trade in any way. You don't have to show that there is  something under the international rules that gives you the ability to  impose those tariffs that then don't result in retaliation from others.   I remember, after President George W. Bush was elected, there was  concern about doing something to help our steel industry at the time.  We needed help in the steel industry, and section 232 was looked at.  They investigated it at the President's request. In that case, the  Commerce Department came back and said it is not a national security  issue. So the President used another part of the trade law, an  appropriate part, where he had to make some of these showings about  material damage to the industry, which is section 201 in the trade  laws.   Section 232 has been narrowly defined until now. I think we need to  get back to that proper definition. That is exactly why we need this  legislation. Misusing section 232 and the national security rationale  not only leads to other countries increasing tariffs, but it also, in  my view, risks us losing the tool altogether. I think we ought to keep  the tool. I think it is an important tool to have as part of our  response if there is a true national security--but if you misuse it, I  believe what is going to happen is that the World Trade Organization is  going to find that we no longer have this ability.   Why do I say that? Because there are already cases in the WTO, the  World Trade Organization, against the United States. These cases are  saying that 232 has been improperly used. They are saying because they  filed these cases against us, they would like to have a decision by the  WTO. I think we run a greater risk of losing this tool if the  administration moves forward with autos and auto parts, and I think  that is a real problem. The WTO could say that the United States can no  longer use this national security tool. I would rather use it properly  and be able to keep the tool.    Yesterday, when we introduced this legislation. We addressed the  misuse of this tool. We said we wanted to preserve it for national  security threats. I want to thank, in particular, Chairman Chuck  Grassley of the Finance Committee for his very positive comments that  he has consistently made about the Trade Security Act, last year and  again this year.   This week, he talked about how he would like to work with us to get  this proposal done. What does the proposal do?   First, it ensures that the proper experts of the government determine  at the outset whether it is a national security threat or not. I  mentioned that right now it is housed in the Commerce Department. It  should be in the Department of Defense. They are the experts who  determine the national security basis for import restrictions. Under  our legislation, if the Department of Defense does determine through  their research that there is a national security threat, then, it goes  to the Commerce Department. The Commerce Department is in charge of the  remedy, which is appropriate. By the way, with regard to steel, we know  that the Department of Defense said that this is not a national  security issue. At the end, of course, the President still makes the  decision. But it is a two-step process to get there, which I think is  very important.  [[Page S1115]]    Second, the bill gives Congress a voice in this. It allows Congress  the opportunity to disapprove of a section 232 action by passing a  joint resolution. Currently, Congress can disapprove of 232 actions  through a joint resolution, but only with regard to oil, because when  this was last used back during the oil embargoes, Congress reacted by  saying: Well, with regard to oil, you have to have our approval after  the fact.   I will tell you that our bill is not the only legislation on this  topic. Other legislative approaches go further, and I think they  effectively take away the national security tool by saying that instead  of a motion of disapproval after the fact, there has to be a motion of  approval from Congress to move forward.   I believe that under the Constitution, the congressional article I  responsibilities--including commerce between the nations--require us to  have a voice in this, but I also believe the administration needs to  have the ability to react quickly to a true national security threat  and not have to go through Congress, which sometimes, as you may have  heard, takes some time. We tend to get tied up in knots up here quite a  lot.   I like our approach better. I think it is about protecting auto  States and export States from the consequences of misusing 232 in the  future, but it does it in the appropriate way. This is about stopping  retaliation against our farmers and our workers. It is not retroactive,  but it is prospective, saying: Let's get the broadest consensus  possible among industry, among Members of Congress, and within the  Finance Committee to get something done here that takes us back to the  original intent of section 232. Again, when properly used, it can be an  important part of our trade enforcement arsenal for real national  security concerns. We want to keep it for that. It should not be used  inappropriately as it has been, in my view, without showing the  national security threat. My hope is that this legislation now can move  quickly through the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee  so that we can put in place something that makes sense to refocus on  the original intent.   Ultimately, I believe the economic and legal case for 232 tariffs on  automobiles going forward cannot be made. I believe that is why we need  reform.   Let's restore this important tool to Congress's original intentions.  Let's be sure section 232 is used appropriately and selectively for  genuine national reasons.   The strength of our economy, as I said earlier, comes from the right  policies, but, ultimately, it comes from hard-working and innovative  Americans in the shops and the plants--as I will see tomorrow in the  Ohio plants I mentioned earlier--and the farms around our States that  send products all around the globe. We want more of that. They deserve  a level playing field. We should give them the chance to compete.   Let's be sure that our trade policy doesn't result in escalating  tariffs that hurt those very workers, those very farmers, and families.  Let's find the right balance, including restoring important national  security tools by not misusing it. I urge my colleagues to join us in  supporting the Trade Security Act to help do just that.   I yield back my time.
