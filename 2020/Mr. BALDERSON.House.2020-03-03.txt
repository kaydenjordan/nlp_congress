 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on an issue that  touches the lives of countless Ohioans because it affects everyone with  loved ones and family members.   When a hardworking Federal employee gives birth to a child, has a  parent is in the hospital, or needs to take leave for any medical or  family-related reason, they are able to do so through paid family  leave.   Sadly, thousands of Federal employees, many of whom live and work in  Ohio's 12th Congressional District, were left out of the most recent  reauthorization of paid family leave for Federal employees.   These TSA agents; FAA workers, including air traffic controllers at  John Glenn Airport; and VA healthcare providers, such as doctors,  dentists, and nurses, work hard. They deserve to take time off for  medical and family reasons without affecting their pay. That is why I  introduced the VAlue FAAmily Act, which would correct this oversight  and extend 12 weeks of paid family leave to these forgotten employees.   FMLA, and the lives of Federal employees, should not be compromised.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 5993, the VAlue  FAAmily Act.                            ____________________
