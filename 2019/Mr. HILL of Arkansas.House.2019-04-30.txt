 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I thank Madam Speaker for the opportunity to speak on this important  resolution, H. Res. 327, and I want to thank my good friend from  Illinois, Dr. Foster, for his passion on this measure to benefit,  particularly, the young people in this country.   Certainly, as the most prominent Ph.D. in the House of  Representatives and a pioneering entrepreneur, he knows the value of  financial literacy.   And I am proud, as a former community banker and investment manager,  somebody who dealt with families, their kids, and older Americans for  30 years in finance, to partner on this very important promotion of  financial literacy for students and young adults.   It is wonderful that it is a bipartisan effort by our committee.   And it is truly unfortunate, Madam Speaker, that only 25 States  require high school students to take a financial literacy class in  order to graduate. As a result, many children and adolescents grow into  adults who don't know how to properly save, spend, and budget.   I am proud that Arkansas is one of those 25 States, Madam Speaker, as  we enacted our requirement back in 2005. But, going back even further  to 1962, Arkansas, through the leadership of Bessie Moore, a remarkable  educator in our State, created something called Economics Arkansas,  which, every summer, puts on financial literacy training for all of our  teachers, K through 12, so that they understand to put financial  literacy in all the classrooms.   It was a lot of fun last week when we were in the district to go to  Robinson Senior High School in Little Rock and see them compete for the  Stock Market Game, which is a major component in financial literacy  training, through Economics Arkansas.                                time  1230    So not everyone, every student is as lucky as an Arkansan, because  two-thirds of Americans can't pass a financial literacy test, Madam  Speaker. Forty-four percent do not have enough savings to cover a $400  emergency, and 33 percent have not saved for their retirement.   Financial illiteracy has broader economic costs, higher debt, limited  savings. For many, this limits their homeownership. This means they  don't have a stable retirement. And for many of our young adults, this  critical knowledge creates the burden that we have seen in student loan  lending in this country where families are not treating higher  education debt as seriously as they treat buying that first house.   Why is that, Madam Speaker? It is because of the lack, in my view, of  financial literacy at the high school level, at our admissions offices  in colleges, and that is why it was terrific, bipartisan, that this  time last year in the last Congress, in September, we passed, with over  400 votes in this House, a measure that requires financial literacy  training for students seeking a student loan, for students accepting a  Pell grant. That is the kind of good work that this House has been  doing.   I want to again thank my friend, Mr. Foster, for his work. As we  close Financial Literacy Month, I can't think of a better topic, and I  can't think of a better friend to share that work with.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close. I have  no other speakers on this important matter.   I just want to continue to thank my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle and our lead sponsor, Dr. Foster, for his thoughtful  elevation of the importance of financial literacy for all of our  students and their families.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support, as well, of H.R. 1876, the Senior  Security Act, and I want to thank my friends and colleagues, the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer) and the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), for their collaboration and work on this  important bipartisan legislation, all focused on protecting our  seniors.   Madam Speaker, America's capital markets are open. They are  innovative, and they are essential for our families. That is how we  live the American Dream. We can grow a nest egg that helps us for our  retirement, helps put our kids or grandkids through college, or helps  buy a home.   But as Americans age, they become more critical to the success of  those open, transparent, and vibrant capital markets because those  Americans over 50, Madam Speaker, roughly, have 77 percent of the  financial assets in our country.   So when bad actors violate our laws and regulations, commit fraud, or  exploit our senior Americans or their families, the integrity of those  transparent and open markets and the opportunity of that American Dream  are threatened.   To that end, protecting senior investors and preventing such behavior  within our financial system is a shared goal. H.R. 1876 protects senior  investors and will help the SEC reduce increasing instances of  financial exploitation. It will create an interdivisional task force at  the SEC to examine and identify challenges facing senior investors.   I have to say, Madam Speaker, over two decades of working in the  investment world and working with the SEC and working with FINRA, the  regulatory body for broker-dealers and investment advisers, their  efforts of sweep exams and the education of the responsibilities of  investment advisers are critical.                                time  1245    This will give them more tools to identify what the gaps are today.   I would add, in my career, that gap extends way beyond financial  advisers to CPAs, lawyers, people in a position of trust that advise  and guide over Americans.   It is shocking for us to report that $36 billion each year are lost  to financial scams in this country and that one out of five seniors  have reported being victims of exploitation.   Many States are taking action on their own. According to the National  Conference of State Legislators: ``The number of bills introduced by  State legislators to combat elder financial exploitation increased by  over 57 percent in 3 years.''   So this bipartisan bill is a very important step in generating  awareness at the Federal level of the need to strengthen protections  for our senior investors.   Madam Speaker, protecting seniors and ensuring the integrity of our  capital markets are things that I believe we all stand behind on this  House floor. It is our duty to protect our constituents, particularly  the most vulnerable, and that is why I urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 1876.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the work of the  sponsor, Mr. Gottheimer, and his important personal testimony about his  family and the importance of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), the minority sponsor of this bill and  my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Indiana's comments. He has been an excellent author.   Again, Madam Speaker, you hear the testimony from both sides of the  aisle, from constituents in both these districts, and the importance of  this.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of my colleagues, we urge adoption of H.R.  1876, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 328, Supporting the  Protection of Elders Through Financial Literacy. This collaboration by  Mr. Casten of Illinois and Mr. Rose of Tennessee is, again, an  important bipartisan effort to focus on financial literacy during  Financial Literacy Month as well as to call attention to the challenges  that we have in making sure that our senior Americans are taken care of  and their financial well-being.   According to research conducted by the AARP Public Policy Institute,  one in five older Americans is a victim of financial exploitation each  year. These victims lose up to $3 billion annually, or more than  $120,000 per victim, which is more than most Americans have in their  entire retirement savings.   Sadly, only 1 in 44 cases is reported. That is the challenge that we  have talked about here this afternoon, that we make sure that that  reporting is identified so that restitution can be made.   I am proud of the work the Congress did on the Senior Safe Act,  legislation that originated in the Financial Services Committee and was  ultimately signed into law last year. That legislation took an  important step in offering greater financial protection to seniors by  encouraging financial institutions, investment advisers, and brokers to  report suspected fraud or elder abuse to law enforcement--a good step.   This resolution we are now discussing also complements the fine work  of Mr. Gottheimer and Mr. Hollingsworth for their work on the Senior  Security Act.   Prevention is the best solution. More can and should be done to  educate seniors and all Americans on healthy financial habits and  protection against financial exploitation.   The unfortunate reality is that seniors can be especially vulnerable  to financial fraud, as outlined by Mr. Gottheimer and Mr.  Hollingsworth. Even according to the SEC's own report in 2018, ``Elder  Financial Exploitation,'' it is attributed to cognitive decline and  wealth held by older generations.   We must work together to ensure that bad actors don't take advantage  of this population. These crimes range from complex scams to the all- too-common case of someone close to an elderly person tricking them  into signing away money that they had saved for retirement. It is this  last type of exploitation that is especially troubling.                                time  1300    As I referenced a few minutes ago, people in a position of trust:  lawyers, CPAs, financial advisers.   H. Res. 328 highlights the importance of educating the elderly about  healthy financial habits that include protecting one's finances from  financial exploitation. You can't take it for granted that we know  better than to finance a child's entrapment in Mexico or that you are  going to help a Nigerian prince. It sounds farfetched. But it happens  every single day across this country, and education is the best form of  prevention.   I think we can all agree that the status quo is not enough. H. Res.  328 raises much-needed public awareness for the importance of personal  financial education for the elderly and highlights the collaboration  between banks, law enforcement, and financial advisers to protect older  generations.   For those reasons, I congratulate and thank my friends,  Representatives Casten and Rose, for their good work.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. John W. Rose), the Republican author of this  measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, this has been a good afternoon on a  bipartisan basis to talk about the importance of financial literacy. It  is something we all try to practice what we preach. We try to encourage  a broad sense of partnership between the regulators, our financial  services firms, the AARP, our schools, and other people to enhance  financial literacy from adolescence to elder years. And I think about  what we have heard today on what we are trying to protect our  constituents from through education: internet scams, Nigerian princes'  schemes, violators from a trusted person.   And then I thought back, just sitting here, Madam Speaker, of my own  in-laws, now deceased about 7 years--one with Alzheimer's and one just  old-age infirmities--and cleaning up all the sweepstakes applications  that they had received and sent money to in those final years of their  life.   I thank my friends, led by Dr. Foster and others. I congratulate  Representative Casten and Representative Rose on this particular  measure, H. Res. 328. I urge all of my colleagues to support it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
