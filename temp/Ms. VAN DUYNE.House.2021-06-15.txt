 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my  colleagues' bill, H.R. 2016, the Federal Disaster Assistance  Coordination Act.   When I was Regional Secretary for HUD during Hurricane Harvey,  Hurricane Maria, and Hurricane Irma, I saw firsthand the bureaucratic  web of red tape and inefficiencies that prevented getting help to those  who needed it the most in a timely manner.   I spoke with several of you in this body on both sides of the aisle,  who came to me fighting for your constituents, asking why it was taking  so long to get aid. I felt and understood your frustration, but had to  explain the long list of policies, procedures, and red tape that our  regulations demanded. And, boy, I never felt like more of a bureaucrat  than when I spoke with you.   It is a very difficult position for our folks to be in. These  inefficiencies have serious costs.   This is a bipartisan piece of commonsense legislation to establish  procedures to streamline and consolidate processes. When we allocate  dollars, they need to get to those who are suffering the most. And the  last thing we need is for them to be caught up in a bureaucracy of the  government's making.   The faster FEMA is able to help get to communities of need, the  faster they can recover. It is critically important that these agencies  all work together.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation.                                time  1345
