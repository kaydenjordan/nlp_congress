 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for  allowing me the time.   I rise today in opposition to H.R. 8 and want to lay out a couple of  reasons for my opposition.   Before I do, I think it is important to acknowledge how polarizing  this debate has become over the last several years. More specifically,  I want this body to know that, as a human being, as an American, as a  father, when I see the heartbreaking news of a mass shooting like the  one we saw just 54 weeks ago in Parkland, it just breaks my heart.   With that being said, this bill that we are voting on today would not  have done anything to stop that tragedy from happening, nor would it  have prevented any of those recent mass shootings.   The 19-year-old murderer in Parkland passed a background check.   The man who murdered 26 innocent people at First Baptist Church in  Sutherland Springs also passed a background check, although he wouldn't  have if the Air Force had passed along his criminal information like  they were supposed to have done.   And the evil that took place in Sandy Hook wouldn't have been stopped  by this bill either. The killer used his mother's guns to kill her and  26 others. They were bought legally.   Mr. Chairman, the simple fact is that criminals don't abide by the  law, and this would only create traps for law-abiding gun owners.   However, there are actions that we can take, actions that we can do,  that would make meaningful strides in combating the violence that we  see today.   One example of something we could do, improve information sharing  between law enforcement officials across this country.   Mr. Chair, to close, I disagree with the policy of this bill.
