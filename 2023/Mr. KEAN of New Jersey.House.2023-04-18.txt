 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Yom HaShoah,  a solemn day where people of all faiths have come together to honor the  over 6 million Jews who lost their lives during the Holocaust.   Today, we remember the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany and  reaffirm our commitment to never forget the lessons of one of the  darkest chapters in human history.   It is also a day to recognize the survivors who have borne witness to  the horrors of genocide and have shown us the strength of the human  spirit in the face of unimaginable evil.   It is our responsibility to ensure that future generations learn the  lessons of the Holocaust. We must teach our children a full and  accurate history so that these acts of hate and intolerance never  happen again.   As we observe Holocaust Remembrance Day, let's honor the memory of  those who perished, celebrate the resilience of those who survived, and  recommit ourselves to creating a world where hate and intolerance have  no place.                            ____________________
