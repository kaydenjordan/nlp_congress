 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the en bloc amendments  and in support of the underlying bill.   Passing this defense bill is one of the most important constitutional  responsibilities of Congress. I commend Chairman Thornberry for his  leadership, and I thank him for his support of my amendments.   I was pleased to join with my bipartisan colleagues, Congressman   Michael Burgess and Congresswoman Barbara Lee, in offering an amendment  auditing the Pentagon fully. This has been promised for many years, and  I am pleased that it is in this bill.   I thank Chairman Thornberry for including my bipartisan amendment  that would officially create th first-ever Department of Defense  commendation for military working dogs and their handlers.    Nine military working dog handlers from the home State I represent,  New Jersey, have been killed in action, and one of my constituents from  Short Hills, New Jersey, was among these.   Mr. Chairman, I think we should be voting on the en bloc amendments  favorably and also voting favorably for the underlying bill.
