 Mr. Speaker, the Trump Presidency has been  characterized by chaos, crisis, and confusion, and this Republican  healthcare debacle has been no different.   The American people clearly understand that TrumpCare will be an  unmitigated disaster. Under TrumpCare, working families will pay more  and get less. Under TrumpCare, premiums will increase. Under TrumpCare,  copays will increase. Under TrumpCare, deductibles will increase. Under  TrumpCare, out-of-pocket expenses will increase.   Under TrumpCare, 24 million hardworking Americans will lose their  health coverage. Under TrumpCare, individuals between the age of 50 and  64 will pay a regressive age tax.   Health care is a matter of life and death; that is why we take it so  seriously. TrumpCare will lead to increased death, disease, and  destitution, and that is why we oppose this horrible piece of  legislation.
