 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 3053.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I am going to have a lot of people wanting to come to the  floor, so I will abbreviate my opening remarks and just address a few  questions that are going to be raised.   First, I just want to highlight the fact that you are going to hear a  lot about local, consensus-based decisionmaking, and then you are also  going to hear about closeness of proximity. This chart kind of  highlights what we are talking about.   The red is Federal Government land. The Federal Government land is  larger than 31 countries on the Earth. You have three different  sections. You have the national test and training range. You have the  national security site. You have also some Fish and Wildlife/Interior  land, bigger than many of our States in our Union. So, to my  colleagues, I want to make sure they have in perspective the size of  the area that we are talking about: bigger than the State of  Connecticut and areas that people are going to talk about.   That is one question that will be addressed. Another question will be  the fear of tourism, because Las Vegas gets 42 million tourists a year,  and they seem to be concerned that this might affect that industry. And  then it dawned on me that the city of Chicago gets 55 million tourists  a year--55 million--and they have over 10,000 metric tons of spent  nuclear fuel in Chicagoland.   So I want to make sure that my friends in Nevada understand that that  should not be a terrible concern when Chicago seems to be doing well  with tourism on that issue.   Also, there will be a debate about transportation. I just want to  call attention, Mr. Chairman, through you to my colleagues that we  operate a nuclear Navy. That nuclear Navy has to have the power systems  refueled. That means new nuclear fuel goes there. That means spent  nuclear fuel goes off the nuclear Navy ships. That is on the ocean.  That is either on the Atlantic Ocean or on the Pacific Ocean. This  spent fuel goes to Idaho, which means that we transport, safely, spent  nuclear fuel, and we have done it for decades.   Those are the three main contentions you will hear with this bill. I  am going to allow my colleagues to talk about all the great benefits of  this bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop: On June 28, 2017, the Committee on       Energy and Commerce ordered favorably reported H.R. 3053, the       Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017. This bill was       additionally referred to the Committee on Natural Resources.        I ask that the Committee on Natural Resources not insist on       its referral of the bill so that H.R. 3053 may be scheduled       for consideration by the Majority Leader. This concession in       no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of       the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Natural Resources represented on the conference committee.       Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and your       response in the bill report and in the Congressional Record.        Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the       extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over       matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further       opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                    Washington, DC, October 6, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter concerning       H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017,       which was additionally referred to the Committee on Natural       Resources.        In the interest of permitting you to proceed expeditiously       to floor consideration, I will allow the Committee on Natural       Resources to be discharged from further consideration of the       bill. I do so with the understanding that the Committee does       not waive any jurisdictional claim over the subject matter       contained in the bill that fall within its Rule X       jurisdiction. I also request that you support my request to       name members of the Committee on Natural Resources to any       conference committee to consider such provisions. Finally,       please include this letter in the report on the bill and into       the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure       on the House floor.        Thank you again for the very cooperative spirit in which       you and your staff have worked regarding many issues of       shared interest over the Congress.            Sincerely,                                                        Rob Bishop,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, October 13, 2017.      Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thornberry: Thank you for your letter       concerning H.R. 3053, Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of       2017, which was additionally referred to the Committee on       Armed Services.        I appreciate your willingness to waive your committee's       further consideration of H.R. 3053, and I agree that by       waiving consideration of the bill, the Committee on Armed       Services does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over       the subject matters contained in the legislation which fall       within its Rule X jurisdiction. I will urge the Speaker to       name members of your committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        In addition, I agree that the DOE Record of Decision       concerning rail corridor siting will not impinge on the       activities of the Department of Defense and Department of       Energy at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site and the Nevada       Test and Training Range.        Finally, I will place a copy of your letter and this       response into the committee report on H.R. 3053 and into the       Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on       the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,      Chairman.                                   ____                                        Committee on Armed Services,                                        House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, October 13, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       3053, the ``Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017.''       There are certain provisions in the bill which fall within       the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Armed Services.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important       legislation, I am willing to waive this committee's further       consideration of H.R. 3053. I do so with the understanding       that by waiving consideration of the bill, the Committee on       Armed Services does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the subject matters contained in the legislation which       fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge       the Speaker to name members of this committee to any       conference committee which is named to consider such       provisions.        The decision to waive this committee's consideration is       also based, in part, on an agreement with the Committee on       Energy and Commerce that the DOE Record of Decision       concerning rail corridor siting will not impinge on the       activities of the Department of Defense and Department of       Energy at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site and the Nevada       Test and Training Range.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest, and our mutual       understanding that a rail siting will not impede DoD and DoE       sites, into the committee report on H.R. 3053 and into the       Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on       the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in       which you have worked regarding this matter and others       between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                     William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the full Energy  and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton), the former chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Lance), who is on the committee, and has been  doing great work to deal with his constituents.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), a subcommittee chair of the Committee on  Appropriations.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Mimi Walters), who has been very helpful in this  project.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. Handel).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Barton).   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am not closing yet. We are waiting for the majority whip.   Mr. Chairman, I want to highlight a couple of issues, of course, that  have been raised. In my brief opening statement I reminded the folks-- and I see my colleague from Chicagoland on the floor--Chicago gets 55  million visitors a year. In Chicagoland there are 10,000 metric tons.  That is in the community, that is where there are condos, and it is  right there.   This proposed long-term repository is 90 miles away from Las Vegas.  It is a mountain in a desert. If it gets approved, final adjudication.   And what has held up the final adjudication? Politics on the  appropriation matter, which I think this bill is going to help solve,  because once we get a good vote--my colleagues, I don't think we voted  on an authorization bill, on this issue on an authorization bill, since  2002.                                time  1015    That is when the State of Nevada objected, per the law. They were  allowed to do that. We had a chance, then, to override that veto.  Because, as Mark Sanford said, this is a national problem that demands  a national solution.   So the law laid out an opportunity to hear the complaints from the  State of Nevada and say ``yes'' or ``no.'' They said ``no.''   The law laid out the opportunity for the national legislative body  and the President of the United States to decide to accept or reject  that.   I think this Chamber vote was about 350 to reject the State of  Nevada's opposition. The Senate rejected it on a voice vote.   So we have been through this numerous times. We know where the  majority of Representatives are, and we know where the majority of  Senators will be. We have just got to move. We have got to address this  national problem with a national solution.   Another issue that was just touched on by Chairman Walden, he spent a  lot of time on it, is spent nuclear fuel. This is ratepayers also  helping pay for our defense waste obligations. The nuclear weapons and  winning the Cold War created stockpiles of nuclear waste, toxic sludge,  in areas in four States primarily. Primarily, Washington State, also  South Carolina. Ratepayers are going to help safely dispose of that.   So when you take the national defense problem and the spent nuclear  fuel problem, we are moving forward in that direction.   Nevadans are not uniformly opposed to the repository. In fact, nine  of the surrounding counties have passed resolutions to move forward, at  least with the adjudication.   And as my colleagues from Nevada know, I have been to that State  quite a few times, and we talked to many, many people on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to also thank the staff on both  sides for their work. This is the way legislation is supposed to move.  You have hearings. In Energy and Commerce, we really have four: a  subcommittee hearing markup, subcommittee markup, full committee  markup, then we go through the process. So our staff has done a  tremendous job.   I also want to thank Ranking Member Pallone and Ranking Member Tonko  for their friendship and their actually good negotiating skills. As  they have told me many times, they have changed this bill through their  diligence, and that has got us here to a better product.   I will end up on three quick points. We have raised them before.   We can transport this safely. We have done it for decades.   Every day, taxpayers are paying from all 50 States into the Judgment  Fund because of our failure to meet our legal obligations. I think it  is almost $800 million a year that we pay because we are breaking the  law.   Independent scientific analysis of the Yucca Mountain repository  found the site can safely dispose of nuclear waste for 1 million years.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H3901]]         Mr. Chairman, I claim the time opposition, but I do not  oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague from  Massachusetts (Mr. Keating). I think this is a very needed amendment.   I would say one of the most frustrating things about this process,  and my colleagues on the other side know, is that we passed this bill  in June of last year. And then we had the funding, and the money, and  the debate, and the trust fund, and appropriators and budgeters.   Anything we can do to clear out and get some clear guidance on the  money, we may have to then move to another piece of legislation to  really clarify. Our bill does that for new revenue coming in, so I  think it is a great addition, and I appreciate him coming down.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority whip.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to end by saying I know there  are some rumblings out there about what is this litigation fund being  paid for and who is paying for it?   The United States Government is being sued. We have to make these  payments because we are not abiding by the law. It is not the private  industry.   There are rumblings out there about: Oh, we are relieving the nuclear  industry of reliability. That is absolutely false. We are going to  protect U.S. taxpayers from the liability that we are paying because  the Federal Government is not complying with the law.   And I want to make that straight. That is accountability, that is  transparency. That is what my colleague Mr. Keating is doing.   And with that, I support his amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.                                time  1030     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague from Illinois-- one of the Chicagolanders that I talk about--for bringing this  amendment. I use his district--and I have used it for years--to talk  about the challenges that we face if we do nothing.   This authorization bill is designed to start doing something, and,  actually, it is designed to help us comply with the law that is already  written.   Zion is the perfect example of the need to move spent nuclear fuel to  an interim site and then a final geological repository, thus, freeing  up, obviously, great lakefront opportunities on the Great Lakes for  redevelopment that would help this community that suffered because of  the closure.   I am glad the gentleman is here. I appreciate the amendment. I am  going back to what Mark Sanford said: This is a national problem. We  need a national solution. That is what we are trying to do now in a  bipartisan manner. Good job. I thank the gentleman for offering the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have the right to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I again thank my colleague. I don't know if  he was in the Chamber when I mentioned that Chicagoland has 55 million  visitors and 10,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel. We would like to  solve that problem. The gentleman's amendment helps the communities as  we transition. It is additive to the overall bill. I am happy to  support it.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        May 10, 2018, on page H3908, the following appeared: Mr. Chair,  I urge adoption of the amendment.  Mr. Chair,  I have the right to close. I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. Chair, I again thank my colleague.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, the State of Nevada has  benefited from the nuclear age. It helped us win World War II. Also,  Nevada pays for our inability to comply with the law because,  nationally, we pay out of the Judgment Fund. So the taxpayers of the  State of Nevada are paying, through Federal tax liabilities, for us not  complying with the law. So I just want to make that straight.   There are two main problems with my colleague's amendment. One is-- and it is just the language--it is a striking bill, which says that,  all of this debate of interim storage that we are having, her amendment  strikes that. All of the discussion about how we are trying to protect  the ratepayers--especially in the future--her amendment strikes that.   Her amendment strikes the final regulatory review of the Yucca  Mountain site. The NRC, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said in their  safety evaluation report that Yucca Mountain would be safe for 1  million years.                                time  1045    Current law allows the State of Nevada to challenge that, but my  colleague's amendment strikes that. And what we have done in this  legislation is we have said: We understand the concerns of the State of  Nevada. Current law says: Because you vetoed it, you get no benefits.   In this bill, we said: That is not fair. We are going to allow the  State of Nevada to receive the benefits that they request in moving  forward. Your amendment strikes that, so your amendment strikes the  opportunity for the State of Nevada to get any benefits once we move  forward.   The other part of the problem with this amendment is the terminology  is very vague as to local government entities. And we think that is  probably intentional. It is intentional so that you can never get a  number of local entities to ever decide. We kind of looked at, based  upon the way the language is written, who would be considered. Well, a  local entity, a community in the State of Utah, Minersville, population  887, 300 miles from the site, could be able to veto this national  solution to a national problem.   Now, that means--and I can't wait to visit Minersville someday--that  they are going to have more power than the Federal Government and this  Chamber. They are going to have the veto authority over the State of  New Jersey or the State of Illinois or the State of--I don't know how  many States came here to debate on this bill. Quite a few.   So a couple problems: the first problem is, it is a strike amendment,  which means everything that you have done, all those adjustments that I  have worked in a bipartisan manner, throw them out; and that you cannot  get to understand the universe of local communities that would have a  veto over this national solution to a national problem.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am glad my friend from Oregon mentioned  the blue ribbon commission. The blue ribbon commission was told: Do not  consider Yucca Mountain. So come on. Really? Pull out the blue ribbon  commission and say ``this is the truth'' when they were told: Consider  everything else, but you can't consider the law of the land.  Preposterous.   To my colleague, Chairman Walden--actually in Oregon--this is  Hanford. These are the tanks next to the Columbia River, which goes  next to Oregon. And you are saying it has no defense-related provisions  for this bill? Come on now. Let's move forward.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
