 Madam Speaker, today I rise to celebrate one of the most  prominent African American women in my community and our Nation's  history, Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune.   At an early age, Dr. Bethune took an interest in the power of  learning and promoting civil rights. In 1904, Dr. Bethune opened the  Daytona Literary and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls in  Daytona Beach, which later merged with the Cookman Institute for Men in  Jacksonville to form Bethune-Cookman College, now University, where she  served as president.   As Dr. Bethune worked to build the school she founded, she also  became a national leader on issues related to civil rights, women, and  young people, even providing counsel to U.S. Presidents.   In 2018, the Florida legislature passed and the governor signed  legislation to place a statue in her honor representing Florida in the  National Statuary Hall collection here in the Capitol.   Dr. Bethune knew education is the key to a quality life and a better  life, and it is my honor to recognize her contributions on the floor  here today.                            ____________________
