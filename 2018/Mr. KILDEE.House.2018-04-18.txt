 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Nicholas Thomas Evans,  a leader in my district and a champion for Genesee County families, who  passed away rather suddenly just recently.   Nick was born in London, England, but raised in Holly, Michigan.  Nicholas started his career as a leader in the Genesee County branch of  the American Cancer Society. In 1998, he accepted a position at  Kettering University, and in 2003, he came to the Genesys Health  System.   During his career, Nicholas did so much and offered so much to our  community, leading important initiatives like the Genesys Health Park  Campus  [[Page H3431]]  Plan, the PACE program in Flint, the revitalization of so many parts of  our community, and empowering women through the Michigan Food & Farming  Systems and the Women in Agriculture program.   There were so many things that Nick did. I can't even go through the  long list. But for all of us back home, we will just miss him.   His wife, Kim, and his daughters, Madison and Camryn, I am sure will  miss him forever. He loved them, he loved his community, and he gave so  much to his community. We loved him. He was a friend, and we will miss  him.                            ____________________
