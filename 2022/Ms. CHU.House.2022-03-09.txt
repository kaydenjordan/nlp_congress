 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill to  isolate and stop sending our money to Russia.   Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has already caused countless  deaths and injuries while forcing 1.5 million innocent refugees to flee  their homes. There must be consequences for this belligerence.   That is why I support cutting off Russia's oil and gas imports to the  U.S., seeking to suspend their participation in the World Trade  Organization, and extending our ability to implement further sanctions.  Global trade, the wealth it helps generate and the needs it helps to  meet, is a benefit of the very international order that Russia is  trying to undermine.   If Putin is declaring war on global peace and stability, then he  should also not be able to benefit from global peace and stability.   I believe that the promise of being able to once again profit from  global trade is a powerful incentive for Putin to end his war of  choice. I am proud to support using our economic influence for peace.
