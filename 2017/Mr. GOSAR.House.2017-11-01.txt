 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2936,  the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, introduced by my friend and  colleague Bruce Westerman.   Our forests and the communities that live, work, and rely on them  desperately need improved management practice to reduce these forest  fire disasters and to increase resiliency.   I was very pleased with the quick work by my friend and former  colleague OMB Director Mick Mulvaney for addressing the wildfire  funding crisis at the United States Forest Service, requesting $576.5  million for wildfire suppression and recommending active management  reforms.   Now, while the Trump administration came through in a big way for  Western communities that have been ravaged by catastrophic wildfires,  Congress must pass H.R. 2936 and get serious about combating  catastrophic wildfires before they get started.   The Resilient Federal Forests Act is a bipartisan, comprehensive  piece of legislation that simplifies the cumbersome planning process  and reduces the cost of implementing proactive forest management  strategies.   H.R. 2936 empowers local communities by getting them involved in the  decisionmaking process. It empowers Tribal communities to be part of  the solution and help reduce the risk of wildfire.   The bill removes incentives for extreme special interest groups to  file frivolous lawsuits. In fact, it requires litigants opposing active  management projects to propose an alternative plan as opposed to just  saying ``no.'' Imagine that, solutions over lawsuits.  [[Page H8335]]    Mismanagement has left our forests vulnerable to insects and disease  and ripe for catastrophic wildfires. It is clear the system is broken.  Western communities are tired of being victims, and this bill allows us  to be proactive and to prevent disasters before they become a risk.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record two letters, one from the  Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the second from the  National Association of Home Builders, in support of H.R. 2936.          Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies,                                     Washington, DC, June 26, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Ranking Democrat, House Natural Resources Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Democrat Grijalva: The       Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (Association) is       pleased to support H.R. 2936, the ``Resilient Federal Forest       Act of 2017'' (RFFA). All 50 state agencies are members of       the Association. Founded in 1902, the Association's mission       is to protect the interests and authorities of the states to       manage fish and wildlife within their borders, including on       federal land. The Association works closely with the federal       land management agencies to deliver on the ground       conservation of fish, wildlife and their habitats for our       citizens.        The Association is particularly appreciative of changes       made by the Committee staff at the request of the       Association. These changes make more prominent in federal       statute the states' authority to manage fish and wildlife on       U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land Management       (BLM) lands. Nothing in the amended language is intended to       change any existing federal, state or tribal authority. It       simply makes more evident the state-federal jurisdictional       relationship which Congress has affirmed. Federal-state       cooperation in this arena is compelled because the USFS and       BLM own the land and thus the habitat, and the state fish and       wildlife agencies manage the fish and wildlife. Robust       cooperation will provide that both land/habitat objectives       and fish and wildlife population objectives are met.        The RFFA is vitally needed to restore the health of our       Nation's federal forests on USFS and BLM lands.       Unfortunately, the USFS and BLM have fallen significantly       behind in meeting objectives for early successional stage       forest habitat, for a number of reasons. Significantly,       federal court decisions and increasing uninformed litigation       has created ``paralysis by analysis'' to quote a former USFS       Chief. Congress mandated that the federal forests were to be       managed for water quality, wildlife habitat, recreation, and       timber harvest. Active forest management by the federal       professional managers in cooperation with the state fish and       wildlife agency professional managers has been replaced by       natural resource management decisions being made by the       federal courts. A return to active forest management will       facilitate realization of all of the public values of federal       forests.        The Association much appreciates that the fire-borrowing       problem is addressed in HR 2936. While most catastrophic       fires occur in the western United States, this is a national       problem because the funds for every national forest and       public land unit are affected. This remedy will prevent the       USFS and BLM from having to borrow from other appropriated       line-items (for example, wildfire prevention, wildlife,       recreation and water quality) to pay for the cost of       catastrophic fire suppression, which cost consumes over 50%       of the USFS budget. We respectfully urge the Committee to       further protect the USFS budget by capping the 10-year       average cost of catastrophic fire costs at its current level.       The 10-year average is used by the USFS in building their       budget request. The 10-year average continues to rise and       unless it is capped it will continue to erode other important       budget line items such as wildlife, water quality, fire       prevention and recreation in the President's budget.        The Association further appreciates the process relief       provided to National Forest Plans (NFP) and (potentially)       Resource Management Plans (RMP) developed by collaborative       deliberation. It is appropriate that a collaborative-      developed plan, which often takes years to deliberate and       conclude, be subject to only two options under NEPA, proceed       or not proceed. It is very reasonable to assume that the       collaboratively deliberated process has examined and rejected       the other options, and only the action or no action need be       analyzed.        The bill's establishment of a pilot binding arbitration       process as an alternative to litigation in each FS Region is       certainly welcomed by the Association. Not only is the cost       of defending the land management plan a burden on the       agencies, but the planned for management work on the ground       is lost, perhaps never to be resurrected on that site. We       commend Congressman Westerman and the Committee for settling       on this significant improvement to litigation reform that was       in HR 2647 from the last Congress.        We also appreciate the increase in acreage ceilings for the       statutorily endorsed Categorical Exclusions (CEs) under NEPA.       CEs must avoid sensitive areas and must be consistent with       standards and guidelines in Forest Plans. Early forest       successional stage habitat, for instance, cannot be just       incidental to be effective in providing habitat for deer,       elk, wild turkey, neo-tropical migratory songbirds and other       species which are dependent on this habitat type. While an       acreage ceiling is an easy metric to measure success, the       desired forest future condition should really determine the       size of the timber harvest.        Additionally, the Association supports the proposed common-      sense amendments to the Endangered Species Act. First, H.R.       2936 overturns the Cottonwood decision, which directs that if       additional critical habitat is designated under an approved       FP or RMP, a section 7 programmatic re-consultation of the       entire FP needs to be done. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife       Service (USFWS) and the Obama Administration argued that the       section 7 consultation needs only to be done on the project       covering the additionally designated acreage of critical       habitat. This remedy will greatly reduce the debilitating       process that the federal court decision directs. Second, the       bill affirms that no ESA section 7 consultation is required       if the USFS or BLM determine during informal consultation       that the proposed action is ``not likely to adversely affect       a species or designated critical habitat'', which is already       USFWS policy. And third, if any consultation on a categorical       exclusion established by the bill is not concluded after 90       days, the action shall be considered to have not violated       section 7(a)(2) of the ESA.        The Association is committed to working with our partners       in the USFS and BLM to manage our federal forests to fulfill       their public values as Congress mandated. HR 2936 makes       significant improvements to and would expedite the process       that governs approval of the USFS and BLM management plans.       We urge that your Committee expeditiously report HR 2936 from       the Committee to the House floor.        We look forward to continuing to work with you to move this       bill quickly through the legislative process. If you have any       questions, please contact AFWA Government affairs Director       Jen Mock Schaeffer.            Sincerely,      Nick Wiley,        President, Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies;        Executive Director, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation       Commission.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                                   Home Builders,                                      Washington, DC, June 21, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, House of Representatives, Committee on Natural           Resources, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop: On behalf of the more than 140,000       members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB),       I am writing to express NAHB's strong support for The       Resilient National Forests Act of 2017 and express our       appreciation to the House Committee on Natural Resources for       continuing this important discussion on the health of our       nation's forest. Better forest management practices that are       also mindful of environmental considerations will help       strengthen the housing supply chain and promote affordable       housing opportunities for all Americans.        Significant concerns have been raised about the U.S. Forest       Service's current forest management efforts, both in terms of       administrative obstacles and legal obstacles in approving       timber harvesting projects. Consequently, less commercial       harvesting of timber has resulted in overgrown forests and an       increased risk of catastrophic wildfire across the country.        Additional commercial harvesting of timber will promote the       health of our nation's forest system, but also positively       impact housing affordability. NAHB research shows lumber and       wood products account for 15% of the cost of construction for       a single family house. Lumber prices are generally volatile,       and it is common for builders to encounter a large price       swing in a short period of time. As additional supply is       brought into the market, upward pressure on lumber prices       will soften.        NAHB urges the House Natural Resources Committee to support       The Resilient National Forests Act of 2017, which will       encourage multi-use forest management practices for national       forests and provide increases in the supply of federal timber       products.        Thank you for considering our views.            Sincerely,                                                James W. Tobin III.     Mr. Chairman, we need forest management reforms, we need  them now. I thank Mr. Westerman and the committee for their work on  this bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for yielding.   What a great issue. As a conservative, I am an outspoken defender of  one's right to life. But being pro-life doesn't mean that I am just  antiabortion. It also means that I support the right to try, because  life at all stages is worth fighting for.   Every year, over 1 million Americans die from terminal illnesses,  many of whom pass away while waiting for the FDA to approve a drug that  could dramatically change their prognosis, while others die in the  hopeless cycle of trying and trying again to gain acceptance into a  medical trial.   Think about that: we are losing millions of Americans at the hands of  government red tape.   Now, as a healthcare provider for 25 years, I know firsthand how  important innovation is to the medical community. The Right to Try Act,  if made into law, will give hope to the child with leukemia whose  doctors have exhausted all other treatment options. It opens previously  locked doors by allowing healthcare providers to try experimental drugs  as a last-ditch effort for survival.   The experiments that the Right to Try Act will allow for have the  potential to lead to many more birthdays, more piano recitals, and more  camping trips, and offer hope for our future, hope for years to come.   But don't take my word for it. Emily Whitehead was merely 5 years old  when she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and her  doctors quickly realized that she was among a small percentage of  patients whose disease was seemingly untouchable by chemotherapy. The  Whiteheads were at the end of their rope. The little girl's body was  resisting chemotherapy, and the window for many more birthdays, more  piano recitals, and more camping trips was wearing thin. Their only  option was to join a clinical trial that experimented with T-cell  therapy, where Emily could be the first pediatric patient to undergo  this treatment.   And do you know what? It worked. Three years later, a groundbreaking  study was conducted where 63 patients received T-cell therapy for 1  year, and 52 of them became cancer free, an absolutely unheard-of  statistic with this deadly strain of leukemia.   Think about that: 52 lives were saved; 52 families were given another  birthday, another piano recital, and another camping trip. What a waste  it would have been had they not had the right to try.
