 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden), my friend.   Mr. Speaker, I want to paint a picture of why I support this bill.  Last Sunday night, many retired NFL football fans were watching my  Houston Texans throttle the Patriots from New England.   Let's say the phone rings at halftime. A fan walks up to answer his  phone. The caller ID says it is from the Social Security agency, the  Social Security office, the Social Security Administration.    He picks up the phone, and there is a slight pause. A voice comes on  and tells him that his benefits have been canceled. To restore them, he  has to give these people he doesn't know his number. And, ``Oh, by the  way, we can fix this right now with your credit card.''   For years, people in Texas and all across the country have dealt with  criminal phone calls. I am pleased to say that today is the day we pass  a bill to help these Texans and Americans fight back.   It is great to see a bipartisan piece of legislation that I worked on  with Representative McEachin, the Locking Up  [[Page H9242]]  Illegal Robocallers Act, included in this package. It empowers the  Justice Department to go after criminals who prey upon senior citizens,  veterans, and all Americans.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Let's ring in a new era in  the Congress, dial back robocalls, hang up on criminals, and give them  one call a week from jail.
