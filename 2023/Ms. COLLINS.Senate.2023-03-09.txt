 Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Relief  for Farmers Hit with PFAS Act. My colleague Senator King joins me in  introducing this important legislation that would assist farmers across  America who have been harmed by PFAS contamination.   PFAS are a class of man-made chemicals--sometimes referred to as  ``forever chemicals''--that can bioaccumulate in bodies over time. They  are traditionally found in nonstick pans, clothing, furniture, and  firefighting foam and have been linked to cancer, thyroid disease,  liver damage, decreased fertility, and hormone disruption. PFAS  contamination is a growing problem, and additional resources are needed  to support affected communities.   In Maine, PFAS contamination affecting many different sectors,  including agriculture, has been discovered over the past several years.  The presence of PFAS in wastewater sludge once spread as fertilizer has  prevented some Maine farms from selling their products, thus leading to  significant financial hardship for these family farmers. One such  farmer is Fred Stone, a dairy farmer in Arundel, ME. In 2016, Fred  discovered that the milk produced on his farm contained some of the  highest levels ever reported for a PFAS contaminant at that time. More  recently, a dairy farm in Fairfield, ME, found PFAS levels in its milk  that were 153 times higher than the State's standard.   Dairy is not the only agricultural sector affected by these harmful  forever chemicals. Adam Nordell and his wife Johanna Davis, from Unity,  ME, learned that PFAS had contaminated the soil and water in their  organic vegetable farm, the result of sludge spread on their land in  the 1990s. Tests last year showed that Adam and Johanna had levels of  PFAS in their blood that were even higher than chemical plant workers  who manufactured PFAS for decades and handled them daily.   Currently, USDA provides limited support through the Dairy Indemnity  Payment Program to dairy farmers who have been directed to remove their  contaminated milk from the commercial market. This program falls far  short of meeting the growing needs of all farmers in the State of  Maine. Fred Stone, the farmer who first learned of contamination in  2016, has still not been compensated adequately for the contamination  he has experienced. What is more, this program helps only dairy  farmers, excluding the farmers of other agricultural products who have  had their livelihoods disrupted by PFAS contamination. While community  organizations and the State of Maine have stepped in to provide some  aid, USDA should do more to assist all farmers affected by these  chemicals. That is what our legislation aims to do.   Specifically, the funds authorized by the Relief for Farmers Hit with  PFAS Act could be used for a variety of purposes at the State level,  including providing financial assistance to affected farmers; building  capacity for PFAS testing for soil or water sources; monitoring blood  for individuals to make informed decisions about their health;  upgrading or purchasing equipment to ensure a farm remains profitable  during or after known PFAS contamination; developing alternative  production systems or remediation strategies; developing educational  programs for farmers experiencing PFAS contamination; and researching  soil and water remediation systems, and the viability of those systems  for farms.   In addition to making new resources available, our bill would create  a task force at USDA charged with identifying other USDA programs to  which PFAS contamination should be added as a activity. This would help  bring even more resources to farmers through existing programs.  Additionally, the task force would provide technical assistance to  States to help them coordinate their responses effectively.   Mr. President, USDA needs to step up and provide support to farmers,  who through no fault of their own are at risk of losing their  livelihoods. This is not just a problem in Maine. A recent report  released by the Environmental Working Group estimated that  approximately 20 million acres of crop land in the United States could  be contaminated from PFAS-tainted sludge, which had been used as  fertilizer.   Thus far, the Federal Government's response has failed to keep pace  with this growing problem. I have urged USDA Secretary Vilsack  repeatedly to come to the aid of these affected farmers, and the Relief  for Farmers Hit with PFAS Act would direct the Department to help where  it is needed most.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. As the members of the  Senate Agriculture Committee begin work on the 2023 farm bill, I hope  that we can work together to pass the Relief for Farmers Hit with PFAS  Act into law.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Relief  for Farmers Hit with PFAS Act.
