 Mr. Speaker, let's be clear about what is  happening here. We are at a crossroads. Free and fair elections are  essential to keeping this fragile democracy intact.   The American people must hear this loud and clear: There are people  in power who don't want you to vote, and they are using every tool in  their toolbox to make it harder.   My fellow Americans, you cannot afford to sleep on this. People in  power and with influence are actively trying to take away your right to  vote. America must confront this harsh reality.   They are purging voter rolls, making voter registration more  difficult, and cracking down on vote by mail, all while we remain in  the midst of a pandemic.   Voter suppression has not been consigned to the history books. It  continues today, right here, right now, and the impact continues to  fall disproportionately on communities of color.   These policies are being actively pursued all over the country in  places like my home State of Florida, where the Governor wants to  create a voting police force to intimidate voters.   We must not allow those who seek to consolidate power and put a thumb  on the scales of the democratic process to succeed.   Our friends in the Senate must stand up for democracy and restore  government of, by, and for the people. I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.
