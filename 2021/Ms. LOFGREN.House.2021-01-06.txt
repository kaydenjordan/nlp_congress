Mr. President, the certificate of the electoral  vote of the State of Arizona seems to be regular in form and authentic,  and it appears therefrom that Joseph R. Biden, Jr., of the State of  Delaware received 11 votes for President and Kamala D. Harris of the  State of California received 11 votes for Vice President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there any objections to counting the  certificate of vote of the State of Arizona that the teller has  verified appears to be regular in form and authentic?    Madam Speaker, I rise to strike the last word.    Madam Speaker, this day marks a crossroads for American  democracy. Those who object to the counting of the electoral college  votes, which reflect the votes of the American people, want to  substitute their preferences for the voters' choice. That is not what  our Constitution requires, and it is at odds with our American  democratic Republic.   If Congress selects the next President instead of the American  voters, we would have no need for an electoral college. In fact, we  would have no need for Presidential elections at all. We would be  moving from a government elected by the people to a government selected  by those already governing.   That is not America. In the United States, we abide by the choices of  the people, not by an elite few.   The Framers of our Constitution considered to have Congress select  the President and specifically rejected it. Instead, they wrote Article  II and the 12th Amendment.   Article II creates the electoral college, where each State appoints  electors. Laws of all 50 States and D.C. require electors to vote for  the winner of the State's popular election. Each State provides for the  orderly conduct of elections, including lawful challenges, recounts,  and the like.   The 12th Amendment is what brings us to today. It says the electors  meet in their States. That happened December 14.   The amendment says the electors shall cast their votes, sign and  certify them, and transmit them to us, sealed. That has been done. The  sealed envelopes containing the signed and certified ballots from each  State's electors reflecting the votes of the people are in those  mahogany boxes.   The 12th Amendment directs the Vice President, as the President of  the Senate, to do only this: open the sealed envelopes and then the  votes shall be counted. Simple. It doesn't say counted in a manner that  some Members of Congress or the Vice President might prefer. No. The  votes are simply to be counted as certified and transmitted by the  States.                                time  1130    During reconstruction after the Civil War, more than one slate of  electors were appointed by States. Dueling lists were sent and  protracted processes were undertaken in Presidential elections. And, as  a result, to make an orderly process, Congress enacted the Electoral  Count Act of 1887. This law governs our proceedings today. The act  provides dispute resolution mechanisms.   Under the ECA, if a Governor certifies a slate of electors and there  are no competing slates in that State, the Governor-certified must be  counted. Today, every single slate of electors won by Joe Biden, or won  by Donald Trump, got their Governor's certification. Not a single State  submitted a competing slate. There is no dispute to resolve.   The 2020 election was the most secure election conducted in modern  history. Challenges were resolved by lawful recounts and audits.   The result?   Vice President Biden won the 2020 election.   More than 60 lawsuits were filed contesting elements of the election  process. None of these lawsuits prevailed.   Why?   As even President Trump's own judicial appointees ruled, there was no  evidence of any wrongdoing that would change the outcome.   The people spoke. It was not a close election. The margin of victory  for Biden in 2020 was larger than Trump's margin in 2016. In fact, the  Biden victory is one of the most decisive in modern times, exceeding  the margin enjoyed by Reagan when he defeated Carter in 1980.   Congress has gathered in a joint session to count electoral votes  every four years since 1789. I understand the disappointment people  feel when their candidate for President loses. I have felt the same  several times in my voting life.   When that happens, it is not an invitation to upend the Constitution  and the laws of the United States. It is an invitation to work with the  new President for the good of the country and to wait for the next  election in 4 years if you are dissatisfied.   In that spirit, I urge my colleagues to uphold the American democracy  and reject the objection.

Biden, Jr., of the  State of Delaware received 20 votes for President and Kamala D. Harris  of the State of California received 20 votes for Vice President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. For what purpose does the gentleman from  Pennsylvania rise?    Madam Speaker, our duty today is significant but  straightforward. We must count the votes of the electors as cast in the  electoral college and announce the results.   As discussed, our roles and responsibilities are established by the  Constitution and Federal law, and they are clear. The facts before us  are also clear. Pennsylvania submitted one slate of electors, as chosen  by the voters of the State. The slate was certified according to State  law. Now those lawful results must be counted and announced.   Despite disinformation and any number of false claims that you may  have heard, including here today, as former Attorney General Barr said:  ``We have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a  different outcome in the election.''   This is not simply a conclusory statement. The results of the  election have been litigated. The record is clear: The lawsuits  challenging the election results failed. They failed because there is  simply no evidence to support these baseless claims.   Now, it is one thing to tweet a belief, quite another to provide  actual evidence. These cases failed because there is no evidence.  Judges ruled in the lawsuits that the 2020 election was sound.   It should come as no surprise that Republican officeholders have  recognized the election results as legitimate and accurately determined  in an election that was conducted safely, securely, and with integrity.   We all take an oath to support and defend the Constitution. As we  near the end of the task before us, let's remember the beginning of the  Constitution. Before Article II and the 12th Amendment, which spell out  the electoral college, and before Article I, which creates Congress,  the Constitution begins with the preamble. The preamble is short and  bold: ``We the people.''   The people spoke in historic numbers. Their votes have been counted.  Their choice is clear. It is time, as the law requires, to announce the  state of the people's vote.   The violence and disorder inflicted on our democracy by seditious  rioters today is an indication of why adherence to our Constitution is  so vital.   I urge all of us to stand up for law, for democracy, for our  Constitution, and to stand up for America and reject this objection.
