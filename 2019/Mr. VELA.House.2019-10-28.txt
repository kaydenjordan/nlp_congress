 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Daniel P. King  for his service to the Rio Grande Valley in the State of Texas.   Dr. King is a proven leader in the 34th Congressional District of  Texas. As a public school superintendent for the last 14 years, he has  guided district-wide initiatives to improve student performance and  graduation rates across south Texas. Under his leadership as  superintendent at Pharr-San Juan-Alamo Independent School District, the  annual dropout rate has been reduced by more than 90 percent, and the  overall high school completion rate now surpasses the State average. He  also helped establish the College 3 program which aims to offer every  single student the opportunity to earn at least 12 college hours before  high school graduation.   This year PSJA named its newest early college campus the Dr. Daniel  P. King College & University Center in recognition of his  accomplishments.   Prior to his role at PSJA ISD, Dr. King was superintendent at Hidalgo  Independent School District where he led the development of the first  early college school district in the Nation. In 2006, Hidalgo ISD  earned the H-E-B Excellence in Education Award. And in 2007 U.S. News &  World Report named Hidalgo High the 11th best high school in the Nation  and number one in Texas. He also earned the State Superintendent of the  Year Award in 2006 by the Texas Association of School Boards.   Dr. King is an influential educator, and his numerous accomplishments  have paved the way for continued student success in south Texas. Our  community is thankful for his contributions, and I am grateful to have  had the opportunity to work with him.   As we honor Dr. Daniel P. King, I also want to acknowledge his wife,  Sara, who is a PSJA faculty member, and their six children who have  supported Dr. King in achieving his professional goals.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join his family, our community,  and me in wishing him a happy retirement and thanking him for his  service.                            ____________________
