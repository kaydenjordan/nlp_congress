 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me  time and for her incredible work on this bill, and also the chairman of  the full committee, Chairman Frelinghuysen.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan agreement before us  and want to thank, again, Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member  Lowey and our able committee staff on both sides for their tireless  effort to slog this across the finish line after five false starts.   It is utterly ridiculous that nearly halfway into the fiscal year  that began last October 2017 we finally arrived at the brink of  completion of our top priority: funding the operations of the  Government of the United States from the Defense Department to  children's health.   Republicans control both Chambers of Congress as well as the White  House, yet the delays and dysfunction have been worse than ever.  Americans around our country can't extend deadline after deadline after  deadline after deadline after deadline in their jobs. We should live up  to those same standards.   In my title, the Energy and Water Development bill, we make progress  by bringing forward America's backlogged construction projects, which  number into the billions of dollars, making many important investments  for our Nation's infrastructure, including: a 13 percent increase for  the Army Corps of Engineers over 2017, which will allow for more  critical waterways projects to drive our economy and job creation; and  an 11 percent increase to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable  Energy to finally move toward complete energy independence for our  country, including through the weatherization program, which has  increased, as well as an additional 15 percent to invent our energy  future through our most advanced energy technology programs, ARPA-E.   Additionally, we removed a harmful rider on the waters of the U.S.  rule, which, along with others, would have seriously hindered overall  passage.   This deal busts through budget caps set in 2011 by $143 billion, or  13 percent. And although I support investment in our military, the  balance between defense and our domestic priorities is skewed in the  wrong direction.   In Ohio, we are at the epicenter of the opioid epidemic, with more  than 5,000 drug estimated overdose deaths in the last 12 months alone.  We rank second in the Nation for deaths per capita.    Mr. Speaker, although I support the inclusion of a $2.7  billion increase for opioid prevention, treatment, and recovery, this  funding only nibbles at the edge of the problem. This is a national  crisis. It must be reflected in a real plan to meet the crisis,  including funding priorities. No matter how many fighters or tanks we  have, America will not be strong abroad if vast segments of our own  population are dying here at home--more than in traffic accidents, more  than from major diseases--from opioid and drug abuse.   This bill is a fair compromise, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes,'' despite some of the major provisions that are not in there  that break our hearts.   The American people are counting on us to run our Nation's ship of  State. Let's do that today.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, the ranking member,  for yielding me this precious minute.   I want to augment my remarks of earlier this afternoon and thank  Jaime Shimek of our own staff who worked so very, very hard on the  Energy and Water Subcommittee, allowing this bill to move to the floor.   And then I feel compelled to rise to thank our chairman of the full  committee, Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen, with whom I have had the  opportunity to work now for many decades and to say to him he is an  exemplary model of public service to the people of our country, a true  patriot, and someone who devoted so many hours to moving a bill to the  floor that could achieve bipartisan consensus in a very loaded  political environment.   I shall never forget, at the beginning of the Iraq war, our trip to  the Middle East, to many of the countries involved, the manner in which  he comported himself, the great counsel he gave to so many of us as a  military man himself, and the great leadership that he has provided as  chair of our Defense Subcommittee at one point and now of the full  committee. The people of New Jersey can truly celebrate his service to  our Nation as we move this bill to a final vote later today.
