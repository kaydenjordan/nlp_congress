 Mr. Speaker, one of the earlier speakers said: ``This is  the most dramatic change in labor law in 80 years.'' And I say: ``Thank  God.''   In the late seventies, a CEO's earnings were 35 times that of the  worker. Today, it is 3 to 400 times what the worker makes. And our  friends on the other side are running around with their hair on fire.   Heaven forbid we pass something that is going to help the damn  workers in the United States of America. Heaven forbid we tilt the  balance that has been going in the wrong direction for 50 years.   We talk about pensions. You complain. We talk about the minimum wage  increase. You complain. We talk about giving them the right to  organize. You complain. But if we were passing a tax cut here, you  would all be getting in line to vote ``yes'' for it.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the International  Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in support of the PRO  Act.                                       International Association of                                Machinists and Aerospace Workers,                            Upper Marlboro, Maryland, March 9, 2021.        Dear Representative, On behalf of the International       Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, I strongly       urge you to support the Protecting the Right to Organize       (PRO) Act introduced by Representative Bobby Scott. In a       functioning and recovering economy, working families and       middle-class Americans cannot be left behind.        The PRO Act is a crucially bold piece of legislation that       modernizes federal laws and expands workers' collective       bargaining rights and closes loopholes that corporations use       to exploit workers. The bill also establishes a process for       mediation and arbitration to help the parties achieve a first       contract. It protects workers' right to organize a union and       bargain for higher wages and better benefits.        However, the right to freely form a union without the       threat of company intimidation or interference is denied to       workers today. The PRO Act strengthens protections for       employees that engage in collective action and levels the       playing field by prohibiting employers from requiring their       employees to attend ``captive audience'' meetings whose sole       purpose is to convince workers to vote against the union. In       addition to imposing financial penalties on employers and       individual corporate offices who violate the law, the bill       would give workers the option of bringing their case to       federal court.        Finally, the PRO Act would override state ``right to work''       laws. These laws are simply designed to give more power to       corporations at the expense of workers, and have had the       effect of lowering wages and eroding pensions and health care       coverage in states where they have been adopted.        For all the above these reasons, I respectfully urge you to       support the PRO Act and vote ``YES'' on this long overdue       legislation.            Thank you,                                              Robert Martinez, Jr.,                                           International President.    You need to stop talking about Dr. Seuss and start working  with us on behalf of the American workers.
