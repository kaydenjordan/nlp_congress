 Madam Chair, I thank Mr. Westerman for all of his work  on this.  [[Page H655]]    Madam Chair, our amendment would provide $10 million in additional  funding to the U.S. Forest Service and its State and private forestry  account. That account is set up to help State and local landowners  recover from damages caused by wildfires and to provide more resources  for proactive forest management.   What we have seen, unfortunately, in the last few years is a number  of horrific fires throughout our Nation, and especially where I am from  in California and the central coast of California. But what we know is  that we must do something about it.   This amendment does something about it by providing the necessary  resources to maintain certain areas in which human beings are living  close to forests and, therefore, making sure that there are certain  requirements that are met by the local entities.   But we can do this without sacrificing our environmental protections.  This is why we are basically able to increase resources for wildfire  mitigation practices such as prescribed burns and maintenance of fuel  breaks and technical assistance to landowners. We can make sure that  they are advanced, but that they can also be in compliance with  environmental safety guards. We can do both in this amendment, and this  amount of money does that.   So, Madam Chair, I continue to ask for support of this amendment, and  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yea'' on this.
