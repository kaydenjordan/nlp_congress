 Will the Senator yield?    Will the Senator yield?    Will the Senator yield?    Will the Senator yield?    Will the Senator yield?    Will the Senator yield?    Mr. President, I was going to give some prepared remarks,  but I want to be a little quicker because I see the Senator from  Virginia here, and I know how devastating a government shutdown is for  the State of Virginia. It is terrible for Hawaii--for our shipyards and  our Federal workers.   I do want to respond to my friend from Alaska. He is my friend. We  overuse that word in the U.S. Senate; that is true. Dan Sullivan is my  friend, but he is wrong on this.   First of all, a small point: The NFL Network is back up and running  on the Armed Forces Network. That was fixed on Saturday.   Second of all, there were unanimous consent requests on Friday night  to make sure that we pay the military. On Friday night, a unanimous  consent request was made to pay the military. It was objected to by the  majority leader. And then we tried again yesterday, and it was objected  to by the majority leader.   So when the junior Senator from Alaska alleges that we are emerging  with slick talking points about the need to support our military  servicemembers and civilian DOD employees, I take personal offense. I  agree, it should not be slick talking points. This should not be a  bludgeon that one party or one Member of one party uses against the  other party. But let's just get our facts straight about what happened.  I am not excusing what a government shutdown does to people--civilian,  DOD, servicemembers, other government employees, essential,  nonessential, the people who depend--not just the workers but the  people who get services from the workers. I am not defending this  shutdown, but let the facts be clear.   On the night of the beginning of the shutdown, a Democratic Senator  tried to ensure that at least we minimize the harm for our  servicemembers, and then we did it again yesterday, and both times it  was objected to by the majority leader.   With that, I will deliver my other remarks later and yield the floor  to the Senator from Virginia.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1301     Regular order, please.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Hawaii.    Regular order, please.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Hawaii.    Mr. President, will the Senator from North Carolina yield  for a question?    Mr. President, will the Senator from North Carolina yield  for a question?    It sounds like you want to stay here all night and get  this done.    Would you be willing to work on a unanimous consent  request to effectuate that?    Regular order, please.    Regular order, please.    Mr. President, regular order.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii has the floor.    Mr. President, I thought I heard the Senator from North  Carolina suggest that we stay in and get this done tonight. I think we  still have a chance to get this done before 1 a.m.    I still have the floor.   And if we don't get this done by 1 a.m., I personally don't think we  should adjourn. I think this should be personally uncomfortable and  physically uncomfortable. I think we should be embarrassed by this. I  think you make a very good point. I think we should stay in until we  get this done.   It is disappointing to me, when I hear all of that. Yet when I ask  you if you would be willing to work on a unanimous consent request to  effectuate what you have just said, the answer is no.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    Mr. President, so here is the state of play. There is a  group of 19 to 22 U.S. Senators, a bipartisan group that is trying to  find a pathway forward. Senators Schumer and McConnell had a meeting.  We don't know exactly how that went. There are some reasons to be  encouraged. I think there are not that many reasons to be overly  optimistic, but there is a pathway out of this. We can get out of this  mess. I think lots of us understand, a lot of us having served in the  legislature or at the executive level, actually at the county level as  well. We all understand how insane this is to do four CRs in a row, and  we all understand that we work very hard to get to the U.S. Senate. I  am looking at all of you and thinking about how difficult everybody's  race was just to arrive at the world's greatest deliberative body.  [[Page S425]]    Forgetting, for the moment, someone's calculus about who has a  temporary or even long-term partisan advantage in light of this  shutdown, we all know shutdowns make this institution weaker, and we  all know shutdowns make Senators weaker. We don't fight tooth and nail  and go through that awful process--there are some joyful moments in a  campaign, but nobody necessarily looks forward to it. It is a tough  thing. You don't go through that so you can diminish the body in which  you serve, and we are diminished by this process. General Mattis may  have put it best when he said no enemy has done more harm to the  readiness of the military than the combined impact of spending caps in  9 of the last 10 years operating under a CR.   Nobody wants to do this anymore. We can't do CRs forever, but right  now we need one to keep everyone at the table without hurting the  American people. That is the purpose of the Brown UC and the Murphy UC,  which is to say: Whatever our disagreements are, we have an  opportunity, by unanimous consent, to make sure we don't punish the  American people for our inability to agree with each other. Why not  keep the government open for 24 or 48 or 72 hours?   From my standpoint, looking at my constituents in the State of  Hawaii, we have extraordinary National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration workers; we have an incredible presence of the  Department of Defense, civilian DOD employees as well as  servicemembers; we have National Park Service people who do  extraordinary work. We have lots of government employees, and it is not  their fault. It is not their fault.   So I have a very simple unanimous consent request. It is a little  different than the others. The others were to try to avoid this  cataclysm, but should we be unable to avoid this cataclysm, I think we  should keep our government workers whole because they didn't do this to  us. We are doing this to them. So my UC request does a very simple  thing. It just makes sure that whatever idiocy happens over the next 6  hours or 6 days or 6 weeks, that they are held harmless.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 290, S. 2274, to provide for  compensation to Federal employees affected by lapses in appropriations;  that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   The Senator from North Carolina.    Mr. President, I just want to briefly respond to the  Senator from North Carolina.   I actually agree it would be a half measure to open the government  for 24 hours; it would be a half measure to pass just CHIP; it would be  a half measure to open the government for 72 hours, but the alternative  is that we are doing nothing.   Sure, it is a little goofy to keep the government open for 24 hours  as we negotiate. It is absolutely goofy. It is embarrassing. It is less  embarrassing than actually shutting down the government while we  negotiate.   Opening the government for 72 hours, a little strange--not our  highest watermark in terms of our legislative prowess. It is pretty  embarrassing. What is more embarrassing? Shutting the government down.  Passing CHIP after it has expired by consent, awful--not the world's  greatest deliberative body's greatest moment. What is worse? Objecting  to doing that.   We want to make sure our Federal employees are made whole. I agree  with the Senator from North Carolina, this is a half measure, but do  you know what? If I am a Federal employee, I will take a half measure  because right now we are giving them nothing.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.    Mr. President, I have one last unanimous consent request,  and I appreciate the participation from the Senator from North  Carolina. I appreciate our dialogue here. I think this is constructive  and productive.   This last UC request is very simple. It is the same one, with a small  modification that Senator McCaskill made on Friday night, and that is  very simple. Every time we have done a shutdown--I have been involved  in one. It was the ``Green Eggs and Ham'' Affordable Care Act shutdown.  It was the worst period of time I ever spent in the Senate.   Sherrod Brown always says: No whining on the yacht. Don't feel sorry  for yourself for serving in the U.S. Senate. It is a privilege. It is a  great job.   Shutdowns are miserable. But during that shutdown and during every  other shutdown that I am aware of, we always took care of our  servicemembers. Senator McCaskill on Friday night put that UC in so  that we made sure everyone who is serving in harm's way or prepared to  serve in harm's way, supports our military, gets paid.   Frankly, in the heat of the moment on Friday night, when there was  still a lack of clarity whether we were going to get through it without  a shutdown, I understand nobody wanted to allow a UC request of any  sort to go through. But then Friday came, and it was is not at all  clear that we were going to move on this. And now we are into Sunday,  and I don't know where we are with this, but I am getting increasingly  worried. So it is really hard for me to understand why we wouldn't  unanimously consent to pay our servicemembers.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 36, H.R. 1301; that the  amendment at the desk, providing for continuing appropriations for pay  and death benefits for members of the armed services, be considered and  agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time  and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   The Senator from North Carolina.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am a  member of the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. As  the Senator from North Carolina knows, the way that we do Defense  appropriations is with great care. We have markups. We find out what  each service branch needs in terms of personnel, in terms of bases and  installation, in terms of new acquisitions, and that process takes a  fair amount of time. That markup is not done.   I would love to move on Defense appropriations, but from the  standpoint of responsibly spending hundreds of billions of dollars, we  are not there yet, and so, therefore, I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
