 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, today I rise to urge support for my  amendment, which would reaffirm and preserve the rights of the States  to write their own water quality plans.   My amendment simply prohibits the EPA from using its Chesapeake Bay  total maximum daily load and the so-called watershed implementation  plans to hijack States water quality strategies.   Over the last several years, the EPA has implemented a total maximum  daily load blueprint for six States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed,  which strictly limits the amount of nutrients that can enter the  Chesapeake Bay. Through its implementation, the EPA has basically given  every State in the watershed an ultimatum: either the State does  exactly what the EPA says, or it faces the threat of an EPA takeover of  its water quality programs.   Congress intended that the implementation of the Clean Water Act be a  collaborative approach through which the States and the Federal  Government work together. This process was not meant to be subject to  the whims of politicians and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. Therefore,  my amendment instructs the EPA to respect the important role States  play in implementing the Clean Water Act.   I want to make it perfectly clear that my amendment would not stop  the EPA from working with the States to restore the Chesapeake Bay, nor  would it undermine the cleanup efforts already underway. My language  only removes the ability of the EPA to take over a State's plan, or to  take retaliatory actions against a State if it does not meet the EPA  mandated goals. Again, it ensures states' rights remain intact and not  usurped by the EPA.   It is important to point out that the correlation between the EPA's  outrageous Waters of the United States rule and the bay TMDL. At the  heart of both issues is the EPA's desire to control conservation and  water quality improvement efforts throughout the country, and to punish  all of those who dare to oppose them.   Mr. Chairman, the bay is a national treasure, and I want to see it  restored. But we know that in order to achieve this goal, the States  and the EPA must work together. The EPA cannot be allowed to railroad  the States and micromanage the process.   With this amendment, we are simply telling the EPA to respect the  important role States play in implementing the Clean Water Act and  preventing another Federal power grab.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2015     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining on each side?    Mr. Chair, I understand that the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott) has the right to close.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentlemen from Pennsylvania, Chairman  Shuster along with Mr. Thompson, for being cosponsors of this  amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.   It is simply not true that this amendment would interfere with the  cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay, and I am going to repeat what I said  earlier. My amendment does not remove the TMDL or the watershed  implementation plans. It only removes the retaliatory actions  threatened by the EPA.   The current plans and processes the States are using to clean up the  bay are working. That is absolutely right. They are working, and they  started long before this imposition by the EPA that occurred at the  beginning of the Obama administration.   States have made great strides in cleaning up the bay, so why  continue to threaten them with an EPA takeover of their water quality  plans.   The other argument that is made is the Federal Government needs to be  involved in this cleanup process. Well, I believe the Federal  Government should be a partner in this effort. As the chairman has  noted, they can play an important function. However, the current  process has the EPA dictating to States, local communities, and  businesses instead of a cooperative approach. That is not playing a  part; that is controlling the process.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
