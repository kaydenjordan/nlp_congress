 Madam President, today I would like to pay tribute  to Dr. Robert Cope, a public servant and cattle veterinarian of Lemhi  County, ID, who lost his battle to cancer last month. I had the great  fortune of being friends and working with Dr. Cope through the many  public and private roles he served. Those who knew Dr. Robert Cope  affectionately called him ``Cope.''   Cope dedicated his whole life to serving agricultural families after  he received his doctorate in veterinary medicine from Kansas State  University in 1975. Shortly, thereafter, he moved to Idaho, where his  clients became his extended family. Cope owned and operated the Blue  Cross Vet Clinic in Salmon, ID, for 44 years. He loved children and the  youth of his community, and he supported them through 4-H and his  veterinarian practice. Idaho ranchers can share countless stories of  Cope's service at all hours of the day and night. Even as his cancer  progressed, Cope offered his advice and expertise to his loyal clients.   Cope served as Lemhi County Commissioner for 14 years and sat on many  committees related to natural resources and environmental challenges.  In March of 2002, he was inducted in the Eastern Idaho Agricultural  Hall of Fame.   With wisdom, common-sense, and humor, Cope tackled life head-on and  was never afraid to address tough issues and find collaborative  solutions.  [[Page S95]]  After having a particularly challenging experience with the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife over a wolf-killed calf, Cope was tasked with writing a  Memorandum of Understanding--MOU--to allow the State to allocate  Federal funds to livestock owners who lost cattle due to predation.   When I served as Idaho's Governor, I led a collaborative effort to  adopt the Idaho Roadless Rule. Cope assisted in that effort and served  on the Idaho Roadless Commission. I trusted his opinion and judgement,  and he provided invaluable insights from a local perspective in the  development and implementation of that rule.   For Cope, his life was about serving people and sustaining the  Western ranching and farming lifestyle. God broke the mold when he made  Cope, and he will be missed by many in Lemhi County and the State of  Idaho. Rest in Peace, Cope.                            ____________________     Madam President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Palouse Animal Wellness and Surgery-- ``PAWS''--as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for January 2023.   PAWS, originally named Garfield Street Pet Clinic and located on its  namesake in Moscow, was founded in 1995, by Dr. Don Kubasch and his  wife, Jan. Dr. Kathy Miller and her husband Jim bought the practice in  2002 when Dr. Kubasch retired. Dr. Miller worked at the clinic as a  technician while studying at the Washington State University School of  Veterinary Medicine. The Millers built a new clinic on Main Street in  Moscow in 2005, renaming the practice to Palouse Animal Wellness and  Surgery, PAWS. Jim joined the practice full time in 2021 as the  director of business operations.   PAWS has become an integral part of the local community; its owners  and staff pride themselves on excellence in service, education, and  enhancement. Along with providing educational and employment  opportunities to veterinary students, for over a decade, PAWS has  maintained accreditation with the American Animal Hospital Association.  This voluntary accreditation, achieved by a mere 15 percent of  businesses in the United States and Canada, means PAWS' patients  receive the best care possible in state-of-the-art facilities, from a  team that meets high standards in every aspect of veterinary medicine.   The Millers' high standards come from their love for their community.  Both Jim and Kathy are Moscow natives, who graduated from Moscow High  School and the University of Idaho. Over the years, they raised four  children in this close-knit community who have all worked at the clinic  in some capacity.   Congratulations to the Miller family and all of the employees at PAWS  on their selection as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for January  2023. Thank you for serving Idaho as small business owners and  entrepreneurs. You make our great State proud, and I look forward to  your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
