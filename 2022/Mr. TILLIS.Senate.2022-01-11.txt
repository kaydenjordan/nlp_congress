 Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to  the majority leader's plan to change the Senate rules. It will open the  door wide for the filibuster to be eliminated for all legislation  moving forward.   The bottom line is very simple: The ideologues in the Senate want to  turn what the Founding Fathers called the ``cooling saucer of  democracy'' into the rubberstamp of dictatorship. They want to because  they can't get their way. They want to wash away 200 years of history.  They want to turn this country into a banana republic, where if you  can't get your way, you change the rules. It would be a doomsday for  democracy.   These are strong words, and these are wise words, but they are not my  words. They are direct quotes from Senator Schumer back in 2005, when  he was a staunch opponent of weakening the filibuster. That is because  during that time, the then-junior Senator from New York and his  Democratic colleagues were making unprecedented use of the filibuster  to derail President George W. Bush's judicial nominees.   The majority leader at one point profoundly admitted that ``[y]es, we  are blocking judges by filibuster. That is part of the hallowed process  around here of the Founding Fathers saying the Senate is the cooling  saucer.''   But things have certainly changed two decades later.   President Biden, the majority leader, and their Democratic allies  were intent on ending the filibuster the second the Democrats won the  Senate last January.   The majority leader's latest attempt is to force a carve-out of the  filibuster for what he claims will be just for one piece of  legislation. But he knows where it leads: the full elimination of the  filibuster and sooner rather than later.   I thought my friend the senior Senator from West Virginia put it  perfectly last week. He said:         The problem with carve-outs is that you end up eating the       whole bird.    There is no such thing as a carve-out when it comes to the  filibuster. We all know it. I will talk a little bit about that later.   But for more than a century, the filibuster has served as a safeguard  for our Republic. It has prevented one party from ramming through an  ideological agenda when that party controls both the White House and  Congress.   Without the filibuster, both the far left and the far right would  have free rein to ram through extreme ideological agendas. Divisive  partisan proposals could become law with only a simple majority. And  with both parties regularly trading control of Congress, laws can just  as easily be overturned and replaced, promoting the kind of chaotic,  confusing policymaking we see in some European Parliaments.   By requiring 60 votes to end debate in the Senate, the filibuster  promotes stability. It necessitates bipartisan compromise to pass  legislation. That is something we need more of, not less.  [[Page S141]]    I saw it firsthand when I was a proud participant in the passage of  the bipartisan infrastructure bill. That is the way this Chamber needs  to work.   That is why when President Trump demanded, I think some 30 times,  that the Republicans should eliminate the filibuster in 2017, 61  Senators joined together in a letter making it clear that we would not  let it happen. Thirty-two were Democrats, and 29 were Republicans. I  was one of them.   And even though I received my fair share of pushback from my side of  the aisle back in North Carolina, I was proud to sign that letter in  2017, and I would be proud to sign that letter today.   Unfortunately, this modest display of political courage has not been  reciprocated by many of my friends on the other side of the aisle.  Twenty-seven of the Senators who signed that letter are still in the  Senate. Twenty-six of them are now supporting the full elimination of  the filibuster. What changed? Nothing except the party in power.   Democrats staunchly defended and used the filibuster when Donald  Trump was President at an unprecedented level, but Democrats are  suddenly against the filibuster now that Joe Biden is President. Many  of my Democratic colleagues are practicing situational principles:  putting their own party's short-term interests ahead of what they know  are the best long-term interests for the Senate and the Nation. It  doesn't get more politically cynical than that.   President Biden served in the Senate for 36 years. He was known as a  strong defender of the institution, including the filibuster. In this  very Chamber, 21 years ago, Senator Biden declared that defending the  filibuster was about defending ``compromise and moderation.'' And he  noted that his speech was one of the most important he would ever give.  But now he favors destroying compromise, moderation, and the  institution he had long cherished, all for the sake of political  expediency for the next 12 months, until Republicans take back the  House and most likely the Senate.   As I noted earlier, the majority leader also shares a partisan double  standard with the President. In a ``Dear Colleague'' letter just  earlier this month, he wrote that ``Senate Democrats must urge the  public in a variety of different ways to impress upon their Senators  the importance of acting and reforming the Senate rules, if that  becomes a prerequisite for action to save our democracy.''   The Senate rule change he refers to is carving out the filibuster in  order to pass one of the far left's priorities; that is, the voting  bill that many of my Members or colleagues have talked about today.   But in 2018, the then-Senate minority leader struck a different tone.  He said:         The legislative filibuster . . . is the most important       distinction between the Senate and the House. Without the 60-      vote threshold for legislation, the Senate becomes a       majoritarian institution like the House . . . no Senator       would like to see that happen.    What is the difference between today and only a few short years ago?  Again, it is the party that is in power.   This same pattern of situational principles also applies to the  majority whip. He went on national television when Donald Trump was  President to warn that eliminating the filibuster ``would be the end of  the Senate as it was originally devised.''   That is Senator Durbin.   But less than 4 years later, after Democrats won control of the White  House and the Senate, the majority whip has a much different take. He  recently declared that ``the filibuster is making a mockery of the  American democracy.'' He made that statement after he and his fellow  Democrats used the filibuster a recordbreaking 328 times between 2019  and 2020, when President Trump was in office. That level hypocrisy is  audacious, even by Washington, DC, standards.   And I know Democrats have been pushing back on this claim, claiming  they are not trying to end the filibuster. They assure us that this is  a one-time deal that will only apply to this one bill.   I would refer them to Newton's third law of physics: ``For every  action, there is an equal and opposite action.'' It most definitely  applies to Senate rules as well.   In 2013, Senate Democrats invoked the nuclear option to end the 60- vote cloture requirement on judicial and Executive nominees other than  the Supreme Court. All Republicans, and even a handful of Democrats,  including the senior Senator from West Virginia, pleaded with the  Democrats not to do it.   Minority Leader McConnell warned Democrats at the time that ``you'll  regret this, and you might regret it even sooner than you think.'' But  they did it anyway. And, indeed, there was that reaction.   Four years later, Republicans controlled the Senate, and we used the  nuclear option to finish what our Democratic colleagues started on the  executive calendar. We ended the 60-vote requirement for Supreme Court  nominees.   There is a clear precedent on what happens when we change the Senate  rules on a partisan basis for political expediency. It produces long- term consequences that I believe both sides will ultimately regret.   Democrats invoked the nuclear option to get more district judges, but  by doing so, they paved the path for Justice Gorsuch, Justice  Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett, who now sit on the Supreme Court today.   What do we think now if the Democrats nuke the filibuster for just  one bill? The Senate rule change that the majority leader is pushing is  really a proxy vote for ending the legislative filibuster altogether  and turning the Senate into the House, full stop.   So I ask my Democratic colleagues to consider this: When President  Trump called for ending the filibuster, a large majority of Republican  Senators stood up to preserve bipartisanship and to protect and respect  this institution. Now, the roles are reversed. President Biden and the  majority leader are demanding that you give them your vote to weaken  the filibuster so it can ultimately be ended.   To my Democratic colleagues who signed on to the very same letter I  did in difficult circumstances, I ask you: Will you stand up for the  principles that you stood for just a few years ago and respect and  defend this institution?
