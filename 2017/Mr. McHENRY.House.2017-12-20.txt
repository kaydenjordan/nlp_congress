 Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is a special pleasure to come and speak to the career  of a great public servant, Matt Bravo.   Matt has worked here in the House for 11 years in various roles. He  started off as body guy for Leader Cantor when Leader Cantor served as  chief deputy whip. In addition to that, he has held various roles in  the whip operation, in the leader's office on the Republican side of  the aisle, as well as important work on the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   Matt Bravo has a great sense of humor, a great love for the game of  golf. He is much better at the game of golf than he is at his jokes. We  love Matt Bravo. We love teasing him. We love giving him a hard time,  but we know his true character. We know how he works intensely to see  things through, to grind out the votes to get 218 to pass our agenda.   Mr. Speaker, we know Matt will be successful in this next phase of  his career. We thank him for his friendship. We thank him for his  service to this House. On both sides of the aisle, the respect that he  has gained is immense, and we congratulate him on this next phase.   Mr. Speaker, we thank Matt for his service in the people's House, to  his government, to the United States of America's people. We will miss  him.
