 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  impact of rising inflation on American consumers.   The Consumer Price Index jumped by 5.4 percent this year through  June, the largest year-over-year gain since 2008. From the higher cost  of gas, to the higher price of used cars, to the price of food at your  local grocery store, small businesses and Americans are paying more for  goods and services, due in large part to government spending during  COVID-19 and now Democrats' reckless economic agenda.   It is as simple as this: Inflation is taxation.   As a small business owner for 50 years, I can tell you these  increased prices are creating challenges for consumers whose budgets  are being stretched thinner and thinner every single month.   The Democrat solution to all of this? Ram through a partisan $3.5  trillion package that will further increase taxes on the American  people and completely disregard rising inflation.   It is pretty simple.   Raising taxes, less jobs.   Lower tax, more jobs.   Congress must return to some fiscal sanity and Democrats must resist  the temptation to spend our way out of this situation, as rising  inflation and the growing national debt become an unrelenting enemy.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
