 Mr. Speaker, the men and women who defend our country have  one sacred creed: leave no one behind, and they all come home.   It took 72 years and 234 days, but today, at Houston's VA cemetery,  Lonnie Eichelberger came home.   At 16, Lonnie left China Spring, Texas, to fight the Nazis and Adolph  [[Page H128]]  Hitler in Germany in World War II. He was a Buffalo Soldier, the all- Black 92nd Division of our Army. He never returned to see his family.   His remains were found in Italy in 1945, but they could not be  identified. So Lonnie, for 17 years, was known as ``Unknown X-193.''   In 2016, his remains were identified. At 11:15 a.m. this morning,  Texas time, Lonnie was laid to eternal rest.   Welcome home, soldier.                            ____________________
