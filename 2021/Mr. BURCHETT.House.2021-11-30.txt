 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Chief Master Sergeant  Ronnie McGhee as Tennessee's Second District's Veteran of the Month. He  served in the Air National Guard during the Gulf war.   Chief Master Sergeant McGhee was born and raised in Anderson County,  Tennessee, and graduated from Oliver Springs High School in 1963. Two  years later, he enlisted in the Air National Guard and joined the 119th  Aircraft Warning and Control Squadron as an administration specialist  and personnel specialist. When the 228th Combat Communication Squadron  opened at the Tyson Air National Guard Base in Alcoa, he joined them as  the communications training manager.   In 1990, Chief Master Sergeant McGhee volunteered to go with the  228th when it was deployed to Qatar in support of the Gulf war. While  he was there, he participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation  Desert Storm.   Following his time in Qatar, he was deployed to Germany and Italy  before settling in Nashville where he served as the command chief at  State headquarters. After more than 37 years of military service, he  retired in 2002.   Our country's heroes are the men and women of our Armed Forces, Madam  Speaker, not famous musicians, not athletes, and not actors. I am  grateful to Chief Master Sergeant McGhee for his service and sacrifice  to our great country.                            ____________________
