 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, and  that upon the conclusion of my remarks, the Senate resume executive  session, as under the previous order.    Madam President, almost exactly a year ago today, I stood  here and called for Congress to take action to protect renters before  the expiration of the eviction moratorium enacted during the early  weeks of the pandemic.   Today, like a year ago, we are only hours away from a fully  preventable housing crisis.   The CDC's eviction moratorium expires tonight at midnight, putting  millions of families still recovering from the economic fallout of  COVID-19 at risk for losing their homes, from losing the bedrock of  their safety and stability.   Right now, more than 11 million renters report being behind on rent.  That is one out of every seven renters. And people of color, who have  been hit hardest by this pandemic, are disproportionately at risk.  Nearly one-quarter of Black renters report being behind on rental  payments.   Last year, Congress worked together to account for that staggering  reality. We provided more than $45 billion in emergency rental  assistance. That money is now finally getting into the hands of  landlords around the country. It is helping families who lost jobs get  caught up on the missed payments.   But the money is getting out too slowly. Some States and local  governments opened their assistance programs only last month. Some  hadn't spent a single dollar by the beginning of June.   Now that is starting to change. In June, States delivered more than  $1.5 billion in emergency rental assistance. That money went to help  nearly 300,000 households, but there are still billions of dollars to  distribute and millions of families in need.   We have the tools, and we have the funding. What we need is the time.   Look, I agree that the eviction moratorium is not a long-term  solution, but let me be very clear: it is the right short-term action.  It is how we keep families safely in their homes while States deliver  emergency aid. It is how we keep families who are starting to recover  from the worst economic crisis of their lifetimes get back on their  feet.   Millions of jobs have been lost, businesses are still shuttered, and  childcare for too many families is still a patchwork of uncertainty.  The recovery underway in this country is historic, and it will  continue, but it has not yet reached every family.   But the need is not just economic. We are still in the throes of a  public health emergency that is trending in the wrong direction. Cases  of COVID-19 are rising. Hospitalizations and deaths are rising. The  Delta variant is more contagious, threatening to spread faster among  the half of the country that remains unvaccinated.   Needlessly evicting families would risk escalating our public health  crisis. The CDC understood that reality when it issued an eviction  moratorium in September. The Agency was clear, and I want to quote the  language they used: ``Housing stability helps protect health.''   That's right. Research shows that moratoriums aid in reducing  infections and deaths due to COVID-19. And research also shows that  when eviction moratoriums expire, there is an associated increase in  COVID-19 and mortality.   Yesterday, Congresswoman Cori Bush sent Members of Congress a letter.  Congresswoman Bush has lived through eviction. She has been unhoused.  And I want to quote her letter. She said:         I know firsthand the trauma and devastation that comes with       the violence of being evicted, and we have a responsibility       to do everything we can to prevent this trauma from being       inflicted on our neighbors and communities.    Cori Bush is exactly right.   My office has heard from so many people in Massachusetts who are  terrified about the possibility of losing their homes. I know that each  of my colleagues here must be hearing these stories. In every State in  this country there are families sitting around their kitchen table  right now trying to figure out how to survive a devastating,  disruptive, and unnecessary eviction.   Congress has a choice to make. It is a privilege for us to represent  people, and we have a duty to exercise our power on their behalf. Every  Senator in this Chamber should be grateful that they have the power  right now to keep families safe.   My colleagues understood the stakes in March of 2020, when Congress  passed the CARES Act eviction moratorium into law. They understood the  stakes when we provided historic funding for emergency rental  assistance. I urge them to join me now in continuing this lifesaving  protection as States distribute assistance to keep renters housed; to  keep landlords paid; and, most of all, to keep families safe.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
