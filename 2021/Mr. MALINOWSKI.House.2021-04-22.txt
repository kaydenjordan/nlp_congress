 Madam Speaker, it is good to be able to stand on the  House floor and speak, not about the crisis of the day or even my hopes  for tomorrow, but about something this Congress has delivered to make  people's lives better.   When I first ran for this job, the number one demand I heard from  voters was to make healthcare more accessible and the Affordable Care  Act more affordable. With the American Rescue Plan, that is what we  have done in a major way.   By increasing ACA subsidies and capping premiums, we are enabling the  typical middle-class family with marketplace coverage to save hundreds  of dollars a month. A 60-year-old couple making $75,000 a year will  save almost $1,400 a month. That is life-changing.   Now we just have to make this permanent; to keep the promise that no  American should be crushed by the cost of their healthcare; and to give  people hope that, if they continue to vote for better government, they  will continue to get it.                            ____________________
