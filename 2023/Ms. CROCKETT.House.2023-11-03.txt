 Mr. Speaker, they say that everything is bigger in  Texas, and that includes our pride for our very first World Series win.  Yes, I also rise to celebrate the World Series champions, the Texas  Rangers.   On Wednesday, the Rangers clinched their first World Series win  against the Arizona Diamondbacks. I don't mean to rub it in the face of  my colleagues from the Grand Canyon State, but we warned you we could-- and we would--come and take it.   This week our Rangers went and took it.   I was lucky enough to represent north Texas as the first Black  Democratic woman to play in the Congressional Baseball Game this year.  While I may not have the arm of Josh Sborz or the speed of two-time MVP  Corey Seager, you best believe our Rangers have inspired me to score  some runs next year.   While this may be our first World Series win, mark my words, it will  not be our last.                            ____________________
