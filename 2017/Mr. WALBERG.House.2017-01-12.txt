 Mr. Speaker, for too long, Washington has spent  education dollars by building bureaucracy instead of by advancing  opportunities for our children.   As a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I  believe we must change the status quo and restore local control in  education. We need someone to lead the Department of Education and to  work with Congress and leave decisionmaking in the hands of parents and  local communities, not in Washington. Betsy DeVos is that person.   She has dedicated her life to fighting for children in Michigan. She  has been a tireless advocate for giving families choices and for  ensuring our kids have access to quality education, including in public  schools, regardless of their Zip Codes. She has a heart for children  and will be a champion for every student in America.   I encourage the Senate to confirm her quickly so that, together, we  can get to work on ensuring a high-quality education is within reach  for every child.                            ____________________
