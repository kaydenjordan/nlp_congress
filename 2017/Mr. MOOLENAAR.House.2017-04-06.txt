 Mr. Speaker, today another farm convoy left Michigan  and headed south to help those suffering in America's heartland, where  wildfires have burned more than 1 million acres in four States.   This convoy, and those like it in days gone by and the days to come,  is the work of the amazing farming community in my district and across  the State of Michigan.   They have donated trucks, trailers, and time to drive supplies to the  affected areas. They have donated food and fencing to help farmers  recover and rebuild. They have donated care packages with candy and  cards to care for the hurting souls.   Many volunteers are staying and helping in the devastated  communities. In fact, tomorrow, two young men from Ogemaw County, Brady  and Keaton, are scheduled to travel with 4-H kids from Michigan's Thumb  area to volunteer their skills and help build fencing in Kansas.   The overwhelmingly and generous efforts of the Michigan farming  community, in response to this tragedy, represent the best of America.  I pray for God's blessing on all those involved as they help with this  crisis.                            ____________________
