 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of  Paul Charles Wesch of Mobile, AL, who passed away on December 27, 2020.  He will be long remembered for his vast knowledge of finance, law, and  business, and for his commitment to his community.   Paul was born in Seattle, WA, on November 20, 1954. He grew up in  Hunstville, AL, where he graduated from Butler High School in 1973. He  went on to earn two undergraduate degrees, a law degree, and later a  LL.M degree in taxation from the University of Alabama. Upon graduation  from law school in 1980, he accepted a position with Stanard and Mills  law firm in Mobile. In 1984, Paul joined The Mitchell Company as a real  estate developer, where he worked for nearly 30 years. During his  tenure at The Mitchell Company, he served as executive vice president,  general counsel, and director. Paul was later appointed in 2013 by  Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson to be the city's executive finance  director. A few years later, in 2016, he became Mayor Stimpson's chief  of staff while continuing to serve as finance director.   In addition to his professional achievements, Paul previously served  as chairman of the Mobile County Republican Party and managed several  political campaigns. He served on the board of directors for National  Security Group, Inc., as well as the USS Alabama Battleship Commission.  Paul was also involved with Camp Rap-A-Hope, St. Mary's Home for  Children, and the University of Alabama President's Cabinet for several  years. He was a respected member of the Athelstan Club, the Mobile Bar  Association, and the Alabama Bar Association.   I offer my deepest condolences to Paul's wife, Linda; his children,  Paul, Caroline, and Colden; his sister, Sharon; his brother-in-law,  Stephen; and his nieces and nephews. I join all of their loved ones as  they mourn his loss and celebrate his many life  accomplishments.                            ____________________
