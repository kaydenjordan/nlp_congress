 Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), and I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division G (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. _.  None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be       made available in support of the United Nations Human Rights       Council, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner       for Human Rights, or the United Nations Relief and Works       Agency.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Yoho) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chair, this is a simple, straightforward amendment that  would limit the taxpayers' burden of hundreds of millions of dollars to  the bodies at the United Nations that work against America's interests  and the interests of our ally, Israel.   Since its reformation as the Human Rights Council about 10 years ago,  this U.N. agency has operated with a singular focus to isolate and  delegitimize one of America's closest friends and allies, Israel.   In fact, Israel stands alone as the only Nation to have an entire  agenda, Item 7, devoted solely to it.   Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, but one would never  know that if you only saw what came out of the Human Rights Council. In  fact, while Israel is targeted repeatedly for unwarranted criticism,  some of the world's worst human rights abusers are ignored.   When the body that was created to promote and protect global human  rights has its agenda driven by the very worst human rights abusers,  you have to stop and ask: How does this make sense? And why should the  United States continue to legitimize this agenda by remaining part of  that body?   The same goes for the U.N.'s Office for High Commissioner for Human  Rights, which serves as the secretariat for the Council.   There is an endemic and systemic anti-Israeli bias and agenda at the  Council, and it is the High Commissioner's Office that serves and fuels  this agenda. In fact, this is the office that is currently putting  together the BDS blacklist for the Council, and the High Commissioner  has signaled his intent to publish this list. This effectively puts the  Human Rights Council and the High Commissioner at the forefront of the  anti-Israeli boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement. There is  simply no justification for the American taxpayers to fund this sort of  activity aimed at isolating and delegitimizing our ally, Israel, and  harming our national interests.   There is also no justification for the American taxpayers to support  our participation at a body that enables human rights abusers. When  Cuba, Venezuela, China, Saudi Arabia, Burundi, and others are allowed  to sit on the Human Rights Council and dictate  [[Page H7133]]  its direction, you know that the body has strayed far from its mandate.   In fact, these countries use the Council to actually shield  themselves from criticism, turning the body meant to promote and  protect human rights into a tool for the world's worst despots to hide  the atrocities that are coming at home.   Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida has 2\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Chair, by passing this amendment, Congress will send a  very clear message to these agencies and to the entire U.N. that the  status quo is no longer, that we want to see the reforms that we want  to address now before we return to full participation.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  amendment in an effort to change the status quo at the U.N. by starting  with the most egregious of the entities, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.  [[Page H7134]]    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will  be postponed.   The Chair understands that amendment No. 112 will not be offered.                    Amendment No. 113 Offered by Mr. Gaetz    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 113  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
