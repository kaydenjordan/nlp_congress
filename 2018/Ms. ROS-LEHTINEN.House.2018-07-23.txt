 Mr. Speaker, in the seven decades since its  independence, Israel has become a shining light in an otherwise dark  region filled with human rights abusers all around her.   That would not have been possible were it not for those who fought  for their ancestral country, but also for our shared values of freedom  and democracy.   In fact, over 4,000 foreign individuals, Jews and non-Jews, from 58  countries volunteered to fight in 1948 alongside  [[Page H6634]]  the Israeli forces. Machal, volunteers from outside the country, they  are called.   Amongst these mighty warriors, 23 Cuban Jews bravely answered the  call to arms and left Cuba to come to Israel's aid and secure her  independence.   This Sunday, the Inter-American Chapter of Hadassah in my  congressional district is honoring these courageous Cuban heroes,  particularly the four remaining survivors.   Mr. Speaker, the sacrifice and heroism of Cuban Jews during the  Israeli 1948 War of Independence will never be forgotten by us.                            ____________________
