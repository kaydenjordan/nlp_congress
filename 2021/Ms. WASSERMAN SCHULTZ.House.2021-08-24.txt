 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 4, critical legislation that confronts the crisis facing our  democracy.   In Florida, we witnessed a Republican legislature attempting to cling  to power through voter suppression, taking special aim at Black and  Brown voices. The blatantly antidemocratic legislation signed by  Governor DeSantis this year makes voter registration harder, limits  voting by mail, and curbs the use of secure ballot drop boxes. Similar  suppression tactics took root across the Nation, with at least 18  States making it harder to vote this year.   To honor our dear friend and colleague, Congressman Lewis, we must  stand up to this assault on our constitutional rights. This bill would  stop those who want to shape the electorate to help them win elections  because they can't win on their losing agenda.   At this moment in history, bold action is necessary to protect the  right to vote. After we pass this bill, we must ensure it moves through  the Senate. Our very democracy depends on it.
