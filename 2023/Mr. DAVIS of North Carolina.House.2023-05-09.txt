 Mr. Speaker, food security is national  security. The late House Committee on Agriculture chair, Harold Cooley,  once said: ``Bread and butter rather than bullets and bayonets are the  most powerful weapons in our arsenal.''   We must ensure that the next generation of agricultural leaders know  how to advocate and make their voices heard for the future of eastern  North Carolina and rural America.   In that spirit, I held a 2023 farm bill listening session with FFA  students at Beddingfield High School in Wilson, North Carolina, to  discuss agriculture's most pressing needs.   Each student sat down with me and addressed their top priorities,  ranging from biomedicine research to nutrition, rural development, and  everything in between. They completed surveys to be submitted to the  House Committee on Agriculture to be a part of the official Record.   Mr. Speaker, bread and butter are indeed our most important arsenal,  along with our students who are our future. We are only as great as the  next generation.                            ____________________
