 Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Blumenthal  and Senator Warner, who have spoken strongly on the issue at hand,  which is to protect our great country and our extraordinary 200-year  experiment in self-governance. To do it, we have to add a new tier--a  strong protection--for the sanctity of our elections.   I thank Senator Blumenthal. He is a member of the Committee on the  Judiciary, where he is doing important work on these issues. I thank  our colleague, Senator Warner, of course, who is the vice chairman of  the Intelligence Committee, on which I serve. I also thank my colleague  who is still on the floor, Senator Blumenthal, for all of his  leadership. I look forward to partnering with him and with Senator  Warner in the days ahead.   In a moment, I will ask for unanimous consent to adopt a bipartisan  bill that I have proposed with Senator Cotton. It is S. 890, the Senate  Cybersecurity Protection Act. Before I ask, however, for that unanimous  consent request, I will give some brief background as to why Senator  Cotton and I are working on this issue and putting all of this time  into this effort.   In the 2016 election, obviously, the Russians inflicted damage on our  democracy by hacking the personal accounts of political parties and  individuals and then by dumping emails and documents online. This  tactic generated massive amounts of media coverage that was based on  those stolen documents. It is clear, in my view, that the Russians and  other hostile foreign actors are going to continue to target the  personal devices and accounts, which are often less secure than  official government devices. You don't have to take my word for it. Top  national security officials in the Trump administration have said  virtually the same thing.   Last year, the Director of National Intelligence--our former  colleague, Senator Coats--told the Senate Intelligence Committee: ``The  personal accounts and devices of government officials can contain  information that is useful for our adversaries to target, either  directly or indirectly, these officials and the organizations with  which they are affiliated.''   Likewise, in a letter to me last year, the then-Director of the  National Security Agency,   Mike Rogers, said that the personal devices  and accounts belonging to senior U.S. government officials ``remain  prime targets for exploitation.''   These foreign intelligence threats are not just aimed at the  executive branch. Last year, a bipartisan Senate working group examined  cybersecurity threats against Senators. In its November 2018 report,  the working group revealed there was ``mounting evidence that Senators  are being targeted for hacking, which could include exposure of  personal data.'' Likewise, Google has now publicly confirmed that it  has quietly warned specific Senators and Senate staff that their  personal email accounts were targeted by state-sponsored hackers.   Unfortunately, the Sergeant at Arms--the office that is tasked with  protecting the Senate's cybersecurity--is currently barred from using  its resources to protect the personal devices  [[Page S5055]]  and accounts of Senators and their staff, even if Senators and their  staff are being targeted by foreign spies and hackers.   That is why, on a bipartisan basis, I and Senator Cotton, who also  serves on the Intelligence Committee with me and with Senator Warner,  who spoke earlier, introduced legislation to permit the Sergeant at  Arms to provide 100-percent voluntary cybersecurity assistance to  Senators and their staff. Our bill is modeled after a provision in the  recently passed Senate Intelligence Authorization bill, which permits  the Director of National Intelligence to provide voluntary cyber help  to protect the personal devices and accounts of intelligence community  employees.   Fighting back against foreign interference means securing every  aspect of our democracy, including the personal accounts and devices of  elected officials. I feel strongly that the majority leader, our  colleague from Kentucky, must stop blocking this commonsense  legislation and allow this body to better defend itself against foreign  hackers.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Rules  and Administration be discharged from further consideration of S. 890,  the Senate Cybersecurity Protection Act; that the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration; that the bill be read a third time and passed;  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I note again there has been an objection.   I would only state that I don't see how anyone could consider what I  have proposed to be a partisan issue. I and our colleague from  Arkansas, Senator Cotton--a military veteran--have joined in an effort,  which I would just say to the Senators who are on the floor, is going  to be one of the great threats of our time.   We know that hostile foreign actors are going to target the personal  accounts and devices of government officials. Russia clearly  demonstrated the opportunities for meddling in the last election. Now,  we know that those opportunities are going to grow exponentially in the  days and months ahead. So I only want to pass on that I think this is  regrettable, and there has been an objection, and I just hope we will  be able to pass this bill before more people are hacked and their  stolen data is exploited by hostile foreign actors.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
