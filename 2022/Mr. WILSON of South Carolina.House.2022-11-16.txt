 Madam Speaker, Americans are  experiencing inflation at 40-year highs, with families in South  Carolina paying over 14 percent more in the last year.   Under Biden, inflation has outpaced worker wages for 18 months in a  row and will cost the average American household over $8,000 annually,  which is a loss of a month of income.   A trip to the grocery store costs families 12 percent more from last  year. Eggs are up 43 percent, flour up 25 percent, milk up 15 percent.   The Congressional Budget Office reports the irresponsible inflation  expansion act will increase the deficit through 2026 and cost working  families an additional $60 billion, destroying jobs.   Our country is in crisis, and Americans need relief, which is why  voters have achieved a House Republican majority. Republicans will  fight Bidenflation undermining American families.   Congratulations, Speaker-to-be Kevin McCarthy.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
