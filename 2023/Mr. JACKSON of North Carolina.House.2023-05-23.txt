 Mr. Speaker, last week there was an  enormous fire in Charlotte. An apartment building that was under  construction caught fire. Within an hour, it became a five-alarm fire.   Ninety firefighters from the Charlotte Fire Department responded.  They were able to heroically rescue 15 construction workers, including  one from on top of a crane. Tragically, two construction workers were  not able to be rescued, and they died: Reuben Holmes and Demonte  Sherrill.   Reuben was loved by his family. He was set to have lunch with his  sister on Saturday, and they just can't believe what happened.   Demonte was a father of four. Obviously, this is a tragedy that will  reshape their families' lives but also a big part of our community.   We honor the first responders who sprang into action and did  everything they possibly could under extraordinary circumstances, a  fire that burned at a temperature of 2,000 degrees.   We call upon the members of our broader Charlotte community to do  everything that they can for these families that have suffered truly  unimaginable loss.                            ____________________
