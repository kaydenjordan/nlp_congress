 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 3,  condemning the recent attacks on pro-life facilities, groups, and  churches.   New York is home to so many compassionate and committed pro-life  pregnancy centers, such as CompassCare in Amherst, New York, and  CareNet Centers dotted around New York State.   Pro-life pregnancy centers across our State and our country provide  women with critical care, such as free pregnancy tests, pre-natal care,  referrals, education, mentoring, and material support, including  diapers, car seats, and clothing. They also provide love and support to  these women in a time of need. From 2016 to 2020, these pregnancy  centers saved over 800,000 lives by providing a compassionate  alternative to abortion.   Tragically, on June 7, 2022, a CompassCare facility in western New  York was maliciously firebombed by a violent anti-abortion group called  Jane's Revenge. The perpetrators left graffiti: ``Jane was here.''  Those responsible have still not been held accountable.   Unfortunately, this was not an isolated incident. Over 100 pro-life  facilities and churches were attacked in 2022 alone.   I was honored to join CompassCare's CEO, Reverend Jim Harden, and the  CompassCare team at its reopening just a few months after the violent  attack. As Reverend Harden said best, CompassCare now has 21st century  telehealth tools to compete head-on with the billion-dollar abortion  empire by reaching and serving every woman in America.                                time  1045    Pro-life pregnancy centers play a key role in helping pregnant women  all across the country, but Democrat leadership has been silent on the  unprecedented amount of violence leveled against these compassionate  advocates for life. House Republicans are united in our condemnation of  the political violence these wonderful caregivers and those who choose  life have always faced.   I am proud to support H. Con. Res. 3, condemning the recent attacks  on pro-life facilities, groups, and churches; and I will not back down  to violent extremists.                            ____________________
