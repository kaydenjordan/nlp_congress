 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 15 minutes as in morning business.    Mr. President, situated off the northeast corner of  Australia lies one of the seven natural wonders of the world, a wonder  that is visible from space--the Great Barrier Reef. Each year, around 2  million visitors come from around the globe to experience the Great  Barrier Reef. They come to see hundreds of species of sharks, dolphins,  fish, mollusks, whales, seabirds, and other marine life thriving in  nearly 133,000 square miles of coral reef. Some of these coral  structures are thought to date back as long as 25 million years. When  Pope Francis spoke of the ``wonderworld of the seas,'' this is the kind  of beauty and bounty he had in mind.   It is difficult to imagine something so expansive and ancient  threatened so profoundly by one of Earth's more recent inhabitants-- humans--but it is. The oceans are taking the brunt of our modern  carelessness. They are warming, acidifying, and literally suffocating  under our carbon dioxide emissions. They are fouled with our plastic  garbage, and they are polluted with runoff from farming and storm water  wash into the sea.   I have come to the floor before to plead that my Senate colleagues  heed the warnings of our oceans. Those warnings are loud and clear and  measurable. They are measurable with thermometers, tide gauges, and  simple pH tests, and they are chronicled by the testimony of fishermen  and sailors.   Today I wish to focus on that Great Barrier Reef. A healthy coral  reef is one of the most productive engines of life on Earth. It is home  to 25 percent of the world's fish biodiversity. The corals use calcium  carbonate--a compound usually readily available in ocean water--to  build their hard skeletons. These hard structures shelter the living  coral polyps and undergird the entire ecosystem that depends on the  reef. Without the corals, the whole thing collapses.   The living corals have evolved a symbiotic relationship with tiny  photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae. The algae live in the  surface tissue of the corals. It is the algae that provide the color  that you see healthy corals display. The corals' metabolic waste is  converted by the algae back into food and oxygen for the corals, and,  in turn, corals shelter the algae.   However, the range of pH, temperature, salinity, and water clarity  within which this symbiotic magic takes place is fairly narrow. Get  outside that comfort range, and the corals get stressed. When they are  stressed enough, they begin to evict their algae. This is what is  called ``coral bleaching.'' The corals whiten as they shed their  colorful algae.   Of course, without the algae, corals can't live for long. The algae  can resettle, and the corals can recover, but if the algae don't  resettle, the corals soon die. That is what is happening in huge swaths  of the Great Barrier Reef, and here is why.   As we have pumped massive quantities of waste CO2 into the  atmosphere, dramatically raising the concentration of carbon dioxide in  the Earth's atmosphere, the oceans have absorbed approximately 30  percent of all of that excess carbon dioxide.   We recently broke a dangerous new atmospheric record, exceeding a  monthly average of 410 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the  atmosphere for the first time in human history.   For comparison, at the start of the Industrial Revolution,  atmospheric carbon dioxide was around 280 parts per million. That is  280 not so long ago and 410 now, and 300 had been about the upper limit  of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for as long as human beings have  been on this planet.   About a third of all of that added CO2 gets absorbed by  the ocean, and it is absorbed with a chemical reaction that makes the  ocean more acidic. That is why we talk about ocean acidification.   At the same time that the oceans have been soaking up all of that  excess CO2, they have also been soaking up heat--lots of  heat--roughly 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere  by these greenhouse gases. As a result of all of that heat, the oceans  are warming as they get more acidic, more often knocking the corals out  of the conditions they need for that symbiosis to thrive.   We are only 1 year out from the massive bleaching that tore across  the globe from 2014 to 2017. NOAA branded it ``the longest, most  widespread, and possibly the most damaging coral bleaching event on  record.''   This graphic shows how severe and pervasive the bleaching was. The  light blue areas on the map, which you really don't see any of,  represent the parts of the ocean that are under no stress. These are  the continents. There is North America and South America. Over here is  Australia. There is Asia. And the red parts are the oceans.   The lighter red is ``Alert Level 1'' areas, where heat stress led to  significant coral bleaching. The deeper red is ``Alert Level 2'' areas,  which experienced not only widespread coral bleaching but also  significant coral die-off. This white box right here marks the Great  Barrier Reef. You can see that severe coral bleaching in the northern  edges of the Great Barrier Reef, and this was new. According to NOAA,  these are areas where bleaching had never occurred before.   In 2016 scientists with the Australian Research Council's Centre of  Excellence for Coral Reef Studies undertook extensive aerial and in- water surveys of the Great Barrier Reef to estimate the extent of the  damage. Out of the over 900 individual reefs that were surveyed, only 7  percent of those reefs escaped bleaching, and 93 percent were hit. In  the northern portion of the Great Barrier Reef, upwards of 80 percent  of the corals were severely bleached.   When the researchers returned, they found that up to two-thirds of  those corals in the northern section had died. The central and southern  sections fared better but still saw corals dying.   A recent paper in Nature by Australian and NOAA researchers totaled  the damage. The paper's lead author, Dr. Terry Hughes, told The  Atlantic: ``On average, across the Great Barrier Reef, one in three  corals died in nine months.''   In the northern section of the reef, researchers found that some  species, such as staghorn and table corals, suffered what they called a  ``catastrophic die-off.'' In total, about one-half of the northern  range's corals died.    Dr. Hughes went on to say the Great Barrier Reef ``has transformed  into a completely new system that looks differently, and behaves  differently, and functions differently.'' That is climate change.   In an interview with Huffington Post, Dr. Hughes said the heat wave  that caused the bleaching was so intense that some of the corals  basically ``cooked'' and died quickly. Usually, if corals can't recover  their algae after a bleaching event, they slowly starve to death. Some  of the less resilient species crashed by up to 90 percent in the recent  bleaching.   Dr. Hughes made clear to the Atlantic that human-caused climate  change was the driving force behind this coral bleaching. Indeed, the  title of his nature article is, ``Global warming transforms coral reef  assemblages.''  [[Page S2543]]    Dr. John Bruno from the University of North Carolina said that the  loss of the Great Barrier Reef's corals is ``like clear-cutting a  redwood forest.'' He went on:         In 10 years, you're going to have a lot of stuff on the       ground, but you're not going to have the old-growth forest       back. Some of these corals were 10, 30 years old, but a lot       of them were centuries old. In 100 years--if there is no more       warming--they could return.    In 100 years, they could return.   Dr. Hughes and his colleagues, however, were less optimistic in their  nature paper. They wrote: ``The most likely scenario, therefore, is  that coral reefs throughout the tropics will continue to degrade over  the current century until climate change stabilizes, allowing remnant  populations to reorganize into novel, heat-tolerant reef assemblages.''  Remnant populations are all they expect to survive.   Researchers are trying to understand the consequences of losing so  much coral in our seas. Obviously, if you harm the corals, you harm the  reef; if you harm the reef, you destabilize life throughout the reef,  and that is bad for oceans.   A recent paper in Global Change Biology found severe declines in the  populations of the fish most connected with the corals hit hardest by  the bleaching. So the cascade effect is already observed.   The Great Barrier Reef even sounds different. A study published last  week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences compared  the lively underwater cacophony of a vibrant Great Barrier Reef in 2012  with the quiet of bleached locations in 2016. The life that teems  around a healthy reef decreased with the loss of the corals.   There are actually some open-ocean species, like juvenile clownfish-- or the Nemos--that actually rely on sound coming off these reefs from  all the life and all the feeding and all the activity and that actually  use that sound to find reefs to go settle on. So this quiet of dying  reefs makes their job of finding new homes harder.   Climate change makes the heat waves that spur coral bleaching more  intense and also more frequent, leaving corals less time to recover  before the next heat wave hits, and we may see the more vulnerable  corals fail to recover at all as the waters warm too much for them to  survive.   A study published earlier this year in Science looked at 100 tropical  reefs and found that only 6 had avoided bleaching. Bleaching events  that occurred in the past, once in a generation, now occur around every  6 years. As the Guardian summarized it, ``Repeated large-scale coral  bleaching events are the new normal thanks to global warming.''   So what can we do about it? Scientists are working to better  understand what makes certain corals more resilient and to try to use  these lessons to protect more vulnerable species. But that research  nibbles at the fringes of this global die-off. There is some localized  work on things like sun shields to help protect shallow corals during  peak heat. Senator McCain and I visited efforts to rebuild shattered  coral reefs in Indonesia, but these tiny efforts can't offset the  global onslaught of climate change unless we move fast to address the  real problem.   Australia announced last week that it would invest around $400  million in a patchwork of efforts to protect the Great Barrier Reef:  increasing monitoring and enforcement, for instance; limiting pollution  runoff from shore; trying to keep out certain invasive starfish; and  trying to help restore lost corals. But the plan does not address the  main culprit behind coral bleaching, and that culprit is climate  change. Scientists noticed that omission, including the Australian  Academy of Science, which pointed out the problem that the reef is  ``highly vulnerable to climate change,'' and ``urge[d] the government  to address the cause of the problem.''   The call of those scientists is a call that we, too, ought to heed.  One of the great wonders of God's Earth is on its way to turning into a  sandy relic because we are unwilling to say no to the fossil fuel  industry. It is that simple.   This coral die-off is one of innumerable consequences that our Earth  is already warning us with. It is not the only signal; it is one of  many. But nothing that can't be monetized for an industry seems to get  our attention around here. Instead, it appears we will have to look  future generations in the eye and tell them that there was once a Great  Barrier Reef, that it was one of the wonders of the world, and that we  let it die to keep the fossil fuel industry happy.   It is time we woke up.   I yield the floor.
