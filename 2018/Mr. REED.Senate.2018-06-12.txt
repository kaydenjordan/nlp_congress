 Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Oklahoma for  being very thoughtful and informing us all of the current procedural  status. We both hope to be able to work through another package of  managers' amendments that could be submitted.   Looking at the amendments we have seen so far, regardless of what  position you take on their disposition, they all seem to be serious,  substantive and, in our view, worthy of a vote. We just have to work  out the procedure to get to those votes. There may be something in the  future that is offered that seems to be very difficult, and I will not  say we have not, in the past, on our side stood up and said we object.  That is one of the prerogatives.   At this juncture, Senator Inhofe and I seem to be in harmony trying  to find ways to vote for the proposals we have seen presented to us and  ask and request votes on the proposals by our colleagues.   With that, I know Senator Inhofe and I will continue to work to see  if we can move this process forward.  [[Page S3735]]    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2842 to the Lee  amendment.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of  the amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, this amendment is a technical correction to  the previous amendment I offered, and I ask that it be accepted for  consideration.    Mr. President, I believe the amendment is pending.   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
