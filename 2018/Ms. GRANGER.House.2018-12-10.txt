 Mr. Speaker, George H.W. Bush was a giant of a man, a  decorated naval aviator who nearly lost his life in World War II,  Ambassador to the United Nations, Director of the Central Intelligence  Agency, Vice President, and, most notably, President of the United  States.   But more than any of that, he is someone to admire because he spent  his life dedicated to serving his country and his fellow man. His  dedication to his country was only rivaled by his dedication to his  family, marked by his 73-year marriage to his wife, Barbara, and his  loving relationships with his children, his grandchildren, and his  great-grandchildren.   As important as he was, he took time to greet people who came to see  him. He knew the value of a written note of praise and a hug and a  handshake. He laughed as well as he led, and he knew the importance of  relationships.   Those who didn't have the privilege of knowing President Bush  personally were given a glimpse of his character through his loved ones  on Wednesday during his memorial service. As his son President George  W. Bush said--who has the same sense of family and dedication to the  Nation--of his father: ``Your decency, sincerity, and kind soul will  stay with us forever.''   So through our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving  you, a great and noble man. George H.W. Bush's greatness shows in the  strength of his family, and he has given us all a lesson in how to be a  good friend.   President Bush accomplished much in his long life. He epitomized what  it means to be a public servant, and I am honored to recognize this  distinguished Texan today and thank him for his service to our country.
