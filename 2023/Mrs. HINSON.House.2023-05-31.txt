 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize General Randy  George, a native of Alden, Iowa, who was recently nominated to be the  next Army Chief of Staff. This is a tremendous and well-deserved honor  for General George.   General George served our Nation both in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is  a decorated military hero, having earned a Purple Heart and Defense  Distinguished Service Medal, among many other accolades.   General George exemplifies distinguished and selfless service. It is  only because of brave Americans like General George that we can wave  our American flag, we can speak freely, and we can practice the  religion that we choose.   I am hopeful that his service inspires the next generation of Iowans  and Americans to answer our Nation's call.   General George has made his hometown of Alden, Iowa, and the entire  Hawkeye State proud.                            ____________________
