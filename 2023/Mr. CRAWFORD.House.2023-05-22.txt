 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a former Member  of this body who served the people of the First District of Arkansas,  Mr. Marion Berry, who passed away over the weekend following a long  illness.   Congressman Berry was born in Stuttgart, Arkansas, and he grew up in  the small Arkansas County town of Bayou Meto. The son of a rice farmer,  Congressman Berry would work as a pharmacist and eventually in  agriculture, which led to a career in public service caring for and  advocating on behalf of those he worked around in the Arkansas Delta.   Congressman Berry worked alongside President Clinton in the White  House and would eventually run for office, serving seven terms in  Washington representing the First District of Arkansas where he was a  member of the Appropriations Committee.   While his work in Washington was important to him, he worked  tirelessly to draw attention to the people of the First District,  especially those who lived in the delta.   Congressman Berry will always be known for his political wit and  wisdom but will be remembered and respected for the service he provided  to his community, constituents, and country in the House of  Representatives.   Our delegation, our families, and so many across the State of  Arkansas offer our condolences and prayers as we remember Congressman  Berry and his family during this time of mourning and remembrance.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence.
