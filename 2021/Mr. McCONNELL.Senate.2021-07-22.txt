 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, with COVID-19 cases ticking up all  across the country, with some bureaucrats and elected officials  actually talking about reimposing various measures on the American  people, the Biden administration continues to let illegal immigrants  pour across our southern border, and reportedly, they are considering  loosening our border security even more.   Remember when the Biden campaign's rhetoric and then the Biden  administration's early actions led to a rush on the border. They tried  to wave it off as a seasonal, springtime surge, but, of course, that  wasn't true. The numbers just keep climbing.   Customs and Border Protection had more encounters on the southern  border in June than they had in May, nearly 190,000 encounters last  month alone--the highest number in 21 years. Law enforcement is coming  across huge groups of hundreds of individuals. With almost 3 months  still remaining in fiscal year 2021, CPB has already encountered more  illegal immigrants than it did in the entirety--the entirety--of fiscal  2019, which was, of course, before COVID. We have exceeded that total  with almost 3 months to go.   The Biden administration claims they are addressing the crisis by  simply speeding up the rate at which they get migrants out of custody,  out of border facilities, as if simply reducing the head count was the  goal. Of course, that is no solution at all if the individuals are  simply being released into the interior of our country.   Ordinarily, legal immigration is part of the heart of the United  States of America, and it always has been, but it simply is not a  universal human right for everybody in the Western Hemisphere who would  like a better job or to break our rules and turn up at the border. No  country, none--no country in the world--could govern itself that way.   In fact, this ongoing crisis is supremely unfair and uncompassionate  to the men, women, and children whom it continues to entice into the  scorching desert Sun. Border Patrol agents are having to double as  humanitarian workers and EMTs. They rescue people who get lost, who are  at risk of drowning, who have been simply abandoned by smugglers or  traffickers.   Amidst all this, in the thick of this crisis, the Biden  administration has spent weeks flirting with ending its title 42  authority, declaring the COVID emergency to be finished and over at our  southern border and letting even more people stream across. COVID is  already on the rise again, the border is already in crisis, and the  President and his team want to end the emergency safeguards at our  border? Reimpose COVID precautions on the American people but end the  COVID emergency for illegal immigrants? How does that make any sense?   Meanwhile, our Democratic friends here on Capitol Hill say they want  to push a massive amnesty plan into the reckless taxing-and-spending  spree they want to pass later this year on a party-line vote. As if  damaging inflation, soaring costs, lower real wages, and more debt were  not punishment enough for the American people, Democrats also want to  stuff a massive amnesty plan into their tax-and-spend spree. It is like  they have systematically identified the worst idea for American  families on every single issue and set about rolling them into one  huge, reckless proposal.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on a completely different matter,  last year, on a broad and a bipartisan basis, Congress passed sanctions  that were designed to block Russia from completing its Nord Stream 2  pipeline project. The Biden administration recently waived those  sanctions to allow the pipeline to move forward. Now it appears the  administration has cut a deal with Germany that will allow the pipeline  to become operational.   The initial press reporting about this deal does not inspire  confidence that this administration is taking the Russian threat as  seriously as it should, nor does it indicate that we are standing with  our Ukrainian partners, who are struggling to defend themselves against  Moscow's aggression. The administration appears to have ignored the  broader implications of the Nord Stream 2 project and Russia's approach  to Europe writ large   Green energy initiatives or promises of diplomatic meetings will not  address the real risks Moscow poses--not even close. Just a couple of  years ago, Washington Democrats were absolutely melting down over their  belief that the prior administration was being too soft on Russia and  leaving Ukraine in the lurch. Where is the outrage today?   For several years there, my colleagues across the aisle sounded like  big-time Russia hawks, so I hope they will now join Republicans in  pressing the administration to explain this curious decision, to  explain how President Biden intends to impose meaningful costs on  Moscow for all its misdeeds at the same time they have America greasing  the skids--greasing the skids--for this Putin pipeline.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on one final matter, next week,  President Biden is set to meet with Prime Minister of Iraq Mustafa al- Kadhimi. The meeting comes at an important moment for our shared  efforts toward peace and security in Iraq and the entire region.   ISIS has been significantly weakened in Iraq and Syria after years of  shared efforts, but the terrorist organization remains a grave threat.  And ISIS is far from the only threat Iraqis and the Iraqi Government  are facing. For years, Iran has systematically sought to undermine  Iraq's sovereignty. Iran's well-armed proxy of militias report to  Tehran, not Baghdad, but they operate inside Iraq.   These groups have conducted campaigns of intimidation and  assassination against peaceful protesters and independent journalists  in Iraq, the same brutal methods they employ in Syria, Lebanon, and in  Iran itself. These Iranian-backed militias are also threatening our own  American interests in Iraq. Iran wants to pick fights with a superpower  while making the nation of Iraq bear the risk.   The fact is, the United States is in Iraq at the invitation of their  government. We are there to support the  [[Page S5029]]  Iraqis and to help the Iraqis kill terrorists and defend their  sovereignty. Our presence in Iraq also helps our operations in Syria  against ISIS and al-Qaida.   Again, it is pretty obvious the terrorist threat is not over.  Remember, the disastrous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan may  not simply be felt in that country; a Taliban victory and resurgence of  al-Qaida could embolden jihadists all over the world, just as the rise  of ISIS did in the wake of President Obama's withdrawal from Iraq.   As we watch Afghanistan descend into chaos and ISIS continue to lash  out in Iraq and Syria, now is not the time for either the United States  or Iraq to pretend that our shared mission is over. As I have warned  again and again, terrorists don't observe our political timetables.  They don't pack up just because we lose faith or lose focus.   So let's hope this administration is already learning from their  mistakes in Afghanistan. When the Iraqi Prime Minister visits next  week, the White House should provide strong assurances that the United  States will stand strong with our friends and continue to support our  partners who are standing up to terror and to extremism.                            ____________________
