 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life of my friend Brian Kelly, who passed away on Tuesday, January  21, at 1:21 a.m., after a long and courageous battle with brain cancer.   I first met Brian when we were congressional staffers together in  central Illinois. He was infectious to be around with his positive  attitude and his perpetual optimism to always help others. We bonded  over our mutual friends and experiences in his hometown of Vandalia,  Illinois.   Brian was the epitome of what a public servant should strive to be,  putting everyone else above himself, even during his fight against this  deadly disease. After diagnosis, when I would see him, the smile and  accompanying laughs made us sometimes forget the pain that he and his  wife, Megan, were experiencing when none of us were around.   Madam Speaker, my friend Brian has no more need to fight, but knowing  that does not make it any easier on his loved ones who lost him too  soon. My heartfelt prayers go out to his lovely wife, Megan, and the  entire Kelly family and all those who were lucky, like me, to know such  a kind soul.                            ____________________
