 Mr. President, on March 22, 2021, we suffered another  horrific mass shooting in our State at the King Soopers grocery store  in Boulder, CO. As we approach its 1-year anniversary, we honor the 10  Coloradans whose lives were cut tragically short in this senseless act  of gun violence. They leave behind children, spouses, parents, friends,  and a Boulder community that will always carry the grief of their loss.   They will never forget the 10 victims and neither should America. So  today, we read their names into the Congressional Record.   Denny Stong was 20 years old and a graduate of Fairview High School.  He was an introverted, smart kid who loved history and model airplanes.  He had been covering shifts at the King Soopers and took enormous pride  in his role as an essential worker during the pandemic. He once posted  on Facebook: ``I can't stay home . . . I am a grocery store worker.''   Neven Stanisic was 23 years old. His dad said he was ``a really good  boy, a good kid . . . a hard-working boy.'' His parents are refugees  from Bosnia who left in the 1990s to escape the war. The reverend at  their local church said, ``His family fled the war . . . They left  everything to save their lives, and came here to have a new start.''   Rikki Olds was 25 years old. She had been working as a manager at  King Soopers for 6 years. Her family described her as a ``firecracker''  who lit up a room with her infectious giggle. Her aunt Lori said, ``She  had a beautiful way of just being her . . . When you're down, she just  wanted to cheer you up, just by being around.''   Tralona Bartkowiak was 49 years old. She co-owned a clothing and  accessories store with her sister and was a  [[Page S1223]]  frequent presence in the Boulder arts and music scene. She had a deep  curiosity about the world that took her on travels from Nepal to Costa  Rica. Her younger brother remembers her as ``a beam of light.''   Teri Leiker was 51 years old. She was a huge fan of the Buffaloes at  CU and was a regular face at the Pearl Street Stampede. A friend called  Teri ``the most selfless, innocent, amazing person I have had the honor  of meeting.''   Suzanne Fountain was 59 years old. She worked for 15 years at Boulder  Community Health. She loved gardening and was passionate about music  and theater. A friend described her as ``the cream of the crop and a  good person, a good soul.''   Kevin Mahoney was 61 years old. He had worked in the hotel business  but retired early to spend more time traveling, skiing, and visiting  his daughter, Erika. After learning of her father's death, Erika wrote,  ``My dad represents all things Love. I'm so thankful he could walk me  down the aisle last summer.''   Lynn Murray was 62 years old, a mother of two, and a retired photo  director for prominent national magazines. Her husband John said, ``I  just want her to be remembered as this amazing, amazing comet spending  62 years flying across the sky.''   Jody Waters was 65 years old. She used to own a boutique clothing  store named Applause on the Pearl Street Mall, where she remembered all  her customers and their favorite brands. She was a mother of two and a  grandmother who loved horses and hiking. A friend said when Jody walked  into the room, ``She was a breath of fresh air, a light.''   Finally, we honor Officer Eric Talley. He was 51 years old, a man of  deep faith, and a devoted father of seven. After losing a close friend  to a DUI, he joined the police academy at age 40 to give back to the  community. In 2013, he made headlines when he helped rescue 11  ducklings from a drainage ditch. Eric's father said he ``loved his kids  and family more than anything.'' For their sake, he was hoping to stay  off the frontlines by learning to become a drone operator. But when the  bullets rang out, he rushed into action, saving countless lives at the  cost of his own. Colorado owes Officer Talley a debt we will never be  able to repay. He and the nine other victims represent the best of our  State.   As we honor the victims' lives, we stand with all who continue to  grieve and the community as it continues to heal. We condemn the  senseless gun violence, not only in Boulder last year, but in far too  many American cities and towns every day. Until no American has to live  in reasonable fear of being gunned down in a school, or a movie  theater, or a grocery store, we have more work to do.                            ____________________
