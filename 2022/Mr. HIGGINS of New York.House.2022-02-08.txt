 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  the Postal Service Reform Act. This legislation would finally eliminate  the requirement for the Postal Service to prefund pension costs 75  years in advance. The mandate is punitive to the post office and to the  people it serves. The unreasonable and unsustainable mandate risks the  affordability of mail delivery for customers and it threatens the  livelihood of hardworking Americans.   The Postal Service employs 630,000 workers nationwide, including  100,000 military veterans, and 6,100 Western New Yorkers. Each and  every day these workers deliver for their communities. We have an  opportunity today to secure the future of one of the most historic and  trusted agencies in the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.                            ____________________
