 Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague,  Representative McClintock, for putting forward a very sensible piece of  legislation.   The Colorado Water Congress, who supports this bill, stated in their  letter:         The economic viability of the State of Colorado is       dependent on safe and reliable water supply. In recent years,       the ability of water managers to meet growth demand and to       create water storage has become more challenging.    In Colorado, the Windy Gap Project, whose formal environmental  permitting process began in 2003, won't see construction start until at  least 2019, with water storage ready by 2022--16 years to permit, 3  years to build.   For too long, Federal agencies have failed to properly coordinate and  time their reviews of water supply project applications, resulting in  missed opportunities for increased water storage during our wetter  seasons.   Water is the lifeblood of Western communities. Without it, most  communities in the Western United States could not survive, so it only  makes sense to store as much of it as we reasonably can during those  wetter years. Yet the Federal Government presents roadblock after  roadblock that prevents a timely and cost-effective completion to many  of these projects.   This legislation will streamline the permitting process and increase  agency accountability by placing the Bureau of Reclamation at the  center of the process and ensuring all other agencies are required to  report to it in a timely fashion.   It is an effective piece of legislation, an effective approach to a  problem that should not exist. I urge my colleagues to support this  measure.
