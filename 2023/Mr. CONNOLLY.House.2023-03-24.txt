 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bob Rota, who  recently retired after 40 years of public service, most recently here  in the House as the enrolling clerk.   Bob began his service as a United States Capitol Police officer  before joining the Clerk's Office in 1987. In his job as enrolling  clerk, Bob oversaw a team of highly skilled professionals responsible  for preparing House-passed legislation throughout the stages of the  process and all the way to its presentation to the President for  signature.   Bob produced high-quality work every single day. As enrolling clerk,  it was his duty to make certain that bills such as the National Defense  Authorization Act, normally over 4,000 pages long, had all amendments  inserted in the correct places and the graphs and charts were accurate,  which is no small task.   Bob's breadth of expertise extended to his encyclopedic knowledge of  House procedures. He could always be counted on to respond to all  questions in a timely and accurate way. Whether he was walking someone  through the minutia of the legislative process or even how to fix a  problem at their home or with their car, Bob was and is an integral  part of the team that supports our legislative work.   Bob looks forward to retirement and spending time with his wife,  children, and grandchildren. I wish Bob and his family many years of a  happy, healthy, and well-earned retirement.   Congratulations, Bob.                            ____________________
