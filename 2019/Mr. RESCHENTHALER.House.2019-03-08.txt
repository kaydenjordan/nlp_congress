 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my condolences on  the recent passing of a true public servant from my district, Greene  County Sheriff, Brian Tennant. All who knew Brian will remember his  devotion to our community. He served as a police officer, emergency  medical technician, and volunteer firefighter. In 2010, Brian risked  his own life to save several others during a terrible house fire in  Waynesburg.   Shortly after this heroic act, Brian learned that he had an  inoperable tumor. Despite this diagnosis and during medical treatment,  Brian continued to serve. In 2014, he started his service as Greene  County Sheriff.   Brian fought his illness for years, all while serving his community.  He was a devoted husband and father of four sons. I am proud to have  met Brian, and my thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones during  this difficult time.                            ____________________
