 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Maj. Nick Oltman,  U.S. Marine Corps, for his outstanding work on behalf of the people of  Maine and the Nation as a 2023 Department of Defense legislative fellow  serving in my Washington, DC, office. Over the past year, Nick has been  integral in shaping my foreign policy and defense priorities. He helped  secure several provisions in the fiscal year 2024 National Defense  Authorization Act--FY24 NDAA--that will make our country stronger and  safer. Nick led my staff in orchestrating important appropriations for  the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Homeland  Security, U.S. Coast Guard, and the Office of National Drug Control  Policy. His contributions to office morale and our collective work  product are emblematic of his good character, competence, and strong  work ethic.   Throughout his tenure in my Office, Nick demonstrated a level of  professionalism and hard work I have come to expect--but not take for  granted--from Department of Defense legislative fellows. Indeed, he  follows a long line of accomplished military officers who have made  impactful contributions to my office and U.S. national security policy.  Over the year, Nick prepared and advised me on wide-ranging and complex  matters under consideration before the Senate Armed Services Committee.  His attention to detail served me well; Nick managed over 400  individual authorization and appropriation requests, 455 markup  amendments, and over 900 floor amendments. He brought his cybersecurity  and budget expertise to assist me in the Strategic Forces Subcommittee  briefings and deliberations, which resulted in important funding  authorizations and legislation. He authored and shepherded a provision  in the final act that establishes an artificial intelligence watermark  competition across the private sector and Federal Government. Nick's  outstanding leadership showed in his work with constituents and while  securing legislation to address changes to basic allowance for housing  and oversight of the transition assistance program.   Further, he authored sections of legislative text and report  language, including one of my top concerns regarding hypersonic defense  and securing important funding for advanced research impacting Maine  from Aroostook to York County. In addition, he became my go-to lead for  monitoring the horrific wars in Ukraine and Israel, providing clear- headed and thoughtful analysis, and liaised with representatives from  the White House, State Department, and Department of Defense to convey  my positions and concerns. His candor and honest assessments provided  critical insights during this fraught time in U.S. history, and our  Nation is better because of it.   On behalf of my colleagues in the U.S. Congress, I extend my deepest  gratitude to Major Oltman for his unwavering dedication to my staff,  the State of Maine, the U.S. Marine Corps, and our Nation. The  greatness of the U.S. military is built on the service and sacrifice of  servicemembers like Major Oltman. His commitment is not a solitary  endeavor, and I want to acknowledge the support of his family: his wife  Meghan and his son Sean. I wish them all the best as they embark on  what I am certain is a bright future.                            ____________________
