 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent in the House  Chamber for rollcall votes 72 through 78 on Wednesday, February 14,  2018. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall votes  74, 75, and 76, and ``nay'' on rollcall votes 72, 73, 77, and 78.                            ____________________
