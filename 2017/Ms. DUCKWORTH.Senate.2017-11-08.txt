 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland for  his thoughtful words on North Korea.   I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to oppose the  nomination of William Wehrum to lead the Office of Air and Radiation at  the EPA.   If confirmed, Mr. Wehrum would be responsible for implementing  critical programs like the Renewable Fuel Standard Program and other  key public health standards under the Clean Air Act.   Mr. Wehrum is part of a larger trend within President Trump's  administration. Many of the nominees who are being sworn in are  unqualified, incompetent, and have actually built their careers on  dismantling the agencies they are now leading.   To be clear, Mr. Wehrum's nomination represents yet another broken  promise by President Trump--this time, to our Nation's farmers. As a  candidate, Mr. Trump pledged to champion the RFS, a policy with broad  bipartisan support that reduces our greenhouse gas emissions, helps us  revive rural economies, and makes our Nation less dependent on foreign  oil.   Yet the President continues to surround himself with advisers intent  on sabotaging the RFS, like Scott Pruitt, Carl Icahn, and, now, Mr.  Wehrum. Mr. Wehrum has proven, time and again, that he is not a friend  of the Renewable Fuel Standard Program.   He sued the biofuels industries--not once, not twice, not three  times, but at least four times--representing groups like the American  Petroleum Institute which are strong opponents of the RFS. During his  nomination hearings, Mr. Wehrum refused to commit to supporting the  RFS, claiming he was ``unfamiliar'' with the program. He wouldn't even  acknowledge the unprecedented attacks launched on the biofuel  industries by this administration.    If you support the RFS, as Illinois farmers and I do, it should be  obvious that the right thing to do is to oppose Mr. Wehrum. This is not  about having blanket opposition to President Trump's nominees; this is  about our national security, our rural communities, and our  environment.   I have already fought a war over oil, and I would rather run my car  on American-grown corn and soybeans than oil from the Middle East. Our  farmers deserve better than a President who makes campaign promises to  protect the RFS in Iowa but will not honor them when he gets to the  White House.   I understand that Administrator Pruitt has written a letter to my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle regarding a pending petition  requesting to move the ``point of obligation'' and a rulemaking on  renewable volumetric obligations. Both of these decisions, as  Administrator Pruitt's letter states, will be final in the coming days.  That is why I am calling on my colleagues to simply hold Mr. Wehrum's  nomination until after EPA finalizes these decisions.   There is no rush to confirm Mr. Wehrum this week. Better yet, let's  oppose his nomination altogether.   I am also concerned that he will gut key public health protections  that we all rely on to protect our families and the air we breathe. One  of the most serious responsibilities I have, as both a U.S. Senator and  a mother, is to protect children and families from harmful pollutants  and to make sure the air they breathe is safe from toxic chemicals.   After reviewing Bill Wehrum's previous work in the Office of Air and  Radiation, it is clear that he made dismantling the Clean Air Act--and  all of the air pollution safeguards and public health protections  guaranteed by it--one of his top priorities. In that office, he  actively fought to roll back commonsense safeguards against lead, fine  particulate pollution, and ozone smog. But he didn't stop there. He  even led efforts to weaken standards designed to reduce emissions of  mercury--one of the most deadly, toxic pollutants in the world--from  coal-fired powerplants. Bill Wehrum wasn't looking out for us; he was  looking out for the fossil fuel industry.   When Mr. Wehrum was originally nominated for this position under the  Bush administration, the Senate had the good sense to reject his  nomination. He was never confirmed, and I hope we do not confirm him  now.   Again, I urge all my colleagues to oppose Mr. Wehrum's nomination  and, instead, support our farmers, our children, and our families.   Thank you.    Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the  Union League Club of Chicago ULCC, and their Salute to Vietnam Veterans  event.   As a Nation, we must do everything we can to uphold our commitment to  those who have worn the uniform of this great Nation and to their  families who have made significant sacrifices on our behalf. On  Veterans Day we honor the service of our Nation's heroes and reflect on  the debt that we each owe to those who have served this great Nation.   Founded during the Civil War, ULCC has been a leader in providing  support for servicemembers and veterans for over 138 years. ULCC, an  official DoD Commemorative Partner, operates its own American Legion  Posts and collaborates with partner groups that provide support to  Active-Duty military personnel. ULCC recognizes that, while  servicemembers may come from different backgrounds and different  branches, they all hold the same sense of duty and commitment and  deserve our full support.   As the daughter of a U.S. marine who fought in Vietnam, our Vietnam  veterans hold a special place in my heart. I often say that we must  always love the warrior regardless of our feelings about the war. Let  us recommit our obligation to Vietnam veterans by ensuring that they  have the healthcare, disability support, retirement benefits, and any  other resources they have earned.   To all of my fellow veterans, to those still serving, and to all the  families that have sacrificed, thank you from the bottom of my heart  for your honorable service.   Thank you.                            ____________________
