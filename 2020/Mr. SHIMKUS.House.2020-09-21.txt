 Madam Speaker, Ms. Julie Fisher is our nominee to be the  U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Belarus. A confirmation vote is  scheduled for tomorrow in the committee. Once confirmed, she leaves for  her post. Upon arrival, she is to present her credentials to the duly  elected President of the Republic of Belarus.   Today, I am calling upon President Trump and Secretary of State Mike  Pompeo to ensure that these credentials be presented to the duly  elected President of the Republic of Belarus, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.   A republic is a government having a chief of state who is not a  monarch or a dictator and who, in modern times, is a president duly  elected by the people. Svetlana clearly won the election, and her  massive support continues to show itself by the peaceful protests  numbering over 100,000 citizens.   Another option would be for her to present her credentials to the  governing council, which will help transition the country to fair and  free elections within 6 months.   Madam Speaker, I call upon all of our democratic allies to do the  same.                            ____________________
