 Mr. Speaker, America is keeping kids in cages. America  is keeping kids in cages.   Many people across our country have risen to say that this is not who  we are. It doesn't represent our values, our ideals, or our  Constitution.   But the sad reality is that today, this is who we are. You are an  American. I am an American. It is fellow Americans who are ripping  toddlers from their mothers and fathers and guarding them in steel  cages.   And in truth, we have done this before. We herded American Indians  into reservations. We turned our backs on Jews fleeing for their lives  from the Holocaust. We ripped children from their parents when we sold  them as slaves.   But we all thought we had learned our lessons, moved past those  hateful times. We have been on a march to grow into a country with the  courage to live up to our values and serve as a beacon of hope for the  world, not repeat the darkest parts of our history.   The families in these detention centers aren't fleeing to the U.S. to  take our jobs, they are running for their lives. They are fleeing a  world of racism, ransom, murder, where their sons are being forced into  violent gangs, and their daughters are being stolen on their way to  school and prostituted as sex slaves.   A nation that fails to learn the lessons of history, that fails to  live up to its core values, that can't abide by the rights enshrined in  its own Constitution, is not strong, Mr. Speaker, it is weak.   Today, we are stealing kids from their parents and we are weak.   And although it is this administration's policy that is directly  responsible for this disgusting practice, we are all guilty as fellow  Americans so long as it goes on.   Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These are our core  values. Let's live up to them today.                            ____________________
