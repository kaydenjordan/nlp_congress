 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative    Michael Burgess, who has been my bipartisan partner in this effort to  affect positively those individuals who suffer from sickle cell anemia.   The Davis-Burgess amendment will add $2 million to the Centers for  Disease Control's National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental  Disabilities' Public Health Approach to Blood Disorders account to fund  a surveillance program in sickle cell disease and reduce the  administration account in the Office of the Secretary of Health and  Human Service's account by a similar amount.   This same bipartisan amendment was offered last year by me,  Representative Burgess, Representative Butterfield, and passed a roll  call vote of 410-12, 410 yes, 12 noes.   I urge passage because what it does is set up a separate account for  sickle cell anemia in the National Institutes of Health. It has no  bearing on the budget, and I urge passage.
