 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to  me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative Act's reauthorization.   As has been mentioned before, I think, the Great Lakes represent 21  percent of the world's surface freshwater.   I am glad to see so many of my colleagues from the Great Lakes region  here, but, really, all of us and the rest of the world have a stake in  this.   The Great Lakes provide drinking water for 45 million Americans.                                time  1430    The lakes support one of the world's largest regional economies  through agriculture, industry, fishing, and recreation.   For thousands of plants and animal species and millions of Americans,  the Great Lakes are vital for life, and are our national treasure.   I wanted to say, this is really personal for me. The eastern border  of my district, running from Chicago to the northern suburbs, is Lake  Michigan. I live just a few blocks from the lake myself and have spent  every summer of my childhood on the beach in Indiana enjoying the lake.   But we are threatened right now by climate change and pollution. Last  year, the Midwest saw record flooding, worsening storms, harmful  runoff, and toxic algae blooms that threaten drinking water and  infrastructure.   Actually, we saw thousands of Americans who couldn't drink the water  because of that algae bloom. And in my hometown of Evanston, beaches  are closing or actually disappearing entirely because the levels of the  lake are at record highs right now.   Just last month, these record water levels destroyed lakefront paths,  and I was getting calls from condominium owners who were worried about  their buildings getting--not demolished--but certainly damaged because  of the high lake waters.   New estimates from the Army Corps of Engineers state that the lake  levels could get even higher next year, and we are watching for that  with great distress.   The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is absolutely essential to  restoring the health and unpolluting the lake and protecting the  grandeur of our lakes.   This is a bipartisan piece of legislation. People on both sides of  the aisle are down here speaking eloquently about the meaning of the  Great Lakes to them, and it is really refreshing, I think, for all of  us to be able to join hands together asking for the reauthorization of  the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to  me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2382, the USPS  Fairness Act.   The United States Postal Service is an essential part of American  life. It was established more than 231 years ago and has delivered on  its promise every one of those years.   Benjamin Franklin was the first Postmaster General in the United  States. And they have--while I understand it is not an official slogan,  I think we have all heard this: ``Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor  gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their  appointed mission.''   So we know that with more than 100 billion pieces of mail delivered  each year, and a 90 percent approval rating, that we must do all that  we can to support them.   Today, Members of Congress are taking the important step to help  support over seven million U.S. postal workers across the country.   Since 2006, U.S. postal employees have been forced to prefund retiree  health benefits 75 years in advance, making them the only government  agency that must prefund future employees that have not been born yet.   This ridiculous law has caused the U.S. Postal Service to lose  billions of dollars each year and has caused postal employees'  uncertainty in their work. This cannot continue.   So I agree with over 300 of my colleagues that we must reverse this  absurd policy. The United States Postal Service Fairness Act will  repeal the prefunding that is mandated and allow the United States  Postal Service to return to its pay-as-you-go system as used before.    Madam Speaker, I want to definitely thank my  colleague from Michigan and also my colleague from Massachusetts for  being here to support workers.   I believe that it is the labor movement that brought us the middle  class. The height was really after World War II, where we saw that  wages were going up for everyone--the wealthiest, the middle class,  poor people could get jobs that would get them out of poverty--and the  labor movement, the right of workers to organize, made the difference,  to fight together, work together for better wages and working  conditions.   So, today, I rise in enthusiastic support before the House of  Representatives for H.R. 2474, the Protect the Right to Organize Act,  for a vote that is going to take place tomorrow in the House of  Representatives.   The right to form a union, which has been eroded over the last  several decades, and the right to take collective action in the  workplace and the right to exercise one's First Amendment rights in the  form of secondary boycotts are fundamental, and it is past time that we  as Americans promote their values.   For too long, employers have been able to violate the National Labor  Relations Act with impunity, routinely denying workers their basic  right to join with coworkers for fairness on the job. As a result, the  collective strength of workers to negotiate for better pay and for  better benefits has eroded, and income inequality in the United States  of America has reached levels that predate the Great Depression.    What is worse is that this is a rather predictable outcome. It is not  surprising if workers don't have the right to organize that their wages  are not going to go up.   But I want to share a story. It is a story of a woman named Yiran  Zhang. She is a graduate worker at Loyola College in my district, in  Chicago, Loyola Chicago.   Yiran Zhang's parents raised their child to be a believer that  education was the path to a better life. They moved to the United  States from China when she was almost 2 years old. So she has grown up  here. Her parents moved to the United States to earn their Ph.D.'s and  work as graduate workers.  [[Page H842]]    Years later, Yiran decided to follow in her parents' footsteps by  pursuing a Ph.D. The philosophy major quickly learned that a lot has  changed in the world since her parents were graduate workers like she  is now.         We're struggling to make a living. The expectations are the       same, but the conditions in higher education are so       different.    The expectations of the job, she means, are the same.   She says:         As a graduate worker, I've had to miss paying bills, to       skip doctor's appointments, and even work two or three       additional jobs to cover living expenses. I'm fighting for a       union because I know it is only by standing together with my       colleagues that we can change any of this.    So Yiran and other Loyola graduate workers came together to form a  union to make improvements in the school's administration. They found  that the administration actually dismissed them and used the legal  system to fight their efforts.   Yiran sees unions as the only way for graduate workers to be heard. I  actually stood with them at a demonstration, and she said:         I've seen that the only way that we've been able to get our       administration to listen is by doing sit-ins and walkouts and       taking action together. Teachers across the country and       people who work at things like Stop & Shop have had the same       experience.    In addition to having a seat at the table, Loyola graduate workers  are fighting for a higher stipend and the establishment of summer  funding, which will give them the ability to do important research and  writing over the summer instead of having to take on multiple part-time  jobs just to make ends meet. They also want more professional support,  including clear grievance procedures and accountability.   So, for young women like Yiran, the ability to join and unionize  would mean that she would be able to truly build on the foundations  started by her parents. She says:         I am fighting for a living wage, respect for my labor, and       a better life. I shouldn't have to seek outside work up to 30       hours a week on top of my graduate worker hours just to make       ends meet at the cost of finishing my program on time or       being the best scholar and educator that I can be. Academia       shouldn't be just for the privileged. Negotiating a fair       contract with graduate workers is the first step toward       addressing these harmful systemic issues.    I am going to quit. I have taken more than my time, I think. But I  wanted to give you a true-life example of a woman who is trying to do  her best in her job as a student worker, as a graduate worker, and  because she can't organize, she can't get the benefits and the wages  that she deserves. This is typical of what is going on in our country  and is creating the income inequality that we see right now.
