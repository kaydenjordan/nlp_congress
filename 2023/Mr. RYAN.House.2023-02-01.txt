 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring voice to my constituents  who have been screwed over and ripped off by our utility company,  Central Hudson.  [[Page H583]]    My colleagues here may never have heard of Central Hudson, but the  people of the Hudson Valley know them all too well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the farmer in Ulster Park, New York,  who received such a massive utility bill, $16,585, 17 times her normal  bill, that she actually contemplated suicide. She described the debt,  which put her at risk of losing her family farm, as a guillotine  hanging over her head.   I rise for the single mother in Kingston who told me she is afraid to  cook for her four kids because turning on the stove means facing a  gigantic gas bill.   For the mayor of our city of Newburgh, who received a bill of  $708,000 for a single month of electricity at his three-bedroom family  home; for senior citizens on a fixed income who had their entire  checking accounts wiped out by an autopay withdrawal.   I could tell hundreds more of these stories and still not scratch the  surface of this incredible corporate ineptitude.   Mr. Speaker, we rely on our public utilities for a necessary service.  They exist for the public good. They are built on a foundation of  public trust.   Central Hudson, and its CEO, Mr. Charles Freni, have irrevocably  broken this trust. Since my calls for an investigation into Central  Hudson's disastrous billing practices almost a year ago, we have  received more than 11,000 formal complaints. A New York State  Department of Public Service report revealed Central Hudson's billing  system was riddled with hundreds of programming errors, leading to  nearly 5,000 customers not receiving their bills, 8,000 customers  overcharged, and more than 30,000 customers whose autopay was billed  incorrectly, costing them over $16 million.   I want to be clear. I do not fault the hardworking employees of  Central Hudson. They begged for additional training. They suggested  improvements to this system. They worked hours and hours of overtime.  They wanted to do the right thing for the people of the Hudson Valley,  but Central Hudson and its CEO clearly did not.   Just 2 weeks ago in response to this devastating Public Service  Commission report documenting their systemic failures, Central Hudson  doubled-down on their deflection, their denial, and their deception.  Rather than taking ownership of their failures, they claimed that no  customers were overcharged and that nobody lost any money.   Give me a break.   Central Hudson's leadership deliberately chose to sweep these  problems under the rug. Why?   Because now owned by a multibillion-dollar and multinational  corporation, they chose to put profits over people. At the same time as  customers'--my constituents'--bills were skyrocketing and bank accounts  were literally being emptied out, their revenues were up over 30  percent and their profits--surprise, surprise--they are up, too.   Central Hudson has had opportunity after opportunity to own their  mistakes and take accountability, but time and again they have failed  to do so.   Mr. Speaker, there is simply no excuse for this. At a time when our  families are facing tremendous economic pressure, the last thing they  need to worry about is their bank accounts being emptied out just  because they tried to power their home.   Because of these failures and because of Central Hudson's continued  unwillingness to take accountability, today I am calling on Central  Hudson's CEO, Mr. Charles Freni, to do the right thing for our  community and to resign.   We need a new leader who will come in, improve service, finally fix  these systemic problems, and start the critical work to rebuild trust  with our community. That is what the people of the Hudson Valley  deserve.                            ____________________
