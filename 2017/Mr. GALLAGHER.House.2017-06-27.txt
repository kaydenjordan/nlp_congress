 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  for his leadership on this critical issue.   As was laid out, communities across this country, communities like  mine in northeast Wisconsin, are in the midst of a public health  crisis. It is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. It is an American  issue, one that should bring us all together.   Opioid abuse is wreaking havoc on our homes, our schools, our  churches. Its devastating effects are destroying our families and the  lives of our loved ones.   As was pointed out, more Americans will have died from drug overdoses  in 2017 than there are names on the Vietnam War Memorial. That is  alarming. That should put it into sharp relief.   As a Marine veteran, I am acutely aware that servicemembers are more  susceptible than the average person to addiction. In fact, veterans die  from accidental drug overdoses at a 33 percent higher rate than the  rest of the population, and something must be done to reverse this  awful trend.   I commend our State lawmakers in Wisconsin who are doing aggressive  work on this front, and I commend the gentleman and everyone who has  spoken out for doing the same thing at the national level, and I look  forward to working with him.   Because headline after headline reminds us of the tragic loss of life  that has resulted from our Nation's opioid and addictions risk, we have  to step up. We have to take action.
