 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1053, I call up the bill (H.R. 6395) to authorize appropriations for  fiscal year 2021 for military activities of the Department of Defense  and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel  strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 6395.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have before us today the National Defense  Authorization  [[Page H3317]]  Act for Fiscal Year 2021. It is an important piece of legislation that  we have done every year for 59 consecutive years. We are going for 60  this year.   It is incredibly important that the United States Congress, the House  and the Senate, exercise our oversight over the Department of Defense  and our national security budget and priorities, and this bill reflects  that.   I want to start by thanking a lot of people who have done an enormous  amount of work to make this possible. We started in committee a couple  of weeks ago. We had over 650 amendments submitted to the original mark  of the chairman and the subcommittee marks. We processed those  amendments and actually adopted 475 amendments in committee.   I want to thank our staff more than I possibly can for the incredible  amount of work that they did to go through all of those amendments, to  work with Members, to work with various interested parties to get us to  that product. I am very pleased that we were able to get that done, and  we passed the bill out of the Armed Services Committee unanimously, 56- 0, with broad support.   At this point, I want to thank the ranking member of the committee,  Mr. Thornberry, for his incredible leadership during this process. He  has been a terrific partner, both when he was chairman of the committee  and now that he is the ranking member of the committee.   As all of you know, this will be his last NDAA, as he is retiring  from Congress. I want to once again thank him for his great work and  his great leadership and really emphasize a point that I have made  many, many times.   The Armed Services Committee works in a bipartisan way and produces a  legislative product in a manner that I think should be an example for  all of Congress. That does not happen by accident. It happens because  of leadership.   When Mr. Thornberry became chairman of the committee and I was  ranking member, Mac showed that leadership from the very start. He  understood the priority of getting the bill done and of working in a  bipartisan way to do that. Because of that leadership, that example has  been set for the committee, and we have been able to continue to  accomplish that.   I also want to thank the Rules Committee. That is not an easy job in  the best of times, and, as we all know, these are not the best of  times. 752 amendments were submitted to be added to this bill this  year. The Rules Committee had to sift through and process all of those  amendments to produce before you the rule that we all just approved  today.   I thank their staff for doing that incredible work and do want to  pause just one moment to thank the staff for the work they did in light  of COVID-19. We all know that things cannot be run the way they  normally are. We had to make adjustments. The staff in particular had  to make those adjustments just getting our committee hearing room set  up so that we could accommodate a social-distancing markup. It took an  enormous amount of time and technological know-how. The staff did a  fabulous job to get us to this point.   I guess what I am saying is it is no accident that we are here. A lot  of work went to get us to the point to have what I think is an  excellent product.   Again, we can't forget the central premise behind this product, and  that is to support our national security policy and to make sure that  the men and women who serve in our military, whom we assign with the  task of implementing that policy, have the tools and training and  equipment that they need to perform whatever tasks we ask them to do.   We can and should have a robust debate about what those jobs should  be, what our national security priorities are, what we should fund,  what we should do. But something we should never disagree on is the  idea that whatever that is that we decide, the troops, the men and  women who are charged with implementing it, are well equipped,  protected, and supported in carrying out that mission. And that is what  we attempt to do.   This year's bill had agreement from last year's budget agreement on  our top-line budget of $741 billion. I think that was a good agreement  that we reached on the defense and nondefense discretionary budget.   And I will say, going forward, this is one of the greatest challenges  that we are going to face. We had a difficult budget environment before  COVID-19. It is even more difficult now. We are going to have to make  some very difficult choices in the decade ahead about what to fund, not  just to meet our national security priorities, but to meet all of our  priorities within that budget context.   I do want to thank the Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, for his  leadership in this regard. The Pentagon has gone to great lengths to do  a bottom-up review, to really take a hard look at where they are  spending money and to find savings, sometimes in the tens of billions  of dollars. That type of effort is going to have to be ongoing, going  forward, if we are going to be able to have a rational national  security policy.   I also want to commend a number of the Members in our committee who  have worked to really focus on diversity in this year's bill. I  believe, in addition to the COVID-19 challenge that we face, the  reckoning that we have as a country for the historic racism,  discrimination, and bigotry that we have wrestled with, it is  enormously important that we address that. This is society-wide, but  within the Department of Defense there are issues to work on there as  well.    We fund, to the tune of $17 million, aggressive efforts to increase  the relationship between the Department of Defense and historically  Black colleges and universities, to create and grow the pipeline of  diversity into the Department of Defense, jobs both civilian and Active  Duty.   We also have now created a chair of diversity within DOD, whose job  it is to look and make sure that we are, in fact, hiring and promoting  people in a way that is equitable, and we have also set aside a special  inspector general to examine that question.   Also, thanks to the leadership of Congressman Anthony Brown and  Congresswoman Jackie Speier, amongst others, we are looking at how the  UCMJ is implemented. Is it being implemented in a way that is fair and  unbiased.   These are all efforts to create the diversity that we need within our  Armed Forces and the diversity we need within our society.   Overall, I am very, very pleased with this product. And more than  anything, I am pleased with the people who worked together to put it  together in a bipartisan way.   There are a lot of diverse opinions, not just Republican and  Democrat, but within each party. As Mr. Thornberry will attest, we are  not all the same within our own parties. Even with that diversity, we  were able to work together and produce what I think is an excellent  product that we should all be proud to support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Hon. Carolyn B. Maloney,      Chairwoman, Committee on Oversight and Reform, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ms. Chairwoman: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 6395, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2021. I agree that the Committee on Oversight and Reform       has valid jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this       important legislation, and I am most appreciative of your       decision not to request a referral in the interest of       expediting consideration of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), the chair of the Tactical Air  and Land Forces Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maine (Mr. Golden), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader  of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Again, I urge Members to support this bill. I want to emphasize a  point that a number of folks have made about the process, which sounds  a little bland and a little bit dry, but that is actually how we  produce such an excellent product, and I think it is a good model for  how Congress should function.   We debate issues. We take amendments from a wide and diverse group of  people, and in so doing, the product gets better. We get the ideas, the  benefit of the talents and the experience of everybody in Congress.   We work it out where we can. We debate where we can't. Then, we vote,  and we move the process forward.   I think it is really, really important that the institution continues  to function in that way. A number of institutions in our country, many  that we have taken for granted for a long time, are under an enormous  amount of pressure. It is very important to have coherent stability in  the institutions of government.   That is something that I know Mr. Thornberry prioritized during his  service on the committee. It is something we all prioritize, to show  people, as Mac pointed out, the system works--yes, the men and women  who serve in our military, clearly, but everybody.   It is a good thing when we get together and have these debates and  create a legislative product, and I urge Members to support this  product.   In closing, I want to emphasize one point that has come up a number  of times, and that is the importance of alliances and partnerships to  our national security and to what the Department of Defense does. This  bill has a number of provisions to strengthen that: support for NATO;  support for our relationship with South Korea; support for the creation  of an Indo-Pacific defense initiative, which is building upon the idea  that we did with the European Defense Initiative. The goal there is to  build the partnerships necessary to maintain our national security  interests globally and, hopefully, without having to rely on the  military.   I know a number of my colleagues on this side of the aisle are  concerned about how the U.S. has used its military over the years, and  I don't disagree with that. The military should not be the first or  primary tool of U.S. foreign policy and national security. But if that  is to be the case, we need to build the partner capacity of allies  throughout Europe and Asia.   That is what this bill, I believe, reflects, that desire to give us  peace by deterring our adversaries through a system of interlocking  alliances. I think that is incredibly important.   Before I close, I do want to address the issues. Concerns have been  raised about some of the amendments.   One particular concern is that there are some amendments that aren't  necessarily within our jurisdiction. As the one bill that passes every  year, this is not an unusual occurrence. I will point out that even  when the Republicans were in the majority, we frequently had amendments  that were outside the jurisdiction of our committee, including in the  lands area.   Who can forget the lesser prairie chicken and the years after years  that we fought over that? That, too, is part of this process, and I  hope, however that comes out, it will not, in any way, undermine the  incredible bipartisan work that has been done on the bill and, gosh,  the nearly 1,500 provisions that will be reflected in that bill once we  get done here.   I think whatever disagreements there may be on a few amendments  coming forward, the best thing that we can do for this institution, for  this committee, for the way the legislative process is supposed to  work, and, as all of us have said, most importantly, for the men and  women who are serving in our military, we show them that we support the  defense bill. We support them. We support what they do.   We have worked together to produce an excellent product that is  worthy of the support of every Member of this body. I urge everyone to  vote ``yes.''   Again, I thank everyone who was involved in the process.   Lastly, I want to close by joining my colleagues in recognizing the  life of   John Lewis. He brought honor to this country. He lived a life  that made us all feel better about where we live.   I think the thing that I will always remember about John is, gosh, he  lived a very tough life. He took on tough fights, but he did it with  joy. You never saw John Lewis get really down. He always had this joy  about him, even in the face of some unbelievable injustice.   He did not hate his enemies. He didn't attack them. He stood up for  what was right.   I hope we can all learn from that lesson and build upon it, bringing  this country together and deal with the challenges that we face now as  he dealt with the challenges that he faced during his life.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I fear this debate is going to  come down to a difference of opinion on tax. My staff and I have looked  at this very, very carefully. This does not restrict us from what we  are currently doing, and it is the position of this sponsor and myself  that we need to make sure our stockpile is safe and usable, and we have  an adequate deterrent. We do not need to do live nuclear testing.   Mr. Speaker, the reason we are concerned about this is because the  Senate has actually put $10 million into their version of this defense  bill to do precisely that. So, there are some who apparently think this  would be a good idea.   We want to make it clear: We don't think it is a good idea to do live  nuclear testing. Keep doing what you are doing. That is fine. Collect  your stockpile. We don't need to be setting off nuclear weapons again.   In this regard, what Russia and China are doing is beside the point.  It is not in our best interest to do this. If they think it is in their  best interests to do live testing, I would disagree with that.   This doesn't help protect us. It endangers people unnecessarily.   I know we are going to get into a debate over the actual language  here, but be clear on what this amendment does.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment allows us to  continue doing what we are already doing to preserve and protect our  nuclear deterrent. It simply says: You can't go setting off nuclear  weapons again. It doesn't work. It doesn't help. And it is  extraordinarily dangerous.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me associate  myself with Ms. Jayapal's remarks. I completely agree with everything  she said.   I have an enormous amount of respect for Mr. Thornberry, but I  disagree with the premise of part of what he said. Part of what he said  is absolutely right. We should exercise our independent judgment and  not simply rubber-stamp what the Pentagon asks us for, but I don't see  how having them give us even more of what they want somehow better  enables us to exercise our independent judgment.   It is the Pentagon who is sending us what ``their priorities are.'' I  think we should be absolutely skeptical of whatever they sent us. But  to say, ``Look, you get to ask for $740 billion, and then you can ask  for even more,'' that somehow that makes it easier for us to exercise  independent judgment, independent of what the Pentagon wants, sort of  stands logic on its head.   Make no mistake about it, there is one and only one reason for this  law. It is because there are some who believe that no matter what you  spend on the Pentagon and defense spending, you could always spend  more. They are trying to push us down that road toward more, which is  wrong because it is a waste. But it is also wrong because it is bad for  national security.   We need to make choices, not imagine that the budget is unlimited.  That is what this does, and it should go away.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1053, I offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Craig).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Carbajal), who is a member of the Armed  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Haaland), a member of the Committee on  Armed Services.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Malinowski).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the en bloc  package, as well as the NDAA upon final passage, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment requires the  Federal officers to identify themselves. That is the primary purpose of  this amendment, not to limit the President.   We see what is going on in Portland right now, which is deeply  disturbing for people in the military. We have people who are wearing  fatigues, who appear to be U.S. military to the casual observer. They  are not U.S. military. This undermines the credibility of our military  to have people out there pretending to be them when they are not.   What this amendment requires is, if you are going to use this law,  identify yourself.   It is deeply disturbing to the U.S. military to have people,  effectively, impersonating them. They should clearly identify who they  are working for if they are acting under the law of the United States.     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1053, I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Schrier).    Mr. Speaker, I also support en bloc package  No. 2, urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.
