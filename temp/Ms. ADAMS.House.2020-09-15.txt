 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Fudge)  for yielding and for her incredible leadership on this issue.   It has been 66 years since the Brown v. Board of Education decision  when this country took a step toward making amends for its legacy of  oppression and discrimination against African Americans. But  policymakers haven't always done the work necessary to make the  promises of Brown a reality.   After years of gains, the last three decades have been marked by  increased racial isolation for Black and Brown students.   Since 1988, the percentage of schools where less than 10 percent of  the student body is White has increased from 6 to 18 percent. More than  half of our Nation's schoolchildren are in districts where over 75  percent of students look just like them.   So, I am happy that today, after 30 years of backsliding, the House  will take a vote to live up to the legacy of Brown.   The Strength in Diversity Act is as good as its name. It will restore  the government's commitment to school desegregation and to ensuring  that every child receives equal opportunity because as Brown told us,  separate is inherently unequal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to help this Nation live up to  those ideals by voting in support of the Strength in Diversity Act. I  thank my colleague from Ohio for bringing this bill forward.                                time  1345
