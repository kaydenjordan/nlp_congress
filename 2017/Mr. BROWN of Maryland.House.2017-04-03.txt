 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the  Fairmont Heights Hornets for winning their first State basketball  championship in 36 years.   After trailing by as much as 9 points, the Hornets, under the  leadership of Coach Chuck Henry, won the 1A boys State title by a score  of 65-52. The team of young scholars was resilient, played hard, and  never panicked.   Credit is due to Coach Henry, who has taken his team to the State  championship after only 2 years on the job. He is a role model, had  high expectations for his students, and constantly pushed them to play  better on the court and achieve more in the classroom. Throughout the  season, Coach Henry never lost faith in his young team.   Mr. Speaker, the students on the winning Fairmont Heights team may  not go on to play in the NCAA or the NBA, but the memories of this  moment, the bonds they have built, and the lessons they have developed  will stay with them for a lifetime.   Fairmont Heights High School has a proud legacy. When it opened its  doors in 1950, it was only one of two high schools in the State of  Maryland for African Americans. Now, nearly 70 years later, the school  has made history again. This team has made Prince George's County and  the entire Fourth Congressional District very proud.   Go, Hornets.                            ____________________
