 Mr. Speaker, as a Clinton County native, I rise today in  honor of the 2021 Division IV Ohio high school football State champion,  the Clinton-Massie Falcons.   On December 3, 2021, the Clinton-Massie Falcons defeated the  Youngstown Ursuline Irish in a thrilling comeback victory that one  would expect to see in a movie.   Trailing 28-7 late in the third quarter, the Falcons kept their poise  and refused to be denied. They shut down the Irish offense while  scoring on three straight possessions. The Falcon's final touchdown  came on a fourth and goal from the 1-yard line with under 1 minute to  play.   With the score 28-27, the team didn't think twice when given the  choice. They went for 2 points and the win to bring home the school's  third State championship in just under 10 years.   To Coach Dan McSurley and every player on the Falcon roster,  congratulations. As a former captain of the East Clinton Astro football  team, I understand the obstacles that you have had to overcome to earn  this title. You have made our county proud and proven that hard work  and determination truly pay off.                            ____________________
