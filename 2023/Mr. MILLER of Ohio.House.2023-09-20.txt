 Madam Speaker, I rise to speak about the ongoing  brutal and unjust war that is still wreaking havoc in Eastern Europe to  this day and about America's role.   Make no mistake, Vladimir Putin is an evil tyrant whose brutal army  is devastating the people of Ukraine. Like many others, I look forward  to seeing him in The Hague.   My position on providing aid to Ukraine has been clear. Ukraine  should have the tools it needs to win this war, its war, with the help  of other countries, not just the United States.   The United States, especially with the American President, who holds  many of these powers, absolutely cannot provide a blank check without  robust oversight and something else that has been lacking: a clear  strategy to end America's involvement.   Before I became a Member of this House, the previous Congress gave  the Biden administration the resources it needed to help the Ukrainians  end their war. However, the piecemeal approach taken by this  administration has prolonged, rather than ended, the fight.   Frankly, just like former President Trump has said, the United States  of America has the tools to end this war in 24 hours, bring that thug  Putin to the table, stop the killing of innocent civilians, and allow  Ukraine to maintain its independence.   I believe the American people, as well as the Ukrainians fighting on  the front lines, have little use, if any, for weak and ill-equipped  weaponry that simply prolongs the war rather than bringing it to an end  once and for all.   A piecemeal approach to helping Ukraine is wasting taxpayer dollars,  and I do not know anyone who is in favor of wasting American tax  dollars.   What we need is a strategy, oversight, and accountability:   A strategy that explicitly defines what victory looks like so we know  when America's involvement is at an end; oversight so that the American  people know how their tax dollars are being spent; and accountability  for this administration's failures to implement these elementary  pillars of decisionmaking.   Another far-reaching, multi-billion-dollar supplement without these  three key tenets is not what the American people want or deserve.  Frankly, it is not what the Ukrainians want either.   The Ukrainians have taken significant steps to restore accountability  to their government and weed out corruption, so I believe they  understand just how important a transparency is.   Madam Speaker, Ukraine can end this war, Ukrainians can have peace,  the innocent killings of civilians at the evil hands of an evil  dictator can stop. We can share the tools Ukrainians need without  depleting our own capabilities. However, the United States cannot be  drawn into another forever war without a meaningful strategy that  defines how we know when it is over. We cannot put American  servicemembers in harm's way, and we certainly cannot waste taxpayer  dollars.   We were supposed to learn this lesson after Vietnam, and, instead, we  ended up with a 20-year war in Afghanistan. We cannot make the same  mistake again.   Madam Speaker, I represent one of the largest Ukrainian-American  populations in the House of Representatives. My constituents are  Americans who are the family members of Ukrainian soldiers. They are  Americans who are faith leaders, and some are even first-generation  Ukrainian Americans. All of them are grateful for the American  assistance and that of our allies, and every single one is ready for  this war to come to an end, just as I know so many others are, as well.    It is time for this administration to be up front with the American  people and articulate a coherent strategy to define our end goal.   Let us all work together to commit to saving taxpayer dollars,  increasing crucial oversight of our operations, logistical and tactical  support, and finally commit ourselves to developing the strategy needed  to save innocent lives, help the Ukrainians end their armed conflict,  keep America out of this war, and ensure this does not go on another  day longer.                            ____________________
