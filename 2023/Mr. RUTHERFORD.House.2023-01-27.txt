 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of a giant of a man in Jacksonville and in northeast Florida,  Mr. Harry Frisch.   Many knew Harry as a very savvy businessman and compassionate  philanthropist, but I had the great privilege of getting to know him as  a true friend. Harry was the epitome of the American Dream.   He was born July 5, 1923, in Vienna, Austria, and at age 14, he fled  the Nazi takeover, traveling to Czechoslovakia and then later fleeing  to Israel, where he worked as an auto mechanic and met his loving wife  of 68 years, Lilo.   Harry and Lilo then relocated to Jacksonville--with their two sons,  Ben and Karl--where Harry began working at his mother's fish business  to make ends meet.   Through his diligent work ethic and his warm personality, Harry grew  Beaver Street Fisheries into one of the largest seafood processors and  distributors in the United States.   Harry's joy was contagious. He felt a deep sense of appreciation for  all those who had helped him along the way and made a point of being  authentic with everyone that he interacted with.   That is the attitude that helped him develop deep roots across  northeast Florida and led him to give back wherever and whenever he  could. Harry supported many local nonprofits, like the River Garden  Hebrew Home, and several local hospitals, including the Mayo Clinic,  St. Vincent's Hospital, and Baptist Hospital.   His reputation earned him a multitude of awards, including a place in  the First Coast Business Hall of Fame.   Above all, Harry was a devoted son, brother, husband, father,  grandfather,  [[Page H482]]  and great-grandfather, and he was known to treat his Beaver Street  Fisheries family as part of his very own family. He loved them, and  they loved him.   At 99 years old, Harry lived a life of purpose and faith that sets an  example for us all. His philosophy in life and business was: ``If you  can't handle the business, you don't need to be in the business.''   Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote: The purpose in life is not to be  happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to  have and make some difference that you have lived and lived well.   To the entire Frisch family, I will use Harry's favorite line, ``Let  me put it to you this way'': Harry Frisch lived a life of immense and  positive impact for an unmeasurable number of people. As Ralph Waldo  Emerson would say, he lived well.   On behalf of Florida's Fifth Congressional District, I offer my  prayers and sympathies to the Frisch family and his Beaver Street  Fisheries family. Harry's life and legacy will not be forgotten.                   A Nation Without Borders Is Not a Nation     Mr. Speaker, a nation without borders is not a  nation.   Since President Biden took office, we have seen a record number of  illegal border crossings at our southern border. This has led to more  drugs and fentanyl entering the United States, increased crime, and a  demoralized Border Patrol.   Instead of solving this crisis, the President and House Democrats  have turned a blind eye. They continue to double down on their radical  open borders policy that focuses on processing illegals faster and  moving them throughout the country.   To this President, there is no crisis at the southern border. This is  his policy--until now. We saw the President visit the border for the  first time this month, and now the Biden administration wants to be  focused on solving the issues at the border. Well, he is about 2 years  too late.   Instead of taking responsibility for this national security crisis,  the President is shifting blame to us here in Congress, claiming House  Republicans have failed to take the necessary steps to defend our  border.   Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely astounding. Since President Biden  took office, CBP has recorded 4.5 million illegal border crossings.  That doesn't include their estimated 1.2 million got-aways.   Under one-party Democratic leadership, ICE removed, last year, only  72,000 migrants, down from 186,000 removals in the final year of the  Trump administration.   In December, under Speaker Pelosi's leadership, we saw a record for  the most illegal crossings in a month, ever. The tenth month in a row,  more than 200,000 immigrants were apprehended at the southern border.   How did the administration respond? By releasing more than 1 million  people into the country's interior last year, only a third of which are  under ICE supervision; by building an app for immigrants to schedule  their illegal entry into the country; they responded by creating parole  programs that bring tens of thousands of migrants into the country  without a pathway to legal status; finally, by cutting ICE detention  beds last budgetary cycle.   Eleven thousand beds were cut by ICE, decreasing our capacity to  detain migrants, not because border crossings are down, but because,  with this administration, negligence is preferable to accountability.   Make no mistake, we are in the middle of a historic border crisis  because of President Biden and House Democrats.   During my trip to the border last spring, I met with discouraged  Border Patrol agents overwhelmed by the influx of migrants attempting  to cross our border, with absolutely no relief in sight.   While these agents do their best to handle groups of hundreds and  sometimes thousands of people, the cartels are taking advantage of the  holes in our border to smuggle in dangerous drugs like fentanyl and  dangerous people. Hundreds of terrorists, known terrorists, on  the watch list have come into this country.    Every State has now become a border State under this administration.  By failing to enforce our laws and secure the border, this  administration is incentivizing illegal entry and encouraging more  people to come here and then overstay their visas.   This national security and humanitarian crisis has gone on long  enough. Since I came to Congress, I have been fighting to secure our  border, working with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to  help secure over $5.8 billion for a border wall since fiscal year 2017.   This Congress, House Republicans are committed to securing the  border, ending catch and release, reinstating the remain in Mexico  policy, requiring proof of legal status for employment, and eliminating  welfare incentives.   We owe it to the communities that we represent to take these issues  seriously and to hold this administration accountable. House  Republicans will take the necessary steps to ensure America is a nation  that is safe.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Kiley).                        Celebrating School Choice Week     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns  today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it shall convene at noon  for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 2 o'clock and 58 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday,  January 30, 2023, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
