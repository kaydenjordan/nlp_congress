 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, this Saturday marks 100  days in office for President Donald Trump, an important milestone for  Congress and this administration.   Since being sworn in, President Trump has stood strong, upholding his  pledge to protect the American people in the face of world threats. He  has stood up to the dangerous regime in North Korea by supporting our  allies in the region and deploying the THAAD missile defense system. He  took swift, decisive action against the dictatorship in Syria by using  military force and economic sanctions after the brutal dictatorship  executed a chemical attack murdering innocent civilians.  [[Page H2857]]    Additionally, the President has taken strong action to win the global  war on terrorism by destroying ISIL-controlled tunnels in Afghanistan.   I appreciate President Trump for being a strong President and a model  of Ronald Reagan, promoting peace through strength. Congratulations to  him on a remarkable first 100 days in office.   I look forward to continuing to work with the President to protect  American families while successfully creating jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
