 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  Bloomington Public School District 87, in Bloomington, Illinois, on  being named the 2019 U.S. Department of Education Green Ribbon School  District and receiving a District Sustainability Award.  [[Page H4151]]    Bloomington Public School District 87 is one of only 14 schools  across the country to receive this award, which recognizes schools and  districts for their innovative efforts to provide a healthy, safe,  sustainable, and efficient learning environment.   This past February, I had the opportunity to speak with Bloomington  Junior High School students and faculty, which is reflected in this  poster, to see firsthand the innovative work District 87 schools are  doing to facilitate more resource-efficient schools.   Bloomington Public School District 87 continues to lead the way in  Illinois. Their resource-efficient practices let teachers and  administrators dedicate more resources to student instruction rather  than operational costs.   Students deserve the opportunity to achieve their full potential in  the classroom, and Bloomington Public School District 87 continues to  give McLean County students that opportunity. I am grateful for their  continued leadership and want to, once again, congratulate them on this  prestigious honor.                            ____________________
