 Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark the passage of the 19th  Amendment out of this very Chamber 100 years ago.   As I join with my colleagues to celebrate this historic vote on May  21, I will wear a yellow rose on my lapel. This is reminiscent of a  scene in the Tennessee State House.   At that time, one more State was needed to ratify the 19th Amendment.  All eyes were on Tennessee.   State Representative Harry T. Burn of Tennessee's Third District  donned a red rose signaling his opposition to the pro-suffrage  movement. However, after reading a letter from his mother, Ms. Phoebe  Ensminger Burn, Representative Burn cast the tie-breaking vote, joining  with his colleagues in yellow roses to vote in support of women's  suffrage.   The resolution passed. Tennessee became the final State needed to  ratify the 19th Amendment.   I will wear a yellow rose in honor of women like Ms. Burn, who  demanded to be heard, to honor Members of the 66th Congress who  championed change and for the enfranchisement of all American women.  Without their voices, our Nation would not be what it is today.                            ____________________
