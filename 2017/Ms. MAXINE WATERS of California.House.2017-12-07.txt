 Mr. Speaker, I just heard a Member  from the opposite side of the aisle come to the floor to talk about  what we are talking about. I am only talking about tax-and-spend  Republicans.   Can you believe the Republicans who have been singing the song of  conservatism for years? They called us ``tax-and-spend liberals.'' And  they talk about the deficit. They even run signs talking about how much  it is costing the American public every minute. But guess what. They  are creating a deficit of $1.5 trillion in this tax scam that they are  passing.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my outrage over this harmful tax scam  legislation passed by tax-and-spend Republicans. That is what I am  saying: tax-and-spend Republicans.   Both the House and Senate bills explode the deficit by over $1  trillion and raise taxes on the middle class in order to spend on tax  cuts for the wealthy. After 10 years, those making $75,000 or less  would see a tax increase, while those making $1 million or more would  see their taxes decrease.   Under the House bill, tens of millions of working families nationwide  would experience a tax increase by 2027.   I hope that the tax-and-spend Republicans on the other side of the  aisle will come to their senses before sending a final bill to the  President's desk.   Tax-and-spend Republicans: over a $1 trillion deficit. Can you  believe it?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5  minutes.   H.R. 477 seeks to provide a statutory exemption from registration  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for certain  brokers who facilitate the merger or acquisition of small businesses,  known as M&A brokers.   When Congress first considered this exemption in a similar bill  during the 113th Congress, our goal was to prompt the SEC to provide  regulatory relief for these brokers from ill-fitting restrictions  designed for persons helping companies raise capital rather than  facilitating their transfer of ownership.   We succeeded. Two weeks after the House passed that bill, the SEC  issued a no-action letter, which contained staff's view that, if an M&A  broker complied with the terms and conditions of the letter, it would  recommend that the SEC not take enforcement action against that broker  for failing to register with the Commission.   Specifically, the no-action letter required the M&A broker to abide  by certain commonsense restrictions to prevent such an exemption from  being misused to raise capital or abused by bad actors.   According to the bill's proponents, H.R. 477 is still necessary to  provide legal certainty since the no-action letter is merely the  nonbinding opinion of SEC staff. I understand that concern; however,  the bill inexplicably omits several of the conditions contained in the  no-action letter that protect small businesses and their investors.   I am pleased that this Congress, Representative Sherman and  Representative Huizenga have worked on a bipartisan basis to add these  protections back in through an amendment. If so amended, I will support  H.R. 477, which would strike the right balance between regulatory  relief and the protection of small companies and their investors.   In particular, the amended bill would require an M&A broker that  represents both the seller and the buyer to provide them with clear,  written disclosures and obtain their consent to that conflict of  interest; prohibit M&A brokers from misusing the exemption to raise  capital rather than transfer ownership of small businesses; prohibit  shell companies from using the exemption as a backdoor way to take a  small business public; and prohibit fraudsters and other bad actors  from using the exemption.   In addition, the bill would not change the statutory definition of  broker, thereby preserving the SEC's ability to investigate and bring  enforcement actions for violations of the antifraud provisions in the  securities laws.   The bill also would limit the relief to mergers and acquisitions  involving companies with less than $250 million in annual gross  revenues, which is the total income of the company, or $25 million in  annual earnings, which is the amount of income minus expenses. The  amendment would then provide the SEC with the authority to modify these  thresholds as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for  the protection of investors.   As our Nation's baby boomers head into retirement and look to sell  their privately owned businesses to a new generation of entrepreneurs,  it is important that they are able to do so in an efficient and cost- effective manner. If amended, H.R. 477 would allow them to do just  that, and so I would support the bill.   I would like to thank my colleagues. I would like to thank Mr.  Hensarling. I would like to thank Mr. Sherman.   This is an important bill for all of us. We are all so supportive of  our small businesses. We want them to do well, and we do not want them  to be hindered by unnecessary regulations.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
