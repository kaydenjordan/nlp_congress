 Mr. Speaker, leaders everywhere should decry the violent  crowds toppling our statues. Our systems are the greatest ever devised  by mankind. They deliver more equality, more justice, more liberty, and  more pursuits of happiness than any other system throughout history.   Now, we haven't always lived up to the ideals of our system, but we  should build upon the accomplishments of our forefathers, not destroy  their memories. We must bring about change by following the laws, not  breaking them. We must support our police, not ambush them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this costly  resolution that would allow more fraud, waste, and abuse.   No one condones fraud, especially when it is perpetrated by an  institute of higher learning. Every student who is financially  defrauded is entitled to relief and forgiveness, period. But we should  make sure that we are helping those who have been defrauded. It is our  job to do due diligence for the American taxpayer.   The Trump administration has made this a priority, unlike the Obama  administration. They used the rule to forgive as many student loans as  they could. They would even target institutions they didn't like. That  is partisan. It is costly to the taxpayer, and it is harmful to the  student. That is why I support Secretary DeVos and President Trump.  Their borrower defense rule takes taxpayers into account.   After seeing the enormous price tag of $42 billion that the Obama  rule created, President Trump and Secretary DeVos acted swiftly to take  that burden off the backs of the taxpayers. I thank the President and  Secretary DeVos.
