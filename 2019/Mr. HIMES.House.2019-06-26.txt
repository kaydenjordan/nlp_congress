 Mr. Speaker, one of the proudest moments of my career in  this Chamber was the passage of the Affordable Care Act, not because it  was perfect--it wasn't--but because it changed the lives for the better  of tens of millions of Americans. Now, of course, we are threatened  with repeal.   Mr. Speaker, here is what repeal would look like by the numbers.  Overturning the ACA would raise the number of uninsured people in the  United States by 20 to 21 million people. Due to preexisting  conditions, more than 100 million Americans could face higher health  insurance premiums or the possibility that they might not get insured  at all.   Now, remember, as you consider the claim from my Republican friends  that they will preserve preexisting condition coverage, remember that  they promised for 10 years to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and they  didn't do it. Then they promised to repeal and replace the Affordable  Care Act, and they didn't do it. So when they promise to preserve  preexisting conditions, take that with a grain of salt.   But this is not just about the numbers. This is about real people in  my district. People like Tom, who was able to start his own business  once insurance didn't tie him to his job, or Robert, who was forced  into bankruptcy by healthcare costs, but doesn't have to fear that  anymore because of the Affordable Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, I do not exaggerate when I say that repealing or  striking down the Affordable Care Act would be a tragedy of enormous  proportions. I ask all of my colleagues to join the fight to protect  Americans' healthcare.                            ____________________
