 Madam Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart. The two most  difficult votes any Member of Congress  [[Page H12166]]  ever has to cast is to vote to go to war or to impeach. Today, I will  vote for the Articles of Impeachment.   Over the last few months, I have listened carefully to my  constituents. I have weighed all the available information to determine  whether or not the President committed any wrongdoing. There are  disturbing facts from this administration that informed my decision,  including the President's own words.   His handpicked Ambassador to the European Union testified there was a  quid pro quo to withhold aid to Ukraine for an investigation of former  Vice President Biden, and that everyone was in the loop.   His own National Security Advisor, John Bolton, said he wanted  nothing to do with this drug deal, as he called it. Then, the President  openly acknowledged that China and Ukraine should investigate Mr.  Biden.   There is much more evidence pointing to the President violating his  own oath of office. I have not made this decision lightly, but I must  uphold my own oath of office because I believe the President has failed  to uphold his oath of office.   The weight of history, my belief in the Constitution of the United  States, and our own national security interests have led me to this  vote.
