 Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to  Amendment No. 47, which directs the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) to reclassify public safety telecommunications officers, also  called 911 dispatchers, as a protective service occupation in the U.S.  Government's Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. This  Amendment would have no direct effect on these workers' wages,  benefits, or other resources; proponents of this reclassification have  stated that ``the benefit of reclassification is recognition and  respect.''   The SOC classification system is a federal statistical standard used  across agencies in data collection. According to OMB, ``[t]he SOC is  designed exclusively for statistical purposes.'' Changes to the codes  affect multiple data sources frequently used by policymakers,  researchers, and employers, including the American Community Survey,  the nation's largest household survey; the Current Population Survey  (CPS), the key source of our monthly employment numbers; and the  Occupational Employment Statistics (OES), the authoritative source of  employment and wage information by occupation.   A standing committee at OMB, the SOC Policy Committee (SOCPC), is  responsible maintaining the accuracy of these codes using well-defined  principles. The SOCPC undertakes a routine revision of the codes  roughly once per decade; the process spans multiple years and  ``involves extensive background research, periods of public comment,  review of comments, and implementation of revisions.'' During its  latest revision, which began in early 2012 and was finalized in 2018,  OMB specifically rejected comments requesting it reclassify 911  dispatchers as directed in Amendment No. 47. In its response to public  comments presented in the May 2014 Federal Register, the Obama  Administration's OMB explained it ``did not accept these  recommendations based on Classification Principle 2, which states that  workers are coded according to the work performed. The work performed  is that of a dispatcher, not a first responder.'' In 2016, the previous  administration's OMB declined a similar request for reclassification.  Based on the principles OMB's policy committee applies to determine SOC  codes, 911 telephone dispatchers are already properly and accurately  classified.   Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in a written  communication with the Education and Labor Committee on April 26, 2019,  reported that the change made by H.R. 1629, a bill identical to  Amendment No. 47, would ``impact computer systems, training,  documentation, and other processes'' and that ``[s]uch unplanned  changes require time and resources to implement and could adversely  affect other survey activities.'' Moreover, changes outside of the  routine revision process would undermine the goal of data continuity,  limiting data sources' usefulness for their key purpose of statistical  analysis; create precedent for disrupting the standard SOC revision  process; and undermine the SOCPC's authority as experts to apply the  classification principles to determine what accuracy requires.  [[Page H5631]]    Public safety telecommunications officers perform critical,  challenging work. They deserve our honor and gratitude for their  efforts. However, considering the many alternative ways policymakers  could confer ``recognition and respect,'' as the proponents are  seeking, there is little policy justification for this Amendment's  approach to achieving that goal. In conclusion, mandating a change to a  statistical code would not affect these workers' wages, benefits, or  other resources--but it would disrupt data series continuity; require  significant additional work for government agencies, researchers,  employers, and others; and intervene in an official, routine government  data-collection and statistical process.  Communications of April 26, 2019 From the Bureau of Labor Statistics to     the Committee on Education and Labor Regarding H.R. 1629 (Same as                             Amendment No. 47)                        Questions related to H.R. 1629         1. How will H.R. 1629 impact the current population survey       and occupational employment statistics?        2. H.R. 1629 would require the Office of Management and       Budget (OMB) to implement a change in the Standard       Occupational Classification (SOC) system regarding public       safety telecommunicators. This requirement would alter the       existing process for periodically reviewing and updating the       SOC, which involves extensive background research, periods of       public comment, review of comments, and implementation of       revisions.        Federal statistical agencies, including the Bureau of Labor       Statistics (BLS) are currently in various stages of       implementing the 2018 revisions to the SOC (https:// www.bls.gov/soc/socimp.htm), which the Office of Management       and Budget released in a November 28, 2017 Federal Register       notice (https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/soc2018final.pdf). In       particular, the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the       Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program are actively       using the 2018 SOC and any changes to the SOC structure would       impact computer systems, training, and documentation as well       as the systems of federal and other data users downstream,       such as the BLS Employment Projections (EP) program and the       Employment and Training Administration's Occupational       Information Network (O*NET).        The CPS is a monthly survey with a sample of 60,000       households. CPS occupational and industry data are coded       according to the most detailed level of the relevant       classification system possible, accounting for factors such       as disclosure concerns for small occupations and the ability       to code occupations based on the detail provided by household       respondents. This CPS occupational coding system closely       aligns with the SOC, but provides data on about 530       occupations, compared with 820 in the full SOC. The Census       Bureau is responsible for applying occupational codes. An       overview of how they are implementing the 2018 SOC is       outlined here https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/ library/working-papers/2019/demo/sehsdwp2019-19.pdf.       Therefore, there is no guarantee that even if this change       were to occur, the Census Bureau would code at that level of       detail.        The OES program could make the needed changes. The data       would show changes in the employment and wages for major       groups affected by the change in classification.        2. Will this bill have an impact on wage class service       contracts?        BLS is not involved in wage setting for service contracts.       To the extent that any published BLS data are used in such       wage setting, any changes to those data could impact wages.        3. Will implementing H.R. 1629 be difficult for the BLS to       do?        BLS uses the SOC in several surveys. Any changes to the SOC       structure would impact computer systems, training,       documentation, and other processes. Such unplanned changes       require time and resources to implement and could adversely       affect other survey activities.        4. Are there plans for a revision of occupational       classifications?        The SOC is revised periodically, with the interagency SOC       Policy Committee making recommendations to OMB for changes.       OMB has not officially stated when the next SOC revision will       occur, although some indications are that the next SOC will       be for the year 2028. If they follow past practices, OMB is       likely to publish an initial Federal Register notice       soliciting public comment around 2024. Detailed information       on the revision process for 2018 is made available here,       including a document called ``Revising the Standard       Occupational Classification'' which provided detailed history       on the revision process and guidance on submission of       suggestions for changes for the 2018 SOC revision.        5. What other consequences are there if H.R. 1629 is       implemented?        Implementation of H.R. 1629 would alter the existing       process for periodically reviewing and updating the SOC,       which involves extensive background research, periods of       public comment, review of comments, and implementation of       revisions.        The revision process includes solicitations of public       comment in the form of Federal Register notices. During the       lengthy and comprehensive SOC revision process, the SOC       Policy Committee establishes interagency workgroups charged       with reviewing comments received in response to Federal       Register notices and providing recommendations to the SOC       Policy Committee. Guided by the SOC classification principles       and coding guidelines, the SOC Policy Committee reviews the       recommendations from the workgroups and reaches decisions by       consensus. This work process is established to ensure that       the review is conducted in alignment with the 2018 SOC       classification principles and coding guidelines, which are       available starting on page 10 of the 2018 SOC User Guide       (https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/soc_2018_user_guide.pdf).        In response to the May 22, 2014, Federal Register notice,       the SOC Policy Committee received and reviewed six comments       regarding 9-1-1 dispatchers. These dockets were reviewed       simultaneously by the SOC Policy Committee and grouped under       docket 1-0199 Dispatchers, Public Safety Telecommunicators.       The full SOC Policy Committee response to docket 1-0199 is       available at: https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/ soc_responses_May_2014.htm.        In response to the July 22, 2016, Federal Register notice,       the SOC Policy Committee received and reviewed over 4,000       comments regarding 9-1-1 dispatchers. The full list of       comments is available here. For comments related only to 9-1-      1 dispatchers, filter the subject column for ``Police, Fire,       and Ambulance Dispatchers.'' The Office of Management and       Budget (OMB) makes public comments available from https:// www.regulations.gov/document?D=OMB-2016-0006-0001.        During the revision process for 2018, a guiding       classification principle was added to emphasize the       importance of maintaining time series continuity, to the       maximum extent possible. Modifications to the structure in       intervening years may be inconsistent with this principle.     Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment  to H.R. 2500, which would require the Secretary of Defense to submit a  report to Congress regarding the Department's progress implementing the  91 priority recommendations from the Comptroller General of the United  States. I would like to thank my colleague Congresswoman Barbara Lee  for cosponsoring this amendment. I would also like to thank Chairman  Smith and the House Armed Services Committee for their work on this  important legislation.   The 91 priority recommendations in GAO-19-366SP report was sent to  the Department of Defense to address major challenges in nine key  areas: Acquisitions and Contract Management, Readiness, Building  Capacity to Drive Enterprise-Wide Business Reform, Defense  Headquarters, Health care, Cybersecurity, Infrastructure, Financial  Management, and Preventing Sexual Harassment. These recommendations  address challenges that affect the Department's ability to accomplish  its mission.   Every Congressional Black Caucus alternative budget for the past  decade has made implementing GAO's recommendations a priority to  encourage DoD to save taxpayer dollars and to be more prudent with the  enormous amount of resources they are provided to defend our country.  As we work to strengthen our nation's Armed Forces to counter threats  from our adversaries, we must ensure that DoD roots out waste, fraud,  and abuse within the agency. While DoD has successfully implemented  some of the recommendations made by the GAO, there is more work to be  done.   Today, DoD faces new challenges in our national security with the  rise of cyber crimes, international terrorism and nuclear threats. Our  military has been stretched and exhausted from being involved in two  wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We should be doing everything we can to  ensure that DoD funds are used to strengthen our national security.   Each fiscal year, the Department is appropriated hundreds of billions  of dollars and is the largest employer in the federal government. It is  critical that DOD accounts for every dollar. The GAO report has 17  recommendations for financial management. GAO reports that DoD has  failed to properly produce correct financial information. This is a  serious problem for a Department that receives such a significant share  of federal taxpayer dollars. Auditing the Pentagon and encouraging DoD  to continue to implement the remaining GAO recommendations would lead  to tens of billions in cost savings for taxpayers by bringing a culture  of financial accountability to the Pentagon.   Madam Chair, it is imperative that DoD address and implement the  GAO's remaining priority recommendations. If cost is the issue that is  preventing the implementation, the required report to Congress will  outline the estimated funding needed to assist DOD with the  implementation.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important  amendment to ensure DoD's efficient use of taxpayer dollars.
