 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1448, as amended, the  Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers, or the PAWS for Veterans  Therapy Act. This bill will help connect veterans with PTSD with  service dogs by establishing a service dog training pilot program,  supporting service dog training organizations, and authorizing the VA  to provide veterans with PTSD service dogs and veterinarian assistance  for those service dogs.   The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act is sponsored by Congressman   Steve  Stivers from Ohio. Representative Stivers is an Army veteran. He has  spent much of his congressional career advocating for his brothers and  sisters in arms and has been a champion of this bill for many years. I  am grateful for his leadership and commitment.   The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act will further the lifesaving bond  that exists between man's best friend and veterans in need, and it will  continue our efforts to promote creative ways to support veterans who  are struggling.   I am proud to be one of the 313 cosponsors of the PAWS for Veterans  Therapy Act, and I am proud to vote in support of it today. I hope that  all of my colleagues will join me.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Stivers). He is an Army officer himself, and is the chief sponsor  of this bill who has also served in this body and does a great job of  that. He will be dearly missed.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1448, the PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act.   From a personal standpoint, this legislation would require the  Department of Veterans Affairs to collaborate with nongovernmental  entities and carry out a service dog pilot program to address post- deployment mental health and PTSD in our veterans.   I have a big community of more than 136,000 veterans in Puerto Rico,  and well-trained service animals provide disabled veterans with PTSD  numerous benefits. For example, they can be trained to wake up veterans  from nightmares, interrupt flashbacks, and quite literally watch their  backs.   There is growing evidence that service animal intervention really  works. Veterans report that animal training can help mitigate the  effects of intrusive memories while grounding them in the present  moment. A growing body of research also shows that patients with  service animals experience a better quality of life, lower levels of  the stress hormone cortisol, and increased chances of sustaining  meaningful employment.   As we all know, the Department of Veterans Affairs is a leader in  healthcare and research for veterans, and this bill will provide an  opportunity to support a growing standard of care for our veterans. As  such, that is the reason I support the bill, and I urge my colleagues  to vote in favor of H.R. 1448.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Before I close, I thank Chairman Takano for working with  Representative Stivers and myself to find common ground. I would be  remiss if I did not also thank Majority Leader Hoyer for his  assistance, scheduling, and consideration of this legislation before  Representative Stivers leaves the House of Representatives.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 958, the Protecting  Moms Who Served Act.   Just 3 days ago, we celebrated Mother's Day, so it is particularly  fitting to be here to discuss a bill to improve the care that is  provided to veteran mothers.   Women are volunteering to serve in uniform at a rapid rate, and when  they become veterans, they seek VA healthcare at a rapid rate as well.   I am committed to making sure the VA is equipped to provide them with  the high-quality care that they have earned.   The Protecting Moms Who Served Act will strengthen VA's maternity  care coordination program. It will expand training on the physical and  mental health needs of pregnant and postpartum veterans. It will also  require a GAO assessment of maternal health outcomes among women  veterans.   I am grateful to the bill's sponsor and my fellow Illinoisan,  Congresswoman Underwood, for introducing this bipartisan bill. I am  pleased to support it this afternoon.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members have 5  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I am a small business man. We own a small  business, my wife and I. I know many small business owners across  America are struggling to reopen and rebuild after COVID-19 shutdowns.  They simply can't find workers to fill the job openings.   Why? Because the Federal Government is disincentivizing people from  working. Many people are making more money off unemployment insurance  than they would if they were back at work, and that is having a  crippling impact on Main Streets across America, including in my  district.   People in Washington need to hear these stories. Southern Illinois is  home to Belleville Boot Company, a military boot manufacturer founded  in 1904. A year ago, they employed nearly 240 workers in Belleville.  But after each round of stimulus checks, as good as they may be, they  had fewer and fewer workers showing up. Now, their workforce has  dropped to 26 percent, and they can't find enough workers to fill the  openings.   In Alton, the Kreative Kids Learning Center has helped educate local  children for 51 years. The owner, Keith, says that they currently have  21 employees but are desperate for more. He runs ads in the newspaper,  online, and on social media, offering a good wage, yet he received zero  applications--zero.   He has even had to turn children away because he is so short of  staff.   In Carbondale, Illinois, Mary Lou's Grill has been a local staple  since 1962, serving up the most famous biscuits and gravy in town. On a  telephone town hall last night, Marilynn, the owner of Mary Lou's,  shared that her food suppliers are unable to hire enough people to run  their facilities. That potentially means food shortages and  skyrocketing prices for restaurants and customers.   Before COVID-19, the Broadway Grille in Sparta, Illinois, had more  applicants than they had positions to fill. But now, Justin, the owner,  says that some former employees have told him they will not seek a job  as long as they are getting unemployment benefits.   He is so short-staffed that he doesn't have enough people to answer  the phone most nights. If he can't find workers soon, he isn't sure  what he will do.   This is not just a southern Illinois issue. It touches every  community across this country. That is why I have invited several of my  colleagues to highlight how their districts have been impacted.   I will start, first off, by yielding to the gentlewoman from Indiana  (Mrs. Walorski), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Worker and  Family Support. She has many stories I am sure she can tell.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Williams).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the former speaker because of his  experience in small business and running a business for a majority of  his life.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from West Virginia  (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Carolina (Ms. Mace).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas  (Mr. Estes). I know that he has many comments that are vitally  important to this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse), a person who really does understand small  business and farming, who understands what it is like to employ people  and how important those employees are.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Hagedorn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Donalds).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close. I thank the gentleman for his comments. I want to thank all of  my colleagues who joined me and joined us here tonight. Thank you to my  friend Representative Jackie Walorski for cohosting this Special Order.   We all agree that it was necessary for Congress to step up and act  quickly to help hardworking Americans laid off or out of work during  the widespread pandemic shutdowns. But here we are, three vaccines  later, the States are loosening restrictions. We need to refocus on  where we are going, on what we are doing, on making sure children go  back to school and people go back to work.   I am proud to support Ranking Member Brady's Reopening America by  Supporting Workers and Businesses Act. Instead of paying people to stay  home, it will allow States to provide back-to-work bonuses and  increased funding for reemployment services.   In April's dismal jobs report, which was mentioned earlier, it is an  indication we have a long way to go. It is a time that we need to get  our economy back on track and our people back to work. Every time we go  down the street, if you listen to the people who spoke here tonight,  jobs, help wanted, help wanted, help wanted, and no help to be found.  Why? Because as good as an intention as we had when we passed the  unemployment extensions, Mr. Speaker, what we are doing is we are  prolonging this situation where we can actually get back to work. We  can take these things off, we can actually be safe going to work. We  are being vaccinated. Things are gearing back up.   Let's not go down the path of government entrapment. Let's go back to  what America is about: People seeking employment when jobs are there,  to bettering their family when jobs are there. Not through government  programs, but through the opportunity of actually working every day to  provide for their families and to provide their children and  grandchildren with opportunities.   We are going to have to do that because we have spent a lot of money  this last year, quite often in making sure that our American citizens  were taken care of. And rightfully so. But now it is time to go back to  work.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
