 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of the  American Rescue Plan.   The critical need to provide economic relief for struggling Americans  and communities across the Nation could never be more evident than it  is now. A year into this pandemic, the world is reeling from the  fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.   This time last year, we had a handful of people that had, sadly,  passed away from COVID-19 as it slowly made its way across the country.  This week, we mourned over 500,000 lives lost and countless family  members and loved ones that will be impacted forever, and we are still  not out of the woods. Yesterday evening, we appropriately honored and  recognized those Americans who lost their lives.   This pandemic has created a deep economic crisis for American  families and small businesses. Economic inequities continue to  accelerate, sadly. Our communities are hurting. They are hurting, and  the time for decisive action is now, just as we did in a bipartisan  effort last year.   Think about it. America--America, the richest country in the world,  and yet the numbers are staggering. Over 18 million Americans are  receiving unemployment benefits. Nearly 24 million Americans are going  hungry, including 12 million children--12 million children. And nearly  40 million Americans cannot afford to pay the rent and possibly face  eviction.   We must get more funding to our States and local governments so they  can help those immediately impacted. This will allow us to begin to  open our schools safely, which we must do, in addition to the rest of  our economy. This is a key component of President Biden's American  Rescue Plan, which I support.   Now, let me repeat. The American Rescue Plan will work to keep  communities safe and reopen schools with a robust vaccine plan for the  public and educators that has been absent until the last 6 weeks.   In my own circumstance, my own constituency, the city of Fresno, in  the heart of my district is facing a multi-million dollar budget  shortfall. Like most cities across the country, they will be forced to  cut jobs, including those of first responders, without Federal support.  The same is true in the communities of Madera and Merced, also in my  district.    The American Rescue Plan will bring nearly $200 million to these two  local communities combined, providing critical relief needed to provide  funding for services their residents require, my constituents.   Now that vaccines are being administered, with millions inoculated so  far, we have to continue to build on that momentum, for gaining the  upper hand over this disease is on the horizon if we stay the course  and implement the plan the President has outlined.   But we must do more to help Americans than just providing  vaccinations. Obviously, that is at the front lines, and we will  produce more vaccines in the next month and in the next 2 months so  that, as the President said, 300 million Americans, by this summer,  will have the ability to be vaccinated. But economic relief is part of  the necessity to help them, and the American Rescue Plan does that.   Now, I have heard some of my colleagues on the other side talk about  the concerns about the fiscal impacts to our economy. I am a Blue Dog.  I believe that we need to have fiscal discipline, and I believe, after  being here 17 years, that happens when Democrats are willing to deal  with expenditures and Republicans are willing to deal with revenues.  And unless we do deal with those two things together it isn't going to  happen.   The last administration indebted this Nation over $7.5 trillion--$7.5  trillion in the last 4 years. I didn't hear much discussion during that  time about the fiscal deficit. But I learned another thing in 17 years  here; when Democrats are in charge, the debt matters. But when  Republicans are in charge, who cares?   So let's get real about this deficit. America is hurting today, and  it needs our support and it needs our help.   Over 140 executives of major American corporations are supporting  this plan. Over 140 of the major companies in America think that this  is necessary, the $1.9 trillion, to get this economy going and to put  our country back on a track that we can be safe from this pandemic.   So I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and to vote in favor of  the American Rescue Plan, as we did previous measures on a bipartisan  effort.                            ____________________
