 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize July 20 as National Pennsylvania Day. Pennsylvania's  nickname, the Keystone State, represents the central role we played in  shaping our Nation. Our great Commonwealth was the second State to join  the Union and continued to lead the way in making history.   As the first capitol of our Nation, many great decisions were made in  Philadelphia. It was there our Founding Fathers authored the  Declaration of Independence and the Constitution forming this great  Nation. Pennsylvania served in an important role in key military  operations. Valley Forge tells a story of sacrifice, leadership, grit,  and determination when our rag-tag military was attempting to defy  history and defeat a global superpower.   The Battle of Gettysburg marked a turning point of the Civil War,  providing the Union with the momentum to bring our great Nation back  together. Our State continues to carry the legacy of many firsts, from  the first American flag sewn by Betsy Ross to the first commercial oil  well.   Our inventor spirit continues to weave through history, from Benjamin  Franklin, Robert Fulton, and Jonas Salk. We continue to bring new and  exciting ideas forward. Our legacy of American craftsmanship and work  ethic runs deep, from our steel mills and coal mines to our farmlands  and forests.   Madam Speaker, as a lifelong resident of Pennsylvania, I am  encouraged each and every day by the industrious spirit of our  residents as we continue to build a bright path forward for our  commonwealth and our country.   Happy Pennsylvania Day! I am proud to be from our great Keystone  State.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  the career of Dr. Brian Toth.

Dr.  Toth started his career in 1983 as a math and computer teacher in the  Altoona Johnstown Diocese system.
