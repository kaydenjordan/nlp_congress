 Madam President, in my new position as ranking  member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship,  each week I have the honor of recognizing an outstanding Iowa small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. It is my  privilege to recognize Red Oak Fabrication of Red Oak, IA, as the  Senate Small Business of the Week for the week of January 30, 2023.   As you will often see across our great State, small businesses and  families go hand-in-hand in Iowa. Red Oak Fabrication of Montgomery  County is no different. Red Oak Fabrication was founded in 1913 under  the name Pike Machine Shop. A short decade later, management would  decide to adopt the name that still stands today: Red Oak Fabrication.  In 1928, Ted Fort began working at Red Oak as one of three employees.  Through hard work and persistence, he purchased half interest in the  company in 1944 and eventually purchased the remaining to own full  interest in 1948. Watching their father's growing success within the  business, it was not long before Ted's sons Bill and Jack, both  veterans of World War II, decided to join the fold in 1946 and 1947  respectively. Bill was responsible for starting the outside sales of  oxygen and welding supplies, while Jack joined the sales team. Ted's  two sons proved to be great additions to the company, especially as the  Fort family's involvement in Red Oak Manufacturing extended beyond the  second generation.   The third generation of the Fort family working at Red Oak  Fabrication began in 1978 when Ted's grandson Jeff Fort started as a  route truck driver. Jeff eventually took over the business in 1992 and  made a big splash in 1993 when he purchased a plasma table, the  company's first. Jeff's son, Jacob Fort, started in 2001 following his  graduation from college, ushering in the fourth generation of Forts.  Jacob got his start working in indoor and outdoor sales. Jacob left the  company in 2005, but returned in 2014 and now handles business  development and purchasing, leading the activities at the north  location. Jordan Fort, another one of Jeff's sons, began working at Red  Oak Fabrication as a freshman in high school in 2004. He worked at his  family's business every summer until his sophomore year of college. He  now handles the powder coating as well as purchasing. In 2022, Justin  Fort joined the business working in operations following a decade of  work in cutting equipment manufacturing and production welding  equipment sales.   You can find Red Oak Fabrication in three locations in Montgomery  County, a north, south, and central location. The central location is  where the company started and is where the machining centers, as well  as a Carhartt store is located. The north facility provides powder  coating, plate rolling, manual and robotic welding, while the south  location has their plate processing equipment. Starting as a two truck  operation, Red Oak Fabrication has grown to include three plasma  tables, two laser tables, and one water jet table. Clearly, a strong  sense of business acumen runs in the Fort family as Ted's children,  grandchildren, and even  [[Page S227]]  great-grandchildren have continued on their forefather's long road of  growth and innovation.   I think we can all agree that small businesses are the backbone of  America and families are the heart. It gives me great pleasure to see  Ted Fort's hard work transcend generations to provide vital  manufacturing services to my home county and statewide. Therefore, I  want to commend the Fort family for their hard work and commitment to  keeping Red Oak Fabrication a family business, even as they continue to  grow their enterprise, and achieve the American dream. Congratulations  to the Fort family and the entire team at Red Oak Fabrication. I look  forward to seeing your continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
