 Mr. Speaker, when Members think of my home State of  Florida, they think of water. From our beaches to our springs to our  lakes and our rivers, Florida's waterways stretch far and wide,  covering nearly 26,000 miles.   Florida's Sixth District, my district, is no exception, with miles of  Atlantic Coast to the east and bordered by the St. Johns River to the  west.   From the Matanzas River marsh to the Everglades, water is at the  heart of Florida's ecosystem and its natural beauty. People are drawn  to Florida's water, and the numbers prove it. One thousand people per  day move to the Sunshine State, with a record 126 million people  visiting Florida last year.   Tourism drives our economy, and Florida's tourism is dependent on  clean water and its natural resources.   Unfortunately, our water quality is threatened right now. We saw a  new blue-green algae bloom erupt in the St. Johns River just last  month. While it is too early to know exactly the specific cause of this  incident, we do know what causes algae blooms, and there are steps the  government can and should take to prevent them.   This is why I am focusing my efforts to remove septic tanks from my  district and connecting those communities to new sewer utilities.   I am grateful for our State lawmakers and Governor Ron DeSantis, who  prioritized water quality this year, putting $49 million toward water  quality and wastewater grants and $25 million specifically for septic- to-sewer conversions. These conversions will have a positive impact by  lessening discharges since septic leakage contributes to these growing  algae blooms and these growing algae problems.   We must leverage these State resources with Federal funds to address  the full needs of Florida. We have the Water Infrastructure Finance and  Innovation Act program and State Clean Water Revolving Fund program,  but they need to be better focused and better utilized to address this  issue.   We have to do more. That is why I requested much-needed funding for  our National Estuary Program, which funds the Indian River Lagoon, in  the fiscal year 2020 appropriations bill. The Indian River Lagoon in my  district has, unfortunately, fallen victim to septic leakage and  requires a plan for restoring water quality.   The National Estuary Program supports and will help maintain healthy  water and estuary ecosystems like the Indian River Lagoon.   Alongside many of my Florida delegation colleagues, I supported the  $200 million funding request for the Everglades restoration project in  April, and I am glad President Trump has amended his budget to include  the Everglades. Everglades restoration is dependent on cleaning Lake  Okeechobee and its discharges, which impact water along our coast.   I also commend my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for  passing the Energy and Water bill yesterday, which includes that $200  million figure. These requests will go directly toward improving  Florida's waterways across the State and areas like the Indian River  Lagoon, if signed into law.   I am hopeful that, here in Congress, we can get this legislation  passed through the House, passed through the Senate, and onto the  President's desk for signature. It is the right thing to do for  communities along the St. Johns River and necessary for maintaining the  travel and tourism that drives Florida's economy.   We must restore Florida's water quality and take this issue very  seriously.                            ____________________
