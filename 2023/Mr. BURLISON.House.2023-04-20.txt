 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dr.  James Suthoff, or, as we who knew him well called him Jim. He was a  husband, a father, a grandfather, and a community leader who passed  away, sadly, on March 25, 2023.   Jim was born and raised in Jefferson City and later worked as an  anesthesiologist in Springfield.   He loved hunting and fishing, but most importantly, he loved his  family and his friends. He was married to his wife, Diane, for nearly  40 years, and is survived by Diane, their two children, two  grandchildren, and six siblings.   Jim was a dear friend, and he will be deeply missed by everyone.   I ask the body to consider them in your prayers.                            ____________________
