 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I support this rule and the underlying legislation.  Today the Federal Government's rules exceed 97,000 pages--the most in  American history. So we ask ourselves: Do we really need 20 pages of  rules governing vending machines? Could we cover fuel standards in less  than 578 pages? Would the Union crumble if we didn't have 61 pages of  regulations on residential dehumidifiers?   Each of these rules has compliance costs that exceed $100 million.   In my home State of Florida, we passed a version of the REINS Act.  The result has been repeal or replacement of over 4,000 job-killing  regulations. We can only make America great again if we make Americans  free again--free from the tyranny of unelected Washington bureaucrats  huddled in windowless cubicles dictating to Americans how they should  live their lives, build their businesses, and protect their own  property. Voters sent us here to drain the swamp, but with so many  regulations, we would be lucky to get permission to mop up a puddle.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).   Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to address you and my  privilege to be recognized by the gentleman from Georgia.   I wanted to address this rule, and I share some of the sentiment that  came from the gentleman from Massachusetts. I like to have open rules.  I like to have open debates. I would like to have more than one debate  on what we might do with this resolution that is before us. I would  like to have a debate on the one-state solution versus the two-state  solution because I believe that the two-state solution has run its  course and we need to pack up our tools, ship those off to the side,  and start all over again with a new look.   I believe we needed to have a resolution that refreshes this in such  a way that it completely rejected Resolution 2334, that vote that took  place in the United Nations and said to the Trump administration: Let's  start this fresh with a new look rather than a direction of being bound  by implication to a two-state solution.   But that is not what we have ahead of us. What we have ahead of us is  a resolution that has come to the floor under a closed rule that sends  a lot of a good and right message to the rest of the world that America  and the United States Congress reject what happened in the United  Nations the other day and that decision to abstain from that vote. On  the other hand, we really don't have the focus here to take on the rest  of this issue. I am hopeful that we will.   I will be introducing a resolution later today that addresses the  two-state resolution in a way I would like to have done it with a  resolution here.   As I said to the gentleman from California, it is not my intent to  blow up his bill or his initiative. I want to see the best success we  can on what is going on here today.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), who is the distinguished  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, the problem with this U.N.  resolution is not simply that it criticizes Israeli actions; it is that  it is fundamentally one-sided. It is anti-Israel, and that is a  departure from longstanding, bipartisan U.S. policy.   U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334 does not address the  Palestinian Authority's failure to end incitement of hatred. Frankly,  they encourage it. The violence that we see against Israeli civilians  comes from the encouragement of PA officials. It doesn't address the  Palestinian Authority's continued payments. An incentive payment in  their budget--over $300 million a year--is paid to those who would  carry out attacks against Israeli civilians. The more mayhem you  create, the longer the term you have in prison, the larger the stipend.  That comes right out of the budget of the Palestinian Authority.   The U.N. resolution did not call upon Palestinian leadership to  fulfill their obligations towards negotiations. The Middle East Summit  is planned next month. So, first, the administration abstains on this,  and next month in France there is real concern that another damaging  Security Council resolution should follow.   That is why this dangerous policy must be rejected, hopefully  unanimously, by this House.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule. It is  not fair. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question  so that Mr. Price, Mr. Engel, and Mr. Connolly can bring up their  alternative to H. Res. 11.   Mr. Speaker, let me say, finally, that I am deeply concerned that the  institution of Congress has been undermined time and time again by this  tendency to be overly restrictive and outright closed. We are supposed  to be the greatest deliberative body in the world, but the problem is  we don't deliberate very much. Everything that is brought to this floor  tends to be a press release substituting for legislation.                                time  1345    There is no bipartisanship. There is none. There is no working  together. There is none. And that is unfortunate. I think one of the  messages of this last election for the American people was they want to  see things happen here. Not just whatever the Republicans want or  whatever the Democrats want, they want us to see us working together.   I served here as a staffer during a time when there was collegiality,  when Republicans and Democrats came together and passed appropriations  bills and authorization bills and passed major reform bills. That  doesn't happen anymore.   On the issue of regulatory reform, I think you can actually get a  consensus on regulatory reform. There is nobody in this House that  thinks the regulatory process is perfect. The problem is, when you  bring a bill to the floor that is so one-sided, that is poorly written,  that is impractical, we can't support it.  [[Page H121]]    On the issue of Israel, we could have come to a consensus, I think,  and spoken with one voice to show our unwavering support for the State  of Israel. But instead, we have a bill that comes to the floor that is  politically charged--I think that is very clear, based on the tone of  some of the speeches here today--but also has factual errors in it.   The frustration level has grown to the point where some of us in the  minority have taken to protesting. We had a sit-in in response to the  fact that we couldn't get legislation to the floor that said if you are  on a terrorist list, you can't fly, then you can't buy a gun, and a  bill that called for universal background checks.   We thought we had a promise to be able to bring some of this to the  floor. My friends could have voted against it. But we were told, no,  you don't even have the right to debate these bills.   I am going to say to my colleagues sincerely that, unless things  change, you are going to see the discord, the anger, and the  frustration build on this side of the aisle, and you are going to see  it build throughout the country.   There is a reason why people hold Congress in such disdain. It is  because they see this place not as an institution where we can solve  problems but as a place where it is all about obstruction or ``my way  or the highway.''   This is a lousy way to start the new year. Please vote ``no'' on the  previous question and vote ``no'' on this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   It is amazing to me some of the stuff that I have just heard, Mr.  Speaker, just in the last few minutes. And I appreciate my friend  across the aisle, but the debate that we have been having here is  amazing. So that is something I want to talk about, but also something  that came up, just to take a few steps down the road.   It had been mentioned many times here on the floor today that a  unanimous vote by the Security Council in some way implies that it was  right or that it was proper. I am sorry, the groupthink of the United  Nations Security Council on this issue was wrong.   The one that was left silent was the beacon of freedom to the world,  the United States, and instead of engaging, instead of working as we  have in the past abstained or voted against, there have been times when  we actually, as my friend said a moment ago, Mr. Speaker, worked  together. When that did happen in the past, there were times in which  Israel and the U.S. worked together to soften or change, and we had, at  that point in time, something that--not liked, but something that could  be lived with. In this case, it was nothing Israel said. This is bad.  America turned its back.   Where was the voice? It was silent. Where was the voice? We voted  absent. That is not what the leader of the free world should do. That  is not what the leader of the free world should do to his closest ally  in the Middle East. That is why we are talking about this.   There are other things we can discuss today. There are other  discussions on two-state solutions on another case on the settlement,  but the bottom line here is that it goes deeper than the other issues.  The deeper part here is that we simply sat silent while the world  mocked and criticized our strongest ally, Mr. Speaker.   So don't talk to me about working together. I get it. But where was  the working together on this? It was absent. A unanimous vote,  especially of the United Nations Security Council, using that as your  justification, I think we need to talk.   But also, Mr. Speaker, when we come to the end, regulatory  environment, the REINS Act is simply saying: Congress, do what Congress  is supposed to do. Congress, work as the voice of the American people.  Work for the voice of helping companies start and create jobs. Work  with the American people to relegate them forward instead of moving  backward.   The REINS Act simply says: let's do our job here. Not the ones who  are closed off from input but the folks who are elected to come to this  place, to come to these hallowed halls and debate what we are talking  about today: debate the regulatory environment, debate the environment.  When we do that, then that is what we need to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying bill.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule  and the underlying bill.   I oppose this rule because it makes in order H.R. 26, the Regulations  from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, which is a radical  measure that could make it impossible to promulgate safety regulations  to protect the public.   I oppose this rule because it would effectively shut down the entire  U.S. regulatory system, amending in one fell swoop every bedrock  existing regulatory statute.   The legislation is clearly designed to stop all regulation dead in  its tracks--no matter the threat to health, safety or the economy.   It would neuter the current system's reliance on science, expertise,  and public participation in developing regulations.   H.R. 26 would reshape the regulatory system to work as it did in the  19th Century, before the abuses of the robber barons led Congress to  create a modern and more efficient system to protect public health and  safety.   The REINS Act would require both houses of Congress to approve any  major rule within a limited period of time in order for it to take  effect.   Effectively, this would allow either house of Congress to block rules  simply through inaction, even when an existing statute required action.   The legislation would disempower every federal agency, effectively  rendering their rulemaking activities advisory opinions with no force  of law.   Under REINS, even rules to handle emergencies could be in effect for  only 90 days absent Congressional approval.   H.R. 26 is so grossly slanted against regulation that it will allow  lawsuits to proceed against any regulation Congress could actually  manage to approve.   And the latest version of the bill delays its effective date for a  year so that any Trump Administration efforts to repeal existing  regulations would not get caught up in the REINS Act trap--another  indication that the REINS Act would be expected to stop any regulatory  action from moving forward (because repealing regulations must be done  through regulation, so repeals would in fact trigger REINS.)   In addition to representing an overwhelming threat to the public,  H.R. 26 is also bad for business.   The legislation would require businesses to have to lobby Congress  for each and every significant regulatory change they wanted--no matter  whether those were new regulations, changes in regulation or repeal; no  matter whether the regulatory issues involved disputes between  different industries; no matter how technical the issues involved.   H.R. 26 would, in fact, make the regulatory system less predictable  for industry and would disadvantage any industry that did not have a  large political presence.   It is difficult to exaggerate how fundamentally this alarming piece  of legislation would change American government and how hard it would  make it to protect the public.   This legislative effort is the ultimate giveaway to special  interests.   Under H.R. 26, any special interest could simply use its political  clout in one chamber of Congress to sideline such vital public  protections as limiting the amount of lead in children's products,  preventing salmonella contamination in eggs, reducing emissions of  toxic air pollutants or banning predatory banking practices.   The REINS Act constitutes the ultimate overreach as well, not only  because of the impact it would have, but because Congress already has  ample tools to control the regulatory system.   Congress is already vested with the authority to vote to block a  specific regulation at any time.   And regulation is permitted only pursuant to statutes that Congress  has passed and can amend or repeal.   Under current law, agencies must keep a record of their interactions  with industry and other entities interested in the regulatory process  and provide a clear record of their decision-making (which often must  be able to hold up in court).   Because agencies often take years to review the scientific and  technical evidence relevant to a decision, throwing every final  decision to Congress would undermine this entire process.   In addition, courts can review regulations and an elaborate public  process that can stretch out for years must be followed to issue a  regulation.   Instead, under this legislation, Congress would have to make  relatively rapid decisions, often behind closed doors, and it would not  be legally held to any standard of technical review.   Businesses would no longer have an incentive to cooperate with  agencies and provide  [[Page H122]]  arguments and evidence because they could just take their chances with  the political process, which they would no doubt try to influence with  campaign contributions.   Ultimately, decisions on regulations would be determined solely by  political horse-trading among Members of Congress.   Agencies issue 50 to 100 major rules a year dealing with everything  from Medicare reimbursement to railroad safety to environmental  protection.   But, under H.R. 26, Congress would have 70 legislative days to  second-guess each and every decision covered by the Act.   Because failure to take action would kill any safeguard, Congress  would be forced to hold hearings in a short time on technical issues-- or worse, forgo hearings and race the 70-day clock with even less  information and debate.   This body has already allowed backlog to clog the channels of its  current docket, and this legislation would require that as many as 100  additional measures come to the floor.   This is not an effort to drain the swamp; this is a divisive and  manipulative tactic employed to clog the drain.   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it, this merry-go-round  legislative scheme and the irresponsibility of the House majority in  wasting time trying to shut down the entire regulatory system (because  it cannot win through time-honored, Constitutional legislative  processes) entirely disregard the administrative public support efforts  in place to protect food safety, air and water quality and to limit the  manipulation of our economic system by special interests.   The REINS Act is tantamount to a coup--a right-wing takeover to block  future agency actions regardless of public desires.   The exceptional Americans we serve deserve a Congress that does its  job and keeps our time-honored institutions functioning.   For these reasons and more, I oppose this rule and the underlying  bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 22 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon the adoption of this resolution       the House shall proceed to the consideration, without       intervention of any point of order, in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 23) expressing the sense of the House of       Representatives and reaffirming long-standing United States       policy in support of a negotiated two-state solution to the       Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The resolution shall be       considered as read. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the resolution and preamble to adoption without       intervening motion or demand for division of the question       except one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Foreign Affairs.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of House Resolution 23.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.    Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of adoption of the resolution.

NADLER and AL GREEN of Texas changed their vote from ``yea''  to ``nay.''   Mr. GRAVES of Missouri changed his vote from ``nay'' to ``yea.''   So the previous question was ordered.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   Stated against:   Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 9.   (By unanimous consent, Mr. McCARTHY was allowed to speak out of  order.)                            Recognizing Tim Berry    Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, when we as Members of Congress are first  elected, before we are sworn in, before we introduce our first bit of  legislation, the first thing we do is begin to hire, to form a team,  and much of the success that happens on this floor is a lot of work  that is done behind the scenes by our staff. They do a tremendous job  for this country in the public service they provide.   I personally count myself blessed to have had Tim Berry as my chief  of staff for the whole time I have been in leadership. Today is his  last day on our floor. Tim has had 18 years of service in this  institution. He has been in other leadership offices. He went into the  private sector, but when I got elected majority whip, I asked him if he  was willing to come back.   Tim has always demonstrated political wisdom, personal resolve,  dedication, but, most importantly, distinct moral clarity.   He has been here in some of the most difficult times in this  institution. He was in the office when people were actually shot when  an intruder came and took lives in this institution. He has worked on  legislation, he has worked on friendships, and he has worked across the  aisle. But if there were one thing I would define this man as, it is a  family man.   Today, we are lucky to have his wife, Lisa, and daughter, Maeve, in  the gallery with us. And to his other children, Ella and Chris, I want  to thank you for your sacrifice on loaning your father. For every  dinner he has missed, or every phone call he had to take, or maybe that  one or two lacrosse games he couldn't coach, I want to thank you.   But to Tim, I want to thank you for your dedication, I want to thank  you for your friendship, and I want to wish you the very best on behalf  of a very grateful nation and institution. Thank you.
