 Madam Speaker, as I stand here today, Republicans in the  Texas State Legislature are rapidly advancing some of the most  restrictive voting laws that we have seen in our Republic since the  Voting Rights Act was passed in the 1960s.   That is why it is so important that we pass H.R. 4, the John Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act, because H.R. 4 will help us fight  against this dangerous GOP-led anti-voter discrimination that we are  seeing, discrimination against the very voters who have fueled growth  in our State and who are allowing Texas to pick up two new seats after  reapportionment.   It will help restore full protections of the landmark Voting Rights  Act of 1965 and re-implement the critically needed VRA preclearance  provision to focus on States with a recent history of discrimination,  like the State that I live in. It is a State that has consistently  pushed racially charged anti-voter legislation that will allow  everything from empowering partisan poll watchers to intimidating Texas  voters to imposing criminal penalties.   We have to do something about this. Let's pass H.R. 4.                            ____________________
