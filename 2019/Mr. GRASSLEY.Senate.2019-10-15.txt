 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2  minutes as in morning business.    Mr. President, on October 13, the U.S. Navy celebrated  its 244th birthday. The U.S. Navy was founded by the Continental  Congress in 1775 to disrupt British shipping and naval power in the  Revolutionary War. At the time, the Navy was just a simple, ragtag band  of converted merchant ships. The U.S. Navy today is the most powerful  naval force anywhere in the world. It provides the military with the  ability to project power to every corner of the globe. America's Navy  works tirelessly to protect the freedom of navigation, of commerce, and  travel around the world.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another point, for the last three  decades, Des Moines has hosted something every year this week called  the World Food Prize. As the World Food Prize kicks off this week in  Des Moines, I pay tribute to an outstanding Iowan and the president of  that foundation.   In his Foreign Service career, Ken Quinn was the Ambassador to  Cambodia, but earlier in that career, Ken Quinn's life of service took  him from a small town in Iowa to Southeast Asia and back. Decades ago,  he identified an avenue to peace and prosperity. As a young Foreign  Service officer, he saw that roads secured economic freedom and food  security for the impoverished people of Southeast Asia.   For the last 20 years, Ambassador Quinn--now not in the Foreign  Service--has cultivated the World Food Prize into the Nobel Prize for  Agriculture. Thanks to his stewardship of the seeds first planted by  the Nobel Peace Prize laureate of 1970, Dr. Norman Borlaug, the World  Food Prize will yield humanitarian goods for generations to come.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, we have heard a lot about  whistleblowers in the past several weeks. There has been an outpouring  of concern for whistleblowers ever since word came out that there was a  whistleblower complaint that implicates the current administration.   A lot of those on the other side of the aisle, expressing support for  whistleblowers, to the best of my recollection, haven't expressed the  same level of concern for whistleblowers in the last administration.   Well, welcome to the table. I hope you stay at the table quite a  while.   I have said for years that it is critical that we protect the  whistleblower process to incentivize the disclosure of true waste,  fraud, and abuse of the taxpayer's money. Those processes must be  carefully followed by all whistleblowers, and that process must be  respected by our government's institutions. Those legal processes are  especially important for government employees who work in the  intelligence field. Whistleblowers who act in good faith, who comply  with the disclosure process set out by law, and who report their  concerns through proper channels deserve to be heard and deserve to be  protected.   I have also said that first-, second-, and third-hand information  doesn't make or break a whistleblower. If they follow the procedure,  that is really most important. However, hearsay is a factor to take  into account when analyzing the strength of underlying allegations.  Clearly, first-hand knowledge is much more powerful than second- and  third-hand knowledge. That is just common sense.   It is common sense no matter what the allegations are or who the  subject is, and there needs to be a consistent approach in the way that  Congress conducts oversight. On April 8 of this year, I spoke on this  Senate floor about the need for consistent oversight. I pointed out  clear double standards between what the Democrats are doing to the  Trump administration and the blind eye that they have used on any fact  pattern that might damage their political narrative.   Let me remind the Democrats that I threatened to subpoena the  President's son and that my staff later deposed that son. In fact, I  investigated alleged Russian collusion with the Trump campaign and  interviewed more than 10 people connected to the June 2016 famous Trump  Tower meeting, many of them Trump campaign officials. By the way, I  also welcomed Democrats' participation in those interviews. The  Democrats did participate. But, unfortunately, the same equal access  and transparency doesn't exist in the House of Representatives these  days as they do oversight of what has gone on with the famous telephone  call to the Ukrainian President.   I have routinely challenged the administration's policies and engaged  in robust oversight to hold this administration accountable. My  oversight and investigation units have sent out almost 300 letters to  the executive branch since President Trump took his oath of office. So  I think I can declare myself an equal-opportunity overseer because I  seek facts, irrespective of party and no matter where they lead.   I don't think many of the Democrats today can say the same thing.  These folks today, who are suddenly so concerned about congressional  oversight, are the same ones who had no interest whatsoever in  defending the institutions of the legislative branch when the Obama  administration was in office.   Quite frankly, I find it all too convenient that the Democrats today  have used allegations of wrongdoing against the President that actually  apply much more clearly to their own political leaders. Let us begin  down this road with the now-debunked Russia collusion investigation.   First, the Clinton campaign hired Fusion GPS to do opposition  research against candidate Trump. Second, the Democratic National  Committee did the very same thing. Third, Fusion GPS hired Christopher  Steele, a former British intelligence officer, to compile the famous  Steele dossier.   Even James Comey, a former FBI Director, a man who leaked sensitive  government records to spark a special counsel investigation, called  that Steele dossier ``salacious and unverified.'' That same Steele  dossier factored heavily in the FBI's investigation against Trump.  [[Page S5780]]    Fourth, Fusion GPS then--would you believe it--used Russian  Government sources for information for that Steele dossier.   Now, it is a fact, not merely an allegation, that the Clinton  campaign and the Democratic Party used a foreign intel officer and  information from the Russian Government to undermine the Trump campaign  and later the Trump administration. And that is not Trump. No, Trump  didn't do any of that. It was the Democrats. The Democrats' action  literally fit their own definition of collusion. Maybe that is why the  Democrats have failed to seek documents and information relating to how  and why the now-debunked FBI investigation into Russian collusion  started, because the Democrats would be front and center in that  investigation.   Special Counsel Mueller's investigation didn't look at the Democrats'  role in collusion, either. After 2 years, more than 2,800 subpoenas,  approximately 500 search warrants and witness interviews, and $30  million in taxpayers' money, that report ignored what the Clinton  campaign and Democrats did. I can see why President Trump would be so  frustrated at being incorrectly painted as a Russian agent.    So what is next? Now that the collusion narrative has been destroyed,  the Democrats have turned to Ukraine. First, the news reports said  Trump offered a quid pro quo, and then Trump released not only the call  transcript with the Ukrainian President but the intelligence community  complaint. Those were extraordinary acts of transparency, and with  transparency comes accountability. The call and complaint showed no  quid pro quo. The call showed that Trump was concerned about whether  Ukraine had a role in the debunked Russia collusion narrative.   This is a reasonable concern, and it is a concern that I share.  Accordingly, since I share that concern, on July 20, 2017, I wrote to  the Justice Department about reports of brazen efforts by the  Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign to use the  Government of Ukraine for the express purpose of finding negative  information on then-Candidate Trump in order to undermine the Trump  campaign.   Ukrainian officials reportedly ``helped Clinton's allies research  damaging information on Trump and his advisers.'' Moreover, Nellie Ohr,  the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, stated during a  congressional interview that Fusion GPS used a Ukrainian politician as  a source for derogatory material against then-Candidate Trump. It is no  wonder, then, that President Trump is concerned about Ukraine's  involvement in the debunked Russian collusion narrative.   The phone call also showed that he was concerned about then-Vice  President Biden firing a prosecutor who was investigating one of the  largest natural gas firms in the world. That firm happened to employ  Biden's son. Years later, Biden bragged about getting the prosecutor  fired. This has been seen on television a lot:         We're not going to give you the billion dollars. They said,       you have no authority. You're not the president. The       president said--I said, call him. I said, I'm telling you,       you're not getting the billion dollars. I said, you're not       getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here in, I think       it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I'm       leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're       not getting the money. Well--    Then he used a cuss word.         He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid       at the time.    The Democrats have argued that Trump has tried to get the Government  of Ukraine to look into this matter to benefit his political campaign.  Yet it doesn't sound like there is much concern from many on the other  side of the aisle about what Biden claimed to have done.   There is also another call transcript I would like to share. This one  says the following:         We put some more ideas down to resolve the airport dispute       we have with British Airways, USAir, and American Airlines.       Would you take another look at that and see if we can get it       done?    Further quoting:         It's sort of a big deal here. . . . In a political season,       it would be big over here to get this open sore resolved. If       you could have somebody take a look at it.    Well, that was President Bill Clinton asking for a political favor  during the 2000 Presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush.  I don't hear any objection whatsoever from the Democrats about the  substance of that call.   Now the Democrats have also accused the President of obstructing  Congress. Here, too, I think they have selective memory.   The Democrats in the Obama Justice Department didn't bat an eye when  Clinton's associates deleted records subject to congressional subpoena  and preservation orders. In March of 2015, Secretary Clinton's  attorneys had a conference call with Paul Combetta, the man who helped  manage Clinton's nongovernment server. After that call, he deleted  Clinton's emails with BleachBit, a software program designed to prevent  forensic recovery. Combetta admitted he lied to the FBI in his initial  interviews and got immunity from the FBI in exchange for agreeing to  tell the truth.   So the Obama administration gave immunity to the person who deleted  Clinton's emails after a call with her attorneys. To this very day, the  FBI has yet to explain why they took that course of action. During the  course of the FBI's investigation, it recovered thousands of work- related emails that were not turned over to the State Department by  Secretary Clinton. The FBI also recovered work-related emails that  Secretary Clinton and her associates apparently deleted. All of this is  very clear evidence of alienation of Federal records, which happens to  be a Federal crime.   What also troubles me about one aspect of the Clinton investigation  is that the FBI agreed to limit the scope of their review to her time  as Secretary of State. That eliminated potentially highly relevant  emails before and after her tenure that could have shed light on why  she operated a nongovernment server. It also eliminated emails around  the time of that conference call that could have shown what exactly was  intended in deleting those emails. That limitation of scope defies  reason.   Lastly, the FBI agreed to destroy records and laptops of Clinton's  associates after reviewing them. That is an astonishing agreement in  light of the fact that these records could have been relevant to an  ongoing congressional inquiry that the FBI knew about.   So where were the Democrats when all of that happened? Where was  their outrage at the potential obstruction of justice and obstruction  of congressional oversight? Seems to me that if the Democrats want to  be consistent, they will have to address what was done and what was  totally ignored in the Clinton investigation. Russia. Clinton. Ukraine.  The Democrats have ignored facts relating to these investigations that  would destroy their political narrative, but facts matter, and the  facts are not going to go away.   It is a shame that they have gone down this road in such a blatant  attempt to remove a duly-elected President from power simply because  they can't get over the 2016 election. Instead of coming together to  work for the American people and to pass trade deals and legislation  that would lower drug costs for seniors, the Democrats choose to gin up  false political controversies while ignoring the involvement of their  own political leaders.   Get over yourselves. All of us will be footnotes to footnotes in  history. It is the policies that we leave behind that will matter for  future generations, not smear campaigns.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, let me  give a short explanation.   The issues facing miners' pension plans are of critical importance,  but I have to tell my colleagues that so are the issues that face a  large number of multiemployer plans, and one of the biggest that is of  concern is the Central States Pension Plan.   Since last year, the Committee on Finance has been working on a  bipartisan basis to address the issues that face the multiemployer  system. We are nearing the completion of a comprehensive proposal that  will include financial assistance to the critical and declining  multiemployer pension plans and will provide long-term solvency to  these plans and to the longer term solvency of the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation, or, as we know it around here, the PBGC. That  proposal will include financial relief for miners and mining companies  because the situation with the miners' pensions should be handled in  the context of these broader, multiemployer plan reforms.   The Senator from West Virginia is a person with whom I work very  often and like personally, but I must object to this and take the  course of action of dealing with this in a larger context rather than  just for miners' pensions, so I object.    Mr. President, I heard what my friend said. I still  stick by what I told him, which is that we are working on a plan to  deal with multiemployers in many different situations of which the  Senator's is a very important part.
