 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my colleagues who are  here to pay tribute to the staff director of the House Intelligence  Committee, Damon Nelson, who passed away on Saturday.   As you see from the tributes that have already poured in and those to  come today, Damon worked closely with many Members of Congress for a  long time. He served 12 years in my personal office as my legislative  director, later as deputy chief of staff, and then almost 4 years on  the House Intelligence Committee as senior adviser, deputy staff  director, and, finally, staff director.   These testimonies reflect Damon's hard work and his enthusiasm for  helping others. He showed immense respect for the institution of  Congress and felt deeply honored to assist the people's Representatives  and to participate in the legislative process.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for coming today to speak  on the House floor about Damon. He will be deeply missed both inside  and outside these halls, and especially by his wife, Dana.   At this time, I am honored to yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Calvert), my great friend and chairman of the Republican  delegation from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Valadao).
