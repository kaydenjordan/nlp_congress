 Madam Speaker, Juneteenth is a day for me of  commemoration, not of celebration, because it reminds us of something  that was delayed in happening.   It also reminds me of what we don't have today, and that is full  access to justice, freedom, and equality. All of these are often in  short supply as it relates to the Black community, and it is still  delayed.   So, as we take this time to acknowledge Juneteenth and to recognize  Juneteenth National Independence Day Act--something I definitely  support--I pray that we do not lose track of the fact that we have so  much more work to do to ensure that we have the fairness, the equality,  the opportunity, whether it is voting, working, or just living  healthfully in the United States of America.
