 Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, as we complete debate on these three  bills and these amendments, I would like to say a few words in closing.   I know I join my ranking member, Mrs. Lowey, in thanking our  colleagues for the very constructive and civil debate over the last  couple of days. I thank the chairman, certainly Judge Carter, as well  as Ms. Wasserman Schultz and their counterparts for the other two  bills, for being involved in work products that have been part of an  open and collaborative process.   The Appropriations Committee received over 57,000 Member requests to  our database and through our Member Day hearings, the majority of which  are reflected in the bills that have been discussed over the last  couple of days.   Secondly, now Members have the opportunity to further make their mark  through the amendment process on the floor. The result, after two days  here, is that we have legislation that truly represents the priorities  of the American people. These priorities include caring for our  veterans, our troops, and their families; rebuilding our Armed Forces;  sustaining our national defense; and investing in essential  infrastructure that grows our economy and creates jobs.   I urge all of my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, to  support these bills. These are bills that fund Federal programs that  all Americans, especially our veterans and our troops, rely on to keep  themselves safe, protect their lives and livelihoods, and preserve our  Nation's ideals. These are programs that all of us can support.   H.R. 5895 begins the 2019 appropriations process on a strong footing  and fulfills our commitment to the American people that we will get our  work done on their behalf, and I urge my colleagues to pass the bill as  we go ahead to vote in the near future.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, with all due respect to the minority  leader, the process has been collaborative, Republicans and Democrats.  These are the three bills that have historically received both  Republican and Democratic support. They embody American values.   What could be more important than looking after our veterans and  their families? Energy and water, infrastructure. We are enormously  proud of the work of both the chairs and ranking members. I urge  Members, both Republicans and Democrats, to support these bills, as  they historically have done, and look after the interests of the  American people, especially those who serve in our military today and  those who have paid the supreme sacrifice.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1030     Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Zeldin) having assumed the chair, Mr. Byrne, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5895)  making appropriations for energy and water development and related  agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other  purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, each year, it is our constitutional  duty to provide funding for the Federal Government. We began that  process on the House floor yesterday, considering three very important  funding bills: Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military  Construction and Veterans' Affairs.                                time  1130    Mr. Chairman, these three bills focus on bipartisan values, caring  for our veterans and military families, rebuilding our Armed Forces,  strengthening our national security, and investing in critical and  essential water and energy infrastructure. These are among the highest  priorities as Congressmen and women. Please vote against the motion to  recommit and support this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.
