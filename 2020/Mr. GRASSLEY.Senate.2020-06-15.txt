 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, this time of year for the last roughly  30 years, the World Food Prize has announced a laureate. The laureate  announced this year is Dr. Rattan Lal. He will receive the prize for  his work on soil health at the annual ceremony that has taken place in  Des Moines for the last 30 years in October.   Often called the Nobel Prize for Agriculture, the World Food Prize is  awarded for exceptional achievements that advance human development by  increasing the quantity, quality, availability of, or access to food.  The award was created by Iowan Dr. Norman Borlaug, who is credited with  saving more lives than any other person who ever lived through his  pioneering work in developing new, more productive plant varieties and  particularly plant varieties free of disease. The Green Revolution  sparked by Dr. Borlaug made it possible for India to feed its people.   Dr. Lal, also from India, is being recognized for his work, which  will be of interest to Iowans and others around the world. Dr. Lal  said:         Achieving hunger-free humanity, soil degradation       neutrality, negative emission farming, and pollutant-free       water are among principal challenges which can never be       ignored. . . . Sustainable management of soil and agriculture       is also essential to keeping global temperatures within the       safe range and restoring the environment.    If people want to know who Dr. Borlaug is, he is one of the two  statues that Iowa has put in Statuary Hall. He is one of five people in  our country who have received a Nobel Peace Prize, the Congressional  Gold Medal, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
