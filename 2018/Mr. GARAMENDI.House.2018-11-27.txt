 Mr. Speaker, I will make this very brief. I know we  are up against the clock here.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Shuster so very much for chairing the  committee during my tenure on it and Mr. DeFazio, also, for his  leadership. I want to also express my appreciation to the new chair, as  well as the previous chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Hunter, with whom I  was able to work over the last 3 years.   Essentially, this is a good bill. It covers the things that the Coast  Guard needs. It increases their funding to a level that is necessary.  The title of the bill is proper. We all thank Mr. LoBiondo for his many  years of service.   There are a couple of things about the bill that I do want to speak  to, and that is we have in the bill a backup system for the GPS that we  so much rely upon now. It is finally going to get into the legislation.  We also move forward with Blue Technologies and the autonomous, both  air and underwater, vehicles that are going to be necessary for the  Coast Guard to fully carry out its responsibilities.   Beyond that there are some things in the bill that are a compromise.  I want to point one out that is very important, and that is section 834  to which I continue to object. This is a bill that actually allows for  an aged wooden ship to ply the waters of the Mississippi. The Coast  Guard correctly states that this vessel, constructed primarily of wood,  and operating the overnight passenger trade, presents an unacceptable  fire risk to its passengers and crew, and, accordingly, the Coast Guard  is opposed to this particular section. It is unfortunate that is in the  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters, one from the  Department of Homeland Security and another one from the National  Volunteer Fire Council.  [[Page H9649]]                        Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs,                            U.S. Department of Homeland Security,                                      Washington, DC, June 28, 2017.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Shuster: This letter sets forth       Department of Homeland Security (DHS) views with regard to S.       89, a bill ``[t]o amend title 46, United States Code, to       exempt old vessels that only operate within inland waterways       from the fire-retardant materials requirement if the owners       of such vessels make annual structural alterations to at       least 10 percent of the areas of the vessels that are not       constructed of fire-retardant materials and for other       purposes.''        Notwithstanding the form in which S. 89 is drafted, only       one vessel, the Steamer DELTA QUEEN, would be eligible for       the exemption. Because of the advanced age, construction, and       configuration of the Steamer DELTA QUEEN, the vessel       represents an unacceptable degree of fire safety risk to its       passengers and crew. Given the risk that a marine casualty       aboard the Steamer DELTA QUEEN poses to life, property, and       infrastructure, the DHS must oppose S. 89.        Background:        The Steamer DELTA QUEEN is a 20th century vessel, the       superstructure of which is constructed of wood. The vessel's       boilers are original and open directly to the wood       superstructure. Uniquely, the vessel's configuration has been       altered such that the sole means of egress is the stage       (gangway) on the bow.        In 1966, Congress stipulated that, ``no passenger vessel of       the United States . . . shall be granted a certificate of       inspection . . . unless the vessel is constructed of fire-      retardant materials (emphasis added).'' During the ensuing       decades, Congress temporarily delayed the effect of the       mandate as it would apply to the Steamer DELTA QUEEN five       separate times. Finally, in 2008, the temporary delay       expired, and the mandate was made applicable to the Steamer       DELTA QUEEN.        S. 89 would, once again, render the mandate inapplicable       with regard to the Steamer DELTA QUEEN, provided that the       vessel's owner or operator makes structural alterations to       those portions of the vessel that are not constructed of       fire-retardant materials.        Discussion:        The prospect of fire aboard the Steamer DELTA QUEEN while       underway cannot be readily dismissed. In 2008, the United       States Coast Guard's Traveling Inspector who was attending       the vessel for examination noted ``evidence of a lack of both       short- and long-term maintenance that adversely impacts the       safety of the vessel . . . [a]ll [of which has] to do with       unintended or excess but unnecessary fireload [sic] (emphasis       added).'' The fire load was concentrated in the lower decks       (i.e., the fire room, other mechanical areas, and the bilge,       as well as in other non-public spaces that, at the time, were       bare-wood compartments with no fire-rated insulation or       finish). This fact is significant inasmuch as the most likely       source of ignition would be the approximately 100-year-old       boilers. The boilers' footprint (height) is not wholly       contained within the steel hull; as such, the boilers open       directly to the aged and dry wood superstructure. Given that       the vessel itself is not divided by thermal and structural       boundaries, a fire within any one compartment could readily       spread horizontally and vertically. In a worst-case scenario,       a fire would begin in the boilers, overwhelm the vessel's       fire suppression system, and spread throughout the whole of       lower deck and into the berths and staterooms that sit atop       the lower decks. If so, the planned evacuation would be       hampered, if not precluded, because the only egress in the       present (and not original) configuration is via the stage       (gangway) on the bow, directly through the likely location of       the fire. And if the vessel's propulsion system too were to       fail during this scenario, the vessel could pose a threat to       other vessels and improvements on or above the navigable       waters.        Separately, DHS notes that 46 U.S.C. Sec. 3503(b)(1)(D)       requires the vessel's owner/operator to ``notify the Coast       Guard of structural alterations to the vessel, and with       regard to those alterations comply with any noncombustible       material requirements that the Coast Guard prescribes for       non-public spaces.'' However, as late as 2008, the Traveling       Inspector noted that:        Renovations, modifications[,] and or upgrades . . . were       found to be limited to those associated with the installed       sprinkler system only. Based on a review of Coast Guard       records . . . there is no evidence of further modifications       or structural fire protections upgrades since 1998 with most       activity tapering off after 9/11/2001. Some existing non-      public spaces, like the carpenter's shop[,] have been       improved by cleaning and organizing, which helps reduce the       fire load. Other non-public spaces, such as the laundry       room[,] still only show bare wood construction with varying       degrees of stainless steel similar to the galley, but as       indicated, the installations are not consistent throughout       with fire rating unknown.        The Coast Guard advises that, if it were to inspect the       Steamer DELTA QUEEN today, those non-public spaces would       likely still be found wanting.        Additionally, S. 89 includes a provision whereby passenger       vessels having berth or stateroom accommodations for at least       50 passengers shall only be granted a certificate of       inspection if, among other things, the vessel has multiple       forms of egress off the vessel's bow and stern. While       multiple forms of egress would be beneficial for the Steamer       DELTA QUEEN during the period while she is exercising the       proposed legislative exemption of S. 89, the implementation       of a new standard would likely result in an unsubstantiated       financial burden for the remainder of the passenger vessel       industry not equipped with multiple forms of egress.       Specifically, those vessels presently meeting the fire       retardant requirements are not required, under current       regulations, to meet a standard for multiple forms of egress       off the bow and stern. If S. 89 is enacted those vessel       owners and operators of presently compliant vessels, with       only one form of egress, will incur costs associated with       securing multiple forms of egress. Such costs will be borne       with no identified benefit; all while the vessel that would       benefit from multiple forms of egress, the Steamer DELTA       QUEEN would continue to benefit from an exemption to the new       standard.        Lastly, the DHS notes that S. 89 does not require the       owner/operator to install thermal and structural boundaries,       particularly about the boilers, and does not carry a monetary       or non-monetary penalty for failure to comply with the       proposed subparagraph (D) requirement. Given this infirmity,       and in light of the lack of past compliance or improvements,       DHS is not persuaded that allowing incremental alterations of       some percentage of the vessel represents a viable solution.        In light of the aforementioned, DHS is resigned to oppose       continuously any legislation that would provide any form of       statutory relief for the Steamer DELTA QUEEN.        The Office of Management and Budget advises that, from the       standpoint of the Administration's program, there is no       objection to the presentation of this letter to Congress.        I appreciate your interest in the Administration's concerns       and input, and I look forward to working with you on future       homeland security issues. An identical letter has been sent       to Representative DeFazio, Senator Thune, and Senator Nelson.        If I may be of further assistance, please contact me.            Respectfully,                                                  Benjamin Cassidy,      Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs.                                   ____                                   National Volunteer Fire Council                                                  November 19, 2018.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.      Hon. Brian Mast,      Chairman, Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation           Subcommittee, Washington, DC.      Honorable Peter Defazio,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.      Honorable John Garamendi,      Ranking Member, Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation           Subcommittee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, Chairman       Mast, and Ranking Member Garamendi: On behalf of the National       Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC), which represents the interests       of the nation's volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue services, I       am writing in opposition to a provision that was included in       S. 140, legislation reauthorizing the U.S. Coast Guard, to       exempt from fire safety standards certain historical vessels       wishing to operate as cruise ships providing overnight       accommodations to passengers.        As the Department of Homeland Security        (DHS) stated last year in opposing this provision: ``The       use of wood construction, even when supplemented by other       fire safety measures, has failed time and again to provide an       acceptable level of safety for United States citizens carried       on board ships.'' Fire safety standards have a proven track       record of saving lives. Our members see this every day       responding to fires in structures with and without modern       fire safety protections. Fires occurring in updated       structures are far less likely to kill or injure occupants       and responders.        One of the greatest challenges that fire safety advocates       face is the belief that many people have that fire will never       happen to them. The widespread adoption and enforcement of       fire safety standards has led to a significant decrease in       the number of fires, fire-related deaths, and fire-related       injuries in vessels and structures in the United States, in       spite of the fact that the general public underestimates the       risk posed by fire. I am concerned not only that the fire       safety exemption in S. 140 will endanger the lives of the       passengers and crew members aboard historical vessels, but       also for the dangerous precedent that it sets.        If you have any questions regarding this communication       please contact Dave Finger, Chief of Legislative and       Regulatory Affairs.            Sincerely,                                                    Kevin D. Quinn,                                                             Chair.    With that, I think I have consumed all the time  allowed. I will simply close in this way: All in all this is our third  effort to successfully pass legislation. I see the majority counsel  over there. I thank John so very much for working with us. And on the  minority side David is an extraordinary individual. It has been a  pleasure working with him on this, the third  [[Page H9650]]  successful passage of the Coast Guard reauthorization.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my Chairman on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, Congressman Bill Shuster, and my Ranking  Democrat Member on the Transportation Committee, Congressman Peter  DeFazio, to endorse and support S. 140, the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard  Authorization Act of 2018.   The Coast Guard is a special Federal agency, one that is selfless in  service and highly proficient in its work. Ironically, the Coast Guard  also is an agency that is over-worked, under-resourced, and rarely  given the thanks that the men and women of the Coast Guard so rightly  deserve.   Today, with the passage of this legislation, we can say that we are  at last stepping up and authorizing funding levels commensurate with  the many demands we ask our Coast Guard to undertake. The 2.6 percent  increases for both fiscal years 2018 and 2019 will go far to address  the deferred needs of the Coast Guard.   This stands in sharp contrast to the folly of the Trump  administration's skinny budget for Fiscal Year 2017 that actually  sought to cut Coast Guard funding by $1.3 billion--a gross mistake if  there ever was one.   In general, I applaud Chairman Shuster and his staff, and Ranking  Member DeFazio and his staff, for their cooperative and collegial, yet  determined, negotiations with the other body to arrive at a final bill  that advances or clarifies several maritime policy initiatives,  improves Coast Guard administration and management, and enhances Coast  Guard mission readiness and capabilities.   I am particularly pleased that this legislation advances the Coast  Guard's future use of new technologies to improve maritime safety and  security and maritime domain awareness.   Chief among these is my provision to direct the Department of  Transportation to establish a reliable back-up timing system to  function should the positioning, navigation and timing signals  transmitted by GPS satellites be disrupted or degraded.   The loss of GPS signals has been characterized as a ``single point of  failure'' for national security and for critical infrastructure  systems. Simply stated, we no longer can afford to ignore this threat,  and I urge members to join me and support this legislation today.   The bill also institutes a new acquisition policy for the Coast Guard  to acquire unmanned aerial systems, or UAS. The inability of the Coast  Guard to acquire UAS systems for its National Security Cutters is a  chronic problem. Restricting the Coast Guard to acquire only systems  already acquired and proven effective by other military or non-military  agencies, should enable the Service to acquire a UAS system that meets  its mission needs without, as they say, ``re-creating the wheel.''   In addition, the bill directs the Coast Guard to sponsor a National  Academy of Science study on the status of unmanned, underwater vessels  and their potential as mission platforms for the Coast Guard,  especially for surveillance activities.   This study should help inform the work of the Coast Guard's Blue  Technology Center of Expertise that Congress authorized earlier this  year with the enactment of Public Law 115-265.   I also want to express my support for Title VII of the bill that  reauthorize the activities of the Federal Maritime Commission and enact  some important amendments to the Shipping Act made necessary by the  disruption and consolidation in the global container shipping market.   Overall, I am pleased that this legislation would authorize increased  funding levels for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 for the Federal Maritime  Commission. Increased funding should enable the Commission to improve  its capabilities to monitor shipping trades that remain turbulent.   The bankruptcy of Hanjin Lines in 2016 and the subsequent  consolidation of the few remaining ocean carriers into three large  alliances produced shock waves in global shipping markets. These new  alliances also sent shock waves to U.S. marine terminal operators, tug  operators, bunkering operators, and other marine service providers.   Title VII of this bill amends the Shipping Act to make some targeted  and strategic amendments to improve the legal standing of U.S. port  service providers. Additionally, this title strengthens the authority  of the Federal Maritime Commission to oversee and intervene, if  necessary, in future interactions between these alliances and U.S. port  service providers to ensure fair competition.   I support these amendments to the Shipping Act as a good first step.  I expect that these ideas will require additional refinement as the  process moves forward, especially on how best to protect confidential  and proprietary information gathered by the Federal Maritime Commission  to understand market dynamics. I am open to those discussions and look  forward to improving the bill.   I also want to express my support for Title IX of the bill that  establishes new authorities for the regulation of ballast water and  incidental discharges from commercial vessels.   While perhaps not perfect, the measure does provide for uniform  regulation of vessel discharges within the scope of the Clean Water  Act. In addition, the legislation addresses several important issues  raised by coastal states, none the least granting states the ability to  establish ``no discharge zones'' if necessary to protect sensitive  state waters.   In closing, this bill is non-controversial legislation that addresses  the interests of the Coast Guard and U.S. maritime industry. It also  addresses the needs of the members on both sides of the aisle, and both  sides of the Capitol. I support the legislation and urge its adoption.   Although I spoke earlier to express my full support for the  underlying bill, I rise now to express my strong opposition to a  provision that the Senate inserted into the legislation over my  objection.   The specific provision is section 834, Fire Retardant Materials.  Nothing could be further from the truth.   What this provision actually does is reinstate an exemption from a  longstanding fire safety requirement for passenger vessels carrying 50  or more people on overnight voyages to be constructed using fire  retardant materials.   And although the provision does not clearly state the vessel or  vessels that would benefit from this exemption, the reality is that  there is only one vessel, the Delta Queen, an aged paddlewheel  steamship whose superstructure is almost entirely built out of wood,  for which the exemption will apply.   In 2008, the 110th Congress decided--wisely in my view--not to renew  this ill-advised exemption for the Delta Queen in favor of upholding  maritime safety. It was the correct decision then, and it remains the  correct decision today.   I have little choice but to raise my objections to this provision  based on the manner by which the other body tacked it onto the Coast  Guard bill despite the fact that companion legislation introduced in  the House, H.R. 619, went nowhere.   This legislation would waive a critical maritime fire safety standard  and consequently expose the American public to overnight travel on a  vessel that the Coast Guard maintains is ``an unacceptable fire hazard  to passengers and crew.''   The Coast Guard's position remains clear and unequivocal. As stated  in its 2008 Special Inspection report, the Coast Guard found that ``The  combustible construction of the vessel presents an unacceptable fire  risk that cannot be mitigated by the addition of fire suppression  measures.''   The Coast Guard also concluded that, ``The vessel, constructed  primarily of wood and operating in the overnight passenger trade,  presents an unacceptable fire risk to its passengers and crew.''  Accordingly, the Coast Guard has been, and remains, opposed to  legislation to renew the exemption from fire safety standards for the  Delta Queen.    Mr. Speaker, I have included in the Record the administration's  views letter stating its opposition to S. 89, which is the underlying  provision in section 834.   This provision also has drawn opposition from the National Volunteer  Fire Council. The Council concludes that the ``fire safety exemption in  S. 140 will endanger the lives of passengers and crew members aboard  historical vessels, but also for the dangerous precedent it sets.''    Mr. Speaker, I have included in the Record the Council's letter  stating its opposition to section 834.   I commend the Coast Guard for upholding its fire safety standards. I  fail to see why it makes any sense for the other body to advance  legislation that would sharply contradict the Coast Guard's  recommendations and compromise maritime safety.   The American public trusts Congress to ensure that our nation's  transportation system remains the safest in the world. Section 834  violates that trust.    Mr. Speaker, I wanted to move to the subject of  climate change, however, my colleague, Terri Sewell, has reminded me  that a very important organization needs a few moments, so I yield to  the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell), to speak about the Stennis  Center.                          Recognizing Rex Buffington     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi  (Mr. Harper).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama  (Mrs. Roby).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Roby, Mr. Harper, and Ms.  Sewell for bringing to our attention one of the important organizations  that develops leadership here in the United States, and, obviously,  from the two of you, Mrs. Roby and Ms. Sewell, who are perfect examples  of the success of the center.                            Climate Change Is Real     Mr. Speaker, we will turn to another topic, I think,  of interest, if my colleagues would just excuse me for a moment.   I always try to start these sessions with purpose. What are we all  about here? And I often use this from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and he  said: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the  abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for  those who have too little.''   While I always use this, I am trying to figure now, how does this  figure into climate change? What would the words of Franklin Delano  Roosevelt have to do with climate change in the era of greenhouse gas  emissions?   I thought about it for a while and I said, it may be difficult to  make the connection, but there really is one. And I really want to  start with this: What is our purpose here?   If we think about climate change, we are going to have to understand  and read and pay attention to this. This is the cover of an  extraordinarily important document that the Federal Government, the  Government of the United States of America, issued last Friday when  most of America was out shopping, Black Friday.   Now, maybe there is some reason that the administration chose to  issue this critical report on that day. If it was to bury the report,  they are not going to be successful, because this document, required by  Congress over the last 20-plus years, gives a clarion call to every  human being on this planet today.   That clarion call is so important that, on this first day following  Thanksgiving and the issuance of this report, we brought it to the  floor of the House of Representatives to alert this Nation that,  despite trying to hide this report on Friday, it is now part of the  public record.   We need to understand what the impact of climate change is on all of  us today, Americans, and to generations into the future. The impact is  stark. It is heavy. It is ominous. And it is already happening.   The front page says: Fires. I am from California. We know about  fires. This is a month ago, fires in California, all of  [[Page H9660]]  these at one time: the Mendocino Complex in my district, the largest  single wildfire in California's history; the Sierras, down in the  southern valley; and the smoke from the Camp fire, burning more than  1,000 homes on this day; smoke covering nearly the entire State of  California.   Are those fires the result of climate change? The answer is  absolutely, yes--the extensiveness, the severity, and the number of  acres burned.   More familiar, perhaps, and more recent, just days after those fires  that I just put up there, this one happened. Eighty-four people are  known to have perished in the Paradise fire, the most mass casualties  in recent history in the United States. Unfortunately, there are still  a couple hundred people unaccounted for.   Is this fire a result of climate change? Yes, it is--the intensity of  the fire, the rapidity with which it tore through the forest and wiped  out an entire town of 26,000 inhabitants. Fourteen thousand residences  were burned out in this fire. There is more to be said.   How about flooding? Port Arthur, Texas, a city that was flooded, and  more along the Gulf Coast this fall. Another community was totally  wiped out or near totally wiped out on the Florida panhandle. Massive  storms ripped through the Caribbean and up into the United States.   Is flooding a result of climate change? The severity and the  intensity of the flooding, certainly--North Carolina, South Carolina,  Florida, and Texas. In California, we have our share of it also.   All of these are words laid out in this climate assessment: Economic  losses today and into the future, perhaps $141 billion over the next  several decades from heat-related deaths alone; $118 billion cost from  sea level rise.   Do you live on the coast? The San Francisco Bay, Florida, a good  portion of Florida, Miami, the Everglades, the East Coast, all of it is  affected by climate change.   We have a problem, folks. Are you interested in ecology? Are you  interested in wildlife? Are you interested in forests? This was once a  green forest in California.   We predicted in the mid-1990s, when I was given a task as the Deputy  Secretary at the Department of the Interior to investigate and to  anticipate what climate change would bring to America, we said there  would be more fires, more intense fires. They would be more  devastating. They would be larger. They would be faster.   We said there would be more flooding. We said the hurricanes would be  even greater than in the past. We predicted that a city called New  Orleans would flood. We predicted that a place called New York City  would flood. And they both did a few short years after that report, as  we prepared the United States for the Kyoto climate conference.   Coming out of that conference, the House of Representatives and the  Senate of this great body denied the opportunity for the United States  to join in the treaty that came out of that conference, and it got  worse.   Forests of California, we predicted there would be a die-off. And, in  fact, there is. This is just one small part of the massive die-off of  trees that is occurring in the forests all across America, even into  the Arctic regions.   Pay attention, America. Pay attention, Congress. Pay attention,  Senate. And for heaven's sake, President Trump, please pay attention to  the reality of climate change. It is here. It is a massive problem.   The U.S. military more than a decade ago predicted that wars would be  breaking out because of climate migration, climate refugees. It is  happening. It is happening around the world.   Read this assessment of what it means to America. We have an  obligation. We, the 435 Representatives of the American people, have an  obligation to address this crisis. It is not a crisis of the future. It  is a crisis of today and the future.   Do we have the courage to do this? Do we have the courage to  decarbonize our energy supplies? We have to find the courage. We have  no choice.   Joining me tonight are people, Members of this House who share the  commitment to address climate change.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider),  my friend from the city of Chicago, to join us and share with us his  concerns.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so very much for  his very forceful words and for the fact that he brought to the table  not alternate facts, but real facts laid out by the scientists who put  this together. We have a challenge, and I know, with the kind of  leadership the gentleman is providing for all of us here in the House  of Representatives and back in Illinois, we have no choice but to get  this done--and we will.   Mr. Speaker, I would like now to turn to my colleague, Mr. Payne from  New Jersey. We often are here on the floor together. I invite Mr. Payne  to please join us, and we will talk about this issue as it might affect  him and his constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, in the gentleman's discussion, Mr. Payne  hit upon a really important issue, and it relates to this. I brought  this up because this is where I am coming from on public policy.   When FDR said that it is whether we provide enough for those who have  too little, normally we think about this in terms of economics, we  think about in terms of wages, living standards, and the like. But you  hit this squarely, because it is those who have little who are going to  be the first and most terribly impacted by climate change.   You talked about the vulnerable. You talked about the elderly, the  young, the working class, and communities of color. Those who have the  least will be the least able to adapt. They won't be able to afford the  additional electric bill for air-conditioning. They are the most likely  to get sick from the various new illnesses that will work their way  into the American healthcare system. As the climate warms, we can  expect to have more tropical, hot weather illnesses coming. We see it  already. West Nile virus is the example that you gave.   So this is very, very relevant. I don't think FDR had in mind climate  change when he talked about this. This is what  [[Page H9662]]  he talked about during the Great Depression. This is relevant today in  the era of climate change not just here in the United States, but you  look at the poor around the world.   For the population of Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the  world, it is likely that 50 percent or more of that population will  have to move because of sea level rise.   Ethiopia, where Patti and I served as Peace Corps volunteers, has  always been plagued by famine as a result of the climate moving back  and forth. It will get worse.   So do we provide enough for those who have too little? Across the  world this is a key issue.   Joining me now is my colleague from California. He and I get to share  the great Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the greatest estuary on the  west coast of the Western Hemisphere.   Before I come to Mr. McNerney, I am going to put up one of your  favorite things here for him to look at, because I know this is what  gets him really excited--clean energy systems. This has been his life's  work, and he can talk about it. When he finishes, we will talk a little  bit more about some of these.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, before the gentleman leaves, I brought  this up because I know that these wind turbines, these windmills are  part of the gentleman's life. You spent, as you say 25, 26 years  building these systems. I believe he was doing it in Altamont Pass in  California, which is now part of his district and adjacent to mine.   It was 1978, 1979 that California passed the very first laws in the  nation to provide a State tax credit for wind, solar, and conservation.  I was the author of that law. The gentleman and I go back a long, long  way here on this issue, Mr. Speaker, and we are not going to give up.  As he said, it is about the next generation.   I have got here on my phone, which I know I cannot use on the floor,  so I am not going to turn it on, but I have a picture of my 13th  grandchild, who was born yesterday. It is those children, that young  boy and his generation, that will either curse us or thank us. Thank us  because we had the courage, we had the wisdom to attack this problem;  or curse us because we didn't.   I believe that we have the wisdom. We have people like Mr. McNerney  who has spent his life working on this, both in the private sector and  now in Congress. I thank him so very much for that determination to  address this critical issue. I thank him for joining us tonight.   I have noticed the East-West show is back in town. Mr. Tonko and I  started doing this 7 years ago. Climate change and energy issues were  what we talked about back then. This was some of his work when he was  working in the State government in New York City, as I recall. Not that  he always talked about it on the floor, but he occasionally would point  out that he was working, trying to create the new technologies that  would address this problem. I thank him for joining us this evening.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Tonko said something a moment ago  that I know will happen. He is presently the ranking member of the  Environment Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce. In about 1 month I  believe he is going to be the chairman of that committee. The hearings  on this issue, the Fourth Annual Climate Assessment, will finally be  heard and the issue will finally be before the Congress.   It has been 8 long years of denial by the Republican-led Congress and  2 years by the current President. I know that in his role--and I  believe he will be the chairperson of that committee--he will make sure  that America and the Congress know and understand this critical issue.  I look forward to those hearings. I look forward to his leadership on  it, and once again to be on the floor with the gentleman with what we  fondly call the East Coast West-Coast program. We are back.    Mr. Speaker, indeed, we are paying for it in so many  way. I showed earlier the fires, the floods, the sea level rise that is  already occurring, the storm surge that recently affected the Panhandle  of Florida. All of these things are the reality of today. And it is not  going to go away.   The gentleman cited several facts. This is one of our programs that  we used 8 years ago. It is this slide. Eight years ago we used this in  our Make It in America presentations and we talked about the wind  turbines and solar. That is actually an electric bus made by a bus  manufacturer in California, the Gillig company. They are using that.  These electric buses are part of the future, as are electric cars.                                time  2045    All of these are the new jobs. These are the new technologies. These  are where people will be going to work. So that is where the jobs are.  These are jobs that won't be exported. These are American jobs. The  maintenance of this, all of these things are available today.   The gentleman mentioned California. Yes, California is way out in  front, really, competing with New York on who can be the best to  decarbonize, to move away from it.   Unfortunately, the administration is going exactly the wrong  direction. The President wants to do away with the mileage standards,  the fuel mileage standards for automobiles, wants to reintroduce coal  back into the economy, which is the worst of all energy sources. We  don't need to do that.   We can do it. We have proven that it can be done, in California and  other places, in other parts of the world. We cannot go backwards. We  owe it to the future generations.  [[Page H9664]]         Exactly.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Tonko mentioned asthma. We Democrats campaigned on a  better deal for the people, which I just happened to put up here: A  better deal for the people.   We talked about healthcare. Asthma is a preexisting condition. We  have a challenge to deal with the Affordable Care Act and the  Republican attempt to reinstitute insurance companies being able to  discriminate based upon preexisting conditions.   All of these things will tie back: job creation, new technologies,  research, healthcare. All of this, in one way or another, comes back to  this question of climate change. So we need to address it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Tonko very much for joining  us.   This issue is about those of us who are here today, but it is, far  more importantly, about those who will be in the future.   I want to dedicate this hour to a very special person, our new  grandson, Grady Christopher Bardet, who was born yesterday afternoon.    He will live in the future, either a very good future  that we and our colleagues here build for him, or one that is not.   To Faith and Eric Bardet, we love you. Thank you for this beautiful  gift.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
