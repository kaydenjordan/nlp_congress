 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the past week, the Senate has been  confirming President Biden's Cabinet nominees with significant  cooperation between both parties. Today, however, the Republican  minority has forced the Senate to jump through a series of procedural  hoops that will further delay the confirmation of one of our country's  chief national security officials, the Secretary of Homeland Security.   It has now been 8 days since President Biden was sworn into office,  and as a result of an objection from one Member--just one Member from  the Republican minority--it will be another 4 days until we can  complete the confirmation of Mr. Mayorkas to be our next Secretary of  Homeland Security. What could have been the tidy work of a few hours on  President Biden's first day will drag on for a week and a half. Make no  mistake about it--he will be confirmed. This dilatory action will not  succeed, but it will prevent the Senate from doing other important  business.   It has become a point of pride for the Republican leadership to say  that they are treating President Biden's nominees more fairly than Mr.  Trump's, but I remind my colleagues that former President Trump had his  first DHS Secretary, Secretary Kelly, confirmed on his Inauguration  Day.   There is a reason that there has been bipartisan cooperation in the  past to confirm the Homeland Security Secretary. Whatever our  differences on policy, both parties have agreed that the prolonged  delay of these nominations is no good--no good--for our national  security.   That is particularly the case right now. Our government recently  suffered an unprecedented cyber attack. In the wake of January 6, the  threat of violence and domestic terrorism remains a great concern. But  because of the tactics of some Republican Members--particularly the  junior Senator from Missouri--Mr. Mayorkas's nomination is being  needlessly stalled.   My friends on the other side don't have to agree with Mr. Mayorkas on  the final points of every policy. I am sure they don't share the exact  views of every appointment to a Democratic President's Cabinet. But  that is not a sufficient reason to oppose a nomination, especially one  as important as Homeland Security.   You don't have to take my word for it; listen to Michael Chertoff,  President Bush's former DHS Secretary. He said:         If members of Congress want to contest elements of       [Biden's] proposal[s], they are free to do so. . . . But       hostage taking is not an appropriate way to do this,       particularly if a result of that is to put the lives of [the       American people] in jeopardy.    Chertoff went on to say that actions to thwart Mayorkas's nomination  were ``irresponsible and unconscionable.'' ``Irresponsible and  unconscionable''--  [[Page S182]]  that is President Bush's former Secretary of Homeland Security, not a  Democrat.   Well, the Senate is not going to tolerate this irresponsible and  unconscionable delay. Despite the tactics from the Republican side, the  Senate will begin work on this crucial nomination today, and he will be  confirmed.                            ____________________     Now on COVID, Madam President, quickly, this Chamber  must also consider additional relief for the American economy and the  American people suffering from the prolonged effects of COVID-19.  Congress must pursue a bold and robust course of action to defeat the  disease, recover our economy, and get our country back to normal.  Again, our country requires bold and robust action.   A trio of economic news items this week has underlined the glaring  needs in the country.   First, the Federal Reserve issued a sobering warning yesterday that  the pace of economic recovery is weakening, and as a result, they  decided to leave interest rates low.   Second, the unemployment report this morning reminded us that jobless  claims are still extremely high--at or near 1 million per week. That is  a lot larger than usual.   Third and maybe most astoundingly, most striking, the Bureau of  Economic Analysis this morning revealed that last year, the economy  shrank by 3.5 percent--the worst year for economic growth since World  War II and the first time our economy has contracted since the great  recession.   Given these economic numbers, the need to act big and bold is urgent.  Given the fact that the GDP sunk by 3.5 percent last year, we need  recovery and rescue quickly. Everywhere you look, alarm bells are  ringing--mortgage deferrals are increasing, businesses are still  closing, schools are closed in many States, restaurants and bars and  travel are in crisis.   Our new Secretary of Treasury, Janet Yellen, who was days ago  confirmed with the support of 84 Members of this body and a large  majority of our Republican colleagues, just told us that ``with  interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act  big.'' That is what Yellen said. ``[T]he smartest thing we can do is  act big.''   Given these numbers, given the weakening state of the economy, only  big, bold action is called for. To cut things dramatically at a time  when the economy needs a boost would be irresponsible and hurt millions  of people.   We are in the midst of a once-in-a-century crisis. It requires a  once-in-a-century effort to overcome it. The dangers of undershooting  our response are far greater than overshooting. We should learn the  lesson from 2008 and 2009, when Congress was too timid and constrained  in its response to the global financial crisis and it took years-- years--for the economy to get out of recession. We must not repeat that  mistake today.   So the Senate, as early as next week, will begin the process of  considering a very strong COVID-relief bill. Our preference is to make  this important work bipartisan, to include input, ideas, and revisions  from our Republican colleagues or bipartisan efforts to do the same.  But if our Republican colleagues decide to oppose this urgent and  necessary legislation, we will have to move forward without it. We have  a responsibility to help the American people fast, particularly given  these new economic numbers. The Senate will begin that work next week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
