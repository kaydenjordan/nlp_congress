 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin my formal remarks, I want to ask for  God's blessing and protection on you; on my friend, Mr. McGovern; for  all who come to this Chamber today to speak and to vote; for our  wonderful staff that make this possible; and most especially for the  men and women of the Capitol Police and the other affiliated law  enforcement agencies that are here to protect everybody and to make  sure that this proceeding can go forward.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts, my very good friend, the distinguished chairman of the  Rules Committee, Mr. McGovern, for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, today is a sad day for all of us, for me personally, for  the Rules Committee, for the entire House of Representatives, and most  certainly for the American people.   For the second time in 13 months, we are meeting to discuss the  impeachment of the President of the United States. Our meeting today  does not arise in a vacuum and comes at what I hope and pray is the end  of a tumultuous period for our country.   Less than 1 week ago, Congress met to certify the results of the 2020  Presidential election. What started out as peaceful protests, turned  into a riot as an untold number of individuals stormed the Capitol  Building. Six people died as a result of this mob. It is only by the  grace of God and the brave acts of the U.S. Capitol Police; the  Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police; the FBI; the ATF; and other  responding agencies that there was not more bloodshed.   Violent acts such as these have no place in our Republic. These  shocking and sobering events rest high on our minds today, as well they  should. Certainly, January 6, 2021, will live in my memory as the  darkest day during my time in service as a Member of this House.   After these grave events, we, as a nation and as an institution, have  an opportunity to come together. President Trump has conceded the 2020  election. Congress has certified the results of the election, and next  Wednesday, President-elect Biden will be sworn in as the President of  the United States.   Congress and the Nation can move forward knowing that the political  process was completed as designed and that the constitutional framework  that has governed our Republic since 1789 held firm. But instead of  moving forward as a unifying force, majority in the House is choosing  to divide us further.   With only 1 week to go in his term, the majority is asking us to  consider a resolution impeaching President Trump, and they do so  knowing full well that even if the House passes this resolution, the  Senate will not be able to begin considering these charges until after  President Trump's term ends.  [[Page H153]]    Mr. Speaker, I can think of no action the House can take that is more  likely to further divide the American people than the action we are  contemplating today. Emotions are clearly running high and political  divisions have never been more apparent in my lifetime.   We desperately need to seek a path forward, healing for the American  people. So it is unfortunate that a path to support healing is not the  path the majority has chosen today. Instead, the House is moving  forward erratically with a truncated process that does not comport with  the modern practice and that will give Members no time to contemplate  the serious course of action before us.   In every modern impeachment inquiry, an investigation and committee  action has preceded bringing an impeachment resolution to the floor. In  part, this is to ensure that members have the full facts, the  opportunity to engage expert witnesses, and have a chance to be heard.  It also provides due process to the President of the United States.  Again, in every modern impeachment inquiry, the President has been  given an opportunity to be heard in some form or another.   This is necessary in order to ensure that the American people have  confidence in the procedures the House is following. It is also  necessary, not because of the President's inappropriate and reckless  words are deserving of defense, but because the Presidency itself  demands due process in the impeachment proceedings.   Unfortunately, the majority has chosen to race to the floor with a  new Article of Impeachment, forgoing any investigation, any committee  process or any chance for Members to fully contemplate this course of  action before proceeding.   Professor Jonathan Turley is correct when he called this ``a  dangerous snap impeachment--an impeachment that effectively would go to  a vote without the deliberation or inquiries of a traditional  hearing.''   Professor Turley also noted that ``the damage caused by the rioters  this week was enormous. However, it will pale in comparison to the  damage from a new precedent of a snap impeachment. . . .''   Mr. Speaker, if the majority is seeking consensus, this is hardly the  way to create it.                                time  0930    The majority is failing to provide the House with an opportunity to  review all the facts--which are still coming to light--to discuss all  the evidence, to listen to scholars, to examine the witnesses, and to  consider precedence. This is not the type of robust process we have  followed for every modern impeachment, and the failure to do so does a  great disservice to this institution and to this country.   Mr. Speaker, I could think of nothing that will cause further  division more than the path the majority is now taking. Rather than  looking ahead to a new administration, the majority is again seeking to  settle scores against the old one. Rather than seeking to heal America,  they are seeking to divide us more deeply, and rather than following  the appropriate processes the House has used in every modern  impeachment, the majority is rushing to the floor, tripping all over  themselves in their rush to impeach the President a second time.   What is worse, though, is the majority seems to believe this course  of action is self-evident, and that is simply not the case. I have to  tell them: it is not. Members have reviewed the same conduct and have  come to dramatically different conclusions. Legal scholars like  Professor Turley and Professor Alan Dershowitz, both of whom condemn  the President's statements, believe that his statements are not  impeachable. I know other scholars have different points of view.   Given this difference of opinion, shouldn't we have a better process  than this?   Shouldn't we have a chance to examine witnesses, discuss the matter  with legal scholars, and consider this in committee?   On a matter as grave and consequential as impeachment, shouldn't we  follow the same process we have used in every modern impeachment rather  than rushing to the floor?   On behalf of generations of Americans to come, we need to think more  clearly about the consequences of our actions today. The fact of the  matter is, Mr. Speaker, there is no reason to rush forward like this,  other than the very obvious fact that there are only 7 days left until  the new President takes office. But what is worse, as Professor  Dershowitz has pointed out, because of the Senate's rules, the case  cannot come to trial in the Senate until 1 p.m. on January 20, 1 hour  after President Trump leaves office.   This is an ill-advised course, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker. Even  Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, agrees. Senator Manchin is quoted this  week as having said, ``I think this is so ill-advised for Joe Biden to  be coming in, trying to heal the country, trying to be the President of  all the people when we are going to be so divided and fighting again.  Let the judicial system do its job.''   So what, then, is the point of the rush to impeach?   We are coming off a horrific event that resulted in six deaths. We  have an opportunity to move forward, but we cannot if the majority  insists on bringing the country through the trauma of another  impeachment. It will carry forward into the next President's term  ensuring that he will struggle to organize his administration. What is  worse, it will continue to generate the bitterness so many of us have  opposed.   Why put us through that when we can't actually resolve this before  the end of the President's term?   Mr. Speaker, I think my colleagues in the majority need to think  about this more soberly. We need to recognize we are following a flawed  process. We need to recognize that people of goodwill can differ. We  need to recognize that, while the House may be done with this matter  after today's vote, it will not be done for the country. It will not be  done for the Senate, and it will not be done for the incoming Biden  administration. The House's action today will only extend the division  longer than necessary.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would note that there are other remedies that  can be pursued. The President is expected to face litigation over his  role in last Wednesday's events. There will be criminal proceedings  against the perpetrators, and I hope all of those who stormed the  Capitol will be brought to justice. And some Members have proposed an  alternative procedure--censuring the President--which could garner  significant bipartisan support in the House.   I do not think impeachment is a wise course, Mr. Speaker. I would  urge my friends in the majority to reconsider. There is still time to  choose a different path, one that leads to reconciliation and hope for  better and brighter days.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to immediately bring up a resolution establishing  a bipartisan national commission on the domestic terrorist attack on  the United States Capitol. This proposed bipartisan commission will be  tasked with examining and reporting upon the terror attack upon our  Capitol that occurred last Wednesday. The commission will be bipartisan  in nature, modeled after the 9/11 Commission, and will fully be  empowered to undertake a full investigation and make recommendations to  the President and to Congress.   I can think of no more appropriate path for Congress to follow than  by ensuring a bipartisan commission reviews all evidence and reports  back to us on this horrific event.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis), who is the ranking Republican member on the House  Administration Committee, for a further explanation of this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Carolina (Ms. Mace), one of our new Members, and note this is her  first speech on the House floor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Jordan), the distinguished Republican leader of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), a new member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I advise the Chair that I have additional  speakers on the way, but they are having a difficult time. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute the distinguished gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop), who is my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Whenever the gentleman is prepared to close, we will close.  We were hopeful that one of our speakers would arrive, but they are  having a difficult time getting here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for presiding over these difficult  proceedings today. I thank my good friend, the distinguished chairman  of the Rules Committee. And I thank everybody who came to the floor and  had something to say at an important moment.   I think the debate, while spirited, reflected the civility and  decency of the institution that we are all privileged to be part of. I  am very proud to have been part of it. I am very proud of all the  Members and the manner in which they participated.   I want, again, to thank the staff and thank those who kept us safe in  the process, particularly the Capitol Police.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule, and I oppose the majority's actions  today. After the traumatic events of last week, the majority should be  taking steps to unite us. Instead, they are only dividing us further.   They are rushing to judgment, in my opinion, and bringing up  impeachment after failing to follow any meaningful process whatsoever.  No hearings have been held, no witnesses heard, no process or  opportunity to respond was provided to the President. No Members had an  opportunity to review or amend this article before it came to the  floor. This is hardly the way the House should undertake such a serious  act.                                time  1030    Mr. Speaker, there is still a way to unite the country. Let us look  forward, not backward. Let us come together, not apart. Let us  celebrate the peaceful transition of power to a new President rather  than impeaching an old President. And let us affirm and reaffirm with  one united voice that the House does not rush to judgment on the most  consequential action we can take. Mr. Speaker, we deserve better than  that and the American people deserve better than that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, as they reflect on this minute and  we move into our next stage of debate, to remember that we are all  privileged to represent a great and a good people. We have gone through  a horrifying and tragic time, and we owe them the opportunity to  reflect and we owe them our best efforts to bring everyone together.   I know people on this floor feel very passionately about this subject  with different points of view. I honor each one of those points of view  and I honor the people that voice them. Let's remember when we are  through this that we are one people and that we have one purpose, that  we are free through the grace of God and millions of brave Americans  over centuries of time and we will remain that way, and we will move  forward together once we settle this debate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question, ``no'' on the rule, ``no'' on the underlying measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
