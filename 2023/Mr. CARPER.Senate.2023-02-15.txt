The announcement and notice shall be issued at least       one week in advance of the hearing, unless the chair of the       committee or subcommittee, with the concurrence of the       ranking minority member of the committee or subcommittee,       determines that there is good cause to provide a shorter       period, in which event the announcement and notice shall be       issued at least twenty-four hours in advance of the hearing.
