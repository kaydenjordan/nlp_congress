 Mr. Speaker, I am against the rule and the underlying  bill. It is a little Christmas tree of unnecessary earmarks, billions  and billions of dollars of the American people's taxpayer money.   But you know the one thing that is not in there? Full funding for our  Nation's physicians. It is a travesty. In fact, there is a pay cut. The  very people who helped get us through the pandemic, and this is how we  thank them.   Shortages, burnout, low morale, retirements; I wonder why?   The American people should know what Washington is doing to America's  physicians and subsequently what is happening to the American people's  access to quality medical care.   Washington, D.C., needs to wake up and reform the way that we fund  our healthcare plans, both Medicare and Medicaid, and make sure the  very people that are taking care of the American people are properly  compensated for the years and years of training and expertise that is  necessary to provide quality care in this country.
