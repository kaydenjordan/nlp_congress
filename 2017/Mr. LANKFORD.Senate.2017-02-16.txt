 Mr. President, it is an absolute honor to be able to  rise and speak in support of Attorney General Scott Pruitt. For the  last 6 years, Scott has been a leader in the State of Oklahoma. He has  been strongly committed to enforcing the law in Oklahoma as it is  written and as is consistent with the Constitution. He is a statesman.  He is a dedicated public servant.   As the Administrator of the EPA, I fully expect Scott to be able to  lead the Agency to follow every environmental law and to partner with  States, local authorities, and tribes to do what is best for the  present and for the future. I have heard some people talk about their  opposition to Scott's nomination, saying they don't believe Scott  believes in clean air, in clean water.   That is not the issue for Scott. Scott absolutely believes in clean  air and clean water, and the accusations that somehow he wants dirty  air and dirty water and our children to be poisoned is ludicrous.   The question for Scott is not if we should have clean air and clean  water, it is who is the primary steward of our clean air and our clean  water. Everyone has a role. We are a nation that is connected to each  other. What happens in one State does affect another State. That is why  we have a national strategy working with the Environmental Protection  Agency, but in the Clean Water Act and in the Clean Air Act, the States  are given primary responsibility through what is called a State  Implementation Plan to determine what is in their best interests and  the best solutions to be able to deal with the issues of air and water.   Scott has fought for the State to be allowed to be in the driver's  seat with regard to all of the State resources, arguing for those that  work in wind farms, in oilfields, and on cattle ranches, for families  who have drinking water and breathe the air and who live there. The  people who should have the loudest voices should be the people who  actually drink that water and breathe that air and understand the  effects of it firsthand.   He has not been alone in this fight. As the attorney general of  Oklahoma, he stood shoulder to shoulder with more than half of the  States to ensure the Federal Government operates within the bounds of  the statutes and the Constitution. He has consistently argued that the  EPA, when they promulgate rules that violate that basic principle of  the State Implementation Plan, should stop, do what the EPA does best,  and have the EPA push the States to do what they should do best.   In an environment where Chevron deference is the precedent set, it is  critical that the leader of an Agency that has such wide latitude to  extract costs out of the economy, should respect the federalist  foundation we have, and the pocketbooks of hard-working families, as  well as our air and our water.   In previous congressional testimony, he stressed the importance of  laws like the Clean Air Act, stressing that the intention was for  States to work together under a model of cooperative federalism that  protects the environment while considering economic costs.   Scott pursued cases against the EPA and other Federal agencies in an  effort to enable and embolden our State government officials to craft  the legislation that needs to be done. His focus has been not to  eliminate environmental protections, it is to honor a country with  tremendous diversity, from rocky mountains to open deserts, to  beautiful woodland areas.   Surprisingly enough, the issues that we face on our environment, in  the concrete jungle of Washington, DC, is different than it is in  Woodward, OK. Let me give you an example of one of those cases that he  engaged in. It is a case where the EPA created a new regulation called  waters of the United States. It dramatically changed the definition of  what are the areas the EPA can oversee and increased their regulatory  authority by millions of acres in just one regulatory sweep.   The courts immediately stepped in and stopped this, and Scott Pruitt  and many other States' attorneys general said: The EPA does not have  the right to be able to step into almost every inch of our State and  say they suddenly have regulatory authority.   In fact, the court said this: ``We conclude that petitioners have  demonstrated a substantial possibility of success on the merits of  their claims.''   Furthermore, they said this: ``What is of greater concern to us, in  balancing the harms, is the burden--potentially visited nationwide on  government bodies, state and federal, as well as private parties.''   The court stepped in and agreed with Scott Pruitt that the EPA was  overreaching, and that case is still in the courts right now. That is a  reasonable thing to be able to do, for an attorney general who has the  responsibility to not only manage the legal issues of the State but  also to watch out for the consumers of the State. As funny as it  sounds, if you go to the EPA's website today and look at Oklahoma and  air quality, here is what it says. The EPA website today reads: ``CAA  permitting in Oklahoma. Clean Air Act permitting in Oklahoma is the  responsibility of the Air Quality Division Exit of the Oklahoma  Department of Environmental Quality.''   The EPA's website today says responsibility for this is from the  Department of Environmental Quality in Oklahoma.   All our attorney general has done is said to the EPA: You should  probably follow the law or at least your own website to be able to  handle all of the permitting issues of who has authority to do this.  For the past month, I have heard Senator after Senator come to this  floor and describe my great State of Oklahoma in a way that makes Scott  Pruitt sound like an ogre and my State sound like a toxic waste dump.   Let me give you an example. Attorney General Pruitt has been  dismissed by some who say that he has personally been engaged in  leading our State to such terrible air quality that the American Lung  Association has given the counties in Oklahoma an F rating.   Well, that is an interesting accusation, until you actually go to the  American Lung Association website  [[Page S1268]]  and see that they give almost every county in America an F rating. In  fact, they give every county in Delaware an F rating in air quality.  They categorize those under ``high ozone days'' and one of three  counties just barely skated by with a D in particle pollution for  Delaware, while in Oklahoma the two largest metropolitan areas actually  received an A from the American Lung Association. Similarly, in that  same study, Rhode Island lacks a single county that doesn't get an F  for air quality on high ozone days, while only two counties received  passing grades for particulate pollution.   The accusation that somehow the American Lung Association has looked  at Scott Pruitt and his record on environmental policy and has given us  dirty air quality is not actually true when you see the full study.   What is interesting, as well, is that the EPA publishes data about  whether counties meet the national ambient air quality standards, and  they have six criteria that the EPA puts out. In fact, recently they  dropped their criteria significantly from the previous years. What is  interesting, as well, is that for Oklahoma, last week, the EPA released  their national ambient air quality standards, trying to determine which  counties had attainment of the standard or nonattainment. Guest what.  Every single county in Oklahoma--all 77--have attainment. Even as to  the new standard that was just released, that we don't even have to  operate under, we already meet those standards for ambient air quality.   Meanwhile, Maryland has 12 counties in nonattainment for at least 1  of those criteria. Connecticut has eight counties that don't meet those  standards. California has 38 of their 58 counties failing to meet those  standards in at least 1 criteria. There are 77 counties in Oklahoma,  and every single one of them meets attainment.   I don't hear anyone standing on this floor challenging the attorney  general of California or of Maryland or of Connecticut and demonizing  them and accusing them of not taking care of the air and the water in  their State.   By the way, I have also heard on this floor, as my State is being  ripped apart for political gain, over and over that asthma rates for  children are catastrophically high in Oklahoma and that Scott Pruitt  should have been more engaged, filing lawsuits so that asthma rates  would go down--until you look at the CDC website for asthma rates for  children. It is 10.1 in Oklahoma. One child is too many. It is 10.1  percent in our State, but you can compare that to Rhode Island, which  is 12.4; or Michigan, which is 10.7. Vermont beat us, by the way. They  are 9.9--0.2 below us.   Again, I don't hear anyone on this floor calling out the attorneys  general of Vermont, Michigan, and Rhode Island and saying they failed  to protect their children because children have asthma in their State.   Another thing that is commonly said about Scott Pruitt and the State  of Oklahoma is that he is committed to conventional energy sources and  that he is stuck in the past, dealing with oil and gas.   I will tell you that Oklahoma is rightfully right proud of its  history of oil and gas in our State. We have unlocked resources that  have absolutely powered our Nation forward. We also have an incredible  group of visionaries in our State that are driving renewable resources  as fast as we are driving oil and gas in our State.   For all the folks that are here bashing oil and gas, I would remind  you that you traveled to Washington, DC, on a plane, in a car, or on a  train that was powered by Oklahoma energy. So you are welcome. And I  will assume that, 2 weeks from now, when we return back for session,  you are going to ride in on a horse just to be able to spite Oklahoma's  energy--probably not. But can I remind you of something?   What is often overlooked about Oklahoma and what has not been stated  here is that Oklahoma truly is an all-of-the-above energy State--solar,  hydroelectric, geothermal, wind, oil, gas, and coal.   Let me give you an example--just one of the examples from that.  Recent data shows that Oklahoma ranks third nationally in total wind  power. We just passed California for total wind production. We are just  barely behind Iowa and Texas. The installed capacity for Oklahoma  alone--just in wind generation--is 1.3 million households powered by  wind power out of Oklahoma.   I will admit that I am a little biased about my State. But I am weary  of hearing people inaccurately demean the air and water in Oklahoma and  try to accuse it of something that is not true for their political  benefit.   Here is my invitation to any Member of this body. Why don't you come  home to Oklahoma with me? I will buy you some great barbecue and drive  you around the State. I will take you through the Green Country in the  northeast part of the State, over to Kenton, OK, and Black Mesa to see  the majestic area around our panhandle. We will drive four-wheelers in  Little Sahara, and maybe we will drive down to Beavers Bend Park, stand  under the tall trees, and put our feet in the crystal clear water of  that river. I will even take you to my house in Oklahoma City, a  community of a million people that exceeds the EPA air quality  standards for ambient air quality.   We say in Oklahoma: ``The land we belong to is grand,'' and we mean  it. We are passionate about our land, and we are passionate about our  air and water. I will tell you that Scott Pruitt is passionate about  his State and what we do there.   I will tell you how political this has really become. Mike Turpen is  the former attorney general of the State of Oklahoma and, by the way,  he is also the former chairman of the Oklahoma Democratic Party. Mike  Turpen, when it was announced that Scott Pruitt was going to be tapped  to be head of the EPA, released this statement:         Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is a good choice to       head up the Environmental Protection Agency. I am convinced       Scott Pruitt will work to protect our natural habitats,       reserves and resources. His vision for a proper relationship       between protection and prosperity makes him superbly       qualified to serve as our next EPA administrator.    That is from the former head of the Oklahoma Democratic Party.   So far, my colleagues have found a good reason for every Cabinet  nominee to delay, delay, delay. This has now been the slowest  confirmation process for any President since George Washington. The  tradition has always been that the President won an election, and he  should be able to hire his own staff and his own Cabinet and get busy  going to work. That is what the American people asked him to do.   Scott Pruitt deserves an up-or-down vote, and he deserves our trust  to be able to take on and follow the law, doing what the EPA requires  him to do.   Scott Pruitt is a friend. I understand that some of the folks who  have attacked him have only met him at a hearing or read about him on  some blog site. But I have prayed with Scott. I have seen Scott  struggle with the hard decisions that affect our State's future. I have  seen Scott listen to people from all sides of an issue, and I have seen  him take difficult stands. I think he will be an excellent EPA  Administrator, and I think he will make some wise choices to not only  protect what is happening now but to be able to help protect us for the  future.   You see, Scott is a husband and a dad as well, and he cares also  about the future of our country. I think he is going to go after it,  and he will be able to be an excellent Administrator in the days ahead.
