 Mr. President, it is Thursday, one of my favorite times  of the week, because it is the time I get to come to the Senate floor  and recognize an extraordinary Alaskan whom we refer to as the Alaskan  of the Week.   Now, Memorial Day is fast approaching. It is certainly one of the  most sacred days in our Nation throughout the year. For this week's  Alaskan of the Week, Sharon Long, it is a day that is a particularly  profound day.   Sharon Long is a Gold Star mother who lives in Anchorage, and she  remembers her son, Grant Fraser, every day of the year. For her and her  family and for so many people who knew Grant and who served with Grant,  Memorial Day is a day when his memory is particularly honored.   Before I get into Sharon Long's story, as well as the remarkable  story of her son Grant, let me talk a little bit about what is going on  in Alaska right now as we, in our country, continue to face the  challenges of this pandemic.   We are doing pretty well in our State, medically, certainly. Things  could, of course, change quickly. We remain vigilant as a State, but  the number of people infected by the virus is very low. Businesses are  starting to reopen. Life, by no means, is back to normal, and there is  much that we are going to need to do to recover from this virus and  pandemic, which has very, very negatively impacted so many parts of the  great State of Alaska's economy--the energy sector, tourism sector,  fishery sector. We will get through this stronger and more resilient,  but it is a challenging time.   As you know, Memorial Day weekend commemorates many virtues in our  Nation: service, selflessness, and, of course, sacrifice. But Memorial  Day also commemorates and inspires hope. I know hope can be a bit hard  to come by during these challenging times, but I don't think we have to  go very far to see signs of hope.   In our great Nation and in my great State, hope is in the faces of  those we love. In Alaska, it is in our mountains and our glaciers and  our clear waters. It is also woven into the fabric of our country and  the soul of our Nation. It is at the very heart of who we are, and it  has been so throughout our history, often manifesting itself in the  battles that have shaped our Nation over decades and over centuries  that define so much of the American character and the people who fought  those battles and died defending their Nation whom we commemorate this  weekend. Hope is what Sharon Long and other Gold Star mothers  throughout our State and Nation who have lost a child while defending  America have to offer us.   So let me tell you about Sharon's story and about her son, Marine  Corps LCpl Grant Fraser, who gave his life for this Nation. From  Seattle, Sharon moved to our State to live with her aunt and uncle when  she was just 16 years old. She graduated from West High School in  Anchorage, studied political science at Alaska Methodist University,  which is now Alaska Pacific University, and embraced the great State of  Alaska with everything she had.   It was a heady and exciting time in Alaska. Prudhoe Bay Oil Field on  the North Slope was just discovered--the biggest oilfield in North  America. This is the late 1960s, early 1970s. The Alaska Native Claims  Settlement Act, one of the biggest land claims acts in U.S. history,  was being debated and then passed right here on the floor of the U.S.  Senate.   Sharon said: Alaska was a wide open place that wanted the energy of  my generation. She got to work. She worked at the Department of Natural  Resources, an agency that I had the honor of being the former  commissioner of. She worked for the Joint Federal-State Land Use  Planning Commission for Alaska, inventorying the abundant world-class  natural resources we have in our State.   Then she and a girlfriend traveled the world for a year and landed at  the end of her tour in DC. She was young, broke, on a friend's couch,  and she came here and asked for and got a job with former Alaska U.S.  Senator Mike Gravel. Some might remember Senator Gravel here in the  Senate. She worked on natural resource issues for him.   Eventually, she made her way back home to Alaska and met her husband,  [[Page S2611]]  an Air Force anesthesiologist, James Fraser, who made his way into  private practice. Sharon helped run the office, and they had two  wonderful children, Grant and Victoria.   So who is Grant Fraser? Her son. He was popular at Service High  School in Anchorage, where he graduated. He was an actor who loved the  works of Homer and Shakespeare. He was a mountain biker, a skier, a  pianist, a scuba diver, a rock climber, and a tennis player. He was  lighthearted and mischievous, and according to his marine brothers, the  only thing that could really rile him up was when they talked about his  sister the way in which sometimes marines, unfortunately, have the  habit of doing. He was a fiercely loyal brother. You could not joke  about his sister Victoria, who, by the way, now is a professional  soprano singer who has performed all over the world.   So Sharon and her husband James assumed that Grant would become an  athlete, maybe, or a scholar. He was a very, very smart young man. But  shortly after 9/11, like so many patriotic young Americans across our  Nation, he surprised his family and his friends when he announced he  was joining the marines. ``No, no, no, no,'' Sharon told her son.  ``That isn't the plan. You are going to school now.''   He told his mom: ``Mom, this isn't my scholarly time of life. I am  ready to serve and fight for my country, if need be.''   He knew he would thrive in the Marines, and he did. He planned on  coming back home in Anchorage to work as a paramedic with the fire  department. Grant and I briefly overlapped in the Marine Corps unit. We  both served in Alaska, Echo Company, 4th Reconnaissance Battalion,  which was later deployed to Iraq in 2005.   On August 3, 2005, in Anbar Province, Iraq, Grant was on a mission,  Operation Quick Strike, to avenge the killing of his fellow marines  that had happened just a few days earlier. He was riding in an AmTrac  vehicle on an attack into the city, hit a massive improvised explosive  device, and was 22 years old when he made the ultimate sacrifice for  our Nation.    Now, I love our military, but let's face it; sometimes it can be  bureaucratic and boneheaded. It took 11 years and tenacious work on the  part of Grant's amazing mother Sharon to finally get her son an  appropriate burial across the street at Arlington.   Just 2 days before the funeral, I was sitting next to Gen. Joe  Dunford, the Marine Corps Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at a  dinner. I told General Dunford about Grant's heroism and about Sharon  Long's heroic perseverance to get her son appropriately honored with a  burial at Arlington.   On an overcast day, September 30, 2016, Grant Fraser was put to rest  among his brothers and sisters, our Nation's heroes, whom we honor this  weekend at Arlington National Cemetery. Family, friends, and especially  U.S. marines from all across America came to that service to say  goodbye to their friend. I was there, and when I got there, I was  honored to see many marines. One, in particular, came to the funeral  early and stayed till the very end. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs,  General Dunford, attended in his dress blues out of respect for this  young Marine Corps lance corporal.   He later told me that when he read about what happened with Grant, he  couldn't sleep. He wanted to be at the funeral to honor Grant's  sacrifice and that of his family, especially his mother Sharon. General  Dunford stayed after most others had left to talk to Sharon Long,  Grant's mother, and his Marine Corps brothers. ``I don't live very far  from here,'' the General told Sharon. ``I will be checking in on Grant  from time to time.''   Now, I have been to a lot of funerals in my Marine Corps career, but  this was the most moving funeral I have ever attended. It was not  because of the presence of a four-star general and Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs, General Dunford, the most powerful U.S. military officer  in America--in the world, really--and not because of the serendipitous  presence of the Marine captain in charge of the Arlington burial honor  guard, whose twin brother was one of the fallen marines whom Grant  Fraser had been sent to avenge the day he was killed 11 years earlier.  It was so moving on that day because, on that day, rank didn't matter,  and medals didn't matter. That day we were all just Americans grieving  the loss of one of our own: mischievous, smart, Marine Corps LCpl Grant  Fraser, an actor, an Alaskan, a brother, a son. It was so moving  because of the dignity, grace, and beautiful determination exhibited by  Sharon Long, who epitomizes the love, suffering, and quiet sacrifice of  so many Gold Star mothers across our country, especially this weekend.   Sharon stays in touch with Grant's Marine Corps brothers. They call  her on Mother's Day. They send her flowers, invite her to their  weddings and to their kids' birthday parties. Two of them showed up at  their family home when Sharon's daughter, Victoria, whom we already  talked about, and her date were headed to prom. They needed to make  sure Grant would have approved of Victoria's date. I am sure Victoria  appreciated that.   Grant would have been in the same place in life as these young men  are now. As one of them said to Sharon: I came back home from Iraq to  live the life Grant couldn't.   Sharon is proud of all the men and women who have served, who served  with Grant and continue to serve. She understands their calling. She  understands their camaraderie. These incredible warriors in our Nation  give her hope.   With men and women like these, Sharon said: ``How can you not be  proud of this country? How can you not be optimistic about this  country?''   The lives of hundreds of thousands of America's sons and daughters  have been lost in fighting for our great Nation, and on Memorial Day,  they are in the hearts of all Americans. They are in the hearts of all  Alaskans. They are in the hearts of all Gold Star families, and they  are in the hearts of Sharon Long and her family.   Like Gold Star mothers all across the country and in our great State,  Sharon was fiercely determined to advocate for her son. She sacrificed  much but never gave up, and neither will we ever give up on them, on  him, or their memory, which we commemorate this weekend.   Sharon Long's actions recalled the Memorial Day words of President  Reagan in 1985 after placing a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown  Soldier, a place that is not far from Grant Fraser's eternal resting  place. As President Reagan said:         If words cannot repay the debt we owe these men [and       women], surely with our actions we must strive to keep faith       with them and with the vision that led them to battle and       final sacrifice.        Our first obligation to them and ourselves is plain enough:       The United States and the freedom for which it stands, the       freedom for which they died, must endure and prosper. Their       lives remind us that freedom is not bought cheaply. It has a       cost; it imposes a burden. And just as they whom we       commemorate were willing to sacrifice so much, so too must       we--in a less final, less heroic way--be willing to give of       ourselves [for our Nation].    Thank you, Sharon Long, for your brave sacrifice, for your dignified  determination, and for your hope, which gives us hope. As we head into  another sacred Memorial Day weekend, thank you for being our Alaskan of  the Week                            ____________________     Mr. President, I will speak now about the Due Process  Protections Act, which was sponsored by myself and Senator Durbin from  Illinois and which passed the U.S. Senate last night unanimously. I  thank my colleagues for their support for this simple but important  bill.   In fact, the Due Process Protections Act is so simple that it really  probably shouldn't be necessary, but believe me, it is necessary.  Unfortunately, it is necessary. I was pleased that this body passed it  last night.   Let me explain. The due process clause of the U.S. Constitution, as  interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the landmark decision, Brady  v. Maryland, requires that prosecutors turn over all material evidence  favorable to the defense. That is what a fair trial is about. If the  prosecutor has exculpatory evidence, as we call it, you need to make  sure the defense has it. This is such a bedrock element of our criminal  justice system and constitutional due process that the name of this  kind of evidence is simply now called ``Brady evidence'' after the case  Brady v. Maryland.  [[Page S2612]]    Now, the vast majority of Federal prosecutors--and, by the way, FBI  agents--who work in our criminal justice system are patriots. Many are  veterans, and they work day in and day out to keep us safe and abide by  their constitutional duties and obligations. They do turn Brady  evidence over to the defense, as they are required to do by the  Constitution.   The sad fact is, some prosecutors don't do this. Some choose instead  to win at all costs by taking shortcuts--not justice, but shortcuts.  And when I say shortcuts, I am talking about violating a defendant's  constitutional rights. The prevalence of these violations is not easy  to quantify--these Brady violations, as we call them.   One study--and I am not vouching for the accuracy, and this was a  study called the National Registry of Exonerations--stated that from  1989 to 2017, prosecutors concealed exculpatory evidence at trial in  half of all murder exonerations. If that statistic is even remotely  true, it is outrageous and needs to stop.    Such potential Brady violations have, once again, been in the news  with the prosecution of former National Security Advisor Michael  Flynn--GEN Michael Flynn. There are all kinds of articles now out  there. I recently wrote the head of the FBI on this very issue about  the potential Brady violations by Federal prosecutors that appear to  have taken place in this prosecution. What that has done in my State is  that it has opened old wounds--old wounds--and difficult memories.   My colleagues here--every single one of them--remember the late,  great Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska. As a matter of fact, his portrait  is right off of the Senate floor, an incredible new portrait that we  just put there recently. He was charged by Federal prosecutors with  making false statements and was convicted prior to his reelection,  which he lost because of the conviction by prosecutors.   Not long after the conviction, it started to become apparent that  there was prosecutorial misconduct in that very high-profile case, so  the trial judge in that case appointed a special prosecutor to  investigate this. There was a report that came out in 2012 by the  Justice Department, by the special prosecutor, that was highly critical  of the prosecutors' and the FBI's conduct. In particular, they withheld  all kinds of Brady evidence.   Just 6 months after Senator Stevens' conviction, it was revealed that  Federal prosecutors had concealed numerous pieces of evidence that very  likely could have resulted in his acquittal. Among the more egregious  examples--and there were many--rather than call a witness whose  testimony would have supported Senator Stevens, the government flew the  witness home to Alaska. That is pretty pathetic.   The prosecution also concealed that its star witness, who was  testifying against Senator Stevens, had an illegal sexual relationship  with an underage woman whom he had asked to lie about the relationship.  And to this day--to this very day--there are still questions about  whether the Federal Government offered that star witness, in exchange  for his testimony, leniency on not prosecuting him for violating the  Mann Act. There are still questions to this day.   The special prosecutor that the district judge appointed to  investigate the prosecutorial misconduct in the Stevens case found that  the Justice Department lawyers had committed ``deliberate and  `systematic' ethical violations by withholding critical evidence  pointing to Senator Stevens' innocence.'' That is the Justice  Department special prosecutor determining just how corrupt the Justice  Department was in prosecuting and convicting Ted Stevens.   Yet the special prosecutor, who investigated all of this also, found  that the district court judge was powerless to act against the  wrongdoers--the corrupt prosecutors--because the district court had not  issued a direct, written court order at the beginning of the trial,  requiring the prosecutors to abide by their ethical and constitutional  obligations as laid out in Brady v. Maryland.   It is a bit remarkable because every law student knows you learn  Brady v. Maryland the first year of law school. But somehow these  prosecutors across the street over at the Justice Department forgot  about it, and they were going to be punished. But the system of justice  said that you couldn't punish them because they didn't know because the  judge didn't tell them.   Again, I am not sure we even need a law to deal with this, but, as I  said, unfortunately, we do.   As you can imagine, it was maddening to the people of Alaska that  those who violated Senator Stevens' constitutional rights--and, by the  way, forever changed the political landscape, not just in Alaska but in  America; don't get me going about what happened there--these  prosecutors couldn't even be held accountable and were not held  accountable because they weren't instructed by the district court about  the Brady evidence requirements that they learned in law school in  their first year.   So in response to the Stevens case and due to growing concerns about  the unfortunate frequency of Brady evidence violations by prosecutors,  a number of Federal district judges began issuing specific local rules  or standing orders that explicitly remind prosecutors of what they  learned their first year of law school, which is that you have to turn  over Brady evidence.   But the Federal Judicial Conference's Advisory Committee on the Rules  of Criminal Procedure--so, essentially, the judges who advise on the  rules--has consistently declined to require all Federal courts to do  the same. So right now, all Federal courts don't have to issue  instructions on Brady evidence.   Well, today, Congress is beginning to change all of this. My bill,  which passed last night unanimously--the Due Process Protections Act-- codifies this practice and requires it of every Federal judge  nationwide by amending rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal  Procedure to require that a judge ``issue an oral or written order to  prosecution and defense counsel that confirms the disclosure obligation  of the prosecutor under Brady v. Maryland . . . and its progeny''--that  is quoting from my bill--at the beginning of every criminal case.    Our bill allows each judicial district flexibility to promulgate  their own model rule, but they have to do it. Congress is telling them  they have to do it, so they will do it.   Having this standing order in place will explicitly remind the  prosecution of their obligations--making it a priority to protect the  due process of all Americans, including defendants--and it will provide  for quicker recourse upon discovering any Brady violations that occur.   We obviously can't undo what happened to the late, great Senator  Stevens, nor can we undo all the harm it caused to my State, my  constituents, and, really, the people across America who have also been  victims of these kinds of violations because it undermines trust in our  system of justice. But going forward, we can work to stem the corrosive  effects to our democracy when prosecutors don't abide by their  constitutional obligations. We can work to ensure our system of  justice--the foundation of American democracy--is stronger and fairer  for all, and that is what the Due Process Protections Act will do.   I want to thank chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham,  for helping to facilitate this bill's passage; my colleague Senator  Durbin, who was my original cosponsor of this bill; and the other  cosponsors: Senators Lee from Utah, Booker from New Jersey, Cornyn from  Texas, Whitehouse from Rhode Island, and Paul from Kentucky. I say to  the Presiding Officer, you know those Senators. That is about as broad  a political array in terms of the political spectrum in America and the  U.S. Senate--Democrats and Republicans who believe in this issue, and  that is why I think it is so important.   Our system of justice will be fairer once that bill passes the House  and is signed into law by the President. I just want to thank my  colleagues--all of my colleagues--who voted for this necessary and  important and simple piece of legislation that, unfortunately, we need  in America today.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S2613]]                                ____________________
