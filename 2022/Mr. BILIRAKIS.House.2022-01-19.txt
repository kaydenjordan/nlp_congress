 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks the 1-year anniversary of  one-party, radical rule in D.C.   With Democrats at the helm, Americans have faced one crisis after  another, unfortunately. We have the highest inflation in 41 years,  supply chain disruptions, workforce shortages in critical industries,  spikes in energy costs; record numbers of people and drugs illegally  entering our southern border, a surge in crime, national security  threats, a series of foreign relations disasters; in my opinion, a  mismanaged pandemic, and countless examples of government intrusion  into all aspects of our lives.   Instead of addressing these problems, Democrats have doubled down on  failed policies, have engaged in out-of-control spending, and are  trying to control every aspect of Americans' lives.   This is not the way forward.   I recently asked my constituents one simple question: ``Is your  family better off than you were a year ago?'' Almost 70 percent of the  respondents said no. Fixing that problem should be Congress' main  priority.                            ____________________
