 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to  this budget resolution that would begin the process of repealing the  Affordable Care Act without a plan to replace it, and I rise on behalf  of my constituents who are imploring Congress to save the Affordable  Care Act.   Luanne from Coupeville, Washington, wrote to me. She said:         As someone with several serious preexisting conditions, I       could not get insurance coverage in the past. My husband and       I spent an incredible amount of money--including retirement       savings and out-of-pocket dollars--for my care and       prescriptions. There were truly times when we had to choose       food over medication.    And without the ACA, Jennifer from Lynnwood told me that her best  friend ``will be forced to work as many jobs as she can in order to  obtain money due to the costs of her pregnancy that will no longer be  covered. . . . . She needs the Affordable Care Act, as do many  Americans. Please, I beg you, do not get rid of it. . . . The  Republicans in Congress do not understand how much of us low-income  Americans need this.''   These are just two of the hundreds of Washingtonians who have  contacted me over the past 2 weeks.   Mr. Chairman, do not take away these lifesaving benefits from Luanne,  Jennifer's friend, and the rest of my constituents.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
