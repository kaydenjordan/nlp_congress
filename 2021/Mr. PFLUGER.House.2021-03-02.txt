 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, a  twisted conglomerate of partisan policies meant to consolidate powers  here in Washington, D.C., to fully cement the swamp.   This bill bans voter ID requirements nationwide. It permanently  expands mail-in voting and legalizes ballot harvesting.   Madam Speaker, I am particularly disturbed by the fact that, if this  bill passes, taxpayer dollars will be directly funneled to  congressional candidates and campaigns. The folks in my district, the  11th District of Texas, absolutely do not approve of their hard-earned  dollars paying for TV attack ads of any candidate, much less a  candidate they don't support.   Madam Speaker, we need real, commonsense reforms to strengthen our  election system. H.R. 1 does just the opposite. I urge my colleagues to  have this debate, to have a transparent debate, to talk about these  issues, and to come to the table for a reasonable, thoughtful debate so  that we can get to the real issues that the American people deserve.
