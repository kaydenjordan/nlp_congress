 Madam Speaker, the murderous Putin's  war on Ukraine is criminal.   I am grateful that America and our NATO allies are unified to support  Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian people.   I have faith in the Russian people, who I have met on numerous visits  across Russia, that they will reject Putin's war atrocities. A nation  of world-significant art, music, and literature can change, and that is  why I am introducing a bill to encourage Russian military defectors  with immediate refugee status in America, with up to $100,000 for any  Russian military equipment transferred to Ukraine. Putin betrays the  troops to death.   Additionally, I will introduce a bill for a bust of President  Volodymyr Zelensky to be placed in the U.S. Capitol, as is the bust of  Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Churchill was the wartime leader of  World War II, and Zelensky is the wartime leader in Putin's war.   God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long live Volodymyr Zelensky.                            ____________________
