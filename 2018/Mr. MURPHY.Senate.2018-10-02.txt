 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Candice Bowers overcame a lot of  challenges in her life. She raised two children as a single mother. She  worked as a waitress at Mimi's Cafe. She had a wide circle of friends.  She adopted a little girl named Ariel, who was a relative's baby who  couldn't be cared for. Ariel was 2 years old, and her children were 16  and 20, a year ago yesterday, when Candice Bowers was one of the over  50 victims of the biggest mass shooting in American history--in Las  Vegas.   In speaking about Candice, her aunt said that everybody loved her and  that she always had a smile on her face. She would help anybody. She  had a big heart. She was just a sweetheart. Robert Layaco, a 78-year- old veteran who served in the Korean war, who was her grandfather, said  that everybody else might forget about this in 6 months but that they  will never forget about her--he won't, her daughter won't, her little  daughter won't, and her son will not forget about her--in thinking  ahead to all the Thanksgivings and Christmases at which there will be  an empty seat at their dinner table. He said thoughts and prayers are  just not going to do it.   Angela Gomez was 20 years old when she was gunned down at the concert  a year ago yesterday. She had graduated from Riverside Polytechnic High  School in 2015 and was attending classes at a community college. Her  former cheer coach said that Angie was a fun-loving, sweet, young lady  with a great sense of humor and that she challenged herself all the  time. Angie enrolled in advanced placement classes, and she loved the  stage. She was involved in cheer, she was involved in choir, and she  was involved in the Riverside Children's Theatre. She had an amazing  life ahead of her--filled with joy, filled with enthusiasm for  performance.   Charleston Hartfield was 34 years old when he was killed in the  shooting in Las Vegas. He was a Las Vegas police officer. He was off  duty when he decided to attend the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival, and  that is when this shooting took place.   One of his friends said:         I don't know a better man than Charles. They say it's       always the good ones we lose early. There's no truer       statement than that with Charles.    Charles enlisted in the Army in 2000, and he was a paratrooper with  the 82nd Airborne Division. He deployed to Iraq in 2003, and he served  in a task force that was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for  extraordinary heroism. He survived his deployment to Iraq--one of the  most dangerous theaters of combat in modern history. Yet he couldn't  survive going to a concert to hear a singer he liked in his hometown of  Las Vegas.                                 Gun Violence    Mr. President, I come to the floor every week or so--a little bit  less frequently now than I did a few years ago--to talk about who these  people were. I think the statistics have kind of come to wash over  people. There is no other country in the world--at least in the  advanced world, in the industrialized world--that has numbers like  these: 33,000 a year dying from guns, 2,800 a month, 93 a day. These  are epidemic level numbers, and there are lots of different stories  inside these numbers. The majority of these are suicides. We have an  epidemic level of suicides alone in this country that is going nowhere  but up. A lot of these are homicides. A lot of these are accidental  shootings. They are domestic violence crimes. Suffice it to say, it  only happens in the United States, and it is getting worse, not better.   Certainly, I can show you a 200-year trajectory of how violence in  the United States is getting better, but in the last several years,  since these mass shootings have become so regularized, all of it is  getting worse. There seems to be a lot of consensus about at least one  very narrow-cast idea to try to reduce the likelihood that 58 people  could die all at one time, as happened in Las Vegas.   As we came out of that shooting a year ago, it seemed that we all, at  the very least, agreed that these things called bump stocks--these  things that are manufactured to turn a semiautomatic weapon essentially  into an automatic weapon with which you can fire multiple rounds with  one pull of the trigger--shouldn't be legal, that they shouldn't be  allowed to be sold. We had all made a decision a long time ago that  notwithstanding our differences as to whether these semiautomatic,  tactical weapons should be sold in the commercial space, we at least  knew that automatic weapons should not be available to consumers. Now  this modification was being allowed to turn semiautomatic weapons into  automatic weapons.   We are now a year since the Las Vegas mass shooting, and you can  still get one of these. You can still turn a semiautomatic weapon into  an automatic weapon with ease. In fact, bump stock manufacturers don't  need a Federal firearms license to sell them--you don't even need a  license to sell these things--because the Federal Government classifies  them as accessories, not as firearms.   To me, it is just unbelievable that our ability to work on the issue  of gun violence has broken down so badly that even on an issue about  which we profess agreement a year after 58 people were killed--and by  the way, 800 people injured--we still haven't done anything in this  Congress about the narrow issue of bump stocks, which turn a  semiautomatic weapon essentially into an automatic weapon.   In February of this year, President Trump directed the Department of  Justice to propose a rule that would do this. Just last week, the  Department of Justice announced that it was submitting its rule to the  Office of Management and Budget--one of the final steps in the  rulemaking process. Yet, as we all know, that rulemaking process takes  a long time. You are talking about a rule that will not be effective  until at least 2019. Even when that rule is put into place, it will be  easily contested in the courts because we all know that it is doubtful  as to whether the administration has the ability to ban bump stocks  given the nature of the underlying law.   It would be so much easier for us to just pass a law that says bump  stocks are illegal, thus taking the question away from the courts as to  whether the administration has the power to do it. We could also do it  much more quickly because this rule is still going to take months and  months and months before it is fully put into effect, putting more and  more people in this country at risk.   I wear my frustration on my sleeve when it comes to the issue of gun  violence because I just don't understand why there is only one issue  like this about which the American public has made up its mind. The  polling tells us that universal background checks enjoy 97-percent  support in this country. By a 2-to-1 margin, people want these assault  weapons off the street. The ban of bump stocks enjoys ratings similar  to that of universal background checks. Yet we still can't get it done,  and there are consequences.   If you look back over the history of this country, we have always  been a more violent nation than our parent nations in Europe from which  a lot of the original settlers came. Yet we are more violent now by a  factor of 5 or 6 or in some cases by a factor of 20 because the vast  majority of our violence in this country today is done by guns.   The data tells you that in places in the United States that have  invested in the kinds of reforms that we would like to take nationally,  like universal background checks or the bans on certain dangerous  capacity weapons, the violence rates are much lower and gun deaths are  much lower. So it is not a guessing game as to what works here if you  actually want to reduce the number of people who are killed by guns.  Ultimately, we know what works.   One of my chief frustrations continues to be the fact that we pay  attention to the issue of gun violence only when 50 people are killed  or when it is the 1-year mark of 50 people being killed. This is a  daily number. Every day, 93 people are being killed by guns, and they  do not make it on the evening talk shows. They don't make headlines,  but the pain for those 93 families today who will lose a loved one from  a suicide or a homicide or an accidental shooting is no different from  the pain that comes from losing a brother or a sister  [[Page S6425]]  or a son or a daughter in Parkland or Las Vegas or in Newtown.   Betty Sandoval had a toxic relationship with a man who had been  threatening her for some time. There were text messages found on her  phone, threatening her life if she ever left her boyfriend. One day,  she was followed home by this young man, who shot and killed her out of  anger that their relationship was going the wrong way. Betty was 16  years old and was shot in a fit of passion by a young man who had easy  access to a weapon with which to try to exercise his demons over the  relationship.   This is the story of America. We don't have more mental illness than  any other country in the world. We don't have more broken relationships  than other country in the world. We just have more guns. So when a  young man is really upset about how things are going with his 16-year- old girlfriend, he can easily find a weapon.   That is the story of suicides as well. There are tons of data that  show that if you don't have easy access to a gun in those moments when  you are contemplating taking your own life, you have a chance to  survive that moment, to get help, to have a conversation with your  mother or your father or a friend, and that gets you to a different  place. It is the proximity of that weapon that makes a difference, as  it did for Betty Sandoval, who died just about 3 weeks ago in Houston,  TX.   Dezmen Jones was 15 years old and Jameel Robert Murray was 28 years  old when they were both shot to death in York, PA. Of Jameel Murray,  one of his mother's friends said that he was always smiling. She said:  ``He was just larger than life.''   Classmates of Dezmen Jones said that he was ``a really cool person''  who ``had lots of friends.'' Dezmen was 15 years old, and he rode his  bike all around town, from friend to friend, back and forth to William  Penn Senior High School. He was 15 years old when he was gunned down.   Jameel's mother's friend set up a fundraiser on Facebook because  Jameel's family didn't have enough money to bury him. They didn't have  enough money to do a funeral, so they asked for donations online so  that they could give Jameel, who was 28 years old, a proper burial.  That shooting happened a week ago, on September 26.   Close to home, in Waterbury, CT, on September 2, Matthew Diaz was  shot in the back early Sunday morning in the Berkley Heights housing  complex. This is about 3 miles from our house in Connecticut. He was  the father of two. He had an 11-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter.  Imagine having to tell an 11-year-old kid: Your dad is gone, and he is  never coming back.   Matthew's mother said:         He loved his children to the fullest. He would do anything       for his children. He would do anything for me. He was my       friend, my protector, my comedian.    Diaz was unconscious when the police found him. They tried to perform  CPR, but he was pronounced dead about an hour after arriving at the  hospital.   Every single one of these stories is exceptional because when an 11- year-old loses a dad or when you lose your mom or when a newly adopted  2-year-old no longer has her adoptive mother, everything changes.  Everything is cataclysmically different for those families.   There are 93 of those stories every single day, and it doesn't have  to be that way. It is not inevitable. It is within our control.   I think these numbers just tend to stun people after a while. I think  these numbers don't mean anything to folks. So I am going to continue  to come to the floor and tell the stories of these victims, to give  voices to these victims, especially today as we mark 1 year since the  worst mass shooting in the history of the country. We recognize 1 full  year since we pledged to do something about it, since we talked about  the narrow area of agreement around bump stocks, 1 full year of total  inaction on the one thing we thought--we thought--we could do together  to make the country a safer place.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
