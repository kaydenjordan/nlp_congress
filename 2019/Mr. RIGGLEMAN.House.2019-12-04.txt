 Mr. Speaker, ``Right under your nose: A Mexican cartel  turned this rural area into a hidden cocaine hub,'' reads the headline  from over the weekend from our newspaper in southern Virginia.   This article goes on to explain how a drug cartel has smuggled super  pure meth, cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, and other drugs throughout the  southern Virginia countryside.   I have spoken on this floor about the dangers our rural communities  face from illicit drug trafficking, and now in my district, Mexican  cartels, famous for their extreme violence, are tearing local  communities to shreds.   I have taken action. I voted to provide funding that will help CBP  agents stop drugs at the border. Securing our border cuts the head off  the snake of these violent cartels. I have aided local law enforcement  and pushed for drug trafficking designations in my district, and I have  worked to fund treatment programs that help those battling addiction.   We need to fight back against drug trafficking and take back the  communities we call home.                            ____________________
