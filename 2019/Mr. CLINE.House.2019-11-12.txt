 Mr. Speaker, yesterday was Veterans Day, and while we were  all back in our district and while we should thank our veterans every  day for standing in defense of our Nation, November 11 is a day when we  all can join together as Americans to thank these courageous heroes.   I rise today to congratulate one specific business, Tactical and  Survival Specialties, Incorporated, of Harrisonburg for being awarded  the U.S. Department of Labor's HIRE Vets Medallion.   This prestigious honor is the only program within the Federal  Government that recognizes the meaningful and verifiable efforts  undertaken by job creators to hire and retain our veterans.   Tactical and Survival Specialties, Incorporated, was founded by  retired U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Bill Strang in 1980, and  the business is one of the oldest tactical equipment suppliers in the  United States. TSSi is committed to providing state-of-the-art  equipment to military, law enforcement, and disaster response  professionals all over the world.    I applaud TSSi on being one of a select few awardees across the  Nation, and I thank all the employers who have demonstrated outstanding  efforts to hire, train, and retain our veterans.                            ____________________
