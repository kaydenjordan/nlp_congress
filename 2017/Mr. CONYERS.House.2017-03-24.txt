 Mr. Speaker, I've been here a while and it's hard for me  to recall a time when we've voted on something so obviously and  willfully harmful to children, seniors and working Americans.   This bill strips healthcare from 24 million people.   It requires some seniors to pay 100 percent or more of their income  in premiums.   This legislation dramatically cuts Medicaid, directly contradicting  President Trump's claim not to.   In Michigan, HALF of all children rely on Medicaid.   In my district alone, 56,000 people will lose coverage, including  16,000 children.   Let's be clear: if we pass this bill, children, seniors, and working  people will suffer and some will die, so that the wealthy can get a tax  cut.   Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. That's why I support a  single-payer, Medicare-for-All plan, and why I will be voting ``no'' on  this mean spirited legislation.   Mr. Speaker, as Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee, I  include in the Record a legal analysis prepared by committee staff that  concludes that the provision of H.R. 1628 that requires New York State  to change how its counties fund the State's portion of Medicaid  expenses is not related to a legitimate Federal interest, that no  rational Federal purpose has been proffered for the provision, and that  it would severely intrude on traditional state prerogatives. As such,  this provision would violate Constitutional limits on the Federal  Spending Power, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses and the  Tenth Amendment (reserving all undelegated powers to the States) and  would likely be held unconstitutional if challenged in court.                                 Memorandum       To: Interested Members.      From: House Judiciary Committee Democratic Staff.      Re: Constitutionality of Faso-Collins Amendment.      Date: March 24, 2017.        The Faso-Collins amendment, incorporated into the Manager's       amendment, would violate Constitutional limits on the Federal       Spending Power, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses       and the Tenth Amendment (reserving all undelegated powers to       the States). Requiring New York State to change how its       counties Fund its portion of Medicaid expenses is not related       to a legitimate Federal interest, no rational Federal purpose       has been proffered for the provision, and it would severely       intrude on traditional state prerogatives.        If the Faso-Collins amendment were ever enacted, it quickly       would be invalidated by the Federal courts. The irony of this       ``buyout'' is that the ``payment'' supposedly being delivered       in exchange for votes--the unconstitutional provision--is the       legislative equivalent of a check on a closed bank account,       which will never deliver the promised benefits.        For the last 51 years, New York State has chosen to fund a       portion of its share of the Medicaid Program by using funds       from county property taxes. Fifteen other States structure       Medicaid funding through a similar legally authorized system.        The Faso-Collins amendment specifies that any State that       had an allotment of Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH)       funds that was more than 6 times the national average, and       that requires subdivisions with populations of less than       5,000,000 to contribute toward Medicaid costs, shall have its       reimbursement reduced by the amount of contributions by such       subdivisions. (This effectively limits the application to New       York State, and carves out New York City.) Under the       amendment, New York State is at risk of losing $2.3 billion       of its $32 billion in Federal Medicaid funds.        This provision is unconstitutional, and could be struck       down for several reasons:        Violation of Limits on Spending Power--Article I of the       Constitution grants Congress spending power to ``provide for       the . . . general Welfare.'' In South Dakota v. Dole, 483       U.S. 203 (1987), the Supreme Court held that any spending       condition imposed on the States must be related to the       Federal interest in that particular project or program and       that Congress cannot coerce the States into compliance with       the Federal government's objectives. In NFIB v. Sebelius, 132       S. Ct. 2566 (2012), the Supreme Court found provisions of the       Affordable Care Act which required all States to comply with       the law's Medicaid expansion violated this spending       authority, noting the ``Constitution has never been       understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the       States to govern according to Congress' instructions.'' The       Faso-Collins language does not appear to be related to any       Federal interest in the use or allocation of Federal Medicaid       funds: it does not further Medicaid's purposes and has       nothing to do with ensuring the proper disbursement of       Federal funds. Indeed, because the provision applies to       counties in a single State--and leaves the very same system       undisturbed in 15 other States--it could not possibly be       justified by any legitimate Federal interest.        An additional line of Supreme Court cases, including New       York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167, 172 (1992), has       held that conditions on Federal grants must be ``reasonably       related to the purpose of the [Federal] expenditure'' because       otherwise ``the spending power could render academic the       Constitution's other grants and limits of Federal       authority.'' Likewise, in Massachusetts v. United States, 435       U.S. 444, 461 (1978), the Supreme Court noted that it has       ``repeatedly held that the Federal Government may impose       appropriate conditions on the use of Federal property or       privileges and may require that State instrumentalities       comply with conditions that are reasonably related to the       Federal interest in particular national projects or       programs.'' Under these precedents, the Faso-Collins language       would be held to be an arbitrary exercise of Federal power       which intrudes on only one particular State's sovereign tax       powers, and is unrelated to any Federal interest or purpose       in the Medicaid Program.        As Yale Law School Professor Abbe Gluck wrote in a post on       the Balkinzation blog today, the Faso-Collins ``amendment is       likely unconstitutional. The protection from federal       interference of the internal functions of a state government       is one of the bedrocks of state sovereignty protected by the       limitations on Congress's powers in Article I of the       Constitution and the reservation of power to the states in       the Tenth Amendment.'' She further reasoned that ``Even if       one could argue that this is an exercise of the federal       spending power under Article I, for Congress to legally use       that power, the conditions on a state's use of federal       funding have to be tied to a reasonable federal propose . . .       It is hard to see a reasonable federal purpose here other       than garnering more GOP votes for the struggling repeal       bill.'' (available at https://ballkin.blogspot.com/2017/03/ is-gop-aca-repealer-unconstitutional-on.html?m=1)        Violation of Due Process and Equal Protection--Under the       Fifth Amendment, the Federal government is not permitted to       deprive its citizens of equal protection or due process of       law. Those clauses have been interpreted on numerous       occasions to prevent the government from discriminating       between the treatment of the sovereign States absent a       rational basis. For example, in Helvering v. David, 301 U.S.       619, 640 (1937), the Supreme Court warned that Congress does       not possess the right to demonstrate a ``display of arbitrary       power'' in its treatment of the various States. In this       regard, in 2009, when an earlier Senate version of the       Affordable Care Act sought to provide special treatment for       Nebraska with respect to Medicaid reimbursements, 13       Republican State attorneys general wrote to Congress       (available at http://www.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/ files/microsites/career-servicesifiles/Letter%20to%       20the%20 Honorable%20Nancy %20Pelosi%20 and%20the       %20Honorable%20Harry %20Reid.pdf) asserting the provision was       unconstitutional (the provision was ultimately dropped). In       the case of the Faso-Collins language, there is no legitimate       policy justification for developing a special rule limiting       Medicaid funds for New York as compared to all other States,       including 15 States which have sharing agreements with their       counties. Nor has a justification been offered for why New       York City should be excluded from the application of the       special rule. As such, it is clear that the provision is       discriminatory, ``arbitrary'' and has no rational basis.        Abrogation of Tenth Amendment Principles--The Tenth       Amendment provides in relevant part that powers not delegated       to the Federal government or prohibited to the States are       reserved for the States. This has been read to prevent the       federal government from ``commandeering'' the states to serve       its own purposes. In Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898       (1997), the Supreme Court held that Congress cannot       commandeer State officers to implement Federal policy--in       that case requiring criminal background checks for handgun       purchases pursuant to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention       Act. The Faso-Collins language commandeers New York State       government to facilitate the partisan political ends of a       faction in the U.S. Congress, which would seem well outside       the proscriptions of Printz. In fact, by essentially ordering       New York to reorganize its internal affairs, the Faso-Collins       amendment may run even further afoul of Tenth Amendment       principles than was the case in Printz given the lack of a       Federal purpose and the interference with the core sovereign       function of how a State chooses to use its taxing power.        It is of particular constitutional concern that the Faso-      Collins provision directly interferes with New York's       internal decisions about how to structure its own tax and       spending policies, and how to allocate those responsibilities       between the State and its subdivisions--which is a core       function of a sovereign entity protected by the Tenth       Amendment (and potentially Article IV Sec. 4 of the       Constitution, which provides that the ``United States shall       guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of       Government.''). This is constitutionally significant because       in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 575 (1964), the Supreme       Court held that political subdivisions such as counties and       cities ``have been traditionally regarded as subordinate       governmental instrumentalities created by the State to assist       in the carrying  [[Page H2441]]       out of State governmental functions.'' In Hunter v. City of       Pittsburgh, 207 U.S. 161, 178 (1907), the Court noted that       these subdivisions are ``created as convenient agencies for       exercising such of the governmental powers of the state, as       may be entrusted to them'' and that the ``number, nature, and       duration of powers conferred upon these [entities] and the       territory over which they shall be exercised rests in the       absolute discretion of the state.'' The Faso-Collins       amendment purports to invoke Federal power to displace New       York's sovereign exercise of this ``absolute discretion''       and, for that reason, violates the Constitution. As Chief       Justice John Marshall long ago explained in Gibbons v. Ogden,       22 U.S. 1, 198-200 (1824), the States' ``power of taxation is       indispensable to their existence. . . . In imposing taxes for       State purposes, [States] are not doing what Congress is       empowered to do. Congress is not empowered to tax for those       purposes which are within the exclusive province of the       States.''                                   ____                                     Office of the Attorney General,                                         State of South Carolina,                                                  December 30, 2009.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Harry Reid,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        The undersigned state attorneys general, in response to       numerous inquiries, write to express our grave concern with       the Senate version of the Patient Protection and Affordable       Care Act (``H.R. 3590''). The current iteration of the bill       contains a provision that affords special treatment to the       state of Nebraska under the federal Medicaid program. We       believe this provision is constitutionally flawed. As chief       legal officers of our states we are contemplating a legal       challenge to this provision and we ask you to take action to       render this challenge unnecessary by striking that provision.        It has been reported that Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson's       vote, for H.R. 3590, was secured only after striking a deal       that the federal government would bear the cost of newly       eligible Nebraska Medicaid enrollees. In marked contrast all       other states would not be similarly treated, and instead       would be required to allocate substantial sums, potentially       totaling billions of dollars, to accommodate H.R. 3590's new       Medicaid mandates. In addition to violating the most basic       and universally held notions of what is fair and just, we       also believe this provision of H.R. 3590 is inconsistent with       protections afforded by the United States Constitution       against arbitrary legislation.        In Helvering v. Davis, 301 U.S 619, 640 (1937), the United       States Supreme Court warned that Congress does not possess       the right under the Spending Power to demonstrate a ``display       of arbitrary power.'' Congressional spending cannot be       arbitrary and capricious. The spending power of Congress       includes authority to accomplish policy objectives by       conditioning receipt of federal funds on compliance with       statutory directives, as in the Medicaid program. However,       the power is not unlimited and ``must be in pursuit of the       `general welfare.' '' South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207       (1987). In Dole the Supreme Court stated, ``that conditions       on federal grants might be illegitimate if they are unrelated       to the federal interest in particular national projects or       programs.'' Id. at 207. It seems axiomatic that the federal       interest in H.R. 3590 is not simply requiring universal       health care, but also ensuring that the states share with the       federal government the cost of providing such care to their       citizens. This federal interest is evident from the fact this       legislation would require every state, except Nebraska, to       shoulder its fair share of the increased Medicaid costs the       bill will generate. The provision of the bill that relieves a       single state from this cost-sharing program appears to be not       only unrelated, but also antithetical to the legitimate       federal interests in the bill.        The fundamental unfairness of H.R. 3590 may also give rise       to claims under the due process, equal protection, privileges       and immunities clauses and other provisions of the       Constitution. As a practical matter, the deal struck by the       United States Senate on the ``Nebraska Compromise'' is a       disadvantage to the citizens of 49 states. Every state's tax       dollars, except Nebraska's, will be devoted to cost-sharing       required by the bill, and will be therefore unavailable for       other essential state programs. Only the citizens of Nebraska       will be freed from this diminution in state resources for       critical state services. Since the only basis for the       Nebraska preference is arbitrary and unrelated to the       substance of the legislation, it is unlikely that the       difference would survive even minimal scrutiny.        We ask that Congress delete the Nebraska provision from the       pending legislation, as we prefer to avoid litigation.       Because this provision has serious implications for the       country and the future of our nation's legislative process,       we urge you to take appropriate steps to protect the       Constitution and the rights of the citizens of our nation. We       believe this issue is readily resolved by removing the       provision in question from the bill, and we ask that you do       so.        By singling out the particular provision relating to       special treatment of Nebraska, we do not suggest there are no       other legal or constitutional issues in the proposed health       care legislation.        Please let us know if we can be of assistance as you       consider this matter.            Sincerely,        Henry McMaster, Attorney General, South Carolina; Rob       McKenna, Attorney General, Washington; Mike Cox, Attorney       General, Michigan; Greg Abbott, Attorney General, Texas; John       Suthers, Attorney General, Colorado; Troy King, Attorney       General, Alabama; Wayne Stenehjem, Attorney General, North       Dakota; Bill Mims, Attorney General, Virginia; Tom Corbett,       Attorney General, Pennsylvania; Mark Shurtleff, Attorney       General, Utah; Bill McCollum, Attorney General, Florida;       Lawrence Wasden, Attorney General, Idaho; Marty Jackley,       Attorney General, South Dakota.
