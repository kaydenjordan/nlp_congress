 Mr. Speaker, please stop me if you have heard this one  before and know how it ends. My colleagues on the other side are once  again trying to sell the American people a broken alternative to  something that is working pretty much as it was intended to.   The FCC privacy rule just says that customers must opt in before  internet  [[Page H2499]]  companies can sell their web browsing history, and that those companies  must make reasonable efforts to protect customers' sensitive  information. These are not unreasonable requirements.   The internet is our gateway to the world. Whether we connect through  our mobile phone or our home computer, we pay companies for access. If  those companies want to sell information about what we do on the  internet, they should have to get our permission first. It is the right  thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side to simply do the  right thing.
