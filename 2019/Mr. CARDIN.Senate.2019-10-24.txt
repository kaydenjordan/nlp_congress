 Mr. President, my heart is heavy today as we mourn the  loss of Congressman Elijah Cummings. He was a powerful voice for the  people of Baltimore, a champion of justice for our country, and a dear  friend to me and so many others.   I first met Elijah when he was elected to the Maryland House of  Delegates, where I was the speaker, but our lives had intersected in  formative ways even before that. We both grew up in Baltimore and  shared a deep and abiding love for the city. We went to the same high  school--Baltimore City College High School--and we both earned law  degrees from the University of Maryland before balancing private law  practices with public service in the Maryland General Assembly.   So when I met Elijah, I couldn't help but feel a kinship with him,  but I think that was perhaps just Elijah's power--the ability to build  kinship with anyone and the commitment to do so with everyone. He was  constantly searching for common ground, always looking to make human  connections. As a result, he developed meaningful friendships with  people all over the political, social, religious, and geographic map.   Elijah's talent for building consensus, as well as his work ethic and  dedication to his constituents, propelled him early on to positions of  leadership in the Maryland House of Delegates. There, he became the  youngest ever chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus and the first  African American to be named speaker pro tempore. He served in that  chamber for 14 years, during which he worked tirelessly to advance the  rights and opportunities of Maryland residents.   Then, in 1996, Elijah was elected to represent Maryland's Seventh  District, including our home of Baltimore, in the U.S. House of  Representatives. He filled a seat previously occupied by civil rights  legacies Parren Mitchell and Kweisi Mfume, and, let me tell you, there  was no person more prepared to carry on their fight for equality and  freedom.   Elijah was the son of sharecroppers who worked the same land in South  Carolina where his ancestors had been enslaved. His parents moved to  Baltimore to build a better life for their family, but the city was  rife with racial intolerance. From a young age, Elijah faced prejudice  and discrimination. He attended a segregated elementary school, and he  was pelted with bottles, rocks, and jeers when he and other children  integrated the local public swimming pool.   In the face of all that hatred, he found the hope and determination  to overcome every obstacle set before him so that he could rise up and  lift others up too. He worked diligently, excelling as an undergraduate  at Howard University, going to law school even though people told him  he could never become a lawyer, successfully practicing law, and then  launching a career of public service that led him to the U.S. Congress.  Elijah continued to climb until he was elected Chairman of the House  Oversight Committee.   All the while, he remained firmly based in his community. He lived in  the same house in West Baltimore for more than 30 years--in the inner  inner city, as he put it--and he returned home every night after a long  day of work in DC. He was known to sit on the stoop of that house and  feed the neighborhood pigeons. And every Sunday, he went to church,  where he was often met by a line of people waiting to share their  concerns, and he would listen to them and try to help them all.   Elijah never for a moment forgot that his purpose was to represent  the folks back home in his district, to be a voice for the many who  were silenced. He once said that while it was his ``constitutional duty  to conduct oversight of the executive branch,'' it was his ``moral  duty'' to fight for his constituents. And fight, he did. In the 23  years that he spent in Congress, he was a fierce advocate for his  district, especially for Baltimore. Where others saw problems and  danger, he saw opportunities and solutions. He advanced measures to  improve education, to expand affordable housing, to curb addiction, to  enhance public infrastructure, to promote gun safety, and to reform  police practices. He worked to erase the racial and class divides that  he had grown up with, so that future generations of Baltimoreans would  not face the same obstacles he did.   Although he never shied away from contentious issues, he also  understood when harmony and healing were needed. After the tragic death  of Freddie Gray, Elijah went to the streets to ask the citizens of  Baltimore to come together and find a peaceful path forward. Then, true  to form, he launched into action, pushing hard for policies and  programs to help the city recover.   Because of his heroic service to his constituents, Elijah was beloved  by his community, perhaps more than any other elected official I have  known. His loss is a devastating blow to Baltimore and to Elijah's  entire congressional district.   But it is not just Maryland that will feel this loss--Elijah's  passing leaves an unfillable void for the Nation as a whole. He loved  this country deeply. Elijah believed in the potential of American  ideals, so he held us to the highest moral standards. In moments of  moral crisis, he would famously remind whoever was listening, ``We are  better than this!''   He was passionate about rooting out corruption, protecting our  democracy, and achieving equality and freedom for all. As chairman of  the Oversight Committee and in life, he fought for what was right  simply because it was right. And Heaven forbid anyone should stand  between Elijah Cummings and justice, because, while Elijah was always  calm and respectful, he was never afraid to hold someone's feet to the  fire.  [[Page S6153]]    He gave every ounce of himself, up until his last day on Earth, to  defending the honor of our Republic. We have lost a booming voice for  truth, fairness, and liberty that can never be replaced.   I grieve for a nation without Elijah's leadership. I know that we  will hold his legacy close to our hearts and that we will strive to  follow his example of moral clarity, but the loss of Elijah Cummings  has ripped a hole in the fabric of our country that cannot be fully  mended.   My thoughts and prayers are with Elijah's wife Maya, his three  children, and all of his loved ones. Know that we are mourning  alongside you.   And to Elijah--you left this world a better place than how you found  it. Now it is time to rest.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I stand here today to grieve the  loss and honor the memory of Thomas D'Alesandro III, a true public  servant. I feel extremely fortunate to have benefited from Tommy's  wisdom, his friendship, and his example over the years. He will be  dearly missed.   Thomas--or ``Little Tommy,'' as he was known--was born in Baltimore  in 1929. He grew up in a very politically active home. His father was a  Congressman and three-term mayor of Baltimore. His sister, Nancy  Pelosi, went on to become the first female Speaker of the U.S. House of  Representatives. So, in a sense, it seems that Tommy was destined for  life in the public sphere. But he never behaved like leadership was his  birthright. Whatever the import his name carried, Tommy was always  humble, always hard-working, always determined to earn the support and  trust of his community. And that is exactly what he did. As president  of the Baltimore City Council and then as the city's mayor, Tommy was  on the ground, fighting alongside his constituents for what was right.   Tommy was the mayor of Baltimore from 1967 to 1971. It was a  tumultuous time for Baltimore and for the entire Nation. After just 4  months in office, Tommy had to lead his city through the grief and  unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.  Despite being personally devastated, he did that with courage and  grace. He went on to serve a term marked by an unyielding commitment to  civil rights.   Tommy passed laws to ban discrimination in housing and public  accommodations. He fought the racist practice of blockbusting in real  estate. He funded anti-poverty programs and new schools in underserved  neighborhoods. And he appointed more African Americans to public posts  than any Baltimore mayor before him, including to positions that had  only previously been held by White people.   He was a man of ideals, certainly. His Catholic upbringing instilled  in him the values of generosity and fairness. He had a nuanced  understanding of racial inequality in the United States, and he was  profoundly disturbed by the intolerance plaguing the country.   But I believe that he earned the support and trust of his community  because he didn't just espouse ideals--he didn't simply demand justice  or condemn hatred. He delivered concrete, meaningful action to make  Baltimore a more equal and harmonious place.   Tommy did all of this because he sincerely cared, not because it was  politically convenient. In fact, he faced a lot of criticism for his  leadership on civil rights from those who wished to preserve their own  privilege. The easy thing would have been to turn a blind eye to the  injustices around him and protect the status quo, but that wasn't  Tommy. He wasn't concerned with what was easy; he was concerned with  what was right. He had a good heart, and he listened to it.   Even after leaving political office, Tommy continued to give back as  a mentor and adviser to future leaders. I am immensely grateful for the  counsel that he offered me as a budding lawmaker. As a Baltimore native  myself, I have long looked up to Tommy and strived to follow in his  footsteps. I can only hope to emulate his integrity, bravery, and  compassion.   We have lost a hero and a legend but not a legacy. Tommy was somebody  who always led by example. Even though he is no longer here with us,  his example lives on. It lives on in the blossoming Baltimore that he  cultivated. It lives on in the generations of dedicated public servants  that he inspired. And it lives on in the quest for justice that he  championed.   Nevertheless, this loss is a painful one. My heart and prayers are  with Tommy's wife, children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and  all of his loved ones as they grieve and heal.                            ____________________
