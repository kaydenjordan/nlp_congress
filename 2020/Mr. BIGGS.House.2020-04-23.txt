 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The current bill provides $12 billion to jurisdictions that  specifically authorize and encourage the use of surveillance and  contact tracing. The bill does not define these terms.   Does it allow big tech companies to surveil and trace American  citizens and then turn that accumulated information over to the  government?   How will this data be secured, stored, et cetera?   There are many questions that go unanswered. Not the least of these,  however, is the question of how much longer the American people  acquiesce to unconstitutional and crushing government action.   We need to open up America now. I call on our Governors to free their  citizens immediately.
