 Mr. Speaker, freedom of speech and thought on college  campuses is essential to one of the most important missions of the  university: the search for truth.   While censorship can come from the right or left, many colleges and  universities are now zealously devoted to advancing leftwing ideas and  are willing to disregard evidence and logic to do it.   Universities should be a marketplace of ideas, not temples to a  single political dogma. When students or faculty speak out against  established norms, they are canceled, fired, or otherwise stigmatized  by peers and university administrators.   This is not what our Founding Fathers intended for our country or for  our universities. Thomas Jefferson, who founded the University of  Virginia, once wrote: ``I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal  hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.''   Universities used to promote this sentiment, but things have  changed--and not for the better. Universities should be centers of  education, not indoctrination. Yet university leaders either brazenly  push their own agenda or walk on eggshells in fear of their own student  body.   Research and development suffer when debate and discussion are openly  rejected on college campuses. Quashing intellectual curiosity hinders  every field of study.   The freedom to speak and think freely comes from God. Students should  not have to sign away their First Amendment rights after enrolling in  college, especially if those institutions accept taxpayer funds. It is  time for colleges and universities to be held accountable when they  refuse to protect the free speech of students and faculty.                                time  1045    Members of the Education and Workforce Committee have submitted  multiple bills to promote and protect the freedom of speech on college  campuses.   In the next Congress, we look forward to examining closely these  bills and other ways to preserve the First Amendment on campuses.                           Independent Contractors     This administration won't be happy until it controls how,  when, and where you work. It is hard to know if it is sheer arrogance  that drives this administration to think it knows better than you or if  Biden is so beholden to Big Labor that he refuses to see what is best  for the rest of America.   Regardless, this administration's attack on independent contractors  is wrong, and Republicans aren't standing for it.   Many workers, especially women, have come to rely on the flexibility  the independent contracting model provides. A regular 9-to-5 schedule  does not work for every American.   Forcing all workers into a one-size-fits-all model, while a dream for  union bosses, is a mistake. This debate is about freedom. Workers  deserve the freedom to choose how they work.   I am pushing back against Democrats' assault on entrepreneurial  opportunity and their attempts to control the lives of Americans from  birth until death.   Because I have seen firsthand that when the Federal Government steps  aside and allows job creators and industry leaders to innovate, the  workforce and U.S. economy will thrive.   We have had enough of this Washington-knows-best mentality.   Remember when President Obama told Americans, ``You didn't build  that.'' He ridiculously claimed that businesses need the government's  help to be successful.   As if this wasn't bad enough, now the Biden administration is telling  America's entrepreneurs, ``You can't build that.'' This is  unacceptable. We must do everything we can to stop this proposed rule,  and I encourage everyone to get involved.   Get on the phone, call your Representative and Senator, and submit a  comment. We must put pressure on the Biden administration to withdraw  this proposed rule.   Enough is enough. The livelihoods of real people are at risk.  Americans should be able to build a future they want for themselves. It  is time for Washington to get out of the way.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Madam Speaker, employee-sponsored coverage is the bedrock of our  healthcare system, and it is under attack by President Biden and the  Democratic Party.   Despite its name, the Affordable Care Act did nothing to make  healthcare coverage more affordable. In fact, it did the opposite.  Health coverage is now more expensive than ever.   In 2008, before the passage of ObamaCare, the average annual premium  for a family was $12,680. Today, it is $22,460. To make matters worse,  experts say that 2022 is the calm before the storm, and employers are  bracing for drastic cost increases in 2023 due to inflation, health  worker staff shortages, and supply chain issues.   It is imperative that Congress address the affordability,  transparency, and accessibility of healthcare. I have said this  repeatedly: I will not stand by while the Federal Government burdens  Americans with heavy-handed policies.   Now Democrats are using their self-made affordability crisis to move  all Americans to Medicare for All. The Biden administration has  continued its march towards total government control by illegally  expanding ObamaCare subsidies. Expanding ObamaCare and its unfettered  spending continues to drive inflation, adds billions of dollars to the  Federal deficit, and makes health insurance less affordable.   Despite the pandemic being over, President Biden has also failed to  end the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, PHE, prolonging Americans'  dependence on the Federal Government.   The American people deserve to know the Biden administration's plans  to wind down the PHE and transition the procurement and distribution of  [[Page H9845]]  COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and testing to the commercial market  quickly.   Furthermore, it is imperative that we continue to protect access to  telehealth as part of this off-ramp plan. The COVID-19 pandemic  revealed that virtual visits can fill glaring gaps in healthcare access  nationwide.   Congress allowed coverage for pre-deductible virtual visits for the  duration of the PHE. Around 90 percent of high deductible health plans  took advantage of that provision this year, up from approximately 80  percent in 2021 and 60 percent in April 2020. This is clear proof that  Americans need and are making use of increased access to telehealth.   President Biden and Democrats may not have a plan to address these  critical issues, but Republicans do. For the past year, House  Republicans have worked to create the Commitment to America which  includes policies to strengthen employer-sponsored coverage by  increasing competition in the healthcare market, promoting price  transparency, and lowering health coverage costs.   Republicans also have plans to help employers lower costs by  expanding access to association health plans and tax-advantaged health  savings accounts. We plan to remove barriers that currently prevent  employers from participating in advanced payment initiatives.   We will reduce the administrative burden on business owners created  by outdated ObamaCare paperwork mandates, and we will promote policies  that transfer control of health spending back to the patient.   We must shed the layers of bureaucracy blocking Americans from  understanding the true cost of their care. This includes codifying the  Trump administration's price transparency rule and building on the  price transparency provision in the No Surprises Act.   Time and time again, the Biden administration has failed to make the  best use of taxpayer dollars. Democrats champion the idea of ``health  for all'' and ``universal coverage,'' but they seriously fail to  consider the adverse impact their policies have on inflation, costs,  access, and quality.   By contrast, Republicans will build on the bedrock of our healthcare  system--employer-sponsored coverage. We are committed to making  employer-sponsored healthcare and the healthcare market more  affordable, transparent, and competitive.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Ellzey for giving me the opportunity.
