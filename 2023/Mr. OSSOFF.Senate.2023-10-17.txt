 Mr. President, I rise to commend a champion of  Georgia's families. In October 2015, Erin Campbell valiantly founded  the Athens Area Diaper Bank with a mission to help families in need.  Since then, her work has helped countless families access some of the  most basic, yet vital, supplies a newborn and their families need.  Working with partner nonprofits, agencies, and organizations in their  six-county service area, Ms. Campbell and the Athens Area Diaper Bank  work to collect donations and distribute diapers and other supplies to  those in need.   In 2022, the Athens Area Diaper Bank celebrated its 1 millionth  diaper distributed, an incredible feat. Working closely with Ms.  Campbell and the Athens Area Diaper Bank team, I brought Republicans  and Democrats together to deliver new funding for the Athens Area  Diaper Bank and their partner organization, Helping Mamas, enabling  them to serve more rural communities in the Athens-Clarke County Area.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I commend Erin Campbell for her  inspirational service to the Athens area and thank her and the entire  Athens Area Diaper Bank team for their work.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to commend Columbus,  Georgia's Greater Shady Grove Missionary Baptist Church on its 160th  anniversary, celebrated in August 2023. Founded in 1863 under a grape  arbor in an oak grove as Shady Grove Missionary Baptist Church, the  congregation has been a mainstay of the Columbus, GA, community ever  since its founding by Brother Boston Miles and Sister Mary Moore, who  became the church's first members.   In August 1967, the First Baptist Church of Columbus, GA, granted  full titles and deeds of the church building to the Shady Grove  congregation, and on March 27, 1968, the Superior Court of Muscogee  County duly incorporated the ``Greater Shady Grove Baptist Church,  Inc,'' a name change to distinguish itself from other churches with the  same name. In January 1988, the Reverend Dr. Marcus J. Gibson became  the acting pastor and served in that capacity until April 17, 1998,  when he was made interim pastor. On February 14, 1999, Reverend Gibson  was installed as the 22nd pastor of the Greater Shady Grove Missionary  Baptist Church, the same role he maintains today. Under Pastor Gibson's  leadership, the congregation has continued to flourish, successfully  expanding, improving the south parking lot, upgrading the  transportation ministry, and remodeling the sanctuary. Greater Shady  Grove Missionary Baptist Church has also added new ministries and  programs, including the annual women's and laymen's conferences,  outreach ministry expansion and improvements, the organization of the  liturgical dance ministry, the mother ministry, the organization of the  sick, bereavement and condolence ministry, and initiating of the  deacons family care. Above all, Greater Shady Grove Baptist Church  remains a central place for fellowship, community, teaching, and  nurturing.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I commend Reverend Marcus J. Gibson and  the Greater Shady Grove Baptist Church on its momentous 160th  anniversary, and here is to many more.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to commend the Reese-Hyman  American Legion Post No. 96 on its 100th anniversary.   Founded in 1923 by World War I veterans from Warren and Glascock  Counties, the Reese-Hyman American Legion was named in honor of  Cummings Reese and Samuel Hart Hyman, the only Warren County residents  who lost their lives in service to the Nation during World War I.  According to Eric Wilkerson, who had served as the post's adjutant for  17 years, the local chapter quickly grew to over 100 members in its  first few months and became very active in the community, including  running the annual Warren-Glascock County Fair.   Led today by Commander Patricia Hambsch, the Reese-Hyman American  Legion Post No. 96 continues bringing local veterans together, helping  them access their hard-earned benefits and advocating for policies that  help veterans. In July, its members gathered in Warrenton to celebrate  the 100th anniversary of the Reese-Hyman American Legion Post No. 96.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I thank all of Georgia's veterans for  their service and sacrifice on behalf of our Nation, and I commend the  Reese-Hyman American Legion Post No. 96 on this momentous  occasion.

Ms. Rivera Holmes serves as  president and CEO of the Albany Area Chamber of Commerce and the  chamber's foundation. For over two decades, she has dedicated her work  to the people of Southwest Georgia, first working as a reporter at the  Albany Herald and ``Southwest Georgia Living'' before joining Albany- Dougherty County's economic development commission.

Most recently, Ms. Rivera Holmes graduated from the Institute for  Organization Management, the professional development program of the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce, demonstrating her continued commitment to  better represent the local chamber and serving her community--and I  congratulate her on this achievement.
