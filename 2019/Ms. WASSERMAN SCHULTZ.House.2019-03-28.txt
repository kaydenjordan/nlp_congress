 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the passing  of a dear friend and remarkable professional, Steve Cernak.   As CEO of Port Everglades in Broward County, Florida, Steve oversaw  the largest expansion in the port's history and helped Port Everglades  grow to become the number one cruise port in the country.   He had a vision for the port, and he was an incredibly dedicated  public servant.   Steve loved his work, community, and family.   He was a loving husband, father, and grandfather, and took any  opportunity to share how proud he was of his grandchildren, often  sharing photos of them before meetings, to which I can personally  attest.   His professionalism was unmatched, and I am grateful for his  unwavering commitment to keeping Americans safe.   Although Steve is no longer with us, his legacy will live on through  the institution he helped propel into the leading port in our Nation.   Steve Cernak was a selfless, compassionate, and tireless public  servant, and he will be profoundly missed, but never forgotten.                            ____________________
