 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  bill and my four amendments.   The first amendment will require a report on the status of women in  Afghanistan. The rights we fought to secure for them are in dire peril.   The second will hold the administration accountable by requesting a  report on the amount of money and materials left behind in Afghanistan.   The third blocks any funding for intelligence sharing and ensures no  taxpayer dollars are wasted working with the Taliban. They proved that  they can't be trusted by the deadly events at the airport.   The final amendment will establish a memorial for the 13  servicemembers who perished securing the airport.   They lost their lives protecting Americans and our allies. This  memorial would ensure that they are never forgotten for their  sacrifice.   I urge adoption of all four of my amendments.
