 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Republican tax  plan. This bill is nothing but a giveaway to America's wealthiest and  corporations on the backs of middle class families.   The GOP tax plan gets rid of commonsense policies that the American  people rely upon:   It eliminates the student loan deduction that helps young people pay  for college;   It eliminates the medical expense deduction, which helps families  struggling with diseases like Alzheimer's afford care;   It eliminates the deduction for teachers that helps them purchase  supplies for the classroom; and   It sharply reduces the State and local tax deductions that my  constituents in Sacramento rely upon.   Meanwhile, when the national debt grows as a result of the GOP's  unfunded tax breaks, Republicans will turn around and justify cuts to  earned benefits like Medicare and Social Security.   Middle class Americans shouldn't be punished so that the megarich and  corporations get a break.                            ____________________
