 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Thomas  Street Health Center's legacy as the first freestanding HIV clinic in  Houston and the Nation.   Since 1989, Thomas Street Health Center has been a vital source of  care for over 5,000 patients living with HIV/AIDS.   This outstanding achievement is a testament to the exceptional  research and collaboration between healthcare providers, patients, and  the broader healthcare community.   Thomas Street Health Center is moving to a new facility next month.  This is a significant step forward, opening many possibilities for  enhancing the patient experience. We bid farewell to this historic old  location as it created many positive memories and contributions to the  community.   The Northside community will miss the people and the patients, but  the building will forever remain as a reminder of the work that created  such a difference in the lives of so many people at that site.   We look forward to a bright future for Thomas Street Health Center in  this new era. We congratulate them and we bid them well.                            ____________________
