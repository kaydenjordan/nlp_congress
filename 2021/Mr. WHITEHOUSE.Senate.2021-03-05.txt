 Mr. President, nobody on our side likes this  amendment, and we urge a ``no'' vote. It would tie the hands of local  and State government. It would make it more difficult to rehire or  interfere with recovery in our capital cities, so if we could all have  a resounding ``no'' vote on the Graham amendment, I would appreciate it  and yield back further time.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1369     Madam President, for 1 minute.   Madam President, knowing how much my colleagues on the other side  love unelected bureaucrats, I want to make sure it is clear that this  was a unilateral decision made by an unelected bureaucrat to change the  way hospitals are compensated. And the result, at least in my State, is  that our hospitals are paid 25 cents per dollar less than the hospital  right across the border in Massachusetts and 30 cents per dollar less  than the hospital right across the border 20 minutes down the road in  Connecticut.   Dr. Barrasso and Dr. Cassidy can understand that a 25-percent hit in  hospitals that close together, a 30-percent hit between hospitals that  close together, is ridiculous.   And my friends on the Finance Committee will remember me showing this  graph to every Health and Human Services witness who showed up.    And none could defend it. I ask your support on this.   The Senator from Tennessee.
