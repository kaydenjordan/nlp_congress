 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Ranking Member  Smith, Chairman Thornberry, and the committee staff for working with me  to include language that brings attention to the threat of nuclear  proliferation.   Currently, nine countries possess over 15,000 nuclear weapons, and  the United States plans to spend $1.2 trillion over the next 30 years  to upgrade and expand its nuclear stockpile. As we build up our nuclear  arsenal, we are increasing the risk of these destructive weapons ending  up in the hands of terrorists.   The language I included in this bill stresses the importance of  addressing this danger and requires the Secretary of Defense to explain  how the Department of Defense is responding to this threat. When  Secretary Mattis testified before our committee, I asked him about this  ongoing threat and he told me that nuclear proliferation has not  received enough attention over quite a few years.   This amendment is a welcome first step in the development of a robust  strategy against nuclear proliferation.                                time  1445
