 Mr. Speaker, after 3 long years of COVID  restrictions, on May 12, the United States' northern border finally  reopens fully to our Canadian neighbors. This is a turning point in  rebuilding the relationships and economies along the U.S.-Canadian  border.   In 2019, prior to the pandemic, domestic and international travel  spending reached $3.1 billion in my western New York district alone.   As we emerge from a global health crisis and celebrate National  Travel and Tourism Week, let's seek out opportunities to encourage and  ease travel in the United States. This includes adequately funding  Federal agencies to support travel, investing in infrastructure, and  modernizing NEXUS and passports to improve the travel experience.   Together, we can highlight U.S. destinations ready to be explored and  grow the economy.                            ____________________
