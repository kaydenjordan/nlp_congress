 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday morning, I hosted Judge  Ketanji Brown Jackson, the President's nominee to replace Justice  Breyer on the Supreme Court, in my office. I was glad to meet with  Judge Jackson. We enjoyed a cordial discussion.   Like I have been saying, Republicans fundamentally believe the  nominee, the Court, and the country all deserve better than the  disgraceful displays that Senate Democrats have routinely visited on  nominees of Republican Presidents. The Senate's process should be  dignified, but it also must be vigorous, exhaustive, and painstaking.  We are talking about a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest  Court.   This is a moment when issues relating to the law and the judiciary  are directly hitting American families, from skyrocketing murders and  carjackings, to soft-on-crime prosecutors' effectively repealing laws,  to open borders. This is also a moment when the far left has declared  open season on the very concept of judicial independence itself.   [[Page S963]]  President Biden even bowed to the radicals and set up a Court-packing  Commission.    Now, Justice Breyer has distinguished himself by loudly and proudly  putting those radicals in their place. He has consistently denounced  the concept of partisan Court packing and defended the Court's  legitimacy.   One would hope his successor would follow suit, but curiously the  same radicals who want to turn Democrats into the party of Court  packing also badly wanted Judge Jackson for this vacancy. It is a  matter of record that this nominee was the anointed favorite of these  fringe groups. At this time last year, they were already spending dark  money to raise her profile.   So I intend to explore why groups that are waging political war  against the Court as an institution decided Judge Jackson was their  special favorite.   Like I said, I enjoyed meeting the judge. She is clearly a sharp  lawyer with an impressive resume, but when it comes to the Supreme  Court, a core qualification is judicial philosophy. Our citizens need  Justices who treat all parties fairly, apply our laws and Constitution  as written, and leave legislating to us here in Congress.   I raised all these matters yesterday. I look forward to gaining more  clarity about Judge Jackson's positions during the vigorous and  thorough Senate process to come.   (Ms. ROSEN assumed the Chair.)                                   Vaccines    Madam President, now on another matter, our Nation faces serious  challenges to our citizens' health and wellness. COVID-19 has been one  of them. Abuse of illegal drugs and prescription pills is another.  Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are ever present. Many of these  health crises hit Middle America especially hard and specifically rural  America.   Data show that rural Americans are disproportionately likelier to die  from a number of potentially preventable causes. That is why I have  been focused on expanding local treatment centers and telehealth and  fighting the drug epidemic tooth and nail.   Last week, I hosted Dr. Rahul Gupta, the administration's drug czar,  in Kentucky. Opioid abuse is a staggering problem in our State and  throughout the country. Last year, even during COVID, fentanyl abuse  alone was the biggest cause of death among Americans aged 18 to 45.  That is not even all drugs, just fentanyl alone.   In short, this may literally be the worst time in American history to  deliberately cut healthcare access in rural America, but that is just  what the Biden administration has done. President Biden told every  thinly stretched doctor's office and hospital that accepts Medicare  that they had to fire workers who didn't want the COVID vaccine.   Now, I have been a consistent advocate for getting vaccinated. They  offer powerful personal protection against hospitalization and death,  but they do not prevent people catching or transmitting the current  variant. There is no moral justification for sweeping mandates. The  benefits accrue to the person who gets the shot.   What is more, the CDC's own research says that prior infection  provides protection that is at least as strong as the vaccines. But the  President's overreaching mandate ignores that. His policy  unscientifically discriminated against people who have immunity from  prior infection. They had to comply anyway or lose their job.   The President tried to force such a mandate on all kinds of workers  across America. The courts slapped that down easily. But his mandate  targeting healthcare workers remains in effect.   It is unfair on a personal level, but even just looking at public  health, it is terrible policy for rural America. We cannot have  President Biden mass firing doctors and nurses when hospitals are  already short-staffed.   One hospital leader in Marshall County, KY, told me that ``this is an  absolute disaster. We are a small critical access hospital with 250  employees. . . . We have begun assessing areas that may have to be  [literally] shut down.''   A head of a hospital in Calloway County told me that ``I can afford  to lose not one more nurse.'' He said the Biden mandate ``makes no  sense''--no sense--``for rural healthcare.''   The head of a critical access hospital in Hardinsburg says that ``the  mandate is devastating for Kentucky hospitals.''   Clearly, many of my colleagues are hearing similar things. Yesterday,  over the objections of every Senate Democrat who voted, Republicans  stood up for Americans' right and Americans' healthcare access. We  passed a resolution to overturn President Biden's mandate that would  drain doctors and nurses out of middle America.   If Washington Democrats could safely hobnob in the Capitol all  Tuesday evening with no masks, then they ought to stop pushing mass  firings on essential health workers.   Unfortunately, if we know anything about this Democratic House, this  commonsense measure may well die on Speaker Pelosi's desk.   I sincerely hope our colleagues across the Capitol will see reason  and pass this bill.    Mr. President, in 1822, pioneer settlers founded  Calloway County in Kentucky's Jackson Purchase. Two hundred years  later, in November, the residents of this community are celebrating  their bicentennial and paying tribute to the adventurous forefathers  who made it possible. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring  Calloway County for reaching this impressive milestone.   Like the rest of the Jackson Purchase, Calloway County was bought by  the Federal Government from the Chickasaw Indians in 1818. This fertile  land, bordered by the Tennessee, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers, was  prime territory for American farmers seeking to move westward from the  young Nation's eastern core. Those early settlers poured into Calloway  County, on the Purchase's eastern edge, and incorporated the county in  1822, with the early settlement of Wadesboro serving as their county  seat.   Calloway County developed like much of the rest of the Purchase, with  large farms bolstered by easy access to Kentucky's inland waterways and  the urban markets that lay beyond. Calloway's early residents built a  one-room, log courthouse in 1823--the first public building constructed  in the Jackson Purchase--and founded several towns, including Murray,  the current county seat. Calloway quickly grew into a prosperous  community with thousands of residents.   By the end of the 19th century, Calloway County formed an integral  part of Western Kentucky's commerce, culture, and governance. In  recognition of the county's significance, Calloway native Rainey T.  Wells started the Calloway Normal College in the 1890s to train  teachers. Though that school closed in 1913, Wells secured State funds  to construct Murray State Normal School in 1923, now known as Murray  State University. Wells became Murray State's second president in 1926  and would go on to practice law in front of the Supreme Court in 1937,  before returning to his Calloway County home until his death.   Another important moment in Calloway's history came when the  Tennessee Valley Authority dammed the Tennessee River and created  Kentucky Lake, a vast reservoir on the county's eastern edge. In  addition to supplying hydroelectric power to Calloway County residents,  the lake created new recreational attractions for the local community.  Today, Kentucky Lake--and the Land Between the Lakes National  Recreation Area that governs its neighboring forest areas--is one of  the largest natural attractions in the Commonwealth, bringing millions  of tourists to the region every year.   Today, Calloway County is a unique Kentucky community, navigating new  pathways in education and recreation while still remaining firmly  rooted in its agricultural and historical traditions. Murray is a  burgeoning town with nearly 20,000 residents, serving as both a host to  thousands of Murray State University students and a gateway to the Land  Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. The county's attractions  include museums, parks, Civil War forts, and miles of beautiful rolling  hills. It is no surprise that, every year, more and more families  decide to call Calloway County home.   Calloway County residents will have much to celebrate in their  upcoming bicentennial. They and their pioneer ancestors have built a  thriving community, complete with everything prospective newcomers  could desire in a new home. Their upcoming celebration will include  local civic groups, nonprofits, churches, sports teams, and  businesses--a colorful tapestry of every organization that makes  Calloway County great.   I want to give special thanks to the Calloway County civic leaders  who are working so hard to make this year's bicentennial celebration  possible. Through their hard work, their community continues to  prosper, even 200 years after its founding. On behalf of the Senate, I  share our congratulations with every Calloway Countian and join them in  honoring 200 years of proud Kentucky traditions.                            ____________________
