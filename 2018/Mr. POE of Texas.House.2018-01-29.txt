 Mr. Speaker, recorded conversations, warrantless  surveillance of citizens, and government invasion of privacy--it sounds  like a page out of George Orwell's novel ``1984.'' I don't know if you  read this in high school or not, but my generation did. We never  thought that this would ever take place in America. It is a book about  Big Brother government.   To quote Orwell, here is what he says about government:         Always eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you.       Asleep or awake, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or       bed--no escape.    It talks about government eyes watching America. But it is happening  here in America, Mr. Speaker, behind the closed doors of government  intelligence and law enforcement agencies.   Big Brother, in my opinion, is watching. How? Through a piece of  legislation called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.  FISA allows our government to spy on foreign agents, including  terrorists, primarily overseas. The government collects all of this  information and puts it into a database. If government wants to use or  search the database, they go to a secret FISA court, and that court  issues a secret warrant to search the database.   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and  Trade and a former judge and a prosecutor, I want government to go  after terrorists overseas who seek to harm Americans; nab them, lock  them up, and get rid of them.   What is of disturbing concern, Mr. Speaker, is government uses these  database communications, texts, and emails of Americans to gain  information on them and spy on them without a real probable cause  warrant. That is one reason I did not vote to reauthorize FISA. This is  a direct violation of Americans' Fourth Amendment rights.   For years, I have worked to rein in FISA's abuse of Americans'  constitutional rights, and now we are learning more about FISA. And it  is not good news.   Recently, Members of Congress were given access to a top secret memo  by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence regarding the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The memo outlines improper  conduct of government, and its contents are extremely disturbing.   The Justice Department and the FBI oppose the release of this memo  without their permission. The Justice Department wants to black out, or  redact, portions of it even though they haven't even seen the memo.  They don't want the public to know what is in it. They think that the  American people ``can't handle the truth,'' to give a quote from Jack  Nicholson.   The reality is these agencies would prefer to continue operating in  secret, behind the closed, locked doors of intrigue and surveillance.  Mr. Speaker, this is exactly why the memo should be released.   A transparent government, Mr. Speaker, is a good thing. That  revolutionary idea sounds to me like something our Founders envisioned  when they drafted the Fourth Amendment. Remember, the Bill of Rights  was intended to protect us from government.   Despite the protests of those who wish to offer up our privacy on the  altar of national security, keeping this memo secret does not make us  any safer.   It is clear, Mr. Speaker: Release the memo to the press and to the  public. Let the public and the media know what is happening by our  government behind the dingy, dark rooms of secrecy. The memo is proof  evident that government cannot be trusted.   Ironically, the new FISA bill signed into law attempts to protect  Americans from foreign terrorists but denies Americans the right to  have their privacy protected in our homeland. This is not the America  our Founders envisioned.   The memo speaks for itself. Let the American people see the memo.  Government has been watching America's conduct. Now it is time we  watched the conduct of government.   As George Orwell said in his book ``1984,'' in the eyes of Big  Brother government, ``Ignorance is strength.''   Well, government may think so, but, Mr. Speaker, ignorance of the  people is not a strength; it is a weakness. The  [[Page H632]]  spying eyes and improper acts of Big Brother need to be revealed.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 534) to prevent the sexual abuse of minors and amateur  athletes by requiring the prompt reporting of sexual abuse to law  enforcement authorities, and for other purposes, as amended.

[[Page H635]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 534, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that today we are voting on S. 534, the  Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization  Act of 2017. This important legislation protects child athletes from  both sexual and physical abuse.   Over the past year, the Nation was horrified to learn of the decades  of abuse that occurred within USA Gymnastics by Dr. Larry ``Lecherous''  Nassar. The middle name was added by me, Mr. Speaker. Last week, Nassar  was sentenced to between 40 and 175 years' incarceration after pleading  guilty to several counts of sexual assault.   Over 150 women and girls gave victim impact statements. How a serial  predator like Dr. Nassar could have preyed on so many young girls for  such a long time in such a flagrant fashion is appalling.   Our amateur gymnasts were failed. They were failed by the very people  who are supposed to protect them and do no harm, as doctors are  supposed to do.   In the past weeks, we have not only seen Dr. Nassar brought to  justice, but we have also seen many others held accountable for their  roles of commission and omission associated with these atrocities.  Though we are glad to see justice finally served in this case, we must  take appropriate measures to prevent this from occurring again. This  bill will do that.   Under current law, the Victims of Child Abuse Act requires persons  engaged in certain activities and professions on Federal lands or in  Federal facilities to report child abuse. Failure to report could  subject such persons to criminal penalties.   This bill expands these mandatory reporting requirements to adults  working at national governing boards, that is, amateur sports  organizations recognized by the United States Olympic Committee, such  as USA Gymnastics or USA Tennis, or at sanctioned events. The bill also  charters a new organization called Safe Sport, tasked with preventing  child abuse within the national governing bodies through education and  handling reports of misconduct.   Safe Sport will assure these national governing bodies abide by such  policies and procedures to assure that predators like Dr. Nassar will  never again be permitted to terrorize young athletes with impunity.   I would like to thank Mrs. Brooks of Indiana for her hard work on  this issue and for assembling a bipartisan team of cosponsors.  Protecting our young people, including those who have sacrificed so  much to represent the United States, such as Olympic athletes, is and  should be a bipartisan undertaking.   I commend my colleagues for their support, and I urge them to vote in  favor of S. 534.   Mr. Speaker, I have 133 victim impact statements of young women that  were made at this sentencing, and I want to read just a few phrases  from some of these strong athletes who had the courage to come forward  and tell what Dr. Nassar did to them.   The first one is from Donna Markham. Donna's daughter Chelsey was an  athlete under the supervision of Nassar. She could not give a victim  impact statement, and here is why, according to her mother, Donna: ``In  2009, she took her own life. She couldn't deal with the pain anymore.  Every day I miss her. It all started with him.''   Danielle Moore: ``I hope being reduced to a prison number''--she is  talking to Nassar--``will define you as it defined me for so many  years. I will no longer be known as a number, and I will be Dr.  Danielle Moore.''   Megan Halicek: ``As I stand here, I still flash back to the feelings  of fear, laying frozen in his office, my sweating, shaking body,  adrenaline pumping, painfully clutching the sides of the table, waiting  for the sick treatment to be over.''   Gwen Anderson: ``I still remember him saying, `It's okay. I know  you're not used to being touched there, but it will feel better.''   And here is what Gwen's coach had to say, Thomas Brennan: ``For the  record, go to hell. . . . What you did to everyone else who trusted you  and sent girls your way is disgusting, reprehensible, unforgivable.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my friend from Texas. Just  so it is clear, I agree with her on the money. It should have been  funded, but it was ruled an earmark, and we can't do earmarks anymore.  We have to go through another process to get that funding. A good  reason why we ought to have earmarks.   Mr. Speaker, Amanda Barterian said this at the sentencing hearing:  ``I refuse to let Larry Nassar take anything more from here. He has  already taken enough.''   Nicole Walker said this at the sentencing hearing: ``I have anxiety  and sleep disorders all because of what you''--Nassar--``did to me.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.  Brooks), a former U.S. attorney.    Mr. Speaker, Katherine Gordon said this at the  sentencing: ``Sexual assault is distant until you realize each girl in  the news is a broken mirror.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas, not only for  her support of the legislation, but also for her long-time working on  these issues of victims of crime, and her involvement in legislation in  the past and in the future on matters such as this.   This is not a happy event, Mr. Speaker. This legislation, as Mr.  Bishop said, it is unfortunate that Congress had to get involved in  this issue. Congress is going to get involved, and we are going to try  to rectify the problems of the past and hold people accountable for  crimes in the future.   We are talking about the symbol of everything that is good, and  right, and beautiful about America: these Olympics, the Olympians, and  particularly the gymnasts who represent America; the training they go  through; the zeal for which they represent our country and work. Yet,  while all of that was going on, bad things were happening to them.   Our gymnasts who just participated in the last Olympics, who won  medals, gold medals, they endured abuse, yet they went forward to  represent our country in the United States Olympics.   People who harm those girls and other athletes, male and female, they  need to be held accountable, not just Larry Nassar, but other people  need to be held accountable. This is where law enforcement needs to be  involved.   Mr. Speaker, I am a former judge, and I want to commend the judge in  this case, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, for allowing all of these victims  to testify in open court. They had the courage to come forward and tell  very difficult things, things that are difficult for us to even listen  to here on the House floor. They said it, and they wanted the criminal  to know what he had done to them impacted them.   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the judge for allowing that, but  also the sentence that she imposed. I want to read a few more of the  statements, Mr. Speaker:   Jessica Rodriguez: ``USA Gymnastics should be held accountable for  each and every one of these acts of abuse they allowed to happen.''   Taryn Look: ``I was still a child. . . . I wanted to end my life.''   Mattie Larson: ``I was at the height of my career at 19, and the  Olympics were just a year away, and I just couldn't take any more of  the abuse. I was broken. Larry, my coaches, and USA Gymnastics turned a  sport I fell in love with as a kid to my personal living hell.''   Mr. Speaker, all of these brave Americans came forward and testified  about what had happened to them. And we should--they are all Olympians  for that. They all deserve the gold medal for what they did  representing our country and their strength and their courage to  testify in open court about what happened to them.   The defendant, the convicted criminal, wrote a letter to the judge,  Mr. Speaker, saying he couldn't take all of this abuse against him for  having to listen to all of the statements by the victims. Are you  kidding me? He is not the victim. He is the criminal, and he belongs in  jail.   He belongs in jail, as these victims have said, for the rest of his  life, to keep him away from little girls. And I am glad that that is  where he is going, but he is not a victim. Because of the mental abuse  that he caused on victims of crime, he needs to remember what he has  done. And I am glad that we have finally got this legislation passed in  such a quick method. It is proof, Mr. Speaker, that we can work pretty  fast, we also can work in a bipartisan manner, and we can also work  with the Senate getting legislation that is important to America  passed.   Mr. Speaker, I want to read one last statement, and I include in the  Record the 133 written statements that I have, subject to length  limitation in the Record.                          Statements by 133 people         Kyle Stephens: ``Little girls don't stay little forever,       they grow into strong women that return to destroy your       world.''        Jessica Thomashow: ``What you did to me was twisted. You       manipulated me and my family. How dare you.        Donna Markham (Speaking on behalf of her daughter, Chelsey,       who killed herself 10 years ago.): ``In 2009, she took her       own life. She couldn't deal with the pain anymore. Every day       I miss her, every day. It all started with him.''        Jade Capua: ``I am no longer broken by you. Every day I       grow a new strength and look into the mirror to see a strong,       unbreakable person. Nothing will ever take away what you've       done to me or to the others that started behind me. However,       we can walk free and radiate the strength that we've gained       from your horrific acts, something you will never be able to       do.''        Alexis Moore: ``I don't like the word victim. I am a       survivor, but more so I am me. Those 10 years are a part of       my story. They have helped define who I am today.''        Olivia Cowan: On Michigan State University and USA       Gymnastics:        ``If they would have taken action when it was first       reported, they would have saved me.''        Nicole Soos: ``I thought he was a famous doctor. There was       no way he would do anything inappropriately in front of my       mom. I was wrong.''        Ashley Erickson: ``Today I can say I'm finally ready to       face you . . . Why did you do this? You were the adult, you       were the doctor.''        Rebecca Mark: ``He molested me and he molested me with my       mom in the room.''        Bethany Bauman: ``I am 100% confident, that if he had not       been caught, he would have continued to do this for the rest       of his life.''        Kate Mahon: ``By publicly speaking out against Larry       Nassar, I'm not just speaking out for myself. I'm speaking       out for all the girls and women of the past, present, and       future that have been or will be affected by sexual       assault.''        Danielle Moore; ``I hope being reduced to a (prison) number       will define you as it defined me for so many years. I will no       longer be known as a number, and I will be Dr. Danielle       Moore.''        Melissa Imrie: ``Everybody's story that I listened to today       is just an echo of everything that I've went through. They're       just speaking like it's my voice.''        Megan Halicek: ``As I stand here, I still flash back to the       feelings of fear, laying frozen in his office, my sweating       shaking body, adrenaline pumping, painfully clutching the       sides of the table, waiting for the sick treatment to be       over.''        Jamie Dantzscher: ``There is no therapy, no cure for       monsters like you. You are pure evil.''  [[Page H642]]         Brianne Randall: ``I was a 17-year-old that reported your       abuse to police in 2004. You used my vulnerability at the       time to sexually abuse me. I reported you to police       immediately and had a rape kit done . . . you had the       audacity to tell [police] I misunderstood the treatment       because I wasn't comfortable with my body. How dare you?       Sadly they took your word instead of mine.''        Anna Ludes (video statement): ``I felt so special and lucky       that Larry Nassar would take the time to help me. But it       turned out that he was a molester.''        Lindsey Schuett (video statement): ``If anyone deserves to       never see the light of day again it is this man.''        Marion Siebert: ``You hindered the trajectories of our       lives that we and our parents worked so very hard for, and       changed the rest of our lives in ways that we're still       realizing and dealing with every day. This is what makes this       crime so heinous.''        Katelyn Skrabis (statement read on her behalf): ``Nothing       can change what Larry Nassar did to me.''        Taylor Stevens (statement read on her behalf): ``Because of       you my life has been forever changed. I have to live with the       fact that I am a victim of sexual assault.''        Breanne Rata (statement read on her behalf): ``My only       relief is knowing my picture is no longer on the wall of your       Michigan State office.''        Erin McCann: ``I was told over and over again how honored I       should feel for seeing Dr. Nassar . . . It was no honor. It       was disgust. It took more than it should have from me.''        Jennifer Rood-Bedford: ``The road to healing looks steep       from where I am standing now, but I am a warrior.''        Gina Nichols (on behalf of her daughter, Olympic hopeful       Maggie Nichols): ``You are not a real doctor. You are a       serial child molester, a pedophile.''        Tiffany Lopez Thomas: ``I imagine hitting you if I ever had       the opportunity to see you again. Instead I will allow my       thoughts and my feelings to hit your heart.''        Jeanette Antolin: ``You made me believe you were my friend.       I truly believe you are the spawn of Satan. There's no       therapy that will fix the evil that's deep inside you.''        Kayla Spicher: ``I was sexually assaulted, but I was       unaware, not because I was naive, but because I was a       child.''        Gwen Anderson: ``I still remember him saying, ``It's OK. I       know you're not used to being touched there, but it will feel       better.''        Thomas Brennan (Gwen's coach): ``For the record, go to hell       . . . What you did to everyone else who trusted you and sent       girls your way is disgusting, reprehensible, unforgivable.''        Amanda Thomashow; ``Larry, the thing you didn't realize       when you were sexually assaulting me . . . was that you were       building an army of survivors who would ultimately expose you       for who you are. From this rubble we will rise as an army of       female warriors.''        Jaime Doski: ``I want to show my family how strong I am and       that I'm a survivor.''        Jenelle Moul: ``I hope you are never able to walk outside       those [prison] walls as a free man. Most importantly I hope       all of the survivors you hurt are able to heal from the       damage you have done.''        Madeline Jones: ``Before every appointment, I cried in the       bathroom. After every appointment, I couldn't wait to get       home and shower.''        Amanda Barterian: ``I refuse to let Larry Nassar take       anything more from here. He's already taken enough.''        Jennifer Hayes: ``You parted my legs and forcefully pushed       your dry fingers in my vagina . . . You had created a secure       world where you brainwashed everyone around you.''        Nicole Walker: ``I have anxiety and sleep disorders all       because of what you did to me.''        Chelsea Williams: ``He manipulated me with such ease, with       such finesse. This is perhaps what scares me the most about       him.''        Stephanie Robinson: ``While I came to this stand as a       victim, I leave as victor.''        Carrie Hogan: ``I am broken, I'm tired, I feel like life       has been desperately sucked out of me.''        Helena Weick: ``This is not my shame anymore. It's yours.''        Amanda Cormier: ``These things happened to me in his office       long ago were not short lived and uncomfortable moments. They       were lifelong traumas that changed the way I walk in the       world.''        McKayla Maroney (statement read on her behalf): ``He abused       my trust. He abused my body and he left scars on my psyche       that will never go away. It all started when I was 13 or 14       years old. It didn't end until I left the sport.''        Annette Hill: ``As your former patient, I trusted you,       Larry. You sexually abused me.''        Aly Raisman: ``I will not rest until every last trace of       your influence on this sport has been destroyed like the       cancer it is.''        Lyndsy Carr Gamet: ``I was a carefree silly little girl       until this happened and afterwards there was a cloud and the       cloud has followed me into every relationship in my life,       especially the most important ones.''        Taylor Cole: ``This man has broken my world.''        Jessica Smith: ``I'm mortified that I didn't understand       exactly what that meant at that time.''        Arianna Guerrero: ``I am only 16. I should not even know       what an impact statement is. I shouldn't know what the inside       of a courtroom looks like. You have a hard time looking at me       now. But you didn't seem to have a problem when I was half       naked on your table.''        Nicole Reeb: ``[Michigan State University's] response has       compounded my pain. I am frustrated and outraged at the       administration's inability to take responsibility for handing       over children and girls to a predator for almost 20 years. I       no longer bleed green.''        Christine Harrison: ``You knew what you were doing was       wrong and you only asked for forgiveness because you got       caught.''        Jessica Tarrant (recorded video): ``I wasn't even alive yet       the first time he sexually assaulted someone and I was only       one when he was first reported.''        Brian Tarrant (Jessica's father): ``I just want to say,       Larry, you did nothing to defeat her.''        Mary Fisher-Follmer (on behalf of her two daughters,       Katherine Payne and Maureen Payne): ``As you deteriorate in       prison, I want you to remember you lost.''        Katie Rasmussen: ``No one did anything because no one       believed me. They didn't understand how such a respectable       doctor would do something like that. And I don't understand       how a 14-year-old could make that up.''        Madeline Johnson: ``I realized the only way I could get him       to stop was if I lied and told him pain was all gone.''        Chelsea Zerfas: ``I avoided going to practice when I knew I       had to see him . . . I felt like I couldn't breathe and I'd       tremble in fear.''        Samantha Ursch: ``I'm not pretending it didn't happen       anymore. I'm just moving past it.''        Kara Johnson: ``The framed photos of patients on his wall       told an incredible story of a doctor who could heal anyone.''        Clasina Syrovy: ``When girls came forward and told an adult       the adults didn't listen. Why didn't they listen? What good       is it to teach children to tell an adult if the grown-up       doesn't listen, doesn't take action?''        Brad Johnson (Kara and Madeline's father): ``Your story is       dark, sinister, and pure evil.''        William Michell (Larissa's father): ``You sowed a       destructive black seed in my daughter's innocent mind and       body.''        Amy Labadie: ``Come hell or high water we'll take every       last one of you down that could have stopped this monster.''        Ashley Yost: ``That's something a 25-year-old shouldn't       have to do . . . sleep in their parents' bed because they're       afraid of a monster.''        Marie Anderson: ``While his fingers were inside of me, he       would apply pressure to the outside of my lower abdomen and       massage the inside of my vaginal area.''        Kassie Powell: ``You hid for years behind Olympic rings and       a Spartan [Michigan State University's mascot] head, but now       there is nowhere left for you to hide.''        Doug Powell (Kassie's father): ``I want you to fear and       cry, and no one to listen. I want you to remain alive for       your eternal life in those [prison] walls.''        Megan Ginter: ``I am done being ashamed of something that       was out of my control.''        Katherine Gordon: ``Sexual assault is distant until you       realize each girl in the news is a broken mirror.''        Katelynne Hall: ``What if someone would have taken the       abuse seriously?''        Anya Gillengarten: ``I thought the things that Larry Nassar       did to me would send me to Hell.''        Amanda McGeachie: ``MSU has failed to represent us; failed       to respect us; failed to take accountability for our safety.       After being a proud Spartum alum . . . I now feel ashamed to       have represented a school who will not take accountability.''        Lindsay Woolever: ``You were in the best position to help       people but you chose to do the opposite.''        Hannah Morrow: ``Life's handed me lemons, and you'd best       believe that I am well prepared to make lemonade.''        Jordyn Wieber: ``Even though I am a victim, I won't live my       life as one. I am an Olympian.        Alexis Alvarado: ``I was only a child when this abuse       started. I didn't know what he was doing was wrong.''        Morgan McCaul: ``You violated the very principle of your       calling: Do no harm.''        Trinea Gonczar: ``It's time for me to stand up for these       little girls and not stand behind you anymore. Goodbye,       Larry. May god bless your dark broken soul.''        Larissa Michell Boyce: ``Today is a new day. Today I am       claiming my freedom from you. Today I am breaking free from       the chains you put me in 20 years ago. Today I am finally       free. I am standing here reclaiming the voice that you stole       from me. I am reclaiming my confidence. I am reclaiming the       power you took from me. I am reclaiming Larissa Michell, that       innocent girl you abused. I am no longer that little girl. I       am taking her back, I have the control now.''        Bayle Pickel: ``How could you do something so horrible to       an innocent young girl?''        Adam Boyce (Larissa's husband): ``It was and still is very       real for us.''        Bailey Lorencen: ``While my mind heals and filters out the       evil sickness that you unwillingly bestowed upon my body your       mind will get darker and darker and you will hate yourself       almost as much as everyone hates you in this room right       now.''        Valerie Webb: ``To all my sisters, we need to stand, fight       back and not rest until this mess is up mopped up; each and       every crumb.''        Whitney Mergens: ``All I want is for this darkness to go       away. I don't want to look in  [[Page H643]]       the mirror and have to convince myself that I'm okay. I want       to stand there and see a strong woman other than a damaged       one. Standing here today I know the light is near.''        Marta Stern: ``I will no longer carry the weight of what       you did to me so long ago. The burden is yours.''        Melody Posthuma-Vanderveen: ``We need to call out the       deeper issue at hand. We live in a society where action is       not taken when it's most needed.''        Emma Ann Miller: ``[Michigan State University] is still       sending bills to my mom for appointments where I was sexually       assaulted.''        Amanda Smith: ``I will not stop speaking until I am heard,       until we are heard, until things are changed.''        Taylor Livingston: ``Everyone who continued to allow this       man, knowing full well what he was doing, is to blame.''        Lindsey Lemke: ``Larry, I hope you . . . and all others       realize you've pissed off the wrong army of women.''        Christy Lemke-Akeo (mother of gymnast Lindsey Lemke):       ``These girls had no idea this wasn't a medical procedure.''        Krista Wakeman: ``You're a sick man, Larry. I hope you rot       in prison because that's where you belong.''        Paula Daniels (on behalf of daughter Samantha Daniels):       ``When you lay down to sleep at night I want you to see every       little girl's face that you've abused. Hundreds of girls       Larry, innocent girls who trusted you--and know these little       girls are all grown-up now and I pray that they haunt you       every single day.''        Alliree Gingerich (statement read on her behalf): ``Not one       day goes by where I don't replay the abuse my head.''     Mr. Speaker, here is what Natalie Woodland said:  ``I am strong, and I am beautiful, and I am bold, and no one,  especially you''--Nassar--``can take that away from me. . . . While  standing up here, I'm finally realizing that I'm not alone.''   And she is not alone. We are on her side. We should be on the side of  victims of crime, and this legislation will promote a better  atmosphere: a lawful, good atmosphere for our gymnasts and other  athletes to work in. The people who committed these crimes need to be  held accountable, and society has started with the first culprit, Larry  ``Lecherous'' Nassar, and there should be more to follow.   And that is just the way it is, Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  statements from the Nassar trial:         Megan Farnsworth (statement read on her behalf): ``He took       away something I can't get back. He took it 18 years ago when       he did his procedures, and again when I was adult and learned       what he had been doing.''        Kourtney Weidner (statement read on her behalf): ``Through       these years I've experienced increase in anxiety and       stress.''        Charla Burill (statement read on her behalf): ``You were       the doctor who would give me a hug, who seemed to       understand.''        Lauren Michalak (statement read on her behalf): ``It makes       me feel disgusted that a man that was so respected in the       community could take advantage of a girl who was only in 8th       grade.''        Sherry Bradley (mother of Vanasia Bradley): ``I am sick to       my stomach with disgust and betrayal.''        Presley Allison: ``I was abused while my own mother was in       the room.''        Kamerin Moore: ``You molested a little girl who had just       lost her father . . . you used my father's death as another       opportunity to manipulate the trust I put in you.''        Catherine Hannum: ``What he did to me . . . is disgusting,       vile, and wrong. I am going to find my sense of self again       and it starts with this letter.''        Jessica Chedler Rodriguez: ``USA Gymnastics should be held       accountable for each and every one of these acts of abuse       they allowed to happen.''        Taryn Look: ``I was still a child . . . . I wanted to end       my life.''        Mattie Larson: ``I was at the height of my career at 19 and       the Olympics were just a year away and I just couldn't take       any more of the abuse. I was broken. Larry, my coaches, and       USA Gymnastics turned the sport I fell in love with as a kid       to my personal living hell.''        Whitney Burns: ``As this man's hands were touching places I       had never let any man touch, I told myself I could make it       one more second without the anger exploding inside me. `One       more second, Whitney, you can make it one more second.' ''        Isabell Hutchins (statement read on her behalf): ``I       couldn't accept the fact that it happened to me and I was in       denial for a long time.''        Natalie Woodland: ``I am strong, and I am beautiful, and I       am bold, and no one, especially not you can take that away       from me . . . While standing up here I'm finally realizing       that I'm not alone.''        Jillian Swinehart: ``You have to be the most sick and       twisted person ever to do that to young girls.''        Anne Swinehart (Jillian's mother): ``To think, I let this       happen to my child while I was sitting right there.''        Alison Chauvette: ``He was in no way treating my body. He       was, however using his position, manipulating me as a person       changing the person I was, preying on me, a young girl, to       fulfil his sick fantasies.''        Anna Dayton: ``You were supposed to be the good guy.       Instead you used your power and your authority to take       advantage of me, to take away my trust, and strip me of my       innocence.''        Olivia Venuto (statement read on her behalf): ``I know that       we will overcome this.''        Sarah (no last name provided): ``By coming forward, we       victims of Larry Nassar can help see that justice is       served.''        Kristen Thelen: ``In that moment of terror and confusion, I       completely froze.''        Alexandra Romano (statement read by her sister Danielle       Romano): ``The pain is just beginning for you. You disgust me       and everyone else in this world and like many other girls       said, today is the last day you are anything to me. You are a       sad excuse for a human being and from now on you're dead to       us.''        Jessica Howard (statement read on her behalf): ``My mother       blames herself.''        Arianna Castillo: ``He told me I had to go through pain in       order to be successful in the sport.''        Selena Brennan: ``Today is your time to face me. I want you       to continue to look at me while I speak because that is the       attention I deserve . . . I want you to know you have not       defeated me.''        Kaylee McDowell: ``My body is scarred by you . . . You       covered me with your illness and I will be contaminated by       you for the rest of my life.''        Emily Morales: ``He would rub one hand up and down my leg       and butt as the other ungloved hand penetrated me . . . He       talked about how my muscles were so tight.''        Abigail Mealy: ``The final level of your horrible pyramid       of lies is when I had to lie on a table in your basement next       to your lit fireplace and your children's toys surrounding me       while you 'treated' me for my back problems.''        Ashley Bremer: ``He was only acting as my friend to gain my       trust.''        Brooke Hylek: ``All I ever wanted to do was feel better and       go back to the sport I loved without any pain.''        Abigayle Bergeron: ``I was a victim of Larry Nassar but I       will not let that define me.''        Emily Meinke: ``My initial gut reaction was to question the       technique . . . I couldn't help but wonder how inserting his       bare fingers in my vagina was supposed to make my pain       disappear. Since I hadn't even had my period yet I assumed it       was my vagina but I really didn't know for sure.''        Morgan Valley (statement read by her mother, Dawn Valley):       ``This so-called doctor took advantage of my pain and my       innocence.''        Marty Valley (father of Morgan Valley): ``We're overcome by       anger and guilt for not protecting our beautiful, precious       daughter. As difficult as it is for us as parents, we know       it's nothing compared to what these young women are going       through.''        Christina Barba: ``We know that a single candle can light a       dark room. Imagine what all these flames can do. We will not       live in darkness. We will burn brightly. To all the abuses       and predators and harassers and enablers, we will burn your       pedestals and hiding places to the ground. All your darkest       secrets will be brought to light. We are strong and will not       let you snuff out our light. We will burn brightly and not       with hate but with hope.''        Makayla Thrush: ``Nobody should ever have to question their       doctor, especially one who was the doctor for the US Olympic       team.''        Sterling Riethman: ``Larry did not violate Jane Doe. He did       not sexually assault Jane Doe . . . he violated real girls       and real women. Well, those little girls are here today and       we said it before and we'll say it again, time's up. The       truth will come out.''        Kaylee Lorincz: ``You made a critical mistake. You       underestimated the mind, power, and will of your victims,       these accomplished athletes.''        Rachael Denhollander (Her testimony to the IndyStar began       the legal case): ``I can call what you did evil and wicked       because it was . . . I can call it evil because I know what       goodness is. And this is why I pity you.''    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
