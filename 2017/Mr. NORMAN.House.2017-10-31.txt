 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2521, the  South Carolina Peanut Parity Act of 2017.   I am proud to join Representative Joe Wilson, who has been a real  leader in the area, and the entire South Carolina delegation as a  cosponsor of the South Carolina Peanut Parity Act of 2017, an important  bill for South Carolina's peanut farmers. I also commend Harry Ott of  the Farm Bureau who has been a great leader in this effort.   Mr. Speaker, South Carolina has experienced explosive growth in  peanut farming in recent years, going from producing very few peanuts  in the early 2000s to becoming the fourth largest peanut-producing  State today, led by Brent Cogdill from Sumter. This legislation will  finally give South Carolina peanut farmers their much-deserved  representation on the Peanut Standards Board.  [[Page H8285]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of  legislation for South Carolina's peanut producers.
