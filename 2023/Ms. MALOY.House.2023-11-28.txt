 Mr. Speaker, it is an absolute honor and privilege to be  here right now. It is very humbling. Since this was a special election,  they let me have a few friends and family come in the gallery. I want  everyone on the floor to notice how many people are up here to support  me.   I have talked a lot on the campaign trail, and the media has talked a  lot about how I went to college on a scholarship I won in an FFA soil  judging contest. I was very involved in FFA in high school. In my  freshman year, I memorized the FFA creed and then participated in a  creed speaking contest where I totally lost.   I repeated one of the paragraphs three times, but in the first  paragraph, which I had down pat, there is a sentence that says, ``I  believe . . . in the promise of better days through better ways, even  as the better things we now enjoy have come to us from the struggles of  former years.''   I think that perfectly describes how I feel right now about being a  Member of the United States House of Representatives. I believe in the  promise of better days through better ways. I am excited to be here  now, when there are really important conversations happening and when  an individual can have a huge impact.   I also acknowledge the struggles of former years and that we live in  an absolutely wonderful, great country because of the people who came  before us and had important conversations and struggles and inched us  ever closer to the ideal, the American Dream, the principles that are  embodied in our Constitution and our Declaration of Independence.   Let me humbly say how excited I am to be here and how much it means  to me to be representing the people in Utah's Second Congressional  District. I don't take that title lightly. I want to make sure my  constituents know that I am here to truly represent them and that I am  optimistic, that I am excited to serve, and that I understand what a  great honor and rare privilege it is to be standing here on the House  floor right now giving a speech, so thank you.                            ____________________
