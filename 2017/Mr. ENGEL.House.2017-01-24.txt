 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  rise in support of this bill.   I want to thank Chairman Ed Royce, and I am pleased to cosponsor this  bill that he has introduced to make it easier for people around the  world to harness the power of the Internet. This bill passed in the  last Congress but didn't make it through the Senate, so I am glad we  are taking it up again.   Mr. Speaker, we know the way this incredible tool has shaped the  world in the last generation. The Internet can instantaneously connect  people across the world from each other who a few years ago would never  cross paths in a lifetime. It allows citizens and journalists living  under oppressive regimes or in war zones to get information out to the  world. It allows entrepreneurs in emerging markets to sell their  products in global markets.   To be sure, the power of the Internet can cut both way. ISIS has  proved all too adept at using social media to recruit fighters and  spread its hateful message. But put to its highest purpose, the  Internet can help drive economic growth and spread stability and  prosperity.   Unfortunately, too few people around the world have access to this  tool. Roughly 60 percent of the world's population is not online, and  the growth rate of Internet access is slowing. If you live in a poor  community or a rural area, sometimes just because you are a woman, it  is harder to take advantage of the Internet.   We know where that lack of access is holding populations back. Three- quarters of those who are offline live in just 20 countries. If we  could close that gap, think of what it might mean for all of those  people struggling to make ends meet, and that is exactly what this bill  aims to do.   Chairman Royce's legislation calls on the administration to ramp up  efforts around the world to expand access to the Internet. It  encourages the State Department, USAID, and the Peace Corps to focus on  Internet access as a diplomatic and development priority. And it states  clearly that expanding Internet access, especially in the developing  world, is an American foreign policy priority.   So I am glad to support this measure. I thank the chairman for all  his hard work.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, when we talk about the world becoming more  interconnected, one of the main drivers of that trend is the Internet.  Our enemies have taken advantage of this tool for destructive purposes.  As we push back against that threat, our foreign policy should also  help as many people as possible to use this tool in a positive way.   So this bill, again, helps move us in the right direction. I want to,  again, say I am grateful to Chairman Royce for bringing it forward.   I am glad to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation.   Again, I thank our chairman, Ed Royce, for his leadership and working  together.   I want to acknowledge my good friend from New York (Mrs. Lowey), who  authored this bill. For years and years, she has been a champion for  access to education here in the United States and around the world.   Like the other bills before us today, we passed this legislation in  the last Congress. I am glad we are taking it up so early this year so  that, hopefully, the Senate can act.   Mr. Speaker, research tells us that more than a quarter billion young  people around the world are not in school. For millions more, the  educational opportunities are substandard. This lack of access puts so  many young people at a tremendous disadvantage. Children should be in  classrooms. They should be aspiring to their highest potential,  thinking about what they want to be when they grow up.                                time  1700    The payoff of a few years of quality education is huge. Every year of  primary school increases an individual's earning potential by 5 to 15  percent. It is not just those students who reap the benefits, it is  really all of us.   Consider public health and economics. More educated populations are  healthier and more productive. Consider threats to our security. In  places like Afghanistan and South Sudan, where roughly half of children  are not in school, we know that violent extremists and others are ready  to fill the vacuum, leading these vulnerable young people down a dark,  dark path. Research has also told us that in high-risk places like  Somalia, where young people can learn about certain issues like  nonviolent civic engagement, participation in violence drops by 14  percent and support for violence drops by 20 percent.   That is why education needs to be a foreign policy priority and why  we need to be very careful as a new administration urges to make major  changes in America's foreign assistance. This legislation calls for a  5-year strategy for expanding opportunities for kids to go to school  all over the world, especially where children are most vulnerable. It  would put a new point person in charge of making sure that our efforts  across government are coordinated and effective, and it would place a  special emphasis on monitoring and evaluation so that we know we are  getting the best bang for the buck when it comes to our investments in  basic education.  [[Page H665]]    This bill would help to put children in classrooms around the world.  It would give more young people a better shot at a full and successful  life. I am proud to support it. I commend Mrs. Lowey.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Lowey), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I read a few weeks ago that the new administration was  planning to retool the State Department to focus more on terrorism. The  article suggested that the State Department might do away with some of  our smart power efforts. That would be a mistake. I look at an effort  like this one, expanding access to education, and I know that it isn't  taking away from our ability to combat terrorism. In fact, it is  critical to that fight.   When we help more young people get access to a good education, we are  giving them the tools to think critically and resist those who mean us  harm. We are helping give people an alternative, a path forward for  their lives.   When kids don't have these skills, who do you think shows up? When  children are told from a young age, with no competing message, that  America is their enemy, how does that shape their lives?   So I hope that this bill gets to the new President's desk and that he  sees the value not just in expanding access to education, but in the  wide range of foreign policy priorities that help to project stability  and make communities stronger, that show the world that the United  States is a friend and a partner, and not an enemy.   Again, I thank Congresswoman Lowey for her hard work. I thank  Chairman Royce for his hard work and collegiality, as always. I support  this bill. I urge all Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
