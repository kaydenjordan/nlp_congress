 Mr. Speaker, this month the current administration made  the reckless and undeniably partisan decision to begin reconsultation  of the 2019 biological opinions.   In its place, the proposed interim operations plan represents a huge  step backward in California's effort to protect, restore, and enhance  the delta ecosystem and provide reliable water supplies.   The 2019 BiOps were built on years of research, comprehensive peer  reviews, and the best available science. They advise the most efficient  use of water resources while continuing to protect at-risk species.   These BiOps also allow for greater water availability for the Central  Valley farmers that feed the world. Questioning these expert findings  is antiscience.   I led the entire Republican California delegation in expressing our  grave concern to the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce.   As the California drought worsens, communities in my district face  water shortages and farmers are unable to maintain their crops.   I implore my colleagues and this administration to stand up for these  suffering families and farmers, stand up for science, and reject this  outrageous decision.                            ____________________
