 Mr. President, this bill gives additional funding for  judges and legal officials to ensure due processing, evaluating claims  of folks at the border, provides resources for technology and to  construct a physical wall, gives law enforcement at the southern border  additional resources, and it overrides President Biden's decision to  end title 42.   I would encourage an aye vote on this amendment.
