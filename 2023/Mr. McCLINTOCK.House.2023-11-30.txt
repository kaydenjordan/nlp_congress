 Mr. Speaker, the attack on Israel by Hamas on October  7 was an unprovoked act of barbarity and butchery that targeted  innocent civilians and broke every rule of war dating back to medieval  times.   The sinister nature of this attack and the genocidal character of the  government behind it should shock the conscience of every man and woman  of good will on this planet.   As the Nazis were systemically murdering 6 million Jews, the  civilized nations of the world took up arms in defense of the  defenseless, annihilated the scourge of Hitler and Hitlerism, and vowed  to never allow such crimes to be permitted again.   To assure this objective, these United Nations restored the Jewish  state to the Jewish homeland, whose roots in Israel trace back to the  dawn of human history.   Never again. Israel exists today to maintain and uphold that sacred  vow of mankind.   Never again. The generation that survived those times knew how vital  that declaration is and how essential the existence of Israel is to  fulfill it.   Yet, the genocidal hatred that produced the Holocaust was never  completely extinguished. It has now morphed into a more virulent strain  of Nazism that came on full display on October 7. Shockingly, we are  seeing support for that ideology in the riots unfolding on our streets  and on our campuses, and it has even seeped into the Halls of Congress.   Now, I oppose punishing anyone for their opinions, even vicious  opinions, but they should be denounced at every opportunity, and the  destructive policies they advocate should be decisively defeated; which  brings me to the folly of the Biden administration.   Now, Hamas is the popularly elected government of Gaza. When it  attacked, Israel responded the only way it morally could, by waging war  with all of its might and resources.   Gaza was not provoked by Israel. Quite the contrary: In 2006, Israel  granted the people of Gaza the right of self-government, and they  promptly responded by electing Hamas. Last week, a poll of Palestinians  found overwhelming support for that government and the atrocities that  it has committed. There is no moral equivalency here. Israel has  practiced tolerance toward all its Arab neighbors while Hamas is  dedicated to the annihilation of Israel.   War is hell on Earth. A nation forced into it has a moral obligation  to put all of its resources behind its soldiers and to achieve  unconditional victory as quickly as possible, and then to resolutely  destroy the government and culture that unleashed it.   The demands for a cease-fire by the Biden administration, the  provision of so-called humanitarian aid to Hamas-controlled Gaza, and  demands for proportionality are utterly self-destructive to all  involved because their practical effect is to prolong the conflict  indefinitely.   In war, you don't want a proportional response; you want the most  disproportional response you can muster. The more disproportional it  is, the sooner it is ended.   Humanitarian aid is what you send after the enemy has unconditionally  surrendered and not a moment before. Can you imagine sending food and  fuel into Nazi Germany during World War II? That is lunacy.   The fountainhead of this problem is Iran. It is funding the most  extensive terrorist network in history. The sanctions against Iran were  producing a growing popular resistance to that regime, yet each time it  was about to boil over, Obama, and later Biden, took billions of  dollars owned by the Iranian people and instead turned it over to their  oppressors in Iran.   Biden's refusal to enforce sanctions has meant an estimated $30  billion of revenues to Iran. It was about to release another $6 billion  when the attack on Israel embarrassed them into temporarily backing  down.   When President Biden releases money to Iran or relaxes sanctions, he  is funding the very terrorist operations unleashed against Israel. When  he  [[Page H5988]]  leaves our borders wide-open, he is creating an open pathway for  terrorists into our country. When he sends aid to Hamas-controlled  Gaza, he gives aid and comfort to the very forces that unleashed such  terror upon Israel and aspire to unleash it against America.   For our own sake, and for the sake of humanity, America must stand  unconditionally with Israel, cutting off any resources to its  adversaries and providing the arms, ammunition, and moral support it  desperately needs.   This is the only way to restore the full force of civilization behind  these two sacred words ``never again.''                            ____________________
