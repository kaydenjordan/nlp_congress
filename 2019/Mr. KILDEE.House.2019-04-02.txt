 Madam Speaker, well, the President says that Republicans  are ``the party of healthcare.'' I think it would be more accurate to  say that they are the party of taking away your healthcare.   The Trump administration is moving to eliminate the Affordable Care  Act in its entirety, every provision, which would mean millions of  Americans would lose health coverage.   Let's remind ourselves what would happen if the ACA were eliminated:   Millions of Americans with preexisting conditions, including 1.7  million in Michigan, would be at the whim of big insurance companies  who once again would be free to discriminate against them because they  are sick or once had an illness;   Millions of Americans, including 690,000 Michiganders enrolled in the  Healthy Michigan Medicaid expansion, would lose health insurance. If  they prevail, they lose health insurance;   Eliminating the ACA would also hinder our ability to deal with the  [[Page H2947]]  opioid crisis, since the ACA requires insurance companies to cover  substance abuse treatment.   And the Republicans have no plan. Take away the healthcare from  Americans; no plan to replace it. We ought to reject that.                            ____________________
