 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a true  conservation leader who has dedicated years of her life to ensuring the  Tule Springs Fossil Beds in Las Vegas would be declared a permanent  national monument.   Jill DeStefano was one of the five founders of the Protectors of Tule  Springs, and she worked tirelessly until the beds were officially  designated the 405th unit of the National Park Service by President  Barack Obama in 2014.   She has served as the board president of the Protectors of Tule  Springs as they protect, preserve, support, and promote responsible  stewardship of the Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument and the  Ice Age Fossils State Park.  [[Page H1334]]    Jill's passionate advocacy for Tule Springs has ensured they will  always be safe and that our children and grandchildren can enjoy them  for years to come.   These protected lands tell a story and teach the next generation  about our American values for conservation and preservation of our most  precious remnants of our national history.   I thank Jill for all of her hard work to protect Southern Nevada's  beautiful outdoors. The people of Nevada's Third District are eternally  grateful for Jill and all that she has done. I am wishing Jill the best  of luck in her next chapter.                            Azerbaijan's Blockade     Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the proud  Representative of a large Armenian-American community in southern  Nevada as we mark 100 days since Azerbaijan began a devastating,  heartless blockade of Artsakh, cutting off 120,000 Armenians from a  critical humanitarian lifeline and their main artery to the outside  world.   For 100 days, Azerbaijan has denied the citizens of Artsakh basic  human rights and access to food, fuel, and medicine in freezing  conditions on what is on its way to becoming a humanitarian  catastrophe.   As if that wasn't enough, we have seen increasingly escalatory and  troubling rhetoric from Azerbaijani officials in just the last few  days.   It is long overdue that our government acts to hold Azerbaijan  accountable for its heartless treatment of the innocent Armenian  civilians in Artsakh.   That is why I was proud to join my colleagues as an original  cosponsor of H. Res. 108 in February condemning Azerbaijan's brutal  blockade and calling for an end to this manmade humanitarian crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to urge the administration to take action  here and to respond to Azerbaijan's aggression by cutting off U.S.  military assistance in line with section 907 of the FREEDOM Support  Act. Particularly, as we enter the thick of the appropriations process,  I will also continue to work to ensure that vital humanitarian  assistance is delivered to civilians who continue to suffer from the  blockade and ongoing fighting.   During these difficult times, I share the serious concerns of my  constituents in southern Nevada's Armenian-American community. I will  continue to be an advocate for solutions to this manmade crisis.   I will always stand with the Armenian people and to work to secure  much-needed relief as they face down continued threats and unjustified  aggression from Azerbaijan.                            ____________________
