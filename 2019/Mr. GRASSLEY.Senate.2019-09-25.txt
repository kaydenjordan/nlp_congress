 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute as in morning business.    We are getting toward the end of the year, and one of  the issues I would like to get done--which has to go through the House  of Representatives first--is the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. In  regard to that agreement's helping agriculture, I want to start by  laying out the fact that there is a lot of anxiety in agricultural  America.   Even though the harvest is about to start across Iowa, we had a  really difficult, tough spring getting the crops in. There is a crop to  be harvested, however, and farmers will now be doing that job. They  hope they can cover their costs. And while they are doing that, they  are thinking about putting in next year's crop.   Passing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement would inject more certainty  into the plans that the farmers have about this year's harvest and the  plans they have for next year's crop. Passage of that would signal to  the world that we here in the Congress are very serious about passing  new, modern trade arrangements.   Yet we are running out of calendar days in 2019. Congress must step  up and deliver for our hard-working farmers, as well as workers in  America and small business in America and, in a sense, by getting this  agreement passed, helping all of America. The time for the U.S.-Mexico- Canada Agreement is now.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
