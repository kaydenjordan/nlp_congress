 Mr. Chairman, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act  subjects the SEC to enhanced cost-benefit analysis requirements and  requires a review of existing regulations.   By promoting economic analysis requirements during the regulatory  process, this bill ensures that regulation writing is data driven and  not done on an ad hoc basis with little thought to the true impact the  expanding regulatory net has on businesses and the economy.   It is a mistake for regulators overseeing our financial system and  the capital markets, including the SEC, to promulgate regulations  without fully considering the costs and benefits, as well as all of the  available regulatory alternatives.   This bill also takes the commonsense approach of requiring the SEC to  evaluate whether a proposed regulation is inconsistent with, or  duplicative of, other Federal regulations. When our businesses are  being overwhelmed by compliance obligations that demand more and more  time and resources, it is crucial that our regulators do everything in  their power to ensure that regulations are effective, streamlined, and  nonduplicative to minimize impact.   It is important to note that this legislation does not limit the  SEC's rulemaking authority in any capacity. The bill appropriately  strengthens the SEC's existing cost-benefit-related requirements to  ensure that the true impact of regulations can be calculated.   To advocate for the status quo and against this legislation shows a  fundamental misunderstanding of the financial system and the regulatory  process. This legislation is a vote of confidence that, with the  appropriate tools and a data-driven approach, our regulatory agencies  can create a framework of safety and soundness that does not unduly  burden our economy.   I am happy to lend my support to this bill and encourage my  colleagues to support this commonsense measure. I, again, thank the  gentlewoman from Missouri for her efforts on this legislation.
