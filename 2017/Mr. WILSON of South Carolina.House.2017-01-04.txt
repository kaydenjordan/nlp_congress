 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the first day  of the 115th Congress, the House of Representatives elected Paul Davis  Ryan to serve as Speaker of the House. I have been grateful to serve  with Speaker Ryan, a proven conservative, throughout my service in  Congress and can attest to his commitment to conservative values with  innovative thoughtfulness.   Under Speaker Ryan's leadership, House Republicans last year passed  meaningful legislation providing greater outreach service for veterans,  reinforcing local control of education, ending the 40-year ban on crude  oil exports, combating the opioid epidemic, passing the National  Defense Authorization Act, and enacting sweeping mental health reform.   Speaker Ryan also launched A Better Way, a bold policy agenda that  presents meaningful initiatives for restoring a confident America by  presenting solutions to address poverty, grow our economy to create  jobs, defend the Constitution, improve health care by repealing the  failing ObamaCare, reform the Tax Code, and strengthen the military.   I was grateful to cast my vote for Speaker Ryan, and I look forward  to working with him, President-elect Donald Trump, and Vice President- elect Mike Pence in the new Congress to deliver policies of limited  government and expanded freedom for American families.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his  actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on  terrorism.                            ____________________
