 Mr. Speaker, I rise to say this: Americans are  suffering from extortionate, skyrocketing drug prices, and this is  unacceptable.   Between 2013 and 2016, 67 percent of Americans who had to file for  bankruptcy did so because of enormous medical expenses. That is  unacceptable.   Last year, in my home State of Pennsylvania alone, one in four  individuals had to forgo medical care so they could pay their rent or  put food on the table. That is not a choice we can, in good conscience,  allow them to have to make. It is unacceptable.   I am, therefore, proud to announce my support of the Lower Drug Costs  Now Act, H.R. 3, landmark legislation which takes bold strides to lower  prescription drug prices for all Americans.   On behalf of the families who demand and deserve drug pricing reform,  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure swift passage  of this landmark, critical legislation.
