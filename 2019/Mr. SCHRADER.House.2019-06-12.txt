 Mr. Chair, I rise today to urge support for this  important bipartisan amendment.   The Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers program provides valuable  services to get at-risk young adults the skills they need to succeed. I  would repeat that: This is a very successful program with phenomenal  results. To turn our back on these kids is unconscionable.   It is an extremely successful program, training thousands in a  variety of tasks, like working on rural infrastructure projects,  maintaining our national forests, and being a frontline member for our  natural disaster relief teams.   Wildfire season has already started out West. We need these services  to enhance our brave first-responder teams. As pointed out by the  chairman, these folks were invaluable during the 2017 fire season,  providing the equivalent of 450,000 hours of service, leveraging our  tax dollars in a great way.   I have heard from a number of constituents and groups in my district  that are worried about the future of these young people, like the  Angell CCC on our Oregon coast.   This is a callous approach by the administration.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and push  back against this ill-thought-out plan.
