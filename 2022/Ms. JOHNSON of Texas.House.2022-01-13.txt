 Madam Speaker, right now, our Nation is at a  crossroads.   As we speak, the sacred right to vote--the fundamental pillar on  which our Nation was built on--is under attack.   That's why I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5746, the Freedom  to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. This bill--itself a result of prolonged and  spirited deliberation between the House and the Senate--will if enacted  serve as a safeguard for our democracy for generations to come.   Let me be clear: every American must have the opportunity to make  their voices heard and their votes counted. This is an issue with no  middle ground--when the voice or the vote of one is suppressed, so be  it for us all.   We have seen no better example of the attack on voting rights than in  my home state of Texas. Initiatives like SB. I have sought to undermine  the right to vote freely, fairly, and safely for people across the  state--especially those in minority and underserved communities. We  have and must continue to fight these archaic and discriminatory laws,  and today is a step in the right direction.   I would also be remiss if I didn't point out that we are using a bill  from the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, which I chair, to  advance this legislation. Our Committee has traditionally focused on  the issues of the future--items such as scientific research, space  exploration, and technological innovations. That is why it is fitting  that the House Leadership chose one of our bills to guarantee that the  United States Senate would debate the future of our democracy.   Madam Speaker, simply put, we can no longer afford the cost of  inaction on this issue. I urge my colleagues in both the House and  Senate to support this legislation so that we can meet the urgency of  the moment.
