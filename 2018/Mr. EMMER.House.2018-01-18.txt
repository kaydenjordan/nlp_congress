 Mr. Speaker, every citizen in our Nation desires the  chance to achieve their American Dream. For thousands across this  country, their American Dream consists of owning a home or starting  their own business.   Some laws have proven helpful in achieving this dream; others have  created obstacles by codifying government overreach.   In 1975, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act was enacted. This important  law exposed and helped eliminate discriminatory lending practices,  particularly against minorities. In short, this law helped more  Americans realize their dream of owning a home.   Over the years, however, the disclosures required by the law have  expanded away from the original intent and have actually become an  obstacle, preventing small, medium, and local lenders from helping  aspiring landowners and business entrepreneurs.   In 2015, the Dodd-Frank-created agency, the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, CFPB, demanded from lenders more than double the  amount of data originally required under the Home Mortgage Disclosure  Act.   That double-the-data rule took effect on the 1st of this month.  Larger lenders are able to adapt. In fact, most, if not all, continue  to be in the home mortgage business today.   But for smaller lenders, for the family-owned bank on Main Street,  the double-the-data rule means making fewer mortgages or none at all.  This unintended result is something each of us has heard over and over  again in our home districts.   Again, these are not the Wells Fargos, the Bank of Americas, or the  J.P.Morgans. These are the small guys, the little guys on Main Street  Minnesota and Main Streets all across this country.   We all remember the financial crisis of 2008 and the devastation it  brought to this Nation. Our economy suffered greatly.                                time  1545    No one wants that again. Unfortunately, Congress reacted by demanding  that small banks and credit unions, quite literally, pay for a crisis  they didn't cause. In the great State of Minnesota, the ``Land of  10,000 Lakes,'' I consistently hear from small banks and credit unions  that want to do what they do best: help Minnesotans achieve the  American Dream.   Due to the increased cost of compliance with the CFPB's double-the- data rule--an estimated additional $326 million--many small banks in  Minnesota are reconsidering their ability to continue to make mortgages  and other covered loans.   In 2014, Minnesota credit unions were on the hook for $7.2 billion in  compliance costs. That is before the double-the-data rule. Not only are  the additional HMDA compliance burdens ill-suited and unnecessary for  these institutions, the CFPB's rule does very little to provide  additional protection, all while potentially exposing consumers to  potential identity theft or fraud.   This information comes from those on the ground, the ones who are  seeing this misguided rule in action. As a direct result of having  fewer and fewer small, medium, and local lenders in the home mortgage  business or offering capital for their neighbor's small business to get  off the ground, the CFPB's rule has put the American Dream out of reach  for thousands across the country.   Mr. Speaker, today we have to rightsize government regulation to  create more opportunity. We have the opportunity to encourage small-  and medium-sized financial institutions in our local communities to  keep their doors open, to make mortgages again, to make loans to would- be entrepreneurs, in short, to fund the dreams of their neighbors and  friends.   We have an opportunity to expand, not the law, but rather, and  instead, the number of Americans who can own a home or start their own  business.   I first introduced the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act when I  came to Congress in 2015. It is a bill that would keep the original  intent of the 1975 law. Nothing will overwrite or exempt any financial  institution, big or small, from reporting data related to race and  gender. It is a bill that will put a stop to the loss of small- and  medium-sized lenders by providing desperately needed regulatory relief  for Main Street banks and credit unions.   I am pleased to say it is a bill that has been perfected with the  input from both sides of the aisle, present company excluded, and in  both Chambers. Our goal today shouldn't be to expand the law. Our goal  today should be to expand the number of Americans who want to get one  step closer to achieving their American Dream, whether it is owning a  home or starting a business.   Mr. Speaker, that is our goal, and today we can take a big step  forward in reaching that goal. If my fellow colleagues share this goal,  then I urge you to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2954, and pass the  [[Page H516]]  Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from  Minnesota who described his district, he failed to mention that the  China-Asia Economic Development Association and the Jewish Community  Action group all oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Crist), a member of the Committee on Financial Services.
