 Mr. President, I rise today with a heaviness in my heart  for what we have seen happening in the last 36 hours in Hong Kong.   Freedom-loving people in Hong Kong for the last 23 years have known  basic, fundamental human and natural rights, and we see the Communist  Party of China coming in and trying to steal their dignity and to steal  their freedom. They live in real and tangible fear of what is going to  happen tonight and this weekend and next week.   Yesterday was July 1. July 1 is the anniversary 23 years ago of Hong  Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty under the Sino-British Joint  Declaration. Under that agreement, the Communist Party of China made a  pledge not just to Hongkongers and not just to the British but to the  watching world, and they said that it would guarantee--they would  guarantee--a certain level of autonomy and freedom to the Hong Kong  community and that Hong Kong would not be forced to live under the kind  of despotism that the mainland Chinese are forced to experience.   The Communist Party announced to the world, in signing that  declaration, that Hongkongers would be retaining a lot of freedom.  Well, since that handover in 1997 and, especially since 2003, when  there was another attempted national security law debated, the people  of Hong Kong have been holding pro-democracy protests and celebrations  every year on the July 1 holiday. Annually, on July 1, they have  reminded the world of what the pledge was of the Communist Party in  that agreement of July 1997.   Yesterday, though, protesting and demanding basic human rights and  freedoms in Hong Kong became a crime. Under the new national security  law, to speak out, to exercise freedom of assembly, freedom of speech,  or freedom of the press issues is considered an act of secession,  subversion, and terrorism. That is what the new national security law  that the Chinese have forced on Hong Kong stipulates.   Thousands of people--thousands of brave freedom lovers--flooded into  the streets anyway, and they celebrated yesterday that anniversary, and  they demanded that their representatives who have sold them out to  Beijing would continue to testify to the pledges that were made 23  years ago yesterday. At the end of yesterday, several hundred of these  freedom-loving protesters were arrested, and 10 of them were charged  with suspected violations under the new national security law.   Chinese Government officials now seem to be saying that these folks,  these 10, are going to be extradited to mainland China and face their  charges there. Remember, the protests that we have seen in Hong Kong  over the last 15 or 16 months were specifically because of an  extradition law where Hongkongers were facing the threat of being  extradited to mainland China, and, supposedly, according to the  government officials in Hong Kong, this rule, this intended legislation  was going to be suspended. Well, instead, it looks like it is, in fact,  connected to this new national security law.   Yesterday really marks the beginning of a new reign of terror in Hong  Kong. With the implementation of this national security law, it is  abundantly clear that the Communist Party seeks to turn Hong Kong into  a police state no different from Tibet or Xinjiang, and the Hong Kong  Government no longer derives any power from the consent of the people  who govern, but rather it seeks to rule solely by its cooperation with  the CCP's security apparatus.   We are witnessing the signs of the coming crackdown. Even before this  law was signed, democracy activists and lawmakers, including Martin  Lee, who is Hong Kong's father of democracy and the drafter of Hong  Kong's basic law, had already been rounded up. Many are expecting the  same fate for themselves in the coming days. Many folks have begun to  say goodbye to their families in anticipation that they are going to be  rounded up and hauled off into another one of the Chinese reeducation  camps or whatever Orwellian euphemism we want say for the new and  potentially coming Auschwitzes.   Reading over the last several days, I am grieved over what are  especially painful and tear-jerking farewell messages from many of  these democracy activists in Hong Kong on social media heading up to  midnight on June 30, before the new law took effect. My heart ached as  I read Joshua Wong tweeting out from the Psalms, in particular Psalm  23:4:         I may walk through valleys as dark as death, but I won't be       afraid. You are with me, and your shepherd's rod makes me       feel safe.    This was mere hours after announcing that he and other Demosisto  members--a democracy political organization--would be closing down  their organizations.   Pro-democratic parties and pro-independence parties, like the Hong  Kong National Front and Studentlocalism, have announced on social media  that they, too, have disbanded and will try to continue their fight for  freedom from abroad. But if you read the national security law that the  Communist Party is imposing, it looks like they are going to try to  claim extraterritorial powers over Hongkongers in exile regarding  freedom-of-speech issues in other places in the world as also a  violation of this new, tyrannical, Communist Party Chinese law.   Videos of restaurant owners and cafe owners are up on social media.  You can see them removing their pro-democracy posters, their signs  celebrating the freedom that Hong Kong has known in the past. These  folks are tearing down these signs in their own restaurants and in  their places of assembly because they assume they are likely to be  punished under the new national security law if they keep up signs that  they have had in their places of business where they were communing and  breaking bread over the past many, many years. This serves as a  chilling reminder of how the CCP rules through fear, which it  ultimately turns into self-censorship.   Hong Kong-based Twitter accounts have been deleted en masse.  Individuals fear for their safety if they continue to use the platform,  and they fear retribution for previous tweets supporting democracy and  accountable government, which is just a fundamental human thing to be  able to say or do or talk about or plead for. Like in mainland China,  Twitter will undoubtedly become a tool that is reserved only for the  oppressors, no longer for the oppressed.   I fear that Joshua's request--``If my voice will not be heard soon, I  hope that the international community will continue to speak up for  Hong Kong and step up concrete efforts to defend our last bit of  freedom''--I fear that Joshua's request will be met with silence.   I fear that we will fail Ronald Reagan's challenge to us that we  would be ``staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the soul  prerogative of the lucky few, but [rather, it is] the unalienable and  universal right of all human beings.'' We are all created in God's  image, and our rights come to us from God via nature, not because of  the beneficence of some government.   I fear that we in the United States and those in the international  community will just simply move on from the kind of imminent crackdown  in Hong Kong that we are going to see that is going to have echoes of  what happened in Tiananmen Square in June of 1989 and that so many  people just decide to allow the Chinese Government to whitewash and  pretend never happened. We must not allow that to happen.   I pray that we in this body will live up to our convictions and that  we will speak out about what the Communist Party is going to do to the  freedom-loving people of Hong Kong.   Thank you.    Mr. President, if the chairman would yield for just one  moment.    I would also like to praise the chairman for the work he  [[Page S4178]]  does. Flying around the world can be hard on bodies. When you have all  the work you have to do at home and you go around the world and you  encourage freedom-loving people--I know that many, many wonderful folks  in Taiwan who are fearful because of what they see happening in Hong  Kong know they have had an advocate in the chairman of the Armed  Services Committee for many, many years.   To the people in Taiwan who are also scared at this moment, Jim  Inhofe is a heroic speaker. I just want to thank him for the work he  has done there.
