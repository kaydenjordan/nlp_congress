 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule that is before us  today. As Democrats in the House bring forward legislation in the name  of supporting the environment and climate, I would like to talk a  little bit about the process.   My good friend Chairman McGovern and the Democratic majority of the  House Rules Committee received a total of 91 amendments submitted for  consideration on the legislation that we have before us, and as you  just heard from Mr. Cole, of the 45 Democratic amendments, more  than half were made in order, 26 of those; but of the 44 Republican  amendments submitted for consideration, only 3--let me repeat that--3  of those were made in order.    Myself, I offered 2 of those 44 amendments. They were  noncontroversial. They were ruled germane to the legislation before us  by the House Parliamentarian, and all they did, simply, was recognize  the clean, renewable benefits of hydropower and the clean emissions- free benefits of nuclear power, but Chairman McGovern and his committee  refused to allow this recognition.   So we have got to ask ourselves, Madam Speaker:   Why? Why, if we are supposedly here to debate policy affecting our  environment and our climate, why would they not want to discuss the  clean energy that comes from hydroelectric dams like those in my  district along the Columbia and Snake Rivers?   Why would they not want to discuss the emissions-free energy produced  by nuclear power plants like the Columbia Generating Station in my  district in central Washington.   It is because the efforts put forward by Democrats in the House, be  it the flawed Paris agreement legislation that is before us or the  radical Green New Deal proposal--which, I might add, has no mention of  hydropower and actually calls for the end of nuclear power in our  Nation--have nothing to do with science and everything to do with  politics.   The majority party, the Democrats, with these proposals, is more  focused on pushing a mandated top-down system that will inevitably do  nothing to help our environment.   What we should be doing, and what my Republican colleagues continue  to advocate for, is focusing on the free market approach spurred by  collaboration and innovation between our national laboratories,  research universities, Federal partners, and the private sector.   Madam Speaker, I would say to my friend Mr. McGovern that, when  Republicans were in the majority, we made a conscientious effort on the  Rules Committee to provide equitable treatment of amendments offered to  legislation. With the process before us today, it is disappointing to  see the chairman not following in that good faith effort, and I would  urge a ``no'' vote.
