 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, today, I stand here in proud support of the bipartisan  Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019, which includes my  bill, the Closing the Law Enforcement Consent Loophole Act.   I introduced this bill when I read a shocking article last year about  a teenager in New York who was raped by two police officers while in  their custody in the back of an unmarked police vehicle. When she  reported the rape, a loophole in New York State law allowed the  officers to claim she consented to having sex with them, despite the  fact that she was handcuffed and under their control.   I was appalled to learn about this and was concerned that that was a  legitimate defense, at that time, in New York, and it remains an  acceptable defense in 30 other States and for Federal law enforcement  officers.   My bill has now been included in VAWA and will no longer allow for  Federal law enforcement officers to use that consent defense as well.   There are also financial incentives for the 30 States that need to  close their loopholes by providing additional VAWA grant funds to  States that pass similar legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to protect the safety of our  women. Closing this loophole puts us one step closer to achieving that  safety.
