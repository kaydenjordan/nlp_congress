 Mr. President, today I rise to talk about a critically  important position in the Trump administration Cabinet: The  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA is  charged with making sure that all Americans are safeguarded from major  environmental threats to human health, where they live, where they  learn, and where they work.   Originally proposed by a Republican administration, the EPA's mission  has been supported by Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike.  Clean air to breathe and clean water to drink are basic human needs  that we all must work to protect. Disagreements involving the EPA  usually stem from how to best preserve our vital resources, and we  certainly welcome those debates in the Senate.   Oftentimes, the role of the Environmental Protection Agency is to  provide a check and balance to activities that pollute our air, dirty  our waterways, and contaminate our land. This is why I am so troubled  by the nomination of Scott Pruitt as EPA Administrator. Mr. Pruitt's  track record on environmental issues as Oklahoma's attorney general is,  in a word, dismal.   I am particularly concerned about the influence of the fossil fuel  industry over Mr. Pruitt's decisions and actions. As Oklahoma's  attorney general, he filed 148 lawsuits against the EPA to undermine  their efforts. In 13 of those cases, companies that gave political  donations to Mr. Pruitt also joined in that suit. As ranking member of  the Science Subcommittee, I am worried that scientific data of the  Environmental Protection Agency will be minimized, suppressed, or  politicalized. Mr. Pruitt has tried to instill doubt in the strong  consensus of global climate change scientists, claiming that the debate  on fundamental scientific principles is far from settled.   If his confirmation goes through, I am concerned that the work of EPA  scientists may be edited, twisted, or buried to protect special  interests and prevent necessary action. Many Michiganders are  rightfully afraid that Mr. Pruitt will not enforce our bedrock  environmental laws like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. We  have seen him fight against these very laws from his current position.   All across the Nation, communities are dealing with contamination and  environmental catastrophes. Rural and urban communities alike depend on  the strength of these laws as well as EPA's resources and their  expertise. For example, the people of Flint, MI, are still suffering  through devastating effects of a catastrophic drinking water crisis.  The Environmental Protection Agency is heavily involved to make sure  the drinking water in Flint will be safe and the National Safe Drinking  Water Act rules will be updated. I am very concerned that the EPA will  ignore the lessons learned after the Flint water crisis under  Administrator Pruitt, and Flint is not the only community facing a  water quality crisis. For example, Monroe County--which gets its water  from Lake Erie--has seen its drinking water affected because of toxins  in western Lake Erie.   Algae blooms--a result of runoff pollution--have made their way into  drinking water intakes. Harmful algal blooms are a problem that  scientists say will only get worse as we see higher temperatures and  more precipitation in the future.   In addition to providing safe drinking water, I am concerned that  enforcement of clean air policies would be weakened. Keeping our air  clean isn't just about climate change. It is about keeping pollutants  out of the lungs of our children. People in places like Southwest  Detroit and St. Clair County all too often suffer the harmful impacts  from poor air quality. Detroit has some of the highest child asthma  rates in the entire country. Children can't learn if they are too sick  to be in school.  [[Page S337]]    Mr. Pruitt has a record we can look at, and it is very extreme. He  has attacked measures that reduced interstate smog pollution, including  protections against arson and mercury. If Mr. Pruitt has sought to  weaken these protections around the country that protect us from  poisons like arsenic and mercury, I think we have to ask the question,  If he is confirmed, will he be protecting American families or will he  be protecting the bottom line of multinational corporations?   To those who welcome Mr. Pruitt's approach of attacking the EPA, I  would say strengthening our economy and our environment are not  mutually exclusive. In fact, each effort depends on the success of the  other. We must protect our natural resources so future generations will  be able to sustainably use them.   Businesses can only attract top talent and jobs to the United States  if we have clean places to live and to work and if we have a healthy  workforce. Sick days brought on by environmental toxins hurt small  businesses, and environmental catastrophes can decimate a lifetime's  worth of equity built up by homeowners.   Smart, effective protections can be good, not just for our physical  health but for our economic health as well. Previous EPA nominees from  both parties have understood these basic principles. What separates Mr.  Pruitt from past EPA nominees is his contempt for the mission of the  Environmental Protection Agency and his disregard for the science that  provides the very foundation for the Agency's actions.   Just as I would not vote to confirm a fox to guard a henhouse, I will  not vote to confirm Mr. Pruitt to safeguard our Nation's environment.   I urge my colleagues to join me to oppose Mr. Pruitt's nomination.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Blue  Water Area Chamber of Commerce on the occasion of its 100th  anniversary. The chamber was founded in 1906 by a group of  businessowners and entrepreneurs in Port Huron who volunteered their  time and financial resources to the growth of the greater Port Huron- Marysville community.   Within its first year, the chamber had accomplished its goal of  encouraging economic growth with the addition of new factories and the  establishment of an industrial enterprise fund. Its work attracted new  business from around Michigan, Illinois, and Kentucky. By the time the  chamber was officially incorporated in 1917, it had grown to 905  members. This expansion allowed the chamber to begin to improve the  well-being of the Port Huron community, a tradition that continues to  this day.   Throughout its history, the Blue Water Area Chamber of Commerce has  been more than just a way to connect businesses in the Port Huron area.  It continually advocates for the community. Over the past few years,  the chamber has led initiatives that have addressed housing shortages,  advocated for improved conditions in our schools through finance reform  and millage campaigns, and supported campaigns to improve our regional  infrastructure. It has fought, time and time again, not just for better  business, but for the prosperity of the entire Blue Water region.   Today the Blue Water Area Chamber of Commerce continues its great  tradition of fostering economic prosperity and community improvement.  The guiding force throughout the last century has been the chamber's  five core values: integrity, relationships, freedom, excellence, and  happiness. By adhering to these values, they have grown and continued  to succeed. In 2007, the Blue Water Area Chamber of Commerce was  awarded the Chamber of the Year Award from the Michigan Association of  Chamber Professionals. It received this great honor again in 2010, for  its continued and outstanding work in advocacy, education, and  assistance programs to its community, a true testament to the  membership and leadership. The growth we have seen in the Port Huron  over the past few years has been remarkable, and the Blue Water Chamber  has been a critical component of that success and progress.   I am pleased today to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing  such an auspicious milestone for the Blue Water Area Chamber of  Commerce. On its 100th anniversary, the chamber and its members have  much to celebrate, and I wish them continuing success and prosperity in  the years ahead.                            ____________________
