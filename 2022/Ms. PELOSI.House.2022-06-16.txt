 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor. I  commend him and the members of the committee, as we just heard from  Congresswoman Spanberger, for their very important work recognizing the  needs of America's working families with their kitchen table issues,  recognizing the needs in rural America for us to have legislation that  strengthens rural America's hand in the decisions that we make as we go  forward.   Mr. Speaker, as we gather here, the war continues in Ukraine. It is  an unprovoked, outrageous act of aggression on the part of Putin and  Russia invading the territorial borders of Ukraine.   At the same time, doing that has driven up prices here at home,  driven up prices at the pump; it is a Putin price at the pump. That is  the main reason, in the short period of time following the invasion of  Ukraine, the price at the pump went up its highest amount in a very  long time.   Russia is also a source of fertilizer, a big source of fertilizer to  our country, and of course, diminishing the supply coming in raises the  cost of fertilizer and contributes to the cost for our farmers, and of  course, then contributes to the price of food at the grocery store. It  is an important kitchen table issue.   Putin's price at the pump is exacerbating the skyrocketing costs  weighing heavily on our families. Again, since Russia began its saber- rattling against Ukraine, gas prices in many places went up $2 per  gallon.   Meanwhile, the World Bank reports that global food prices in March  and April spiked 16 percent over the 2 months prior, and while Putin  works to fuel inflation today, the Democratic House--hopefully, in a  bipartisan way--takes a strong step to bring down crucial kitchen table  costs at the pump and grocery store and across the board.   Our Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act does precisely what the name  suggests in three major areas.   First, the bill brings down the costs for farmers in the field. As we  know, oil, gasoline is an important factor of production for farmers in  order for them to produce. The war in Ukraine has restricted the supply  of fertilizer, as I mentioned, and sent the costs through the roof. By  taking action to lower the costs on the farm, we lower the costs on the  shelf in the grocery store and on the kitchen table.   Second, this bill bolsters competition in the meatpacking industry,  and I thank Mr. Scott for his leadership. Cracking down on the market  power of big conglomerates and increasing competition will ensure  ranchers get a fair deal for their livestock while families get a good  price for meat and poultry.   Third, this bill will help make cheaper, cleaner homegrown biofuels  more widely available. This summer drivers who choose to fill up with  Unleaded 88 could save an average of 40 cents a gallon, and by making  this fuel more widely available it will unleash the power of America's  farmers to help break the grip of foreign autocrats on energy markets;  lower gas prices, while keeping our dollars here at home; and reduce  pollution because biofuels are cleaner than petroleum.  [[Page H5624]]    Today's action to lower food and fuel costs is the latest  manifestation of House Democrats' unyielding commitment to fight  inflation.   Last month, our majority voted to hold Big Oil accountable for price  gouging and war profiteering, which has kept energy prices excessively  high.   This week, we passed legislation to crack down on exorbitant ocean  shipping fees, leveling the playing field for American businesses and  lowering costs for American consumers. Proudly today, President Biden  will sign this legislation into law. It is called the Ocean Shipping  Reform Act of 2022.   As we speak, the Congress is hard at work on a bold, bipartisan,  bicameral competitiveness package to make more goods in America;  strengthen our supply chains; diversify our STEM workforce; and  reinvigorate research and development. We look forward to sending this  strong cost-cutting legislation to the President's desk.    Here is the thing: Inflation springs from higher costs. Higher costs  spring from shorter supply. Shorter supply is there because of COVID  preventing certain products from coming into our country, so short  supply. Short supply of factors of production coming into our country.   That is why the COMPETES Act is so important because it will make us  more independent, more self-sufficient on the products we need; for  example, chips. Chips are a very important part of that bill. To make a  car it takes 1,000 chips; an electric car, 2,000 chips. But we can't do  that manufacturing unless we have chips, and if other countries are  saving chips for themselves at home or the high fees of transporting  them make it just unaffordable to people, we need to make these chips  at home, and that is what the COMPETES Act enables us to do.   So lowering costs for our families; when we ran in 2018--just to  bring back promises made--we said we were going to lower costs by  lowering the costs of prescription drugs, and that is what we are in  the midst of doing now. We are going to lower costs in every way for  America's working families. That is what this legislation does here.   We are going to have bigger paychecks. And we have had, since  President Biden took office, working with the private sector and the  nonprofit sector and the public sector, 8 million jobs have been  created. Unemployment has been cut in half. Wages have gone up. That  also contributes to inflation, which must be addressed, and this  legislation is part of doing that.   So this legislation is a strong step in that direction, and I salute  the relentless leadership of the Agriculture chair,   David Scott, and  the Energy and Commerce chair, Frank Pallone, who is an important part  of this, as well as Representatives Spanberger, Craig, Axne, and Harder  and the dedicated staff of both committees.   Together, they have assembled a package of popular bipartisan  legislation with a laser focus on fighting inflation.                                time  1015    Make no mistake, a vote against this bill is a vote to keep the cost  of gas and groceries high, when we can do just the opposite by voting  for it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong ``yes'' vote.
