 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Chris  Hazencomb. Chris attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October  1.   Chris was a sports junkie who loved the Angels, Raiders, and Lakers.  He worked at the local Walmart and is remembered by all of his  customers as being very friendly.   Chris was close to his mother, Maryanne, and even had a gift for her  with him while at the festival. Chris died shielding his friend, Nikki,  from gunfire with his own body. He is remembered for his love of  helping people and his constant need to put others before himself.   I would like to extend my condolences to Chris' family and friends.  Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the  whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
