 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5657, the  Medical Marijuana Research Act.   I first thank Mr. Blumenauer, Mr. Harris, and, of course, the  chairman of the committee, but Mr. Harris and Mr. Blumenauer are the  lead sponsors of this legislation.   Though our long-term goals for marijuana regulation may differ, the  three of us share a strong conviction that scientific data should form  the basis for policymaking whenever possible. For four Congresses now,  we have joined forces to advocate for more research on the use of  cannabis products to treat medical conditions.   My belief that medical marijuana probably can be beneficial when used  in the proper setting for treatment of certain medical conditions is  based largely on anecdotal evidence from constituents and citizens.   Despite the increasing use of cannabis products around the country,  there have been very few legitimate, peer-reviewed studies to determine  the effects of cannabis on the body, particularly over a long period of  time.   This lack of research is due, in large part, to the Federal  Government standing in the way. Marijuana's schedule I status makes it  extremely difficult for scientists to, one, obtain approval to conduct  cannabis research; and, two, obtain a quality product of marijuana to  use for that research.  [[Page H4139]]    H.R. 5657 addresses both of these issues. It encourages medical  marijuana research by establishing a new set of research standards that  are specific to cannabis. This will allow cannabis to remain classified  as a schedule I substance while increasing access for those who wish to  study it.   It also ensures the availability of verified cannabis products  necessary for legitimate research by establishing a new registration  process. Entities who choose to register and are approved will be able  to legally manufacture and distribute marijuana for the purpose of  conducting such research.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield to gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Harris) as much time as he may consume.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I would say, Madam Chair, you have heard the comments from both sides  of the aisle. We need the research. It is good for the American public  to know whether or not this stuff works.   But you hear accounts from citizens that they are having to buy  marijuana on the street. Maybe they can get it in some of these States  now. But when you are dealing with epilepsy, for example, they have to  boil up a tincture to make sure that it has the CBD and some level of  THC, but nobody really knows what level of THC is necessary to help  with juvenile epilepsy. We just don't know. We have no research.   Parents out there, concerned about the well-being of their children,  have turned their children into guinea pigs. Yet, because in many  States it is still illegal, and was illegal until just a few years ago,  they haven't been able to report their findings to anybody who is  working on this in an official sense.   It is time that ends. Let's do research on cannabis. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am disappointed that all Members could not reach an  agreement on this bill. I have an  [[Page H4142]]  amendment that would specify the types of conditions required to be  addressed by this bill, which would help clarify its intent for the  implementing agencies.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the text of my proposed  amendment.         In the heading of section 2, strike ``congenital anomaly or       birth defect'' and insert ``craniofacial, oral, or       maxillofacial congenital anomaly or birth defect''.        In section 2799A-11 of the Public Health Service Act,       section 726 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of       1974, and section 9826 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,       as proposed to be added by section 2--        (1) in the heading, strike ``congenital anomaly or birth       defect'' and insert ``craniofacial, oral, or maxillofacial       congenital anomaly or birth defect''; and        (2) in subsection (a), strike the term ``congenital anomaly       or birth defect'' and insert ``craniofacial, oral, or       maxillofacial congenital anomaly or birth defect'' each place       such term appears.     Madam Speaker, the stated goal of the bill is a good  one, making sure those who, through no fault of their own, are born  with a condition requiring extensive medical care can eat, drink, and  thrive.   I would love to be able to tell families like the one in my district  with two children experiencing ectodermal dysplasia that insurance  would pay for the hundreds of thousands of dollars of surgery necessary  to allow their teeth and mouths to function properly. But this bill  needs more work, and my amendment could have addressed its most  significant flaw.   Had the bill gone through regular order, I would have offered this  corrective amendment.   The biggest problem here is that not one person can articulate which  medical procedures or treatments would be required to be covered by  insurance.   The bill is titled healthy smiles, referencing cleft palate,  ectodermal dysplasia, et cetera, but not one person can articulate  which medical procedures or treatments would be required to be covered  by insurance. This is, in part, because the FDA has no statutory or  regulatory definition of what a congenital anomaly or birth defect is.   Further, one part of the bill requires insurers to ``include any  medically necessary item or service to . . . restore any body part to  achieve normal body functioning or appearance,'' while another part  provides that ``'treatment' shall not include cosmetic surgery.''   Technical comments from the Department of Labor support my belief  that these two provisions ``seem to be in tension.'' There is a tension  between the two sections.   Because the language is so vague, CBO found it difficult to estimate  the cost. They expressed uncertainty around identifying the procedures  and services that would be considered medically necessary. Nonetheless,  they took a stab at it and guessed it would cost around $1.8 billion.   My amendment would resolve these concerns by replacing the phrase  ``congenital anomaly or birth defect'' with ``craniofacial, oral, or  maxillofacial congenital anomaly or birth defect'' to specify the types  of conditions advocates of this bill have been discussing for months.  Most of the people who signed on as cosponsors thought that was just  what they were doing. They didn't know they were going to cover, as the  gentlewoman has said, the 4 percent of children born with any kind of a  birth defect.   Given that my amendment cannot be considered today, I will be voting  ``no.''   Now, you may wonder, how did I come to this conclusion? When my  oldest son was born 16 years ago, when I called my wife's father, his  first question was, ``Does he have all his fingernails?'' because my  wife was born with a congenital birth defect. She doesn't have  fingernails on her index fingers. This has caused them to be injured  numerous times over the years.   There is no question it qualifies under this bill for some kind of  treatment, whether it be an implant to replace those nails--if this  bill passes, we will be doing everything from the healthy smiles that  the bill purports to do all the way down to fingernails.   Now, she is fine. She has grown up. She has adjusted. Everything is  good. But the first question my father-in-law asked was, ``Does he have  all his fingernails?'' because, for years, it was a concern to him as a  father, as a parent.   This bill would deal with that, and that is why it is hard to say  what it is going to cost because a lot of smaller defects like my  wife's fingernails would be covered under this.                                time  1745    And if it is covered, by golly, you know they are going to fix it.  The worst thing she has to do now is wear gloves when we take out the  Christmas tree and try to be careful. But as a child, it was a bigger  issue, and like I said, the tips of her index fingers are a little  bulbous. She might be offended by this, but if you look closely, it  looks a little bit like E.T.'s finger, though it is not quite as long  and it doesn't light up. But it is a birth defect that this bill would  cover at huge cost to the American public and to the American  taxpayers.   This bill goes too far. I wish we had the opportunity to accept my  amendment, which we can't do on a bill that is on suspension, because  then we could make sure it dealt with the big items that only affect a  much smaller part of the population and that truly do need to be dealt  with.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I will submit that my amendment was not offered at the  full committee. Two years ago, when we were taking this bill through  regular order, at that time it was discussed that we would try to work  on language that would narrow the scope before it came to the floor. I  assumed that that would be done before this bill was brought up on a  suspension; that has not happened. I would be more than happy, if we  have to come to loggerheads over it, that we have that discussion where  we can discuss all the potential costs, all the potential birth defects  that might be covered, including the minor ones, the ones that don't  have an effect on lasting smiles, which is also included in this.   Now, the gentlewoman's heart is in the right place, and I have great  respect for her, and understand what she is trying to do. I just think  that there is so much unknown cost for so many minor birth defects and  small inconveniences that might be cosmetic or might not be, depending  on which doctor makes that decision, because we don't have a good  definition either in the bill or in the standard lingo of the FDA, et  cetera.   I think we are buying a whole lot more expense, both to the American  taxpayer, and, I believe, this is going to push up the cost of health  insurance on families that are already having difficulties making those  health insurance payments. All of that is correct.    And the chairman of the committee--also his heart is in the right  place--mentioned ectodermal dysplasia. I have no problem with us  treating that. It affects a small number of people. It is a huge cost  on a handful of families out there--maybe a few more than a handful-- but it does affect people disproportionately who cannot afford to have  that fixed, and it does create huge problems on eating, on talking, et  cetera. Those are the things we want to go after.   What I want to make sure we are not doing is spending billions of  dollars of American taxpayer dollars or raising the cost of health  insurance because we are going to take care of everything down to two  index finger fingernails missing, et cetera. That is my concern.   Madam Speaker, as you can tell, I feel passionately about this, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
