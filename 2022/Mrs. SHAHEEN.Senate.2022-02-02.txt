 Mr. President, I rise in recognition of the 36th  anniversary of the Challenger Space Shuttle Disaster and to pay tribute  to the memory of all seven Challenger crewmembers: Gregory Jarvis,  Judith Resnik, Francis Scobee, Ronald McNair, Michael Smith, Ellison  Onizuka, and Christa McAuliffe.   On January 28, 1986, the world witnessed a fatal accident that  claimed the lives of all seven of the Challenger's crewmembers. As many  of my colleagues will remember, just moments after launch, the shuttle  exploded, never having left the Earth's atmosphere. It was later  determined that unusually cold temperatures caused several seals within  the shuttle's right rocket booster to fail, ultimately resulting in  this devastating tragedy.   This anniversary is a particularly difficult day for the people of  New Hampshire as we pause to remember the Challenger crew, including  Granite Stater Christa McAuliffe. The Challenger mission had been  chosen to pilot President Reagan's Teacher in Space Program, and  Concord schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe was selected to be the  program's first participant. Christa looked forward to the opportunity  to teach two lessons from space and share her once-in-a-lifetime  experience with students across the country.   Although the Teacher in Space program was discontinued following the  accident, the families of the Challenger's crew established the first  Challenger Center for Space Science Education to promote science,  technology, engineering, and math--STEM--education. The center is a  nonprofit that engages with students and teachers, providing hands-on  education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Today,  40 Challenger learning centers have opened globally, and they are  continuing to expand opportunities for innovative programs and  activities in STEM. Though we lost five dedicated astronauts, a hard- working engineer, and a passionate and devoted educator 36 years ago,  the Challenger's poignant legacy continues to live on.   So many of our students and teachers can point to Christa McAuliffe  and Challenger learning centers as having inspired them to pursue  careers in education, science, mathematics, and innovation. New  Hampshire has both the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center, an air and  space museum and planetarium, as well as the Christa McAuliffe School,  an elementary school in Concord. I have no doubt Christa would be glad  to know that a great number of young women have chosen to follow in her  footsteps and embrace the values she worked so hard to espouse. Christa  lived by the words, ``I touch the future. I teach.'' More than three  decades later, her enduring impact on the future is clear.   In 2019, the Senate passed the Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin  Act, legislation I sponsored with the late Senator Mike Enzi of  Wyoming. The legislation was advanced through Congress with  overwhelming bipartisan  [[Page S494]]  support and was subsequently signed into law. The enactment of this  legislation meant that a commemorative coin in Christa's honor was  minted by the U.S. Treasury in 2021. Proceeds from the sale of this  coin are going to support STEM education, helping to cultivate a new  generation of scientists, engineers, and educators.   Today, we take pause to honor the seven outstanding professionals  lost in the Challenger accident and acknowledge that this is a very  difficult day for their colleagues at NASA, family and friends. Our  hearts are with them on this day of remembrance.                            ____________________
