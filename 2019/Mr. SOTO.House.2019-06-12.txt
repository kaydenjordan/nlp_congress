 Mr. Speaker, nearly 3 years ago, on this date, we lost 49  angels and 53 others were injured. Family and friends grieved for their  loved ones and our Orlando community mourned. But we came together,  stronger than ever before, to heal, to comfort each other, to overcome  this tragedy, and, most importantly, to give back.   As Orlando Strong, we swore, as a community, to never forget those  who we lost that night--their stories, their images, their memories,  and their spirits--which live on in our hearts and our memories. We can  never forget this tragic act of hate against the LGBTQ and Latinx  community: our community. We continue to reject these despicable acts  of hate.   To honor the fallen and the survivors of this tragedy, I joined with  my colleagues, Representatives Stephanie Murphy and Val Demings, to  introduce landmark legislation to designate the Pulse nightclub as a  federally recognized national memorial site. This designation gives  these hallowed grounds the national recognition it deserves, while  serving as a reminder that love overcomes hate.   Let the Pulse memorial become a symbol of hope, love, and continued  light for our community. We will always remember the 49 angels:   Edward Sotomayor, Jr.   Franky Jimmy DeJesus Velazquez   Stanley Almodovar, III   Xavier Emmanuel Serrano Rosado   Javier Jorge-Reyes   Shane Evan Tomlinson   Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo   Juan Ramon Guerrero   Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera   Peter O.

It  gives you just a glimpse of the carnage and the death that happened  that day, but we will always remember them.                              Do-Nothing Senate     Mr. Speaker, there is something rotten in the city of  Washington. There is an injustice brewing in this Capitol. And there is  a sinister plot afoot in this Congress.   On the one hand, we have the people's House, the House of  Representatives, where we are working every day and passing major  legislation--our For the People Agenda--and, on the Senate side, we see  something very different--inaction, stagnancy. In essence, they are  doing nothing.   Our For the People House is passing laws that combat corruption in  D.C. and strengthen election security. Our For the People House is  lowering prescription drug prices. Our For the People House is passing  the Equality Act, Dream Act, universal background checks, and others.                            ____________________
