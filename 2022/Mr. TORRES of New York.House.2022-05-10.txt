 Madam Speaker, I am here to speak about H.R.  7077, which stems from the tragedy of Twin Parks North West, the scene  of New York's deadliest fire in more than three decades, one that left  the South Bronx with a death count of 17, including 8 children, one as  young as 2 years of age.  [[Page H4735]]    The legislation would empower the United States Fire Administration  to investigate the deadliest fires, in partnership with State and local  governments. Not all local jurisdictions have the capacity to  investigate the causes of complex fires on their own. The Federal  Government, tapping into the technical expertise of the USFA, can and  should aid fire investigations in the aim of ascertaining the truth  about what exactly happened and why.    We must investigate the deadliest fires so that every lesson is  learned and so that no life is ever lost in vain.   The objective here is to enable the USFA to share lessons learned  with governments at all levels in the hopes of transforming those  lessons into policies and practices that prevent fires and save lives.   Every time a fire breaks out and a life is lost, we should be  reminded of a simple injunction: Those who fail to learn from history  are doomed to repeat it. Let us enable the USFA to learn from the  deadliest fires so that we as a Nation never repeat them.   I am enormously grateful for the partnership of Congress Member Haley  Stevens; without whose support the bill would never have been brought  to the floor. I am also enormously grateful for the bipartisan  cooperation of Congress Members Bice, Meijer, and Gonzalez.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters supporting my  legislation from the FDNY, International Association of Fire Chiefs,  National Association of State Fire Marshals, and the International  Association of Fire Fighters.                                                           FDNY,                                          Brooklyn, NY, May 9, 2022.      Hon. Ritchie Torres,      Congressman,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Torres: I am pleased to write in support       of H.R. 7077. This bill authorizes the U.S. Fire       Administration to conduct on-site investigations of major       fires and other fires under other specified circumstances.        This bill would help to prevent future fires and deadly       tragedies by empowering the U.S. Fire Administration to       launch investigations, which assess a range of broad       systematic matters that contribute to fire incidents. The       most recent fire at Twin Parks was a tragic reminder that a       serious fire can happen at any time, particularly in       vulnerable communities. Through investigations and education,       we can prevent future tragedies, and this bill will assist in       doing just that.        I look forward to partnering with your office on this bill       and other critical legislation that furthers New York City.            Sincerely,                                                 Laura Kavanagh,                                           Acting Fire Commissioner,      Fire Department of the City of New York.                                   ____                                           International Association                                                  of Fire Chiefs,                                       Chantilly, VA, March 4, 2022.      Hon. Ritchie Torres,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Torres: On behalf of the nearly 12,000       members of the International Association of Fire Chiefs       (IAFC), I endorse the Empowering the U.S. Fire Administration       Act. This legislation will allow the U.S. Fire Administration       (USFA) to examine the cause of major fires and share lessons       learned with local governments to prevent future tragedies.       The IAFC asks Congress to pass this legislation.        Deaths and property loss from fire remain a national       tragedy. The National Fire Protection Association reports       that, in 2020, local fire departments responded to more than       1.3 million fires. These resulted in 3,500 civilian fire       deaths, 15,200 injuries and more almost $22 billion in       property loss. Despite efforts to reduce the threat of fire,       the United States still has one of the worst fire problems in       the industrialized world.        The USFA can play a significant role in reducing fire       deaths and property loss. It has programs to promote fire       prevention and to train local fire departments to develop       effective fire prevention programs. The Empowering the U.S.       Fire Administration Act can add a valuable tool to USFA's       programs by allowing USFA to examine the cause and origin of       major fires and report on them. Specifically, the bill would       allow USFA to coordinate with the appropriate federal, state,       and local authorities, which are authorized to investigate       major fires. The USFA investigators would examine the       determined cause and origin of the fire and assess broader       systematic matters, including the use of codes and standards,       demographics, structural characteristics, smoke and fire       dynamics during the fire, and the costs of associated       injuries and deaths. Then the USFA would release a report on       this fire with recommendations about fire prevention in       similar buildings; how to improve the tactical response to       similar fires; and how to protect civilian life and property.       In addition, USFA could include this information in its       educational curricula at the National Fire Academy to ensure       that important lessons learned from major fires are       distributed throughout the national fire and emergency       service.        I thank you again for introducing this important       legislation. The nation must work harder to reduce the loss       of life and property through tragic fires. Your bill will       empower the USFA to examine the causes of major fires and       educate the nation on how to prevent future tragedies. We       look forward to collaborating with you to pass this bill.            Sincerely,                                 Fire Chief Kenneth W. Stuebing,                                                       BHSc, CCP(f),      President and Board Chair.                                   ____                                                National Association                                          of State Fire Marshals,                                                     March 31, 2022.      Hon. Ritchie Torres,      Hon. Haley Stevens,      Hon. Peter Meijer,      Hon. Anthony Gonzalez,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Torres, Stevens, Meijer, & Gonzalez:       The National Association of State Fire Marshals (NASFM)       thanks you for your leadership introducing legislation to       authorize the United States Fire Administration (USFA) to       conduct on-site investigations of major fires and fires with       unusual or remarkable context. NASFM strongly endorses H.R.       7077, the Empowering the U.S. Fire Administration Act.        NASFM membership comprises the most senior state fire       officials in the United States. Our primary mission is to       protect human life, property and the environment from fire       and related hazards. As such, we are extremely supportive of       your legislation to empower the USFA to help establish a       broader analysis of major fires and provide recommendations       for enhanced risk reduction and fire prevention efforts.        This bipartisan legislation will increase fire       investigation collaboration at the federal, state, and local       levels by allowing the USFA to send safety specialists, fire       protection engineers, codes and standards experts,       researchers, and fire training specialists to the sites of       major fires throughout the country. The bill also requires       the USFA to issue a report in coordination with appropriate       federal, state, and local authorities to determine the cause       and origin of the fire with recommendations to implement, and       enforcement of national safety codes and standards, to       prevent similar fires in the future.        ``The National Association of State Fire Marshals       enthusiastically supports H.R. 7077, the Empowering the U.S.       Fire Administration Act.'' said NASFM Executive Director Jim       Narva, ``By ensuring the inclusion of a more diverse risk       reduction focus, the investigations authorized under this Act       will help identify underlying issues and recommend actions to       help prevent future tragedies, saving countless lives.''        Thank you again for your leadership, we look forward to       working with you to enact this important fire risk reduction       and prevention legislation into law.            Sincerely,                                                         Jim Narva,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                        International Association of                                                    Fire Fighters                                      Washington, DC, April 1, 2022.      Hon. Ritchie Torres,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Torres: On behalf of the more than       327,000 professional fire fighters and emergency medical       services (EMS) personnel of the International Association of       Fire Fighters (IAFF), thank you for introducing the       Empowering the U.S. Fire Administration Act (H.R. 7077). The       IAFF appreciates your work to enable the U.S. Fire       Administrator to investigate fires and identify essential       lessons learned that can save lives in the future.        Fires continue to be a significant threat across the       nation. This past January alone, three fires led to the       deaths of 3 fire fighters and 29 members of the public. When       these major fires occur, there are always lessons that can       prevent future deaths. Sadly, the U.S. Fire Administration       (USFA) lacks the formal authority to investigate fires and       translate lessons learned into ways to enhance fire fighters'       training and public education efforts. The IAFF is pleased to       support your legislation as it empowers the USFA to identify       important findings from each fire.        The IAFF also appreciates that H.R. 7077 places a high       value on communicating the findings of fire investigations to       the public. Far too often, findings from fire investigations       are only partially released or done so in a manner that does       not allow findings to be used for future educational       purposes. The USFA has a strong track record of educating the       fire service and developing valuable training. Authorizing       the USFA to conduct these investigations is a meaningful way       to ensure that these findings will be shared with the broader       fire service and fully incorporated into future training and       educational opportunities.        Thank you again for your leadership and work to support       fire fighters across the nation. Congress must make every       effort to support our fire fighters' safety and enable them       to succeed in serving their communities. H.R. 7077 provides       an important new  [[Page H4736]]       tool by empowering the USFA to serve the American fire       service in a new capacity. The IAFF looks forward to working       with you to secure the passage of H.R. 7077 as quickly as       possible.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward A. Kelly,                                                 General President.
