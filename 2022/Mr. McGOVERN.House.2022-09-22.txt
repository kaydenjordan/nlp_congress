 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 1377 and ask for its immediate  consideration.

Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1377, providing for consideration of  four measures: H.R. 4118, H.R. 6448; H.R. 5768, and H.R. 8542, all  under closed rules.   For H.R. 4118 and H.R. 6448, the rule provides 30 minutes of general  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on the Judiciary for each bill and motions to  recommit for each measure.   For H.R. 5768, the rule provides 30 minutes of general debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on the Judiciary, self-executes a manager's amendment from  Chairman Nadler, and provides a motion to recommit.   For H.R. 8542, the bill provides 30 minutes of general debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce and a motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, Democrats in this Congress have been focused on  building safer communities since day one. We believe that every child  in America deserves the safety and security of growing up in a  community free from violence, trusting that the people who keep them  safe will do that regardless of the color of their skin or the ZIP Code  that they live in. We believe that the need to fight crime and improve  safety in our communities should unite us, not divide us.   These are good bills that we are considering today that will make our  communities safer.   The Mental Health Justice Act creates a grant program for States and  local governments to train and dispatch mental health professionals to  respond to emergencies that involve people with behavioral needs.   The VICTIM Act establishes a grant program to hire, train, and retain  detectives and victim services personnel to investigate shootings and  support victims.   The Break the Cycle of Violence Act provides grants to communities  for evidence-based community violence intervention and prevention  programs designed to interrupt cycles of violence.   The Invest to Protect Act creates a grant program to provide police  departments of fewer than 125 officers training resources for calls  involving people with substance use disorders, mental health needs, and  for people with disabilities.   I am glad that we are moving forward today. I am thankful to my  colleagues who have worked on these bills.   Do I want more?   Of course.   Will I keep fighting for us to do more?   Absolutely.   The truth is we still haven't made meaningful gains when it comes to  accountability. The House passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing  Act. Sadly, the Senate is yet to act on that bill.   But I don't want the perfect to be the enemy of the good, and if you  don't like what is in one of these bills or all of them, then you can  vote against them. But I strongly urge everybody on both sides of the  aisle to vote ``yes'' on the rule so we can at least move this forward  and have the opportunity to debate these measures.   I am confident that many of the provisions of these four bills will  help save lives. But this conversation can't end here. We need to keep  making our communities safer in new, innovative, and imaginative ways.  We can start by passing this rule and passing the underlying  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I have great respect for my colleague from Minnesota  and appreciate serving with her on the Rules Committee, but I think the  only talk about politics here is from the gentlewoman from Minnesota.   She talks about defunding the police. The bills that are before us  are grant programs. So I am not sure what she is talking about. If you  want to talk about politics, fine, let's talk about voting records.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Washington Post article  titled ``21 House Republicans vote against awarding Congressional Gold  Medal to all police officers who responded on January 6.''                 [From the Washington Post, June 15, 2022]  21 House Republicans Vote Against Awarding Congressional Gold Medal to                All Police Officers Who Responded on Jan. 6                            (By Felicia Sonmez)         Twenty-one House Republicans on Tuesday voted against       awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to all police officers       who responded to the Jan. 6 violent attack on the Capitol by       a pro-Trump mob.        The measure passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan       support from 406 lawmakers. But the 21 Republicans who voted       ``no'' drew immediate condemnation from some of their       colleagues, and the vote underscored the lingering tensions       in Congress amid efforts by some GOP lawmakers to whitewash       the events of that day.        Rep. Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott (D-Va.) called the ``no''       votes ``a sad commentary on the @HouseGOP,'' while Rep. Adam       Kinzinger (R-Ill.) declared, ``How you can vote no to this is       beyond me.''        ``Then again, denying an insurrection is as well,''       Kinzinger, a vocal critic of former president Donald Trump,       said in a tweet. ``To the brave Capitol (and DC metro PD)       thank you. To the 21: they will continue to defend your right       to vote no anyway.''        In an interview on CNN Tuesday night, Rep. Gerald E.       Connolly (D-Va.) called the 21 ``no'' votes ``a new low for       this crowd.''        ``They voted to overturn an election. But in their vote       today, they kind of sealed the deal of basically affiliating       with the mob,'' Connolly said. ``They now are part of the       insurrectionist mob. They brought enormous disrepute and       dishonor on themselves in not honoring the brave men and       women who defended the Capitol of the United States--      everybody in it, but also defending the symbol of democracy       in the world, not just here in the United States.''        In March, when an initial version of the legislation was       brought to the House floor, a dozen Republicans voted against       the measure. Many of those who voted ``no'' said they       objected to the use of the term ``insurrectionists'' in the       resolution.        Those GOP lawmakers included Reps. Andy Biggs (Ariz.),       Thomas Massie (Ky.), Andy Harris (Md.), Lance Gooden (Tex.),       Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Louie       Gohmert (Tex.), Michael Cloud (Tex.), Andrew S. Clyde (Ga.),       Greg Steube (Fla.), Bob Good (Va.) and John Rose (Tenn.).        The House and Senate then remained in a standoff for three       months over whether to honor all law enforcement who       responded on Jan. 6 or to award the Congressional Gold Medal       to one officer in particular, Capitol Police Officer Eugene       Goodman, who single-handedly diverted an angry mob away from       the Senate chamber.        The Senate had already unanimously voted to give the Gold       Medal exclusively to Goodman. The medal, bestowed by       Congress, is a symbol of national appreciation for       distinguished achievements.        Ultimately, both chambers agreed to slightly modify the       House legislation. Four Gold Medals will be awarded: one for       the Capitol Police, one for the D.C. police, another for the       Smithsonian Institution and another to be displayed inside       the Capitol building along with a plaque that names all law       enforcement agencies who helped repel the rioters that day.        On Tuesday, Gooden, one of the 12 House Republicans who       voted against the legislation in March, voted in favor of the       new bill.        But the number of opposing votes grew, with 10 other House       Republicans switching their votes from ``yes'' to ``no.''        Those Republicans are Reps. Lauren Boebert (Colo.), Barry       Moore (Ala.), Ralph Norman (S.C.), Matthew M. Rosendale       (Mont.), Chip Roy (Tex.), Paul A. Gosar (Ariz.), Warren       Davidson (Ohio), Scott Perry (Pa.), Jody Hice (Ga.) and Mary       Miller (Ill.).        Some of those who voted ``no'' on Tuesday said they       objected to the use of the words ``temple'' or       ``insurrection'' in the resolution.        ``I wouldn't call it an insurrection,'' Greene said,       according to Politico.        Some House Republicans, such as Clyde, have sought to       recast the violent mob's actions on Jan. 6 as little       different from a ``normal tourist visit'' to the Capitol.       Others have sought to play down that day's events in       different ways.        During the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, rioters       attempted to break into the House chamber, punching and       busting glass, resulting in the death of Ashli Babbitt, whom       police shot when she attempted to climb through a shattered       glass door.        Gosar has previously claimed that Babbitt had been       ``executed''--even though she defied police warnings and the       officer who fatally shot her was cleared of any criminal       wrongdoing.        Gosar did so again Tuesday, claiming during a House hearing       that a Capitol Police officer was ``lying in wait'' for       Babbitt and that she was ``executed,'' Politico reported.        Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who was ousted from House       Republican leadership over her criticism of Trump's role in       the Jan. 6 insurrection, denounced Gosar's remarks Tuesday       evening.     Madam Speaker, you heard that right: 21 of our  colleagues across the aisle opposed a simple bill honoring the heroes  of January 6; officers who now bear physical and psychological scars  from that day because they fought to protect us in the Capitol. It is  disgraceful. Yet, nothing about that from the other side of the aisle  in terms of just how disgraceful that was.   You can talk politics, but if you want to talk about the substance of  these bills, then do so and acknowledge what they are. They are bills  that will help make our community safer. They are bills that, quite  frankly--I should also point out that I think all but one of the bills  is the same as they were in July.   I am not quite sure what the fuss over the fact that we are bringing  these things up right now is all about. They are good bills that will  help make our community safer. Look, I trust that we pass the rule.  Some thoughtful Republicans will vote in favor of some of them or all  of them.   If you don't believe that this is an appropriate thing to do, then  you can vote ``no.'' That is your right, and you can go home and  explain it to your constituents.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, just for the record, because I think it is important  to have an accurate record, the text of three of these bills has been  available for over a month. Even the manager's amendment on the VICTIM  Act of 2022, which the distinguished gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Demings) has introduced has been available for almost a month.   Again, the only one talking about politics is the gentlewoman from  Minnesota, but I guess that is all they have.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters in support of the  VICTIM Act of 2022 from the National Association of Police  Organizations, from the National Fraternal Order of Police, from the  International Association of Chiefs of Police, from the National Police  Foundation, all in support of the VICTIM Act.                                             National Association of                                      Police Organizations, Inc.,                                      Alexandria, VA, June 14, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chair, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Jordan: On behalf       of the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO),       representing over 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers       across the United States, I am writing to advise you of our       support for the Violent Incident Clearance and Technological       Investigative Methods (VICTIM) Act, H.R. 5768, and thank the       Committee for considering this legislation.        Our nation's cities and communities are experiencing a       historic rise in violent crime. Murders and non-fatal       shootings are going unresolved at higher rates as law       enforcement agencies do not have the officers and resources       to dedicate to improving clearance rates for these horrendous       crimes. The VICTIM Act will help address this issue by       supplying much needed grant funding to agencies to fill,       replenish, train, and support their detective and homicide       personnel. Through this legislation, law enforcement will be       able to focus on solving these violent crimes that have such       a detrimental impact on our communities and improve the       services that they render to victims.        We urge the Committee to join us in support of the VICTIM       Act and we look forward to working with you to ensure law       enforcement agencies have the support and resources necessary       to serve and protect our communities.            Sincerely,                                          William J. Johnson, Esq.,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                  National Fraternal                                                 Order of Police,                                        Washington DC, 13 June 2022.      Hon. Jerrold L. Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. James D. Jordan,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington DC.        Dear Representatives Nadler and Jordan: I am writing on       behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to       advise you of our support for H.R. 5768, the ``Violent       Incident Clearance and Technological Investigative Methods       (VICTIM) Act'' and H.R. 6528, the ``Active Shooter Alert       Act'' and to urge the Committee to favorably report these       bills.        In 2020, the United States saw the largest rise in       homicides since the start of national record-keeping in 1960.       Approximately 21,570 people were murdered in the United       States in 2020--the most since 1995--and a 29.4 percent       increase over 2019. Additionally, the FBI estimates that 77       percent of all murders in the United States in 2020 were via       firearms, up from 73 percent in 2019. At the same time that       the murder rate rose, the clearance rate for murders fell       significantly, from 61.4 percent in 2019 to 54.4 percent in       2020. In cities with a population above 250,000, the rate was       even more dramatic, falling from 57.6 percent in 2019 to 47.3       percent in 2020.        Homicide cases can be very difficult to clear--especially       those committed via a firearm--and non-fatal shootings even       more so. Closing these types of crimes requires diligence,       manpower, and a sustained investigative effort. Given the       limited resources of law enforcement agencies, it's important       to provide the significant, dedicated resources that clearing       these crimes requires, especially given their oftentimes       heinous nature.        The VICTIM Act would establish a grant program administered       by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to help State,       Tribal, and local law enforcement agencies improve their       clearance rates for homicides and non-fatal shootings.       Agencies can use these grant funds to train or hire       additional detectives, investigators, or other police       personnel that can investigate, solve, and respond to       homicides and non-fatal shootings. The grants can also be       used to improve training for agency personnel to address the       needs of victims and family members of homicides and non-      fatal shootings.        These important resources would improve law enforcement       agencies' abilities to close homicide cases, which would       punish the perpetrators of these crimes, provide justice for       the victims and their families, and grant peace of mind for       communities and the dedicated law enforcement officers that       serve them.        Active shooter events, however, are not like normal       firearms homicides cases. Rather than focusing on       investigative methods after the fact, these kinds of events       place a premium on the abilities of law enforcement to       quickly react to a fluid and oftentimes unclear situation.       Responding to an active shooter event is chaotic and can be       fraught with peril, especially when the incident is not       confined to one location. Law enforcement officers must       prioritize preserving lives and ending the threat.       Simultaneously, they need a way to notify the public about       the incident, whether that is to avoid a certain area,       shelter in place, or announce when the area is once again       safe. The ``Active Shooter Alert Act'' is designed to improve       the ways officers and agencies communicate with the public       about active threats.        The bill would establish a national coordinator within the       U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to set up and administer an       Active Shooter Alert Communications Network. The Active       Shooter Alert Coordinator, in coordination with other Federal       components like the Federal Emergency Management Agency       (FEMA), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), and the       Federal Communications Commission (FCC), would develop best       practices and training on the use of a secure communications       system during an active shooter event. We believe as you all       do--having a network for informing the public during these       critical incidents will save lives.        On behalf of the more than 364,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I am proud to offer our support for these       pieces of legislation.            Sincerely,                                                      Patrick Yoes,      National President.                                   ____                                        International Association of                                                Chiefs of Police,                                      Alexandria, VA, June 14, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chair, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Nadler and Ranking Member Jordan: On behalf of       the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), I       am writing to express our strong support for H.R. 5768, the       Violent Incident Clearance and Technological Investigative       Methods Act of 2021'' (VICTIM Act). By providing dedicated       resources to law enforcement agencies to enhance their       abilities to successfully investigate violent criminal acts,       the VICTIM Act will bring justice to victims, remove violent       offenders from our communities and bring closure to families.        Specifically, the VICTIM Act would, through a newly       established a Department of Justice grant program, provide       state, tribal and local law enforcement agencies with much       needed resources to assist them in enhancing their       investigatory capabilities. This includes allowing agencies       to:        hire and retain detectives to investigate homicide and non-      fatal shootings;        acquire resources for processing evidence, including the       hiring of additional personnel;        hire personnel trained to analyze criminal intelligence and       crime trends;        ensure victim services are sufficiently staffed, funded,       and trained.        The IACP urges the Judiciary Committee and the members of       the United States House of Representative to support and       approve H.R. 5768.            Sincerely,                                         Chief Dwight E. Henninger,      IACP President.                                   ____                                      National Police Foundation,                                                  February 18, 2022.      Hon. Val Demings,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Demings: I write on behalf of the National Police       Foundation to enthusiastically support H.R. 5768, the VICTIM       Act. The National Police Foundation is an independent and       nonpartisan organization dedicated to advancing policing       through innovation and science.        Many communities across America are dealing with increases       in crime or concerns over their continued safety. In many       places, violent crime and shootings have increased       exponentially.        The grants authorized in the VICTIM Act will help law       enforcement agencies overcome some of the challenges       associated with responding to the current increase in violent       crime. More specifically, this bill will provide law       enforcement with critical resources  [[Page H8073]]       to address staffing challenges, enhance their forensics       capabilities, further deploy investigative technologies, and       provide services to victims of violent crime and their       families.        Thank you for your continued leadership and support for       America's law enforcement officers and all the people they       serve. We look forward to seeing this bill become law and the       resources getting into the hands of law enforcement where       they are so critically needed. We commend you and the other       sponsors for your commitment to funding the police and giving       them the tools they need to protect and serve.            Sincerely,                                                         Jim Burch,                                                         President.     Madam Speaker, I would respectfully suggest to my  colleague that they are supporting this legislation not because of  politics, they are supporting it because they think it is actually good  for our communities and will make our communities safer.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Forbes article titled  ``Trump Loyalists' Calls To Defund the FBI, and Other Hypocrisies.''                        [From Forbes, Aug. 12, 2022]      Trump Loyalists' Calls To Defund the FBI, and Other Hypocrisies                             (By Shaun Harper)         Federal Bureau of Investigation agents executed a warrant       to search former U.S. President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago       estate in Palm Beach, Florida this week. They were reportedly       looking for classified documents that weren't supposed to       leave the White House during the presidential transition.       Materials for which the FBI was looking apparently have       national security implications. In a press conference       yesterday, Attorney General Merrick Garland said he       ``personally approved'' the search of Trump's home.        Shockingly and ironically, many Trump loyalists are calling       for the FBI to be defunded.        Following the police-executed murders of George Floyd and       Breonna Taylor in 2020, Black Lives Matter activists and       other Americans called for a defunding of police departments       across the country. Trump, most of his supporters, and       several others fiercely rejected this proposal. They praised       law enforcement officers and advanced what became known as       the ``Blue Lives Matter'' campaign. There was occasional       acknowledgment that a small number of bad apples sometimes       engage in bad behaviors. But systemic racism in policing?       Absolutely not. Opponents of the defund the police movement       loudly applauded the bravery, sacrifice, and integrity of law       enforcement officers.        Trump supporters who opposed defunding the police two years       ago are now calling for the FBI, a law enforcement agency, to       be defunded. Among them is Florida Republican congressional       candidate Anthony Sabatini, who in a CNN interview deemed the       FBI ``totally useless.'' He also wants FBI agents to be       arrested.        Garland, our nation's top cop, ``needs to be       assassinated,'' one person who may (or may not) be a Trump       supporter tweeted. This is just one of many social media       posts this week calling for violence against the Attorney       General and the FBI. Ricky Shiffer, an armed man who       allegedly fired into an FBI office building with a nail gun       and was armed with an AR-15-style rifle, was killed following       a car chase and standoff with law enforcement officers in       Cincinnati yesterday. Shiffer was allegedly part of pro-Trump       extremist groups that attacked the U.S. Capitol last year.        The hypocrisy over opposing defunding the police in 2020,       but calling for the FBI to be defunded now, is clear--though       not at all atypical. Trump loyalists have done versions of       this before.        ``Lock her up,'' they chanted, as 2016 Democratic       Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was accused of storing       classified information on private, unencrypted email servers       in her home. Paradoxically, a version of this is why FBI       agents searched Trump's Florida estate this week.        The same group that reached determinations of Clinton's       guilt before, during, and after the investigation of her       swiftly determined that the FBI is wrong about Trump and       should therefore be defunded.        Another example are the ``My Body, My Choice'' posters that       many Trump supporters carried during rallies held throughout       the pandemic to oppose masking and vaccine mandates. That       phrase had been long used in pro-choice demonstrations. Most       Trump supporters aren't pro-choice, right?        The opposition of President Barack Obama nominating Merrick       Garland for the Supreme Court seat that became vacant eight       months prior to the 2016 election is a third example of       hypocrisy. Trump supporters and other GOP members       successfully argued that an outgoing president shouldn't have       the authority to nominate a new justice to the Court with so       little time remaining in his tenure. Yet, many of those same       politicians and other conservatives were fully on board with       Trump nominating Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court just       38 days before the 2020 presidential election.        And then there is the racialized double standard that       played out in the January 6 Capitol Insurrection. On June 1,       2020, a group of mostly peaceful demonstrators gathered near       the White House to protest George Floyd's murder. They killed       no one and did no damage to the White House or any other       federal building. But Trump still called in the National       Guard to aggressively remove them from the streets. His       supporters defended the president's decision. Just six months       later, hundreds of angry Trump loyalists, most of them white,       violently attacked the U.S. Capitol. Their actions resulted       in five deaths and the injuries of 140 law enforcement       officers.        The inescapably obvious role that race played in the       January 6 insurrection hasn't been talked about much, if at       all, in the recent congressional hearings. Had Black       Americans attacked the Capitol, I am certain that Trump       supporters, as well as other conservatives and liberals       alike, would have reached near-unanimous agreement on what       happened that day and the necessary legal repercussions. I       also remain convinced that most Black protestors would have       been immediately killed had they scaled and otherwise       violently entered any federal building, let alone the one in       which Vice President Mike Pence and congresspersons were       meeting at the time. Trump and his loyalists surely would've       argued those Black insurrectionists deserved whatever law       enforcement officers did to them that day, hence the       hypocrisy.    Madam Speaker, I remind my Republican colleagues that  just last month a number of them openly and unabashedly messaged around  defunding and dismantling the FBI. Some even sold campaign merchandise  with that tagline. Let that sink in, I would say to my colleagues.   In any event, pass the rule. Let's have the debate on these bills. If  you want to promote safer communities, then you will support them. If  you want to just do politics as usual, then you will follow the lead of  my colleague from Minnesota and vote against them.   Madam Speaker, these are good bills, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, first of all, I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota  for conceding that the text of three of the bills was available for a  month. I am glad we could set the record straight on that.   The second thing I will say is that at least two of these bills have  bipartisan cosponsorship. The VICTIM Act has four Republican  cosponsors. The Invest to Protect Act has 24 Republican cosponsors.  Maybe they didn't get the memo that they are supposed to put politics  ahead of people, but the bottom line is they are cosponsors of this. I  would expect, unless their arms are twisted, that they will vote for  the bills on final passage.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 101 human  rights, civil rights, racial justice, religiously affiliated, and gun  safety organizations who wrote in support of Congressman Horsford's  bill, H.R. 4118, the Break the Cycle of Violence Act. I think that is  worth noting.                                                     July 30, 2021.        We the undersigned 101 human rights, civil rights, racial       justice, religiously affiliated and gun safety organizations       write in support of the Break the Cycle of Violence Act (S.       2275/H.R. 4118). We urge you to swiftly pass the Break the       Cycle of Violence Act to provide at least $5 billion in       federal funding over eight years for community gun violence       prevention programs.        Gun violence in the U.S. is a crisis, disproportionately       impacting Black and Brown communities nationwide. Gun       homicides are the leading cause of death among Black men ages       15-34 and the second-leading cause of death for Latino men       and boys of the same age range. Black men are more than ten       times as likely to be the victims of gun homicides than white       men. In 2019, 14,414 people died from gun homicides in the       U.S. Nearly 60 percent--8,607--of gun homicide deaths were       Black people. Yet Black people represent just 14.7 percent of       the U.S. population.        With a surge in gun sales in the wake of COVID-19,       shootings are increasing across the U.S., contributing to the       crisis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, there were 39,707 deaths in 2019, the most recent       year for which government data is available with 14,414 of       those being gun homicides. The Gun Violence Archive, a non-      profit organization that tracks and documents gun injuries       and deaths, published data in May 2021 indicating that the       number of deaths in 2020 had risen to a staggering 43,554       with 19,398 of those being gun homicides.        Evidence-based, community violence prevention programs have       been proven to reduce gun violence and save lives, while       investing resources in impacted communities. There are three       well-established models of gun violence prevention programs       that have proven successful in reducing violence, some of       which are referenced in both President Biden's executive       actions and guidance and in the Break the Cycle of Violence       Act. The Group Violence Intervention (``GVI'') strategy, a       form of problem-oriented policing (as opposed to traditional       ``incident-driven'' policing), was first used in the       enormously successful Operation Ceasefire in Boston in the       mid-1990s where it was associated with a 61 percent reduction       in youth homicide. The program has now been implemented in a       wide variety of cities with consistently impressive results.       An analysis of more than 20 GVI programs showed a significant       reduction in firearm violence. The most successful of these       programs have reduced violent crime in cities by an average       of 30 percent and improved relations between law enforcement       officers and the neighborhoods they serve. The GVI model has       a remarkably strong track record: a documented association       with homicide reductions of 30 to 60 percent.        A study of the Cure Violence model, first implemented in       Chicago, found that its implementation in several targeted       districts in Chicago was associated with a 38 percent greater       decrease in homicides and a 15 percent greater decrease in       shootings, compared to districts that did not receive the       intervention. A 2018 evaluation of Philadelphia's Cure       Violence Program found that shootings decreased       significantly, compared to other matched comparison areas.        An example of Hospital Based Violence Intervention, the       third model of evidence-based violence prevention programs,       is the San Francisco Wraparound Project, first introduced in       2005. In its first six years of operation the Wraparound       Project was associated with a fourfold decrease in injury       recidivism (re-injury from gun-shot wounds) rates. Moreover,       studies have shown that this form of intervention saves       hospitals money by preventing future injuries, both for the       patient and for anyone the patient may have considered       retaliating against.        Investment, training, and support for culturally       appropriate violence prevention workers with lived experience       in impacted communities has proven successful in cities       across the U.S., yet lack of political will has resulted in       many advocates and community leaders working with limited or       no resources.        For example, Lamar Johnson of B.R.A.V.E. Chicago, said:       ``Our after-school program is a non-profit- we run it through       the church--and the funding comes mostly from private donors.       The majority of the city's budget goes to law enforcement--      and that's not just Chicago, that's most cities. We've met       with mayors' administrations so many times and presented our       case, but they don't give us funding. The whole system is so       broken, because the focus is on the criminal justice system.       If someone is addicted to drugs, they go to jail before they       go to the hospital to get treatment. It's the mindset.''        Recognizing the effectiveness of these programs and the       heroic people like Lamar who lead them, President Biden, on       March 31, 2021, announced his intention to include $5 billion       for gun violence prevention programs in the American Jobs       Plan. This builds on the efforts of Senator Booker and       Representative Horsford to pass the Break the Cycle of       Violence Act, first introduced in the 116th Congress. If       passed, it would provide funding for federal grants to       communities that experience 20 or more homicides per year and       have a homicide rate at least twice the national average, or       communities that demonstrate a unique and compelling need for       additional resources to address gun and group-related       violence. Each grant awarded would be renewable over five       years, and funds would be commensurate with the scope of the       proposal and the demonstrated need.        While it is impossible to place a dollar amount on a       person's life or the cost of that loss to their families,       communities, and loved ones, the astronomical financial       impact of gun violence on U.S. society cannot be overlooked.       According to a 2020 study by physicians and researchers, gun       violence costs the U.S. healthcare system $170 billion per       year. The Health Alliance for Violence Intervention estimates       it would cost an estimated $827 million per year, or $5.36       billion over eight years, to fund sustained and adequate       violence intervention programs in the 48 U.S. cities with the       highest rates of violence--hence the call on Congress to pass       at least $5 billion over eight years for community gun       violence prevention programs.        With sustained investment into gun violence prevention       programs and a national comprehensive strategy aimed at       reducing gun violence, particularly in Black and Brown       communities, Congress can make inroads to reducing gun       violence in all communities and ensure the right of everyone       to live free from the threat of gun violence. Congress has an       obligation to take action to invest in communities ravaged by       gun violence and to make efforts to prevent gun violence and       protect the lives and safety of all individuals, particularly       in the face of evidence that the 2020 gun-related injury and       death tolls in the U.S. have been the highest in decades.        We urge Congress to act urgently to pass the Break the       Cycle of Violence Act to ensure at least $5 billion in       federal funding over eight years for community gun violence       prevention programs that save lives.

Madam Speaker, again I inserted earlier an article  talking about the Republicans that would not even honor the men and  women of the Capitol Police who defended us on January 6. I continue to  believe that that was a disgraceful moment.   But when the gentlewoman says that somehow they will always stand on  behalf and honor members of law enforcement--let me just read a few  quotations here. Representative Jeff Duncan from South Carolina:   ``The FBI has proven time and again that it is corrupt to the core.  At what point do we abolish the Bureau and start over?''   Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona says:   ``I will support a complete dismantling and elimination of the  Democrat brownshirts known as the FBI. This is too much for our  Republic to withstand.''   Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado:   ``The GOP majority must defund all forms of tyranny throughout  Biden's government. @FBI.''   Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia:   ``Impeach Merrick Garland and defund the corrupt FBI. End political  persecution and hold those accountable that abuse their positions of  power to persecute their political enemies, while ruining our country.  This shouldn't happen in America. Republicans must force it to stop.''                                time  0930    On Marjorie Taylor Greene's website, she is selling defund the FBI T- shirts, so it is my friends on the other side of the aisle who want to  defund law enforcement, who want to defund the police.   There is an old saying: Physician, heal thyself. You ought to take  that to heart. The bottom line here is that these are bills that will  help improve safety in our communities. These are bills that local  officials, local law enforcement organizations, want. The only people  who don't want them are my friends on the other side of the aisle.   If you want to vote no, vote no. But I suspect that some on the  minority side understand what their communities want, and they don't  want politics as usual. They don't want people putting politics over  people. What they want is help for their communities.   You have a chance. You can either vote yes to help the communities or  vote no. That is your choice.   Madam Speaker, I think these bills are good bills. We should support  the rule. We should support the underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, my colleague from Minnesota said, if I am quoting it  right, ``They expect us to believe they support our law enforcement.''  I will be honest with you. I don't expect my colleagues to believe  anything, but I expect them to read the bills and to decide whether or  not, if you pass these bills, they will help make our communities safer  or not.   The gentleman from Florida didn't like three of the bills, but he  likes one of the bills. The beauty of this rule is you will be able to  vote on all of them, and you can vote no on the ones you don't like,  and you can vote yes on the ones that you do like.   When we talk about how law enforcement has been under attack, I don't  want to hear any lectures from my friends on the other side of the  aisle. I went through a whole litany of Republican Members who were  calling for defunding the FBI.   My friends have a Member on the Republican side who actually is  selling defund the FBI T-shirts on her web page. It says, ``Defund the  FBI.'' It is defund the police. My colleagues don't seem to care much  about that.   I will go back to something else that I still can't get out of my  mind, and that was the vote on awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to  the United States Capitol Police officers who saved the lives of  everybody who was here that day, and 21 Republican Members voted no.  That is a disgrace. That has brought shame on this institution.   So, don't lecture any of us about our support for law enforcement  when 21 of the Members on the other side of the aisle voted no on a  Congressional Gold Medal to honor the brave men and women who protected  us in this Chamber on that day. Enough.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The Guardian  titled ``'Republicans are defunding the police: FOX News anchor stumps  Congressman.''                     [From the Guardian, June 28, 2021]       Republicans Are Defunding the Police--Fox News Anchor Stumps                                Congressman                            (By Martin Pengelly)         The Fox News anchor Chris Wallace made headlines of his own       on Sunday, by pointing out to a senior Republican that he and       the rest of his party recently voted against $350bn in       funding for law enforcement.        ``Can't you make the argument that it's you and the       Republicans who are defunding the police?'' Wallace asked Jim       Banks, the head of the House Republican study committee.  [[Page H8078]]         The congressman was the author of a Fox News column in       which he said Democrats were responsible for spikes in       violent crime.        ``There is overwhelming evidence,'' Banks wrote,       ``connecting the rise in murders to the violent riots last       summer''--a reference to protests over the murder of George       Floyd which sometimes produced looting and violence--``and       the defund the police movement. Both of which were supported,       financially and rhetorically, by the Democratic party and the       Biden administration.''        Joe Biden does not support any attempt to ``defund the       police'', a slogan adopted by some on the left but which       remains controversial and which the president has said       Republicans have used to ``beat the living hell'' out of       Democrats.        On Fox News Sunday, Banks repeatedly attacked the so-called       ``Squad'' of young progressive women in the House and said       Democrats ``stigmatised'' law enforcement and helped       criminals.        ``Let me push back on that a little bit,'' Wallace said.       ``Because [this week] the president said that the central       part in his anti-crime package is the $350bn in the American       Rescue Plan, the Covid relief plan that was passed.''        Covid relief passed through Congress in March, under rules       that meant it did not require Republican votes. It did not       get a single one.        Asked if that meant it was ``you and the Republicans who       are defunding the police'', Banks dodged the question.        Wallace said: ``No, no, sir, respectfully--wait, sir,       respectfully ... I'm asking you, there's $350bn in this       package the president says can be used for policing . . .        ``Congressman Banks, let me finish, and I promise I will       give you a chance to answer. The president is saying cities       and states can use this money to hire more police officers,       invest in new technologies and develop summer job training       and recreation programs for young people. Respectfully, I've       heard your point about the last year, but you and every other       Republican voted against this $350bn.''        Turning a blind eye to Wallace's question, Banks said: ``If       we turn a blind eye to law and order, and a blind eye to       riots that occurred in cities last summer, and we take police       officers off the street, we're inevitably going to see crime       rise.''        Wallace asked if Banks could support any gun control       legislation. Banks said that if Biden was ``serious about       reducing violent crime in America'', he should ``admonish the       radical voices in the Democrat [sic] party that have       stigmatised police officers and law enforcement''.        Despite working for Republicans' favoured broadcaster,       Wallace is happy to hold their feet to the fire, as grillings       of Donald Trump and Kevin McCarthy have shown.        He has also attracted criticism, for example for failing to       control Trump during a chaotic presidential debate last year       which one network rival called ``a hot mess, inside a       dumpster fire, inside a train wreck''.        Last year, Wallace told the Guardian: ``I do what I do and       I'm sitting there during the week trying to come up with the       best guests and the best show I possibly can and I'm not       sitting there thinking about how do we fit in some media       commentary.        ``We're not there to try to one-up the president or any       politician.''     Madam Speaker, if you look at the voting record of many  of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you will see few to  none supported recent funding bills that also direct money toward  supporting local law enforcement. If they think that we are on a  crusade to defund the police, well, the last few years of funding the  police say otherwise.   Madam Speaker, I also include in the Record a Rolling Stone article  titled `` `Back-The-Blue' Republicans Bail on Moment of Silence for  Fallen Capitol Police Officers.''                     [From Rolling Stone, Jan. 6, 2022]     `Back-The-Blue' Republicans Bail on Moment of Silence for Fallen                          Capitol Police Officers                             (By Tim Dickinson)         The Republican Party holds itself as the champions of law       enforcement. They campaign on slogans of ``Back the Blue.''       They hold rallies flying the ``Thin Blue Line'' flag. They       purport to celebrate the cops who shield the nation from       violence and anarchy.        But when it came time to show up in the halls of Congress       for a remembrance of the sacrifices Capitol and Metropolitan       Police made defending our democracy from violence last Jan.       6, Republicans lawmakers didn't bother to show up. Only one       sitting Republican officeholder showed up, Wyoming Rep. Liz       Cheney. She was accompanied by her father Dick, the former       vice president.        On that dark day one year ago, the ``Thin Blue Line'' was       not a metaphor. Police put their bodies and lives in harm's       way, attempting to blockade the joint session of Congress       from the violent mob of Trump supporters who sought to stop       the peaceful transfer of power after a lawful election. These       cops were beaten, tased, tear gassed, dragged down steps, and       crushed in doorways. More than 140 were injured in the       insurrection, and five officer deaths (including subsequent       suicides) have been linked to the violence and trauma of Jan.       6.        ``I want to acknowledge our fallen heroes of that day,''       said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, leading a House session marking       the anniversary of the attack. ``Now I ask all members to       rise in a moment of silence in their memory.''        As the officials rose, the visual of a nearly empty GOP       side of the aisle was chilling, as Sen. Chris Murphy of       Connecticut noted on Twitter:         At the moment of silence for the Capitol Police officers       who died, there were only two Republicans who showed up.        Rep. Lynn Cheney. And her father. The 80 year old former       Vice President.        An extraordinary image of where this country's politics are       right now.       --Chris Murphy January 6, 2022         Speaking to reporters at the Capitol, the former vice       president said he attended the House session to mark ``an       important historical event.'' Cheney elaborated that he was       ``deeply disappointed we don't have better leadership in the       Republican Party to restore the Constitution.'' The swipe at       Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and House minority       leader Kevin McCarthy--who could not be bothered to attend       the remembrance, and who have done little to combat Trump's       destructive and ongoing lies about the 2020 election--was       unmistakable.        Rep. Cheney's attendance was not surprising. She is the top       Republican on the bipartisan congressional committee       investigating the events of Jan. 6, and has been consistent       and unabashed in her criticism of Donald Trump, blaming him       directly for the violence at the Capitol. Cheney has been       treated as a pariah by Trump--who has called her a ``bitter,       horrible human being''--and was ousted from GOP House       leadership earlier this year for refusing to kowtow to the       Dear Leader.        Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the other Republican on the Jan. 6       committee, is expecting the birth of a child and could not       attend. ``Wish I could be there too, but I'm on baby watch,''       he tweeted. ``I am in spirit.''     Madam Speaker, I find it hard to believe that someone  says they back the police when they don't even do the bare minimum and  show up and remember those who fought to save the lives of our very  democracy and every single person in this Chamber that day.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank the gentlewoman for that closing statement. I keep hearing  the Democrats want to defund the police, so here we are on the House  floor talking about creating grant programs to help keep communities  safer. Now the Republicans are the ones who are talking about defunding  the police. Do you see the irony?   Democrats actually have solutions in these four bills; real ideas  that have been publicly available for months to make our streets safer  and reduce crime. Republicans are the ones talking about defunding and  abolishing the FBI.   I will remind my colleagues that you have Republican Members who are  raising campaign funds by selling Defund the FBI T-shirts. Want to talk  about disgusting?   No mention of that from my colleagues. Fundraising off of selling T- shirts to defund the police; that is what my friends are doing.   Again, I go back to my point earlier. I still can't get over that 21  Republicans couldn't even vote to give a Congressional Gold Medal to  the men and women who defended us on January 6. I mean, talk about  disgusting. Couldn't show up on the House floor for a moment of silence  to honor those police who lost their lives as a result of what happened  on January 6. Talk about disgusting.   We have ideas here that I think are worth bipartisan support. Some of  this stuff I think should have been brought up under suspension. But,  again, my friends put politics ahead of people. We want to put people  ahead of politics.   Take the VICTIM Act, H.R. 5768. This establishes a grant program in  the Department of Justice to help State, Tribal, and local law  enforcement agencies improve their clearance rates for homicides and  nonfatal shootings. To me, that seems common sense.   The Break the Cycle of Violence Act, H.R. 4118, creates a nationwide  strategy to make our communities safer by addressing both the symptoms  and root causes of violence.   The Invest to Protect Act, H.R. 6448, makes targeted investments to  ensure that local police departments have the training they need to  keep our communities safe.    The Mental Health Justice Act, H.R. 8542; one in four fatal police  encounters ends the life of an individual with severe mental illness.  The Mental Health Justice Act makes it easier to send trained mental  health professionals to respond to individuals experiencing a mental  health crisis.   To me, these are basic, commonsense bills that I think the  overwhelming majority of people in this country, Democrats,  Republicans, Independents, would all support.   You want to talk about not supporting our law enforcement.  Republicans voted against $350 billion in the American Rescue Plan that  could be used for policing. So please don't lecture us about defunding  the police. Republicans only seem to support law enforcement when they  are looking for votes. That is a common theme here, when it is  politically convenient for them. It is really shameful, and it is  cynical. It is why people get frustrated with Washington because  everything has a political motivation.   On stuff that we all should come together on, my friends on the other  side of the aisle always come up with an issue, an excuse not to do the  right thing. You don't have to agree on everything to agree on  something, and this is something we ought to agree on and we ought to  come together on and get it done.   These are good bills, Madam Speaker, bipartisan bills. I urge a  ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous question, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move the previous question on the  resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
