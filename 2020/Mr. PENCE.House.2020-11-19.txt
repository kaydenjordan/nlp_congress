 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of  the Coronavirus Task Force, appointed by President Trump and led by my  brother, Vice President Mike Pence.   Vice President Mike Pence has led doctors, scientists, manufacturers,  elected leaders, and others as they work hard to develop therapeutics  and deliver hope for the American people.   Under the leadership of Vice President Pence and medical experts,  Operation Warp Speed has been a historic success. We now have two  vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at 90 and 95 percent effectiveness.  Companies like Lilly have developed an effective antibody.   Our scientists are making history. To not recognize this achievement  is an insult to the tens of thousands of people who have been working  day and night to battle this pandemic.   COVID-19 has gripped our Nation and our world, but under the  leadership of President Trump and Vice President Pence, and the hard  work of those on the front lines, we are on the path to recovery.   God bless those who have dedicated so much of their time and energy  to helping their fellow man.                         Honoring K-9 Officer Diesel     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a fallen K-9 officer in  my hometown of Columbus, Indiana.   Bartholomew County's own K-9 officer Diesel died in the line of duty  this weekend while he was in pursuit of a dangerous criminal.   Diesel helped our Columbus officers find dangerous narcotics and  search for suspects who had fled from the police. This is important  work.   Our community has come together to express condolences for this hero  with flowers, notes, and even toys on the K-9 handler's car at the  sheriff's office.   Our law enforcement community is the thin blue line that protects our  friends and loved ones from danger, and we are forever grateful to the  heroes who sacrifice everything to ensure our safety.                      Thanking Indiana's Sixth District     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my appreciation to  the Hoosiers of Indiana's Sixth District. They have sent me to  Washington again to represent them in Congress. It is an honor to be  entrusted with this responsibility.   In my first term, my team and I focused on delivering quality  constituent services, and we will continue to work hard for you in the  next term.   The Sixth District of Indiana is my home and always will be, and it  is my honor to serve you in Congress and bring Hoosier values to this  Nation's capital.                     Congratulating Ryobi Die Casting USA     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ryobi Die  Casting USA of Shelbyville, Indiana, on being named the General Motors  Supplier of the Year.   The Supplier of the Year award is chosen by a global team of GM  purchasing, engineering, quality, manufacturing, and logistics  executives.   Hoosier manufacturing plays a major role in our local economy as well  as the global economy, and Hoosiers rely on the manufacturing industry  for good-paying jobs in my district.   Congratulations to Ryobi Die Casting USA for this tremendous  achievement, and keep up the good work.             Commemorating 125th Anniversary of NineStar Connect     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 125th  anniversary of NineStar Connect.   In 1895, Loren Helms of McCordsville, Indiana, established the very  first telephone in the community and created the company we know today  as NineStar Connect.   With headquarters in the Sixth District, NineStar provides rural  broadband to communities all over my Hoosier State.   It is my pleasure to recognize this Greenfield-based company for  their contributions to our community. Thank you to the great team at  NineStar, and congratulations on 125 years.

All four members of the team scored in the top 10 for individual  competitors, earning them the team State title, a big accomplishment.   Congratulations to Anna, Onika, Shalee, and Blake on all their hard  work and dedication to the agriculture community.
