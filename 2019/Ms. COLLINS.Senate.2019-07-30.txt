 Mr. President, I rise to highlight the bipartisan work  that is underway in the Senate to help Americans who struggle with the  high cost of prescription drugs. This problem particularly affects our  seniors, 90 percent of whom take at least one prescription drug. It is  critical that we continue to build on the momentum of this important  pocketbook issue that, I believe, bridges the partisan divide.   Since 2015, as the chairman of the Senate's Special Committee on  Aging, I have chaired eight hearings on drug pricing, and we have heard  so many heartbreaking stories from people who struggle to afford the  medication that they need.   I will never forget standing in line at the pharmacy counter in  Bangor, ME, where I live, when the couple ahead of me received a  prescription drug and the unwelcomed news that the couple's copay was  going to be $111. The husband turned to his wife and said: ``Honey, we  simply cannot afford this.'' They walked away and left that needed  prescription on the drug store counter. I told the pharmacist I didn't  mean to overhear but that I just happened to be the next in line. I  asked him how often this happens, and he gave me the terrible news that  it happens every single day.   At a hearing on the skyrocketing price of insulin, we heard  compelling testimony from Paul Grant, a father of four who lives in New  Gloucester, ME, who discovered one day, because the 90-day supply of  insulin for his 13-year-old  [[Page S5158]]  son with type 1 diabetes had tripled to more than $900, that he had to  resort to paying out-of-pocket for a much lower cost insulin from  Canada without his receiving any credit toward his insurance  deductible.   At our hearing on the cost of treating rheumatoid arthritis, Patty  Bernard, from Falmouth, ME, testified that her out-of-pocket costs  soared from $10 to $3,800 per month for Enbrel when she transitioned  from employer-sponsored insurance to Medicare. She simply could not  afford this expense and had to switch to a different drug that was not  self-administered. This switch required her to go to her doctor's  office once a month for a 2\1/2\-hour infusion, and it did not work  nearly as well for her.   At another hearing, we heard from Pam Holt, who was diagnosed with  multiple melanoma. Ms. Holt is among the 1 million Medicare  beneficiaries who have annual out-of-pocket prescription drug costs  that exceed $5,100, which places her in the catastrophic part of  Medicare Part D. Seniors still pay 5 percent of a drug's cost above  that threshold, and Ms. Holt had to refinance her home to be able to  afford her treatment. The price of her medication is staggering at more  than $250,000 per year, and this is not an optional cost. These are  costs that are necessary to preserve the lives and well-beings of, in  particular, our seniors.   These stories of Americans like Paul, Patty, Pam, and millions of  others who find it extremely difficult to afford the exorbitant costs  of the medications they need in order to maintain their health or the  health of their loved ones have motivated Congress to act on a  bipartisan-bicameral basis.   The Senate's Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, for  example, recently approved the Lower Health Care Costs Act, which  incorporates more than 14 measures to increase drug price competition  and uses market forces to do so. It includes major provisions from the  Biologic Patent Transparency Act, which is a bipartisan bill that I  coauthored with Senator Kaine and is also cosponsored by Senators  Braun, Hawley, Portman, Shaheen, Stabenow, Paul, and Murkowski. It is  intended to prevent drug manufacturers from gaming our patent system.   Patents play a key role in encouraging what can be billions of  dollars of investment to bring new drugs from the lab table to a  patient's bedside, but the patent system should not be misused to  prevent lower priced generic drugs from coming to market once an  initial patent has expired. Our bill requires an earlier and greater  disclosure of the web of patents that is held by biologic  manufacturers, thus making it easier for their competitors, which are  known as biosimilar companies, to develop more affordable alternatives  without their being stymied by the filing of last-minute new patents  that are intended simply to keep competition out of the marketplace.   It is particularly important that we look at biologics. They have  been miracle drugs for many Americans, but they are also the most  expensive category of drugs, accounting for approximately 40 percent of  total drug costs.   According to former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, if all of the  biosimilars that have been approved by the FDA were successfully  marketed in the United States in a timely fashion, Americans would have  saved more than $4.5 billion in 2017. This is an expert calculation  from the former FDA Commissioner.   Instead, what happens in too many cases is that the biosimilar  competitor is available now in Europe or in Canada but not in the  United States.   The HELP Committee package also includes the CREATES Act, which  addresses anti-competitive practices of companies that delay or even  block access to a sufficient quantity of the brand name drug to conduct  the bioequivalency test required by the FDA as part of the generic drug  approval process.   This addresses one of the problems identified by a major  investigation that the Aging Committee undertook in 2016, examining the  explosion in prices of off-patent prescription drugs for which there  still is no generic equivalent. What we found in some cases is that the  brand name manufacturer was making it extremely difficult for the  generic competitor to buy up a sufficient quantity of the drug to do  these bioequivalency tests that are required as part of the generic  approval process. That is just plain wrong.   Due to the provisions in the bill to spur competition, the CBO--the  Congressional Budget Office--estimates that ``the entry of certain  generic or biosimilar products could be accelerated by one or two  years, on average.'' This would make a tremendous difference and would  reduce consumer as well as Federal and private insurance spending for  prescription drugs.   The point I want to make is that this is just allowing the market to  operate as it should, with competition, transparency, and an end to the  obstacles and the gaming of the system that prevent lower priced  pharmaceuticals.   In addition, the Lower Healthcare Costs Act contains several  important provisions to shed light on what is currently a complex and  opaque system. In fact, I cannot think of any other product we buy  where the price is so opaque and lacking in transparency and in which  there are such variations in what the cost may be from plan to plan,  from pharmacy to pharmacy, from manufacturer to manufacturer, and that  is due to a very complex system that I am going to refer to.   At the Aging Committee's hearing on the high cost of insulin, the  American Diabetes Association spoke about the lack of transparency when  you trace insulin from the manufacturer to the pharmacy counter. Keep  in mind that insulin was first isolated nearly a century ago, in 1921  in Canada, and the discoverers provided it for only a dollar because  they wanted to make it widely available.   The ADA chart illustrated the complexity and the perverse incentives  in the supply chain for prescription drugs, and what was clear was that  rebates are a key problem in driving up the cost of insulin.   There is a system here that is rife with conflicts of interest. If  the manufacturer has a high list price, then the pharmacy benefit  manager, who is negotiating on behalf of the insurer, has an incentive  to choose that manufacturer's version of insulin rather than another  manufacturer's because the pharmacy benefit manager is usually  compensated by getting a percentage of the list price.   Well, obviously, the manufacturer wants to have its version of  insulin chosen to be offered by the insurer to its customers. So here  we have this system, which is rife with conflicts of interest and  incentives that encourage higher prices because then the middleman is  going to make more money, and that discount that the middleman--the  pharmacy benefit manager--is negotiating almost never makes it to the  pharmacy counter, to the patient who is purchasing the prescription  drug.   Sometimes part of that does, indeed, go to the insurer, which can use  it to lower overall premiums slightly, but we are talking about trying  to help the person who desperately needs the drug and who is buying it  at the pharmacy counter.   As cochairs of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, Senator Jeanne Shaheen and  I, as well as Senators Cramer and Carper, have introduced legislation  to address the flaws in the system and to hold PBMs and manufacturers  accountable.   We have come up with a bill that would help to reduce the price of  insulin, and what a benefit that would be for the parents of children  who have type 1 diabetes, for whom insulin is literally a matter of  survival. It would also help those older Americans with type II  diabetes, some of whom are insulin dependent.   Another significant change included in the Lower Healthcare Costs Act  requires significantly more disclosure on the costs, the fees, and the  rebate information associated with PBM contracts. It also includes an  amendment that was offered by Senator Baldwin, which I supported, to  require more reporting of drug prices to the Department of Health and  Human Services and a justification for why prices have increased.   These provisions all build on a law that I authored last year to  block pharmacy gag clauses.   I told the story about the pharmacist who was so frustrated because  so many people, day after day, were unable to afford the copays or the  deductibles on  [[Page S5159]]  their needed prescription drugs. Well, I met with a group of community  pharmacists who told me how the system worked, and they told me that  there were actually gag clauses in their contracts where they were  prohibited from sharing with the consumer whether it was cheaper to pay  out-of-pocket rather than through insurance.   Well, I am pleased to say, in working with former Senator Claire  McCaskill and Debbie Stabenow and others, we were able to get gag  clause prohibitions enacted into law last year. According to one study,  banning these gag clauses could help Americans save money in nearly one  out of four prescription transactions. So this is significant  legislation.   I talked recently to a pharmacist in Maine who said what a relief it  was to her to now be able to volunteer to her patients that there may  be a less expensive way for the patient to purchase needed prescription  drugs.   One out of four--nearly one out of four--prescription transactions  should benefit from the laws that we wrote last year.   Another bill that I authored in 2017 will promote more competition  from lower priced but equally effective generic drugs, and it is  already showing promise. To date, the FDA has granted nearly 200  application requests under the new, expedited pathway that my law  provides, and 10 have been approved. That is a much faster pace than in  the past.   As cochair of both the Senate Diabetes Caucus and the Congressional  Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease, I know all too well from listening  to families in Maine and across the country that the path toward  finding new discoveries and treatments is often long and difficult and  that success can be elusive, but we must continue our efforts. When  pharmaceutical companies start twisting around the incentives that were  designed to encourage innovation and, instead, distorting them into  obstacles to competition, Congress simply must act, and that is exactly  what we are doing.   I want to applaud the work of the HELP Committee. All of us  contributed to the bill, and we were ably led by Chairman Lamar  Alexander and Ranking Member Murray. I also want to recognize the hard  work of Senator Graham and Senator Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee  for the bipartisan package of reforms they produced last month.   Finally, I want to salute the Finance Committee chairman, Chuck  Grassley, and the ranking member, Ron Wyden, for taking bipartisan  actions just last week in passing the Prescription Drug Pricing  Reduction Act. That has many important provisions in it that will  require more disclosure. It includes a bill that Senator Casey and I  have authored, as well as many other important provisions, including  putting a medical inflation cap on certain pharmaceuticals.   I know how much the Presiding Officer personally cares about this  issue, and he has contributed greatly to this work as well. My hope is  that we can build upon this momentum, that we can seize the moment when  three different committees of the Senate have all been successful in  reporting to the full Senate three bipartisan bills.   Our HELP Committee bill was reported by a vote of 20 to 3. That is  remarkable consensus.   Let us bring all of these bills to the Senate floor this fall--or  certainly by the end of the year--so that we can deliver real results  to the American people by lowering the price of prescription drugs.   We would then be very proud of listening to our constituents and  addressing a problem that affects millions of Americans.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the 150th  anniversary of the Town of Madawaska ME. Located in Aroostook County,  our State's northernmost region, Madawaska is in the heart of the St.  John River Valley, the center of our rich Acadian culture. I am honored  to celebrate the generations of industrious and caring people who have  made Madawaska such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise  families.   Madawaska has a fascinating history. For thousands of years, the St.  John River Valley has been the home of the Maliseet Tribe. French  explorers, led by Samuel de Champlain, first visited the area in 1604  and established friendly relationships with the Native Americans.   In 1785, French-speaking Canadians fleeing persecution in British  Canada journeyed up the St. John River in search of liberty. They  marked the spot of their landing with a large wooden cross in gratitude  for the safe haven they had found. Today, the rebuilt Acadian Cross is  an enduring reminder of the determination and courage of those first  settlers. The Tante Blanche Museum honors the heroism and compassion of  Marguerite Blanche Thibodeau Cyr, who fed the hungry and cared for the  sick during a famine in 1797.   The Maliseets often provided vital assistance during the first  difficult years. From fertile soil, vast forests, and their own hard  work, the settlers created a prosperous community that laid the  foundation for the vibrant Acadian culture that is so important in  Maine, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and as far away as Louisiana.   Following the American Revolution, the region was the scene of a  decades-long border dispute between our new Nation and British Canada.  Although the bloodless Aroostook War did not result in armed conflict,  it was a period of great tension and uncertainty, with both sides  seeking control of the increasingly valuable timberlands. As the  national governments of Great Britain and the United States negotiated  a peaceful resolution, the province of New Brunswick laid claim to the  disputed area. On July 4, 1827, a band of pro-American settlers  declared the independence of the Republic of Madawaska with its own  flag and the intention of joining the United States.   In response, the Maine Legislature established the Territory of  Madawaska in 1831, creating what was called the world's biggest town,  with an area of more than 4,000 square miles. The border dispute was  settled by treaty in 1842. Peace was maintained between the United  States and Canada. Settlement to the region increase greatly, and in  1869, the town of Madawaska was incorporate.   Today, more than 80 percent of the town's residents speak French, and  they continue to uphold the Acadian traditions of great food, music,  and dance, and of close-knit families and lasting friendships. The  annual Acadian Festival in August is a highlight of the year and a  funfilled celebration of this great heritage.  [[Page S5192]]    To my Franco-American friends, it is a pleasure to congratulate you  on this landmark anniversary. Across the generations, you have worked  hard and worked together to create a community that combines your rich  heritage with the values that define our State and our Nation.   Mr. President, the celebration of Madawaska's 150th anniversary is  not merely about the passing of time, it is about human accomplishment.  We celebrate the people who pulled together, cared for one another, and  built a great community.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S5192, July 30, 2019, first column, the following  appears: Mr. President, the celebration of Madawaska's 15th  anniversary is not merely about the passing of time, it is about  human accomplishment. We celebrate the people who pulled together,  cared for one another, and built a great community.      The online Record has been corrected to read: Mr. President, the  celebration of Madawaska's 150th anniversary is not merely about  the passing of time, it is about human accomplishment. We  celebrate the people who pulled together, cared for one another,  and built a great community.    ========================= END NOTE =========================                              ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from  Michigan, Senator Peters, in introducing the Animal Freedom from  Testing, Experiments, and Research Act, known as the AFTER Act, to  promote the adoption or retirement of animals used for research at  Federal agencies. I would also like to thank Senators Shaheen and  McSally who are original cosponsors of this legislation.   In fiscal year 2018, the Federal government experimented on  approximately 50,000 animals for research purposes. The experiments  occurred across twelve different Federal agencies and the animals used  were mainly cats, dogs, monkeys, and rabbits. While tracking these  animals following experimentation is challenging, once animals are no  longer needed for research, they are often killed, since many agencies  lack formal retirement or adoption policies. With that said, recent  studies indicate that research animals who are adopted often thrive in  their new environments.   In 2013, led by Senators Harkin, Alexander, Cantwell and myself, the  Senate passed the CHIMP Act, which allowed for the retirement of  hundreds of primates that were formerly being used in National  Institute of Health (NIH) experiments. In addition, the Departments of  Defense, Veteran Affairs, and NIH recently enacted successful animal  retirement policies. While I am encouraged by the Senate's past work on  primates and the recent policies developed by a few agencies; there are  still many Federal agencies, including the Departments of Agriculture,  Interior, Commerce, NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency that lack  formal policies for animals that have been used in experiments.   The AFTER Act builds on successful policies at DOD, VA, and NIH by  directing all Federal agencies to promulgate regulations that would  facilitate the retirement of laboratory animals. The bill provides  flexibility for each agency to devise its own policy, with the goal of  ensuring that such animals, whenever possible, are retired and not  killed. Additionally, the AFTER Act requires animals to be evaluated by  a licensed veterinarian and pronounced both mentally and physically  healthy before leaving an agency. This will help ensure a smooth  transition to a new environment.   Our legislation also encourages Federal agencies to work with non- profit organizations to ensure retired animals are distributid to  sanctuaries and shelters across the Nation, not just those closest to  the research facility. This would allow a State like Maine, which does  not have Federal research labs that use animals, to play a role in  retiring these animals and providing homes for them.   Mr. President, there is no reason animals that are suitable for  adoption or retirement should be killed by our Federal government. The  AFTER Act would provide the necessary direction Federal agencies need  in order to move forward with developing retirement policies. I urge  all of my colleagues to join in support of this important bipartisan  legislation, the Animal Freedom from Testing, Experiments, and Research  Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 2340.
