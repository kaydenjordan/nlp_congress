 Madam Speaker, it shouldn't be a partisan issue when we  talk about the border and border security.   You know what it really comes down to?   It is the United States of America versus the Mexican drug cartels.   In April of this year, we had 234,000 illegal border crossings. It  was the worst on record, by the way, only to be exceeded the very next  month, in May, by 241,000 illegal border crossings.   Why do I mention this?   Because we don't know who these people are. No one ever talks about  the 3.8 million people in the world that are  [[Page H8813]]  waiting to come to this country legally, to respect the laws and the  rules of the country that they want to become a part of--who are  exactly the kind of folks that we want to come here.   Another thing nobody ever talks about is 95 percent of those people  are people of color, and they are going to be wonderful people that  make America stronger.   The Mexican drug cartels are making, on estimate, $25 billion a year,  and now they are charging $4,000 a head for illegal crossings, which  adds another $12 billion to their pockets. And we have had 107,000  deaths last year alone to opioid overdoses.   We need to unite as Americans, secure our southern border, and make  our country more secure and Americans safer.                            ____________________
