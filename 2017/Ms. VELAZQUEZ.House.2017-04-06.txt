 Mr. Speaker, another week in Washington and, yet, more  evidence mounts; our election and the White House have been compromised  by Russia.   This week we learned one of the President's informal advisers--a  mercenary who founded the company Blackwater--met secretly with a Putin  representative and attempted to establish back-channel conversations  between the Trump administration and Russia.   Remember, this comes after we found out the President's son-in-law  met with Russian banking officials. It comes after it was reported that  the Attorney General likely perjured himself before Congress about his  own meeting with Russians.   Sadly, it comes after there were chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  Let us recall that Assad's closest ally in that horrific civil war has  been--you guessed it--Russia.   It is imperative we unearth all of the links between this  administration, Russia, and Russia's hacking of our election. The House  Intelligence Committee's investigation has become a farce. We need a  thorough, independent investigation. Appoint a special counsel now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me take this opportunity to thank the  ranking member for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1219, the Supporting America's  Innovators Act of 2017, which I am proud to cosponsor with Mr. McHenry.   Throughout my career here in Congress, I have always supported and  encouraged legislation that creates jobs and fosters innovation for  America's entrepreneurs and small businesses. The bill we are  considering today will further that goal.   Mr. Speaker, I always say access to capital is access to opportunity.  That is exactly what this legislation does.   The Investment Company Act of 1940 currently limits the number of  accredited investors in a venture fund to no more than 100 individuals,  but most funds try not to reach that limit in order to adjust for  unforeseen circumstances. This artificially low limit restricts the  number of individuals that can invest in small businesses and startups.  That means less opportunity for entrepreneurs.   Our bill will address this problem by allowing up to 250 accredited  investors to participate in venture funds with up to $10 million in  capital.                                time  0930    It is important to stress that these are accredited investors. They  have at least $200,000 in minimum income or $1 million in net assets.  These are sophisticated investors comfortable with the risks involved  in the startup sector.   Many of these investors pool their money together either in local or  national groups. More recently, many have gotten involved in online  crowdfunding platforms, which were created through the JOBS Act, to  funnel more capital to small businesses and startups.  [[Page H2761]]    Our bill will create greater access for women-owned and women-led  businesses. The types of funds empowered to attract more investors  under this bill are often a good capital source for women-owned firms.   I am proud that our bipartisan legislation has garnered a wide range  of attention and support from the industry. The Angel Capital  Association and the Internet Association have endorsed the bill. These  are groups dedicated to expanding capital opportunities for small  businesses.   This bill has also moved through the legislative process with strong  bipartisan support every step of the way. Last month, we passed this  bill out of the Financial Services Committee with a broad bipartisan  vote of 54-2. The same day, the Senate Banking Committee was busy  passing its bipartisan companion version, S. 444, sponsored by Senators  Heitkamp and Heller. It is also important to recognize that, last year,  this Chamber passed a nearly identical version of our bill by a vote of  388-9.   It is time to see this legislation enacted. It will create more  capital for small businesses and it will mean more jobs throughout the  Nation.   Let me take a moment to thank Mr. McHenry for working with me on this  bill, as well as Chairman Hensarling. And let me also thank Ranking  Member Waters for her leadership and hard work.   Again, a vote for this bill is a vote for America's entrepreneurs. I  urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
