The Joint Programmable Fuze FMU-139 or FMU-152 fuzes       are multi-delay sensors compatible with weapon guidance kits,       tail kits, high-explosive bombs, and reduced collateral       damage weapons which provide all arming and detonation event       functions combined in a single fuze system.        24. Laser JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munitions) (GBU-54)       converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into precision       guided smart munitions by adding a new tail section       containing Inertial Navigation System (INS) guidance/Global       Positioning System (GPS) guidance and adds a Semi-active       laser seeker. This allows the weapon to strike targets moving       at up to 70 mph. The LJDAM weapon consists of a DSU-38       sensor, a JDAM guidance set installed on bomb body and a       fuze. The DSU-38 consists of a laser spot tracker (same size       and shape as a DSU-33 proximity fuze), a cable connecting the       DSU-38 to the basic JDAM guidance set, a cable cover, cable       cover tie down straps, modified tail kit door and wiring       harness, and associated modified JDAM software that       incorporates navigation and guidance flight software to       support both LJDAM and standard JDAM missions.        The KMU-572 is the tail kit for a GBU-54, 500LB Laser JDAM.        25. The Enhanced Paveway II (EP II) Laser Guided Bomb (LGB)       is a maneuverable, all-weather, free-fall weapon that guides       to a spot of laser energy reflected off the target. The       ``enhanced'' component is the addition of GPS-aided Inertial       Navigation Systems (GAINS) guidance to the laser seeker.       Laser designation for the LGB can be provided by a variety of       laser target markers or designators. The EP II consists of an       MAU-210 Enhanced Computer Control Group (ECCG) that  [[Page S1933]]       is not warhead specific and a warhead-specific Air Foil Group       (AFG) that attaches to the nose and tail of a General Purpose       (GP) bomb body.        The EGBU-49 is a 500LB GP bomb body fitted with the MXU-650       AFG to guide to its laser-designated target.        26. The Mk-82 GP bomb body is a 500LB, free-fall, unguided,       low-drag weapon.        27. Mk-82 inert GP bomb body is a 500LB, free-fall,       unguided, low-drag weapon without the explosive fill.        28. The GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb I Practice Bomb is an       inert variant of the 250LB, GPS-aided inertial navigation       system, small autonomous, day or night, adverse weather,       conventional, air-to-ground precision glide weapon able to       strike fixed and stationary re-locatable non-hardened targets       from standoff ranges. It can be used for integration, test,       or training purposes. This purchase will also include       tactical training rounds.        29. The highest level of classification of defense       articles, components, and services included in this potential       sale is SECRET.        30. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        31. A determination has been made that Bulgaria can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        32. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Bulgaria.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
