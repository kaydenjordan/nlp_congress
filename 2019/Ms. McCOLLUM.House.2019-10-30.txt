 Madam Speaker, I rise today in gratitude to thank the  Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association for their endorsement of H.R.  2407, the Promoting Human Rights for Palestinian Children Living Under  Military Occupation Act.   This endorsement by more than 300 respected rabbis sends a strong  signal by people of all faiths that every child deserves to be treated  with dignity and respect, and that includes Palestinian children. No  longer can we ignore the countless cases of mistreatment and abuse of  Palestinian children by the Israeli military.   As a nation, we should no longer condone the detention of these  children with the support of our tax dollars.   So, again, I thank leaders of all faiths, but especially these rabbis  for their commitment to human rights and the rights of children and for  standing up and saying no more abuse of Palestinian children.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, the Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act  is an important bill to protect one of America's most iconic national  parks and elevate the voices of Tribal communities.   Tribal leaders from across the Southwest have called on Congress to  permanently protect this region from uranium mining. These communities  have seen firsthand the devastating impact uranium extraction could  have on their lives, on their health, and the health of their children.   For example, the Havasupai Tribe live in the bottom of the Grand  Canyon. Uranium contamination of the aquifers that sustain their land  would destroy their drinking water, their farms, and kill their  livestock. Even their ability to remain on their Tribal homeland is at  risk.   It is time for Congress to listen to these Tribal leaders. It is time  for Congress to stand up for future generations who are relying upon us  for clean water, public lands, cultural heritage, and other priceless  resources.   As a chair of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Subcommittee, I hear from Americans about the value of  conserving our public lands and protecting our air and our water. The  Trump administration's agenda puts that all at risk by prioritizing  profits for mining companies over our public health and the health of  our environment.   In my home State of Minnesota, the Trump administration's push to  mine at any cost jeopardizes the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness,  our Nation's most visited wilderness area.   Congress needs to state clearly and emphatically that some places are  just simply too important and too precious to exploit. Today, we take a  stand to protect the lands and waters surrounding the Grand Canyon, one  of the earliest and most iconic national parks.   Madam Chair, I support H.R. 1373, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.
