 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after my  remarks, the senior Senator from Hawaii be recognized.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, what is happening today on the Senate floor  is outrageous. I still cannot quite believe my colleagues as their  staff members stood behind them in the Senate Chamber to my right. All  of them have health insurance that is paid for by taxpayers. All of  us--all of them, all of the staff, all of the Senators, all of the  House Members--have insurance paid for by taxpayers. Yet they would  come to the Senate floor with their votes entrusted to them and given  to them by  [[Page S4174]]  the voting public in their districts and their States. All of them have  health insurance that is paid for by the taxpayers, and they would vote  to take insurance away from hundreds of thousands of people in my State  and in Washington and in Wyoming and in Alabama and in Hawaii.   Millions of people around the country, most of whom have jobs--people  who are working $8-, $10-, $12-, $15-an-hour jobs--are not as well paid  as the staff who stand behind us as these floor sessions go on, and  they would take insurance away from people like them. I am still just  incredulous that that would have happened. This bill affects all of our  constituents. It would upend one-fifth of the American economy. Yet the  people whom we serve have no idea what is in this bill. We really do  not know what is in it.   Over the weekend, people said Senator McConnell was going to bring us  all to the floor on Tuesday to vote on the healthcare law. This is the  law to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I was part of writing the  Affordable Care Act as a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee. That bill took months and months and months, dozens  of hearings, and hundreds of amendments. The committee adopted, and I  supported, 150 Republican amendments. It was the way we should do  things here. Instead, Senator McConnell met just down this hall--I know  the camera does not quite show this. Down this hall in his office, he  met with lobbyists from Wall Street, with lobbyists from the drug  companies, and with lobbyists from the insurance companies. I do not  think the Presiding Officer was part of this--he is, perhaps, too  junior--but four or five Republican Senators were in there, and they  wrote a bill that, alas, was good for drug companies, was good for  insurance companies, and was good for Wall Street. It just left out the  public.   Now, we do not really know what is in the bill this time. One of the  things we do know is, all of the options are bad for my State of Ohio  and that all of the options are bad for the people who elected us to  serve here. Let me talk about those options.   First, behind door No. 1, we have the repeal of the Affordable Care  Act with no replacement. Again, behind door No. 1, I do not know if  that is what this bill is. I do know it is one of the options. So  behind door No. 1 is repeal with no replacement. That means repealing  the entire Affordable Care Act with no plan to replace it. It creates  dangerous uncertainty that of course will drive prices up for everyone.  When insurance companies, when the people who have insurance now have  no idea what is going to happen, of course it drives prices up. Of  course, it means insurance companies will pull out of Wyoming and  Alabama and Washington State and Hawaii and Ohio.   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, 18 million  Americans will lose their health insurance next year, and premiums will  go up 20 percent. Professionals hold these jobs. They are people who  are not Republicans, who are not Democrats, who are just like the  Parliamentarian, who is not aligned with either party. The  Congressional Budget Office is just like that.   Again, think about that. Think of the Members of the Senate. Think of  the Senate's staff who line up along this wall during floor sessions.  All of us have insurance. Yet we are going to take it away. According  to this plan behind door No. 1, we are going to take it away from 18  million Americans. There would be less coverage, and premiums would go  up 20 percent--higher costs. By the end of this decade, 32 million  Americans--that is like 1 out of 10 Americans--who currently have  insurance would be without health coverage and premiums would double.  So 32 million people lose their insurance within the decade and  premiums double.    Let's talk about Barbara. Barbara, whom I met in Toledo just  recently, is 63. She is not old enough for Medicare; she relies on the  healthcare exchanges. Repeal with no replacement would create massive  uncertainty for Ohioans.   The people in this body who voted yes today--does the Senate staff  who stands behind here who have insurance from--taxpayers like  Barbara--do they think about Barbara? Do they think about somebody who  reads in the paper that the Senate took the first--still reversible but  barely--step toward taking their insurance away? Do they ever think  about people like Barbara? Do they, as President Lincoln said, ever get  out and get their public opinion pass and listen to people like  Barbara? She is 63 years old, and she doesn't know if she will have  insurance next month. Imagine that. Do the staff back here, do the  Senators who get insurance from taxpayers--do they think: Oh, maybe my  insurance won't exist a few months from now. Do they think about that?  I am guessing they don't.   Repeal with no replacement creates massive uncertainty for Ohioans  like her. We have already seen this year what that uncertainty does to  Ohio families, with insurance companies that have been forced to pull  out of the market as Congress and the White House create more and more  uncertainty. When Aetna pulled out of Dayton and other communities in  Ohio--in that part of Ohio--they and others left nearly 20 counties in  Ohio without any insurer next year. When they did that, they announced  it was because of the uncertainty in this Congress, that nobody really  quite knows what is happening.   So that is door No. 1--repeal with no replacement, higher cost, less  coverage.   Let's look at door No. 2. Behind door No. 2 is the plan that Mitch  McConnell negotiated in secret. As I said, straight down this hall, go  to the right, that is Mitch McConnell's office. That is where the drug  company lobbyists hung out; that is where the insurance company  lobbyists hung out; that is where the Wall Street lobbyists hung out  and a small number of Senators, and then they slammed the door shut.  That is how they wrote this bill. The Presiding Officer knows this from  his constituents in Florida. The drug companies wrote the bill. The  insurance companies wrote the bill. Wall Street wrote the bill. And,  alas, the bill: tax cuts for insurance companies and tax cuts for the  drug companies. The 400 richest families in America--many of them  contribute huge numbers of dollars, with lots of zeroes on them, to my  Republican colleagues who voted for this bill. The 400 richest families  in America will get--under this McConnell door No. 2, there are not  just higher costs with less coverage for the public, but 400 families  will average a $7 million tax cut for each of the next 10 years. Four  hundred families will get a $7 million tax cut for each of the next 10  years.   The McConnell plan would increase healthcare costs for working  families. We know that. They would slap on higher costs. They would  slap an age tax on Ohioans over 50 when they buy insurance. And when it  comes to healthcare costs, Senator Heller from Nevada said it best:  There is nothing in this bill that would lower premiums.   So they give tax cuts to rich people. They give tax breaks to the  insurance and the drug companies. They cut Medicaid. But there is  nothing in this bill, according to Senator Heller, a Republican from  Nevada, that would lower premiums. There are, however, those massive  tax breaks for drug companies that have been jacking up prices on  lifesaving medicines like insulin and those drug companies that played  a role in creating the opioid epidemic that devastates my State. More  people in my State--as the Presiding Officer, who also represents a  large State, knows--more people in my State died of opioid overdose  than any other State in the United States.   What does this plan do for the opioid epidemic? I have had dozens-- maybe not dozens--I have done at least 15 or 20 roundtables around Ohio  to talk about the opioid epidemic with doctors and counselors,  psychologists and therapists and nurses, people who are recovering from  addiction and their families, and others. One thing they all agree on  is that the single best tool to help with opioid addiction is, alas,  Medicaid. The single best tool to combat the opioid epidemic is  Medicaid. This bill would take away the No. 1 tool we have to fight  that.   So 220,000 Ohioans right now struggling with opioid addiction,  getting treatment for opioid addiction--220,000--they are getting their  addiction treatment because they have the Affordable Care Act and  insurance provided by the Affordable Care Act. We are going to take  that away from them.   At one of my roundtables in Cincinnati--the Talbot House--a father  [[Page S4175]]  sitting next to his daughter, who I believe was in her early thirties,  looked at me and said: My daughter would be dead from an opioid  overdose had it not been for Medicaid expansion. I thank Governor  Kasich for having the courage to stand up against his President and  stand up against the Republican leadership in this town and do the  right thing in expanding Medicaid.   This plan, door No. 2, has higher costs, less coverage, and would  kick many of those 220,000 people off their insurance. It would disrupt  treatment for hundreds of thousands of Ohioans as they fight for their  lives. It would pull the rug out from under local police and  communities in the midst of an epidemic.   A number of police officers told me that when they go to a home--a  police officer or a firefighter or another first responder--when they  go to a home where somebody is unconscious because of an opioid  epidemic, first they give them Narcan to revive them, and the second  thing they do is sign them up for Medicaid. They sign them up for  Medicaid so they can get treatment. Otherwise, there is a very good  chance that person will die.   The most important tool for fighting opioid addiction is Medicaid.  Yet this body voted today--2 Republicans stood up and voted against  this--today, 50 Republicans and the Vice President of the United  States, who honored us with his presence today with the tie-breaking  vote, voted essentially to kick those people off their treatment.   So door No. 2, the insurance company lobbyist plan: higher costs,  less coverage. The same plan written by lobbyists.   Let's talk about door No. 3. Behind door No. 3 are higher costs and  less coverage. It is the same plan written by lobbyists, just with  taxpayer dollars thrown in to buy off votes. Same result--higher costs  and less coverage.   They can't just throw money at this bill and make it better.   Take opioids. They want to take away Medicaid, which is the No. 1  tool we have to get people treated, and then they throw in a $45  billion Federal grant program instead.   Governor Kasich said that those dollars--taking away Medicaid, taking  away treatment, taking away insurance from the 700,000 Ohioans in  Medicaid expansion and hundreds of thousands of Ohioans later--Governor  Kasich is a Republican, and he and I see this pretty much the same way.  Governor Kasich said that putting that money in after taking away  Medicaid is like spitting in the ocean.   The director of Ohio's Medicaid Program said the Republican Senate  plan would be devastating for Ohio. For instance, if someone had  cancer, I don't think the best treatment for cancer is to cut off their  insurance and then give them a Federal grant to pay their oncologist-- not even a Federal grant to pay their oncologist. You don't treat  people by a Federal grant, you treat people by insurance and all of the  wraparound part of insurance that matters.   It is not just those fighting addiction--I talked a lot about  opioids--it is kids with special healthcare needs. It is Ohio schools.  There is a program called Medicaid in Schools that helps young people  struggling with various kinds of physical and mental illnesses in the  schools. That is helpful.   It is rural hospitals. I have been on the phone with literally four  dozen hospital CEOs in this State--at least four dozen, a number of  them a number of times--and small hospitals in rural communities know  that they may close if this bill, the one behind door No. 3, is  adopted.   It is seniors in nursing homes, and it is their families who help  care for them. Few people realize that three in five nursing home  residents in my State rely on Medicaid to cover the cost of their care.  That is 60 percent. They are our parents and our grandparents. These  are middle-class families and working-class families who end up in  nursing homes. They run out of money at the end of their lives. That is  Medicaid dollars. Two-thirds of Medicaid dollars don't go to children  or opioid addiction, they go to nursing homes to take care of our  parents and grandparents.   I met with families again in Toledo last week who rely on Medicaid to  help afford nursing home care.   Bob's mother Blanche lives at a home in Perrysburg, a suburb of  Toledo.         My mother and father worked all their lives. My mother is       95 and receives a pension of only $1,500 a month. Medicaid       keeps her alive so she is able to spend time with her kids       and her grandkids.    I remember Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, who said that  wisdom and knowledge are passed from grandparent to grandchild. A child  can spend time with her grandparents, as my daughters got to spend time  with their grandparents, especially my grandmother in her last years.  It didn't just bring great joy to the grandparents, it imparts wisdom  and understanding and education to the grandchildren. Medicaid does  that, too, when people have insurance, when people are taken care of in  nursing homes and assisted living.   We talk about people like Blanche who worked hard to build a good  life for their families. They paid their taxes. They paid their  insurance premiums. They paid into Medicare and Social Security. So we  are going to cut their Medicaid in the last years of their lives. They  shouldn't have to lose everything because they need more intensive care  in the later years of their lives, and neither should their families,  who are already squeezed--people in their forties and fifties and early  sixties--who worry about their children's education on the one hand and  then worry about paying for nursing home care for their parents on the  other.   Another huge portion of the people Medicaid helps are Ohioans who are  workers, who pay taxes, who have children with a disability or with  serious special needs. Nearly 500,000 kids in Ohio--20 percent of Ohio  kids, 2 in 10--have special healthcare needs. Boaz, whom I met in  Cleveland, was born with several heart defects. He wouldn't be alive  today without treatment covered by Medicaid. Benjamin Dworning from  Akron, born with Down syndrome, visited my office recently with his  parents.   It is not just kids with special needs who will lose out. Ohio  schools could lose $12 million a year. Twenty-two percent of rural  hospitals would be at risk of closing. It goes on and on.   These are all problems created by this bill behind door No. 3,  written by lobbyists, written down the hall in Senator McConnell's  office by drug company and insurance company and Wall Street lobbyists.  That is the bill--undisclosed, unknown until he regurgitated it on the  Senate floor and gave us this bill.   Cleveland.com wrote: ``As for the proposed $200 billion to ease the  path for ACA funding losses, this too would pale compared with the  losses themselves.''   Again, Governor Kasich--he, a Republican; I, a Democrat--said this is  spitting in the ocean.   So that is what is behind door No. 3--higher costs, less coverage.   That brings us to door No. 4. What is behind the last door? We have  no idea. It is the ultimate mystery plan.   Remember what Washington uncertainty has already done to Ohio  families? There are 20 counties with no insurer next year.   As an editor at the Columbus Dispatch--Ohio's most conservative  newspaper--said to me about a month and a half ago, uncertainty is like  carbon monoxide for business, a silent killer.   Now, the Republican Party, which fashions itself as the party of  business, seems to have specialized over the last 10 years in injecting  uncertainty into the economy--uncertainties such as, are we going to  pass the Export-Import Bank, which Senator Murray worked so hard on, so  our companies can export American-manufactured, well-made products? Are  we going to pay our debts or are we not going to meet our obligations  and shut down the government? Are we going to leave hanging out there  the Affordable Care Act repeal? All of these things create uncertainty,  and as a result, business investment freezes. We know what happens. So  who knows what kind of damage this latest vote will do in the insurance  market.   What we know for certain is that this mystery plan behind door No. 4  will mean higher costs and it will mean less coverage, because nothing  so far--nothing that has been put on the table--could result in  anything else. The math doesn't work. How can anyone stand here--again,  staff standing by the wall here and Members of the Senate, all getting  insurance provided by taxpayers--how can you stand here and  [[Page S4176]]  threaten to take away the insurance of others and at the same time  drive up costs?    The Affordable Care Act is not perfect. Of course, it is not. We have  work to do. Senator Schumer talked today about it. Sit down with us. We  would love to work through many of the items and get more young,  healthy people into the insurance pool, to stabilize the insurance  market, to go after the high cost of prescription drugs and maybe, even  to consider Medicare at 55. We were one vote away from opening up  Medicare in a revenue-neutral way for people between 55 and 64 who  might have lost their insurance as they get sick or as they get older.  There are all of those options, but don't start with repeal, throwing  millions of Americans off of their insurance.   I agree with Governor Kasich one more time. Yesterday, Governor  Kasich said: Until Congress can step back from political gamesmanship-- which we saw in spades today, as Senator Johnson and Majority Leader  McConnell were negotiating the last parts of the bill, and as, more or  less, 98 of us sat here and watched and wondered what was going on and  saw that political gamesmanship--and come together with a workable  bipartisan plan, it is a mistake for the Senate to proceed with the  vote we just took on Tuesday. He said that yesterday.   Instead of down the hall Senator McConnell working with insurance  company and drug company lobbyists, instead of listening to the drug  companies so that he puts the tax break for drug companies in the bill,  let's listen to the people of Kentucky, Wyoming, Texas, Louisiana,  Alabama, North Carolina, Ohio, Hawaii, and Washington. Let's listen to  the people of the States of my colleagues in this body.   Let's work on a bipartisan plan to fix what is not working in the  Affordable Care Act. Let's keep what is working and make healthcare  work better for the people whom we serve.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The Senator from Hawaii.    Mr. President, I want to echo the comments of the senior  Senator from Idaho, the chairman of the Banking Committee, and thank  Mr. Alvarez for his service at the Federal Reserve.   I specifically want to thank him for his service during the financial  crisis of 2008. Our country faced daunting challenges during that  period, and the Federal Reserve and the government's response to the  financial crisis was not an easy undertaking.   The crisis demanded great effort and ingenuity from many people. It  required close coordination across the executive branch, the regulatory  agencies, Congress, and the private sector. Working with key  decisionmakers at the board and throughout the government, Mr. Alvarez  played an important role in developing and articulating the legal  dimensions to virtually every initiative taken by the Federal Reserve  to address the crisis.   Mr. Alvarez also worked closely with Congress during consideration of  the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and  played a crucial role in implementing rulemakings required of the  Federal Reserve by Dodd-Frank. I am particularly grateful for the work  he did to implement strong rules to increase the capital and leverage  requirements for the Nation's largest banks--a necessary and critical  step after the crisis--and the work that he did with my office in  making one of the first substantive amendments to Dodd-Frank related to  capital standards for insurance companies.   Scott Alvarez has served the Federal Reserve and the American people  with great distinction and deserves thanks for a job well done.                            ____________________
