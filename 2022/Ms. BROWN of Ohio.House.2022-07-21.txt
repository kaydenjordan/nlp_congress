 Mr. Speaker, imagine waking up one morning to a  sharp, debilitating pain ripping through your lower abdomen that is so  excruciating it brings you to your knees, then going to your doctor  seeking relief, only to be told that while the medicine exists, because  of a new anti-contraception law, you will simply have to endure; endure  the unbearable pain that is so all-consuming it limits your daily  activities.   By threatening access to contraception, this is the new reality  extremists propose for tens of thousands of Americans.   Americans who rely on contraceptives to manage health challenges like  menstrual cramps, hormone imbalance, and even acne, are now grappling  with the fear of no access as the far right continues its war on  reproductive healthcare.   Today, I proudly voted for the Right to Contraception Act because all  Americans should have the right to access and use birth control,  regardless of the reason why.                            ____________________
