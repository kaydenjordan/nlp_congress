 Mr. Speaker, I want to speak candidly  and directly to the American people.   There are many, many issues that we agree upon, Republicans and  Democrats, coming together to solve big challenges.   In my district in New Hampshire, people are dying, and they are dying  from an emergency that did not exist--a continuing resolution will not  solve their problem--and that is the opioid epidemic that hits  districts all across this country. People are dying, families are  suffering, and our communities are hurting.   We need to come together, and we can. We have a bipartisan task force  with 100 Members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats. Just this  week, 50 Members, Republicans and Democrats, came together to ask for  funding for this emergency crisis.   We ask the President: Extend the emergency. We need to fund, and now  is the time.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent, please, together, Republicans  and Democrats, bring up H.R. 4872, the End the Shutdown Act of 2018, a  continuing resolution that would immediately reopen the government  through Tuesday while we continue negotiations on a budget agreement  that adheres to parity and other critical issues like this opioid  epidemic. This is urgent. Please, I ask my brothers and sisters on both  sides of the aisle.
