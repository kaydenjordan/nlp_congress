 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 2019 Florida Fire Marshal  of the Year, Jennifer Pierce.   Pierce currently serves as the fire marshal of the Clermont Fire  Department. With over 15 years of fire service under her belt, she also  oversees the daily operations of the fire prevention division, which  includes reviewing life safety plans, conducting fire investigations,  and coordinating community relations.   Clermont city manager Darren Gray highlighted how Fire Marshal Pierce  has provided ``the highest level of service to Clermont's growing list  of businesses, especially working with downtown's historic buildings  and new business owners.''   In addition to being awarded the Fire Marshal of the Year title,  Pierce was chosen to serve as the statewide director of fire marshals  on the Florida Fire Marshals and Inspectors Association's board of  directors.   Her leadership and dedication to the city of Clermont has been  exceptional, and I am confident that we will see more outstanding  contributions from her in the future.   From the bottom of my heart, I thank Fire Marshal Pierce and all the  incredible first responders who serve District 15 and our Nation.                            ____________________
