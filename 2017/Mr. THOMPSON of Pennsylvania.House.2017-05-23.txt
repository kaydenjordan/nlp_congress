 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  a truly wonderful business in State College, Pennsylvania: KCF  Technologies. I had the honor of visiting KCF yesterday as it hit the  milestone of hiring its 50th employee.   KCF was founded in November 2000 by three Penn State researchers:  Gary Koopmann, Weicheng Chen, and Jeremy Frank. It is a private company  and is employee-owned.   This rapidly growing technology innovation company focuses on putting  inventions to work in the industrial world.   Its staff develops and commercializes products and solutions for  industry and the military. KCF specializes in wireless sensors, energy  harvesting, underwater navigation, and smart material devices. Its goal  is to bring the latest technologies to life to make things we work and  live with smarter.   KCF is not only expanding its workforce, but its revenues have grown  at an average annual rate of more than 60 percent and over 500 percent  since 2005.   It set a lofty goal for this year to save its customers $100 million  in 2017, and KCF is passionately working to achieve that goal. Outside  of its State College headquarters there is a thermometer sign  prominently displayed to track progress. Multiple department walls  within the facility are also adorned with thermometer posters. As KCF  saves customers money throughout the year, the thermometers reflect  that progress by filling up.   KCF Technologies not only cares about giving back to its customers,  but it gives back to the Centre County community, too.   To commemorate a record-breaking sales month in April, employees  exchanged their workday to volunteer at CentrePeace.   CentrePeace was established in 1994 with the purpose of providing a  wholesome working environment for Centre County inmates. It operates  the largest used furniture recycling project in the county, which  prevents tons of items from ending up in the landfills. Inmates repair  and restore electronics and furniture, participate in classes to  improve their life skills, and learn how to handle conflict.   KCF Technologies is also working to improve the lives of our wounded  warriors thanks to research funded by the U.S. Army Telemedicine and  Advanced Technology Research Center, and the National Science  Foundation.   It is fully researching and developing energy harvesting, self- powered prosthetic devices and the innovative Kinetic Revolutions  Adjustable Pylon for use with leg prostheses. These electromechanical  devices make life better for amputees at every age and walk of life.   Today, with my colleague, Congressman Mike Thompson of California, we  will introduce a bill that will curb Medicare fraud when it comes to  unlawful and unlicensed providers of orthotics and prosthetics. Our  bill works to ensure that the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare  Services stops allowing these unlicensed operations to apply for and  collect Federal payments.   As a former certified therapist and licensed nursing home  administrator, I know firsthand the importance of safe and reliable  products for those who are in need.   When unlicensed and unaccredited providers deliver prosthetic and  orthotic services, both Medicare beneficiaries and the American  taxpayer are shortchanged.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan Medicare Orthotics  and Prosthetics Improvement Act of 2017.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  a true gem in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, the Rowland Theatre, which  celebrates its 100th anniversary this year.   Rowland Theatre opened its doors on June 4, 1917. Its visionary was  Congressman Charles Rowland, who was elected to the House of  Representatives in 1915 and represented the 21st Congressional  District, which included Cameron, Centre, Clearfield, and McKean  Counties.   The Rowland Theatre was actually one small part of Congressman  Rowland's life, but it would be the project that would become his  legacy. The theater not only showed the latest silent movies during its  first few decades, it was also the location for the top traveling shows  in the country.   Now the Rowland Theatre shows feature films and also hosts plays, as  well as choir and orchestra performances. The 1,000-seat theater  remains an anchor of downtown Philipsburg, and it is listed on the  National Register of Historic Places. The Rowland Theatre is open 364  days a year, closing only on Christmas Eve.   Mr. Speaker, the Rowland Theatre is a real treasure. Here is to  another 100 years.   Congratulations.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank you so much for  this opportunity. It is great to have a distinguished brother Eagle  Scout like yourself.   Mr. Speaker, Scouting has been a part of my family--or I have been  part of the Scouting family, actually, since I was 11 years old. When I  was 11 years old, my mom and dad did an amazing thing; they did what  today I would call a good turn. It was really an amazing turn. They  actually opened their home up--and this was appropriate since we are  talking about a lot of foster youth this week, kids that grew up in  foster families. They opened our family up to a boy that was just 2  years older than I, Bob. Bob came as a foster brother, and he is still  my brother today.   Bob has some special needs. Bob had been bouncing around foster care  homes his whole life, but when he came to our house, he didn't bounce  anymore. He stuck. Like I said, he became my brother and is my brother  today.   My mom and dad made a promise to him. One of the positive things that  happened to Bob in the home he had been living in prior to coming to  our home was that he got involved in a Boy Scout Troop. That Boy Scout  Troop experience did amazing things for Bob. It really did. It was life  changing for him because it allowed Bob to have success experiences, to  enjoy the outdoors, and to flourish with things that he really  developed a passion for.   As an 11-year-old younger brother, I lucked out. When mom and dad  took Bob back over a couple of valleys to the Scout Troop where he was  associated with--there was no Scout Troop in my hometown at the time--I  got to tag along. I was 11 years old, and I never looked back.   I have been involved in Scouting since I have been 11 years old. I  went on to achieve and earn my Eagle Scout Award. I have served as a  Chapter Chief and a Juniata Lodge Chief in the Monocan Lodge in the  Juniata Valley Council with the Order of the Arrow. I went on to be a  Scout Master for 30 years.   One of the hardest parts about coming to Congress was the fact that I  wasn't going to be home to be able to work with those youth leaders who  were leading the troop for Scout meetings, campouts, and events on the  weekend. That was the hardest part about taking this job because I had  been a Scout Master for almost 30 years. I had trained Scout Masters, I  was a course director, and I had served my council as a council  president.   I am still involved with Scouting. I was back at my old stomping  ground at the Seven Mountains Scout Camp in Spring Mills, Pennsylvania,  on Sunday for an Eagle Scout court of honor. Here is the cool part of  that: at that site over 70 years ago, my father-in-law received his  Eagle Scout Award. Now, I am not saying it should be a prerequisite for  picking out a wife that her dad is an Eagle Scout, but it worked out  okay for me. It wasn't a bad thing.   So Scouting has been a big part of our family. My wife, Penny, has  been a Cub Scout leader and a committee member, and, yes, a Scouting  widow when our three sons and I, at different times, would pack up and  go off to camp and High Adventure. Sometimes she would come along,  actually. A lot of times she was left at home. Unfortunately, she was  there to accept all the dirty laundry at the end of the weekend or the  week, but she is just as much a Scouting leader. When I think about a  great Scouting leader, my wife, Penny, comes to mind with what she has  done.   I enjoy the opportunities to go out to Eagle Scout courts of honor.  It really is a great opportunity to reconnect and to be a part of  Scouting. I enjoy going to Girl Scout Gold Awards as well. So when I go  there, normally I will look at the new Eagle Scout. I will talk about  how we are there to celebrate all the merit badges they have earned,  the citizenship that has been reflected in their actions, the character  that we have seen, and the service that they have provided that now  entitles them to be able to have that red, white, and blue piece of  ribbon with a piece of metal in the shape of an eagle hang from their  chest.   I also tell them they are ready for one last test question. I will  look them in the eye and say: It has been over 100 years since Scouting  came to these shores from England, where Scouting was first originated.  So the question I give them is: Over 100 years, how many Eagle Scout  Awards have been given away?   These kids are really smart. Somehow they are trying to do the math  in their head. I stop them, and I say: Whoa. Stop. This is a trick  question. The answer is zero. They have all been earned. None of them  has ever been given away.   I talk about how now, as new Eagle Scouts, they have this tool chest  that they carry with them. They don't carry it physically in their  hands; they carry it in here. And it really is the principles of  Scouting, because we stop and we start our meetings, we start our  meetings, we end our meetings, we do our campouts and our Scouts' own  worship services. We are always using and repeating the 12 points of  the Scout law and three parts of the Scout promise. We do that because  we want these boys who start out as young boys and become men to have  muscle memory.   Muscle memory is not just on the good days where it is easy things,  where things are going well and we are all celebrating and high-fiving  each other and life is good, but on the bad days. Bad days do come.  Life will be hard at times. We want them, especially in those times, to  be able to rely on that muscle memory of those principles of Scouting.   I talk about how in this Chamber we are here voting. The chairman  knows this. There are 435 of us. It is kind of interesting if you watch  how people make up their mind to vote. It is pretty diverse sometimes.  But for people like myself--I will take the liberty. I know this man  well. This gentleman right here, Mr. Sessions, is an Eagle Scout. I  fall back on the principles of Scouting.   I ask myself four questions when it comes time to vote. The first  question is: In the decision I am about to make, what is my duty to  God? Is the decision righteous according to God's Word and my faith?   Now, I said there are four questions. But if the answer is ``no'' on  the first one, I don't go on to two, three, and four. I stop right  there. If the answer is ``yes,'' then the next question is: In the  [[Page H4496]]  decision I am about to make, what is my duty to country? What does the  Constitution have to say about this decision that is before us?   The third question I ask is: In the decision I am about to make, what  is my duty to others?   Now, that one is a little harder because that is like: How does this  impact more than 730,000 citizens that I have the privilege and honor  to represent--16 counties, 24 percent of the landmass of Pennsylvania?   Finally, the last question is: What is my duty to self?   Now, for those who maybe it has been awhile since you have been  involved in the Scouting family or maybe you just never had that  opportunity, there is still time for everybody to get involved and  support Scouting. There are a lot of volunteer jobs out there that can  be filled. What we mean when we say duty to self, it is not self- serving. We define that by in every action we take and every decision  we make, we are prepared to do our best. That is a reflection of the  Scout motto and the Scout slogans. So those are principles as Eagle  Scouts I really do believe that, by that point, it becomes muscle  memory.   Any youth, for whatever period of time they have the opportunity to  serve in Scouting, we know based on the research division of the Boy  Scouts of America that it makes a difference in their lives.   I will finish up with this. I have said that, as a Scout Master for  30 years, I have seen this work its way out countless times, but let me  take a personal privilege and just mention three particular Eagle  Scouts: Parker, Logan, and Kale Thompson, my three sons. They are all  three Eagle Scouts. They are all adults now. They are scattered--if  anything, maybe one flaw is we made them too independent. They are now  flourishing, one in Elgin, Illinois; one in San Antonio, Texas; and one  in Trenton, New Jersey. Independent--I guess Scouting will do that. You  learn to fly as an Eagle Scout.   I will tell you what I have seen. Parker today is a great dad. What  he does with his two little guys, I see the lessons he learned in  Scouting that just come through in how he nourishes.   Logan, my second son, is a soldier. Although I worried about him, I  didn't worry as much when he was deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan  because I knew that, as an Eagle Scout, he could handle whatever came  to him.   My youngest, Kale, is a music teacher today who nourishes and just  serves youth, kids in middle school, and makes such a difference in  their lives.   In the lives of my three sons, I see how being a Boy Scout and an  Eagle Scout has made them better men and made them better in all the  roles that they serve.
