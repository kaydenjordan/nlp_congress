 Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), the leader of the Republican  Conference.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his  tremendous leadership on this important legislation this morning.   I am proud to rise in support of enacting tax reform, tax relief to  millions of Americans. We have been waiting a long time, more than 30  years. And while everything else has changed over 30 years, our Tax  Code, unfortunately, has only gotten old, outdated, bigger, and more  complicated. It has become a burden, a burden that we are going to  lift.   Now, there are some defenders of the status quo who think that the  Tax Code is just fine. Well, that is not what the American people sent  us here to do, to defend the status quo. We are here to do the big  things.   Our plan rewrites the Tax Code to put American families first,  including families who have children with disabilities. For these  families, who may have saved for their son's or daughter's college  tuition, which is no longer needed, our plan carries on the legacy of  the ABLE Act by allowing them to roll over from a 529 account to a 529A  account, an ABLE account, to pay for things like medical bills or  workforce development instead.   With this bill, we are making it easier for everyone to reach their  full potential. We are lifting the tax burden for everyday, hardworking  Americans. An extra $1,182 for middle-income families in places likes  eastern Washington could make all the difference between living  paycheck to paycheck and saving for retirement or making that car  payment.   Mr. Speaker, this is a historic moment, and I urge all of my  colleagues to join me on the right side of history by voting in favor  of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts. Let's help our hardworking men and women  all across this country.
