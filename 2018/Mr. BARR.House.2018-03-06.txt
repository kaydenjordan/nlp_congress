 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2226) to amend the Truth in Lending Act to provide a safe  harbor from certain requirements related to qualified mortgages for  residential mortgage loans held on an originating depository  institution's portfolio, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2226         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H1390]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Portfolio Lending and       Mortgage Access Act''.       SEC. 2. MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS.         Section 129C(b) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C.       1639c(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(4) Safe harbor.--        ``(A) In general.--A residential mortgage loan shall be       deemed a qualified mortgage loan for purposes of this       subsection if the loan--        ``(i) is originated by, and continuously retained in the       portfolio of, a covered institution;        ``(ii) is in compliance with the limitations with respect       to prepayment penalties described in subsections (c)(1) and       (c)(3);        ``(iii) is in compliance with the requirements related to       points and fees under paragraph (2)(A)(vii);        ``(iv) does not have negative amortization terms or       interest-only terms; and        ``(v) is a loan for which the covered institution       considers, documents, and verifies the debt, income, and       financial resources of the consumer in accordance with       subparagraph (C).        ``(B) Exception for certain transfers.--Subparagraph (A)       shall not apply to a residential mortgage loan if the legal       title to such residential mortgage loan is sold, assigned, or       otherwise transferred to another person unless the legal       title to such residential mortgage loan is sold, assigned, or       otherwise transferred--        ``(i) to another person by reason of the bankruptcy or       failure of the covered institution that originated such loan;        ``(ii) to an insured depository institution or insured       credit union that has less than $10,000,000,000 in total       consolidated assets on the date of such sale, assignment, or       transfer, if the loan is retained in portfolio by such       insured depository institution or insured credit union;        ``(iii) pursuant to a merger of the covered institution       that originated such loan with another person or the       acquisition of a the covered institution that originated such       loan by another person or of another person by a covered       institution, if the loan is retained in portfolio by the       person to whom the loan is sold, assigned, or otherwise       transferred; or        ``(iv) to a wholly owned subsidiary of the covered       institution that originated such loan if the loan is       considered to be an asset of such covered institution for       regulatory accounting purposes.        ``(C) Consideration and documentation requirements.--The       consideration and documentation requirements described in       subparagraph (A)(v) shall--        ``(i) not be construed to require compliance with, or       documentation in accordance with, appendix Q to part 1026 of       title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor       regulation; and        ``(ii) be construed to permit multiple methods of       documentation.        ``(D) Definitions.--In this paragraph--        ``(i) the term `covered institution' means an insured       depository institution or an insured credit union that,       together with its affiliates, has less than $10,000,000,000       in total consolidated assets on the date on the origination       of a residential mortgage loan;        ``(ii) the term `insured credit union' has the meaning       given the term in section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act       (12 U.S.C. 1752);        ``(iii) the term `insured depository institution' has the       meaning given the term in section 3 of the Federal Deposit       Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813);        ``(iv) the term `interest-only term' means a term of a       residential mortgage loan that allows one or more of the       periodic payments made under the loan to be applied solely to       accrued interest and not to the principal of the loan; and        ``(v) the term `negative amortization term' means a term of       a residential mortgage loan under which the payment of       periodic payments will result in an increase in the principal       of the loan.''    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2226, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access  Act, represents a very simple solution to a significant policy  challenge facing our economy: how to expand access to mortgage credit  without replicating the accumulation of excess risk in the mortgage- backed securities market like we witnessed in the run-up to the 2008  financial crisis.   My legislation achieves both goals by extending the qualified  mortgage legal safe harbor to small creditors, banks, and credit unions  with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less, that originate  and hold residential mortgage loans in portfolio, rather than selling  or securitizing them, allowing those lenders to satisfy Dodd-Frank's  ability-to-repay rule.   Such a policy would actually incentivize private sector risk  retention--a goal of the Dodd-Frank Act itself--and mark a return to  relationship lending in which a bank or credit union can tailor  products to a consumer's needs and credit risk, without running afoul  of one-size-fits-all government requirements. Under CFPB regulations,  only government-defined qualified mortgages enjoy a presumption that a  lender has satisfied the Dodd-Frank law's ability-to-repay  requirements.   Small banks and credit unions have been disproportionately impacted  by these rules, given their reliance upon residential mortgage lending  and greater involvement in small dollar or balloon loans that run afoul  of current QM regulations. It is no surprise that Harvard researchers  have found that, since Dodd-Frank's passage, community banks have lost  market share at a rate double that experienced between 2006 and 2010, a  period including the entirety of the financial crisis. It is also not a  surprise that many small community financial institutions have  testified in front of the House Financial Services Committee and to  many of my colleagues that they have simply left the mortgage business  altogether because of the difficulties associated with the QM rule as  currently constructed.   Indeed, a third of the National Association of Realtors survey  respondents reported being unable to close mortgages due to a  requirement of the qualified mortgage rule. Residential mortgages were  the product or service most often identified by surveyed banks as a  candidate for discontinuation as a result of Dodd-Frank. A recent study  by the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University  documents the falling share of bank participation in mortgage  originations.   Everyone agrees, especially after the 2008 financial crisis, that a  borrower should be required to show a demonstrable ability to repay.  The only question is: Who is in the best position to make that  determination--a community banker with a professional and, perhaps,  even a personal relationship with the borrower who has full view of  that borrower's character, creditworthiness, financial situation, and  who is willing to assume 100 percent of the downside risk of default;  or is it an unaccountable, unelected bureaucrat in Washington, D.C.,  who literally knows absolutely nothing about that borrower?   By bearing 100 percent of the risk, financial institutions have every  incentive to make sure that a borrower can afford to repay a loan.  Banks and credit unions would have more than just skin in the game.  Under this legislation, their interests would align perfectly with that  of a borrower.   As one witness in front of our committee testified: ``A financial  institution that retains a loan's credit and interest-rate risk has a  keen interest in engaging in thorough, sound underwriting to determine  the borrower's ability to repay. Allowing a financial institution to  make a customer-specific lending decision on a loan it intends to hold  in its portfolio can be a more effective way of protecting consumers  than regulatory attempts to micromanage mortgage terms with inflexible  standards.''   No less than Barney Frank, former chairman of the committee, endorsed  this concept in a hearing before this committee, saying he ``would like  the main safeguard against bad loans to be risk retention, because that  leaves the decision in the hands of whoever is making the loan,'' the  CFPB also, itself, acknowledged this key point in its own rulemaking,  where it recognized that portfolio lenders ``have strong incentives to  carefully consider whether a consumer will be able to repay a portfolio  loan at least in part because the small creditor retains the risk of  default.''   This legislation also presents a viable alternative to the  ``originate to distribute'' mortgage lending model that contributed to  the subprime mortgage meltdown and bubble in residential real estate  and taxpayer bailouts. The  [[Page H1391]]  result is expanded access to mortgage credit without additional risk to  the financial system or to the taxpayer.   In fact, this is particularly important for young families and first- time home buyers, who tend to have difficulty meeting the ability-to- repay requirements due to circumstances, such as significant student  loan debt, but who are otherwise creditworthy.   I have been working on this legislation for 5 years now, and I am  happy to announce that, this year, we had a bipartisan breakthrough.  That is because, at the committee markup, I offered an amendment that  limited the scope of this bill to financial institutions with less than  $10 billion in assets. And my distinguished colleague, Representative  Capuano, offered a technical amendment that enhanced the legislation by  clarifying a few key provisions. I am pleased to report that,  because of those two amendments, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage  Access Act passed with unanimous support in the committee and is now on  the floor today for consideration.    I want to thank Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters,  Representative Capuano, the Kentucky Bankers Association, the Kentucky  Credit Union League, the American Bankers Association, the Independent  Community Bankers of America, the Credit Union National Association,  the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, the National  Association of Home Builders, and the United States Chamber of Commerce  for their hard work on this important legislation.   If passed by the House, it is my hope that the Portfolio Lending and  Mortgage Access Act moves quickly through the Senate. Eleven of our  Democratic colleagues in the upper Chamber support this exact language,  which is in Chairman Crapo's community financial institution relief  bill. Together, Republicans and Democrats can deliver on the regulatory  relief that many of us in this body have promised to our constituents  that will enable more of them to buy the home of their dreams.   Madam Speaker, I invite all of my colleagues to vote for this  important pro-homeownership legislation that perfectly aligns lender  and borrower interests to the benefit of America.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Kildee), for his constructive comments, his support. And the  gentleman is absolutely correct. He engaged with me and my colleagues  who were cosponsoring this legislation in a very constructive manner.  He made valuable contributions, along with Mr. Capuano and the ranking  member. Several other members on the other side of the aisle, Mr.  Perlmutter, for example, offered his thoughtful comments as well. I  appreciate the support, the bipartisan support, working through a  compromise to get this legislation to where  [[Page H1392]]  it is today, so I thank the gentleman for that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Emmer), who is also a sponsor of this legislation and a distinguished  member of the Committee on Financial Services.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), who is also, I believe, a sponsor of the  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, let me just reiterate that this legislation solves two  problems. It solves the problem of responsible expansion of access to  mortgage credit, access to that American Dream of home ownership; and,  at the same time, preventing the mistakes that led to the 2008  financial crisis, the originate to distribute model where originators  of mortgages had no skin in the game and they allowed those mortgages  to be poorly underwritten or not underwritten at all, with no  documentation, and then securitized and sold into the secondary market,  really without any eye towards the consumer and the borrower's ability  to repay.   Everybody in this institution, as evidenced by the bipartisan work  here, we all recognize that a borrower should demonstrate an ability to  repay that loan, but the crux of this legislation, at the core of this  legislation is a recognition that a local community banker, a local  credit union, a lender with a personal relationship with a borrower is  in the best position to determine whether or not that borrower, that  prospective homeowner, can repay that loan.   When there is risk retention, when that lender is charged with the  responsibility of maintaining that loan in portfolio, the lender is  much more incentivized to properly underwrite that loan and make sure  that that customer, that borrower, that future homeowner, has a  demonstrable ability to repay. I think it is a much better substitute  to a one-size-fits-all credit box from, frankly, bureaucrats in  Washington, D.C., who have no eye towards the creditworthiness of that  particular borrower.   We have worked with our friends on the other side of the aisle to  make this a bipartisan piece of legislation limiting the size of the  institutions that can access this regulatory relief. But, clearly, when  community financial institutions, bankers from around the country,  every part of the country, are saying that they see the QM rule as not  ``qualified mortgages,'' but as ``quitting mortgages;'' and when we see  an  [[Page H1393]]  unnecessary constraint of mortgage credit; and when the National  Association of Realtors are reporting that they are unable to close  mortgages due to this onerous qualified mortgage rule, clearly the  pendulum has swung too far.   So, yes, we needed some reforms in the aftermath of the financial  crisis. This QM rule went too far. This is a recalibration of that. And  this is important regulatory relief for our community financial  institutions that will inure to the benefit of the American home-buying  public, and it will do so in a responsible way, providing a viable  alternative to the originate to distribute practices that really led to  the financial crisis.   Madam Speaker, let me just make one final observation, and that is to  give credit to the administration. The Department of the Treasury, in  their findings and recommendations in their report on banks and credit  unions, they recognized that this was a problem in the mortgage lending  space and they made a recommendation also to increase the portfolio  lending safe harbor to institutions with $10 billion in assets or  lower; and that, as they argued, will accommodate loans made and  retained by small depository institutions, provide that needed  regulatory relief to our community financial institutions, and also  expand access to mortgage credit in a responsible way.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support. At this time  I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4725) to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require  short form call reports for certain depository institutions.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 4725         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Community Bank Reporting       Relief Act''.       SEC. 2. SHORT FORM CALL REPORTS.         Section 7(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12       U.S.C. 1817(a)) is amended by adding at the end the       following:        ``(12) Short form reporting.--        ``(A) In general.--The appropriate Federal banking agencies       shall issue regulations that allow for a reduced reporting       requirement for a covered depository institution when the       institution makes the first and third report of condition for       a year, as required under paragraph (3).        ``(B) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term `covered       depository institution' means an insured depository       institution that--        ``(i) has less than $5,000,000,000 in total consolidated       assets; and        ``(ii) satisfies such other criteria as the appropriate       Federal banking agencies determine appropriate.''.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise today in support of H.R. 4725, the Community Bank Reporting  Relief Act.   Community banks were hit hard by the Great Recession and the ensuing  regulations. Numerous bankers have told me they are spending more and  more money and resources and time on compliance costs and less money  and resources on actually providing services to customers. This is  particularly alarming because these small banks are so critical to  their communities. From sponsoring the local T-ball team, to lending  money to a farmer for the next year's crop, to helping the single mom  purchase a used car so she can get to work, these banks are involved at  every level of our communities all across America, but because of  overregulation, these banks are rapidly closing and consolidating.   Unfortunately, the headline for banks in the Commonwealth of Kentucky  is no different. Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank financial  control law, we have seen a 20 percent drop in the number of banks in  our State and there has been a dearth of charters for new banks. In  fact, since 2010, there have been only a few de novo charters for banks  nationwide.   Now, some people say that consolidation and mergers have been a long- term trend for the last 30 years and, therefore, not related to the  recent uptick in regulations unrelated to Dodd-Frank, but they are  clearly not seeing the bigger picture, because even after mergers, many  branches in rural and other underserved communities are closing,  leaving many Kentuckians to drive a town or two over just to get to the  nearest bank.   It is not just about a long-term trend of consolidation. There have  been literally no new charters, whereas before the Dodd-Frank law was  enacted, there were many, many new charters every year; and since the  Dodd-Frank law was enacted, no new charters. So the consolidation trend  has gotten a lot worse since this avalanche of red tape coming out of  Washington, D.C., and that is having a very negative impact on rural  and underserved American communities.   While new technologies are helping bring banking services to anyone  with an internet connection, many people still prefer the personal one- on-one banking style that they grew up with and the personal  interaction often that helps the banks themselves understand the exact  needs of their customers.                                time  1400    The Dodd-Frank law was almost 2,300 pages and required dozens of  agencies to create new regulations or revise existing ones. As a  result, these agencies issued hundreds of regulations and, according to  the Mercatus Center, the law placed about 28,000 new restrictions on  the banking industry, effectively doubling the number of regulatory  restrictions in title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulation to more than  52,000.   Although not part of the Dodd-Frank rush of regulations, a growing  number of banks have cited the Federal Financial Institutions  Examination Council's, or FFIEC, Consolidated Reports of Condition and  Income--or call reports, as they are commonly called--as too  burdensome.   Each quarter, all national banks, State member banks, insured State  nonmember banks, and savings associations are required to file these  call reports. The reports contain approximately 50 pages of financial  data on each bank, including their assets, liabilities, capital  accounts, expenses, and income. However, these reports are very  burdensome for community banks with limited resources and offer little  value to the regulators relative to the last quarter's report.   Thankfully, H.R. 4725, the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act, is  fighting back against the bureaucratic nightmare of complying with  these 52,000 restrictions by allowing banks with less than $5 billion  in consolidated assets to file their call reports every 6 months as  opposed to every 3 months.   The impact of this regulatory change will be a huge development for  banks across the country. Now they will spend less time on call reports  and more time on actually helping customers. This means more capital  will be flowing into our local economies, spurring job growth and  economic development, while making a real difference in the lives of  Americans trying to access affordable capital to buy a new home or car  or start a business.   I want to thank my good friend from Illinois, Congressman Randy  Hultgren, for his leadership and for introducing this important  legislation. Due to his leadership, this great community bank bill is  being considered as a suspension on the floor today. That means that  there is a great chance that this bill will build on its unanimous  support earned during the House Financial Services Committee markup and  will be a bipartisan provision in the Senate Banking chairman's  Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which  is expected to pass out of the Senate very soon.  [[Page H1394]]    In addition to Congressman Hultgren, I want to thank Chairman  Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters for their hard work on this  critical legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4725,  the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the sponsor of the legislation  and the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me once again thank the gentleman from Illinois for his tireless  advocacy on behalf of our community financial institutions and  providing some commonsense, basic relief to those institutions so that,  instead of dealing with paperwork, they could actually better serve  their customers and grow our local economies.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  [[Page H1395]]  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4768) to require the President to develop a national strategy to  combat the financial networks of transnational organized criminals, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4768, the National  Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal  Organizations Act.   I want to, at the outset, applaud and thank my colleague Mr. Kustoff  from Tennessee for his leadership on this important legislation and for  bringing this solution to the Congress and this solution to the  American people.   As Members of Congress, our number one responsibility is the national  security and the well-being of the American people. Unfortunately,  transnational criminal organizations threaten the safety of Americans,  and we must do  [[Page H1396]]  everything in our power to stop them. Transnational criminal  organizations, or TCOs as they are called for short, are engaged in  illegal business ventures around the world such as money laundering,  cybercrime, and the trafficking of drugs, weapons, endangered species,  and even human beings.   While TCOs may not be motivated by a particular radical, political,  or religions ideology, they are motivated by money, and they will stop  at nothing to get it. According to a 2011 report published by the Obama  administration, entitled, ``Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized  Crime,'' TCOs have dramatically ramped up their size, scope, and  influence, and are even teaming up with terrorist organizations and  corrupt foreign officials to expand their networks and conceal their  illicit financial assets.   These TCOs cost the Western Hemisphere about 3.5 percent of gross  domestic product annually, and they generate for themselves around $870  billion, which is roughly the value of the world's largest company,  Apple.   President Trump, on February 9, 2017, issued Executive Order 13773 on  ``Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal  Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking.''                                time  1415    It states that TCOs in the form of transnational drug cartels have a  stronghold in America and threaten the safety of the American people.  From former President Obama to current President Trump, TCOs are  recognized as a major risk to national security. That is why I am very  pleased to see that my good friend from Tennessee, Congressman  David  Kustoff, has introduced H.R. 4768, the National Strategy for Combating  the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act.   This legislation requires the President, the Treasury Secretary,  financial regulators, and other appropriate officials to create a  national strategy to combat TCOs and their illicit use of financial  networks. Specifically, the legislation requires them to identify and  assess the largest TCO threats to the United States. It also mandates  that the strategy include the identification of the people or groups  that facilitate access to financial networks for the TCOs through  laundering assets, such as, real estate, art and antiquities, smuggling  bulk cash, exploitation of shell companies, and the use of covert  cryptocurrencies and other cyber technologies.   The legislation also requires the strategy to include long-term and  short-term goals, an explanation of how goals will be integrated into  existing national security apparatuses, and, if needed, suggest  legislative and regulatory changes to better fight against TCOs.   This legislation passed the House Committee on Financial Services  with unanimous support in January, and it is my hope that it passes  with unanimous support today on the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to Congressman Kustoff, I thank Chairman  Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters for their hard work on this issue.  Together we can, in a bipartisan way, empower our government to better  fight transnational criminal organizations, making the American people  safer and our economy stronger.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4768, the National  Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal  Organizations Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), a member of the House Financial Services  Committee and a former United States Attorney from the Western District  of Tennessee, who has brought considerable prosecutorial experience in  drafting and authoring this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North  [[Page H1398]]  Carolina (Mr. Budd), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I, once again, thank my colleagues for supporting this legislation.  In particular, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff) for  his leadership on this issue.   I would note, also, in addition to all of the many sound and  persuasive arguments that have been offered for why we need this  legislation, this National Strategy for Combating the Financing of  Transnational Criminal Organizations Act, the National Fraternal Order  of Police has endorsed this legislation, and I include in the Record  their letter.                                                  National Fraternal                                                 Order of Police,                                  Washington, DC, February 15, 2018.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Representatives McCarthy, Pelosi, and       Hoyer: I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal       Order of Police to advise you of our support for H.R. 4768,       the ``National Strategy for Combatting the Financing of       Transnational Criminal Organizations Act.''        The Office of National Drug Control Policy was established       to set out our strategy in combatting our nation's drug       problem. Similarly, the Office of Community Oriented Policing       Services has served as the cornerstone for our nation's       crime-fighting efforts for more than two decades. With the       growing threat posed by transnational criminal organizations,       it is important that we adopt a comprehensive national       approach.        President Donald J. Trump took the first step by issuing       Executive Order #13773, the Enforcing Federal Law with       Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and       Preventing International Trafficking a year ago. The Threat       Mitigation Working Group was set up to bring Federal agencies       together a common goal of investigating, prosecuting and       dismantling transnational gangs.        This bill would codify part of this Executive Order by       developing a national strategy for combatting transnational       criminal organizations. We need to attack their ability to       profit from unlawful activity-whether it is money laundering,       bulk cash smuggling, shell companies or digital currencies.       Simply put, until we can stop the flow of criminal profits to       these organized, unlawful enterprises, they will continue to       survive no matter how many individuals we arrest and       prosecute.        On behalf of the more than 335,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, we believe this bill will make our country       safe from these transnational criminal organizations. If I       can provide any additional information, please do not       hesitate to contact me or my Senior Advisor, Jim Pasco, in my       Washington office.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,                                                National President.     Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress representing a State  that has been ravaged by heroin and opioid addiction, I can't think of  a more important thing for this Congress to do than to develop a  national strategy for combating these transnational gangs that are  preying on our communities.   Once again, I commend Mr. Kustoff for his leadership in this area and  in this effort and in this fight. I applaud my colleagues for  supporting the legislation on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
