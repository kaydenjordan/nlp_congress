 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in opposition to H.R. 21.   A top U.S. security priority must be energy independence in  perpetuity.   We know high oil prices hit working families hard. Last year, the  Biden administration rightly released oil from the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve, and oil prices dropped $1.69 a gallon in my area.   Unfortunately, the bill we had debated adds layers of bureaucracy-- four agencies and departments thick--limiting our progress to stabilize  prices.   America must have an all-of-the-above energy profile. Here is yet  another handout to Big Oil. It forces the leasing of additional lands  to oil companies while vast amounts of current federally leased land  sites are already going unused.   Leasing land is not the same as production.   H.R. 21 would hamstring our ability to protect people and companies  from spiking gasoline prices.   I fought hard to save the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when others  here tried to decommission it. American energy security means national  independence. We should settle for no less.                            ____________________
