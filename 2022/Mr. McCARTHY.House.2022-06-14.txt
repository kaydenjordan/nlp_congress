 Madam Speaker, after three unanimous consent requests  of mine that were blocked, Congress will finally vote to provide  Supreme Court Justices and their families with more security.   I am glad this bill is coming to the floor as is. The Senate passed  it unanimously, 100-0, more than a month ago. Madam Speaker, the House  Democrats have delayed it for more than a month.   The question the American public asks is why? Why would you delay it?   We have all known that additional security has been necessary since  the Dobbs opinion was leaked last month. Justice Kavanaugh was targeted  by an armed and dangerous man who flew clear across the country to kill  him. He had zip ties. He had a plan.   Far-left groups have plans to target Justice Amy Coney Barrett and  her children. They put out where their children go to school. But  Congress kept it here for a month--for a month. These unnecessary  delays put the safety of the Justices and their families in danger.   By passing the bill as is, we are sending a clear message to the  leftwing radicals: You cannot intimidate the Supreme Court Justices. I  hope we all take that message to heart.   How can we forget what Senator Schumer said? He didn't just say it-- he screamed it--on the steps of the Supreme Court. ``You will pay the  price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful  decisions.''   I don't know what he meant by, ``You will pay the price,'' because  the Supreme Court Justices aren't up for an election. It couldn't be  that they would lose at the polls. They are lifetime appointments.   Now, I don't know if that young man who came all the way from  California to kill a Justice, if that is what he thought Schumer was  saying, but what was he saying, ``You will pay the price''?   I hope Senator Schumer understands that his words have consequences.  I believe he should apologize for contributing to this heated climate.   With that said, again, I am glad this bill is finally coming to the  floor. It should not have been this hard or taken this long. Every  single person in the Senate voted for it: Republican, Democrat,  Independent. It sat here for a whole month. Even though we came  [[Page H5494]]  to the floor and asked for unanimous consent to bring it forward, we  were denied.   It should not have taken a threat against Justice Kavanaugh to force  action, a threat that even Speaker Pelosi dismissed in her press  conference. She said, ``Everybody will be fine.''   But at the end of the day, this is the better bill, and I am glad it  will be heading to the President's desk without any poison pills to  ping it back to the Senate, to delay it further. This is a big victory.   Now, let's work to defend our justice system for everyone by  upholding the rule of law which is under attack daily in our cities. We  can't uphold the rule of law when there is looting, when cities and  police stations are being burned down, when criminals are coddled  instead of locked up.   Now that this Congress has come together to condemn intimidation  against Supreme Court Justices, let's take the next step to keep  America safe. Let's support our police, not defund them. Let's enforce  all the laws on the books like the law that prohibits protesting  outside Justices' homes. Even President Biden encouraged people to do  that.   Let's get tough on crime so that every American can feel safe in  their homes and in their communities. Just in my home State, back in  the home city of our Speaker, San Francisco, the people had a big  voice. They have just recalled their district attorney because of  crime.   It is not for me to give any political advice to the other side of  the aisle, but if you want to know what the Republican registration in  San Francisco is, it is 6.8 percent. I think your message of defunding  the police by this majority party, and I think your message of not  upholding the law, the American public doesn't want that.   They want to feel safe, just as a Supreme Court Justice does. They  want to be able to go do their jobs and not feel they are being  intimidated.   Let's get tough on crime. We want the American public to feel safe in  their homes and their communities. They want to feel safe. Those are  the things that would create a safer, stronger America, just like we  had before.   I will make this one promise. If Democrats don't do it during this  Congress, I promise you we will in the next Congress, because there is  definitely going to be a change.                            ____________________
