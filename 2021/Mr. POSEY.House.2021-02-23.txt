 Mr. Speaker, I have been reading the COVID ``unrelated''  relief bill. At least when President Trump was borrowing money to keep  the economy from crashing, he was creating jobs, making America energy  independent--lowering gasoline and fuel prices for every American  family--lowering unemployment, protecting our borders, rebuilding our  military, and so on.   Now, however, with the assistance of this Chamber, this  administration is doing just the opposite.   It sounds like something right from the pages of Saul Alinsky's book,  ``Rules for Radicals,'' how malcontents propose to destroy America.   This COVID ``unrelated'' relief bill is more about keeping America  closed and funding liberal policies than getting past this virus, and  it is outrageous.                            ____________________
