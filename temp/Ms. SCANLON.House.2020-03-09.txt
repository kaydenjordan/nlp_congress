 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2877) to add Ireland to the E-3 nonimmigrant visa program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2877         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. E-3 VISAS FOR IRISH NATIONALS.

(b) Employer Requirements.--Section 212 of the Immigration       and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182) is amended--        (1) by redesignating the second subsection (t) (as added by       section 1(b)(2)(B) of Public Law 108-449 (118 Stat. 3470)) as       subsection (u); and        (2) by adding at the end of subsection (t)(1) (as added by       section 402(b)(2) of Public Law 108-77 (117 Stat. 941)) the       following:        ``(E) In the case of an attestation filed with respect to a       national of Ireland described in section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii),       the employer is, and will remain during the period of       authorized employment of such Irish national, a participant       in good standing in the E-Verify program described in section       403(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant       Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1324a note).''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2877, a bill to add Ireland to  the E-3 nonimmigrant visa program.   In 2005, soon after the United States and Australia finalized the  Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, Congress created the E-3 visa  program. That program provides up to 10,500 temporary visas for  Australian nationals who are pre-approved by U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services to work in a specialty occupation for a sponsoring  United States employer.   A specialty occupation is one that requires the theoretical and  practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge in  fields such as science, engineering, and research and development in  emerging technologies. Since the program's inception, Australia has  only ever used a fraction of the 10,500 E-3 visas that are available  each year. For example, in fiscal year 2019, only 5,800 E-3 visas were  issued to Australian nationals.   H.R. 2877 does not increase the number of visas that may be issued,  but instead allows Irish nationals to use any unused visas. That bill  would take the number of E-3 visas that are left unused by Australia in  a given fiscal year and make that same number of visas available to  Irish nationals the following fiscal year.   This is a commonsense bill that recognizes the important bond we  share with two of our country's closest and most steadfast allies. This  bill is not controversial, and, in fact, passed the House by voice vote  in 2018 when my Republican colleagues held the majority in this  Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my friend, Mr. Neal, chairman of the  Committee on Ways and Means, for continuing to champion this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2877, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I would urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
