 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for  yielding me time.   Madam Speaker, keeping our elections safe from cyberattacks and fraud  is not and should not be a partisan priority.   H.R. 2722 has been rushed to the House floor without giving the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee the opportunity to hold even a  single hearing on the bill or the subject matter.   The problem with rushing this bill through Congress is that it will  have a significant negative impact on NIST's ability to work with State  and local governments to identify standards and best practices for  election security.   Our priority in Congress should be to develop useful tools that  empower States and local officials to ensure their elections are  secure, accessible, and accurate.   In fact, our secretary of state in Indiana, Ms. Connie Lawson, has  done a remarkable job leading the effort to add safeguards to our  elections process, ensuring it is completed with integrity.   Given the opportunity, I believe that our committee could come to an  agreement, in a bipartisan manner, to update NIST's election and  security activities.   Congress should focus on legislation that provides much-needed  improvements and reinforcements for local officials without  overstepping the States' authority to maintain their elections.   Madam Speaker, because of the lack of following regular order, the  committee has never been given the opportunity to ensure those issues  are addressed.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment thereto, and  concur in the Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill passed the Senate  with 84 votes and could be sent to the President's desk for his  signature today.
