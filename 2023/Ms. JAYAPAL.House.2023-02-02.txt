 Madam Speaker, this is a revenge resolution.   It is a revenge resolution that seeks to remove Representative Ilhan  Omar's strong and necessary voice from the Foreign Affairs Committee.   It is an attempt to silence her simply because you do not agree with  her views and you cannot begin to understand her lived experience as a  war survivor, as a refugee, and as somebody who brings an experience to  this body that you are not even trying to understand.   We have previously voted, in a bipartisan manner, to remove  individuals from their committee assignments because of their violent  actions that endanger the safety of their colleagues.   That is not what today is about. Today is about revenge. It is also  about the fact that Republicans want to distract the American people  from the fact that they have absolutely no legislation to bring to the  floor that is actually about helping the American people with their  costs, with dealing with inflation.   You don't have any solutions, so you are trying to distract with  these inane, insulting, absurd--absolutely absurd--resolutions.   Vote ``no.''
