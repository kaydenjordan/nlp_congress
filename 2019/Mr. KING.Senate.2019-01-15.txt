 Madam President, today I wish to recognize Mr. Ted  Ames, of Stonington, ME, as he retires from the board of directors for  Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries, MCCF. Ted has been a lifelong  member of the Maine fishing community, and his knowledge and expertise  will be missed by the board of MCCF. Maine fishing communities and our  entire State are proud of Ted's work and we wish him all the best in  his retirement.   Ted was born and raised on Vinalhaven, one of the many vibrant island  communities off the coast of Maine. Like so many before him, Ted has  the ocean in his blood; he spent more than three decades as the captain  of two boats, the F/V Mary Elizabeth and F/V Dorothy M., fishing for  groundfish, scallops, and lobster. Ted was an early member of the  Stonington Fisheries Alliance and then founded and served on the board  of the Penobscot East Resource Center in Stonington, which is now the  Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries. Ted also founded and directed the  Zone C Lobster Hatchery in Stonington. He is the former executive  director of the Maine Gillnetters Association and a member of the Maine  Marine Resources Committee to Establish a Lobster Zone Management Plan.   Not only did Ted have a long career as a fisherman, but he also  taught at the University of Maine and Mt. Desert Island High School,  educating the next generation about chemistry, biochemistry, and  environmental science. Ted has a M.S. in biochemistry with a specialty  in tissue culture and 6 years of research experience; he has won  numerous recognitions including the 2005 MacArthur Foundation's Genius  Award, Monmouth University's 2007 ``Champion of the Oceans'' Award, and  was named a visiting coastal studies scholar at Bowdoin College in  2010. In 2007, he was the Geddes W. Simpson Distinguished Lecturer at  the University of Maine for his work at the intersection of science and  history.   Ted's career clearly shows his passion for ensuring that the  tradition of fishing is preserved for generations to come. Ted has  worked to restore cod, haddock, and flounder in the eastern Gulf of  Maine, working with the Maine Department of Marine Resources to conduct  interviews with retired fishermen, map historical stock distributions,  and publish a paper that helped provide the scientific evidence that  would explain the depletion of the fish in the area.   Ted has served his community and the State of Maine for many years in  so many ways, and we are lucky to call him one of our own. While we  will miss Ted's wisdom, knowledge, and work ethic at MCCF, we wish him  and his wife Robin Alden nothing but the best in this new  chapter.                            ____________________
