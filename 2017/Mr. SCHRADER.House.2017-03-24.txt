 Mr. Speaker, after all these late nights and backroom  deals, here we are. This version of the bill was just dropped on our  lap this morning, so we ought to take a careful look at what is in  front of us.   First of all, the bill defunds access to preventative health care and  wellness. All the programs that we made progress on will be gone.   It shortchanges the Medicare trust fund. Seniors might be paying  thousands more than they are now to get the care they need.   It returns us to a system with skimpy benefits without serious  coverage for maternity care and mental health.   Most dramatically, the bill dismantles the Medicaid system as we know  it, which has been a success across much of the country.   In Oregon, children and families finally have access to care that  fits their needs. People living with disabilities are leading  productive lives now. Hospitalizations and emergency room visits have  been cut in half, and costs are down.   We are all going to do this--take health care away from 24 million  Americans, 14 million just this next year--and not going to save any  more money than under the original ACA?   Look, I know there are parts of the ACA that need fixing. While  millions of people got coverage for the first time, premiums are still  too high in the individual market. That is only 5 percent.   Vote ``no'' on this bill, and let's make the system better.                                time  1330
