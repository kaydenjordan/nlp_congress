 Mr. Speaker, I have just seen a news report that the  President may invade Syria with ground troops.   Now, I criticized former President Obama for his actions in Libya,  Iraq, and Syria, without seeking authorization from Congress, and  leaning on the weak need that these were somehow authorized back in the  AUMF after 9/11. This is far beyond the scope of that resolution, which  I helped write, so to have a ground invasion of Syria, without  authorization from Congress, will trigger the War Powers Act.   Let's be clear: The Constitution says, once we are at war, the  President runs the war as Commander in Chief. But it is only the United  States Congress that has the power to declare war, authorize war, which  this essentially would be.   So the President must come to the Congress and ask for a new  Authorization for Use of Military Force before launching any ground  invasion of Syria.                            ____________________
