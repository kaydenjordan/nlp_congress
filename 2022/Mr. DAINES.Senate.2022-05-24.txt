 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Mike DeVries of Fergus County as Montanan of the Month for  his dedication to serving his community and his courage during the  Denton fire this past December.   Mike joined the volunteer fire department shortly after moving to  Denton with his family back in 2004 and has been loyal to the  department and community ever since, serving as chief for 11 years.   On December 1, 2021, Mike's love of his community and resolute  leadership was on full display. As the West Wind fire tore through the  town of Denton, Mike acted swiftly to maintain incident command and  ensure the safety of his firefighters and members of the Denton  community.   As Montana suffered a terrible fire season in 2021, Mike not only  coordinated aid and resources, he showed care and compassion to his  fellow residents of Denton and the surrounding area.   He met with folks who were impacted by the fires and connected  personally with all the local firefighters and community members who  showed up to help.   Serving as the Denton fire chief is just one of the ways Mike gives  back to his community. He is also on the elder board of the Denton  Bible Church and has served several terms on the town council.   As a volunteer fire chief, he has spent countless hours training,  traveling, and managing the department.   His son Joel says that Mike is held in high regard by other  firefighters as he works to build relationships between Denton and  surrounding departments.   While Mike is quick to give credit to his crew, he deserves  recognition for his leadership during the 2021 fire season, loyalty to  the Denton Fire Department, and compassion for his community.  [[Page S2657]]    Mike, keep up the great work. You do make Montana proud.                          Tribute to Karen Pfaehler    Mr. President, today, I have the honor of recognizing a staff member  who has turned into family over the years.   Karen Pfaehler is truly one of a kind. She has set the standard for  constituent recognitions in Montana, and now it is my turn to recognize  her as she retires after many years of service to Montana.   Karen got her bachelor's degree in elementary education and  psychology and was hired to work as a military aerospace program  manager and contract analyst in Denver, CO.   As fate would have it, she met the love of her life, Gus Pfaehler, at  a sales convention.   They moved to Hong Kong for his work and lived there for many years.  Later, while living in Bangkok, Karen volunteered and ran the charity  division of the American Women's Club. The organization's philanthropic  arm gave donations, mostly to Peace Corps volunteers and orphanages.   Karen also enjoyed entertaining Ambassadors and dignitaries for  various functions and events.   It was in Hong Kong that Karen and her husband raised their daughter  Jaclyn, the pride of their lives.   After their time in Bangkok came to a close, they moved stateside to  Salt Lake City, UT.   Once Gus retired from his corporate role, they decided to call  Bozeman, MT, home, and it was here that Karen was able to pursue her  passion of events and events planning and politics. Her skills were  highly sought after, and soon she became a mainstay in Montana  political events. In fact, in 2015, she signed on with my team and,  lucky for us, she decided to stay.   Karen and her sidekick Winnie, her dog, have spent countless hours  combing through every detail of Montana news and headlines, catching  every outstanding Montanan.   Karen has worked tirelessly, making sure all Montanans are honored  for their heroism, their anniversaries, their birthdays, and, of  course, she planned all of our events.   One story in particular that comes to mind was when she received word  a large gathering was coming to one of our instate offices. Karen  wasted no time getting the details ironed out and created a welcoming  experience for our visitors and even had breakfast treats for  everybody. It was a wonderful gathering thanks to her hard work and her  dedication.   Karen, your expertise and attention to every detail will be missed.  The charisma, the positive attitude you bring to everything you do, is  highly regarded by all of your peers and by me.   Thank you for your years of service to the great State of Montana. We  wish you well on your next chapter of being a full-time grandma. God  bless you.                        Nomination Of dara Lindenbaum     Madam President, today I have the honor of  recognizing a true American hero, Hershel ``Woody'' Williams. Woody is  a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and recipient of the Congressional  Medal of Honor for his immense bravery during the Battle of Iwo Jima in  World War II. Woody is also a former representative of the Veterans  Administration and founder of the Hershel ``Woody'' Williams Medal of  Honor Foundation.   Woody always had a desire to serve his country, and to this day, he  continues that effort. His initial attempt to enlist in the U.S. Marine  Corps, at just 17 years old, was derailed by his disapproving mother.  The following year, he was again denied entry because he did not meet  the height requirement. However, at the age of 19 and after the height  requirement had been reduced, Woody finally was able to join the Marine  Corps and begin a journey that would not only bring honor to his family  and friends, but to our entire Nation.   After training as a flame thrower operator, Woody was deployed to the  Pacific where he fought in the Guadalcanal Campaign and in Guam. On  February 21, 1945, he landed at Iwo Jima. With the support of just four  marine gunners, Woody gallantly eliminated pillbox after pillbox,  successfully reducing heavy machinegun fire to make way for our  advancing troops. Even though the situation was beyond desperate, he  continued on, knowing what needed to be done to win and to save the  lives of his brothers. When the battle concluded, he had eliminated six  enemy pillboxes.   That same day, U.S. forces heroically hoisted the American flag on  top of Mount Suribachi. Woody's bravery was instrumental to the  military success at Iwo Jima, and his bravery was acknowledged at the  White House by President Harry Truman on October 5, 1945, with the  Medal of Honor. In addition to those honors, an Armed Forces Center in  Woody's hometown of Fairmont, WV, holds his name. The Hershel ``Woody''  Williams Armed Forces Reserves Center is the only National Guard  facility in the country to bear the name of a living marine. Also  honoring Woody is a Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Fairmont, WV, a  bridge in Barboursville, WV, and an Expeditionary Sea Base Vessel.   Woody continued to serve his country well after the war, working for  the Veterans Administration as a veteran service representative for 33  years out of offices in West Virginia and New Mexico, where he  continued to serve his military family. After Woody retired in 1979, he  continued to support veterans through the Hershel ``Woody'' Williams  Medal of Honor Foundation. This foundation preserves the memory of the  brave men lost at war, reminding us all of the price that must be paid  for freedom. His effort to build Gold Star Family Memorials in all 50  States is also coming to a successful close, with the 50th memorial  being unveiled in Bozeman, MT, on Memorial Day, 2022.   It is because of heroes like Woody, that America is known as the land  of the free and the home of brave. I want to thank you, Mr. Williams,  for your continued service to our great country and for displaying such  tremendous courage, not only during times of war, but throughout your  life.                            ____________________
