 I think that is exactly right, Senator Heinrich. It is  one of these unique moments tonight in the Senate where this body is  coming together.   Here we are--as Senator Heinrich mentioned and Senator Gardner has  mentioned--we may disagree on various issues, but we are coming  together tonight at a time when the Nation needs to come together to  move this very important legislation forward   In Montana, we had cabin fever, as I am sure folks in New Mexico and  Colorado had as well. There were too many times on Zoom and not enough  time outside. It has been good to see, as we have been through a phased  opening in our State, like other States, people are getting back  outside again and back into our national parks.   I think about being a kid growing up in Montana. My earliest memories  were literally when Mom and Dad would load us up in a pickup. Those  were the days when you laid down in the back of a pickup. Kids rode in  the back of the pickup. Nobody was strapped in. I am not suggesting  this become the normal practice, but back in the day, we just rode in  the back of the pickup. Mom and Dad would take us up to Cooke City, MT.  Sometimes we would do day hikes out of there. Sometimes there were  overnights on our public lands.   You don't realize how special that is when you are growing up until  you realize not everybody around the country has that kind of direct  accessibility to our public lands. That is why more and more Americans  are actually coming out West and why they want to be closer to these  amazing public lands that we are so grateful we have in places like New  Mexico, Colorado, and Montana.   We say in Montana that we get to work, but we also like to play. We  work hard during the week, and I think we work hard so we can get out  on the weekends, where there is hiking, fishing, hunting, and  backpacking. This is our life.   These are pictures I have taken with my phone. The picture right  here--we have three Mini Australian Shepherds. These are two of them.  Our older dog, Jessie, has a hard time getting down the trails and  mountains now, but the younger ones still can.   We think about our fondest memories spending time outside on our  public lands. It is why we continue to preserve, protect, and expand  that access to this incredible treasure we have in America.    Senator Heinrich, the Land and Water Conservation Fund  has been such an important tool for us to provide access to the type of  situation you just described. We have about 1.5 million acres of  Federal lands in Montana that are not accessible because they are  landlocked. They are inholdings because of the complex nature of the  checkerboard ownership infrastructure that we oftentimes see out West-- a section, 640 acres, a square mile. You have a State section, you have  a Federal section, and you have a private land owner. This is working  with willing landowners who want to work and find a way to consolidate  some of these sections to provide better access to the public lands.   We have had some great projects, like the Tenderfoot project, we call  it, over by the Smith River, which is a treasure in Montana. It is kind  of the Montana bucket list, to float the Smith. It is an amazing  several overnights from one point to the next, an over 50-mile kind of  float. I did that once, and I would love to do it again. We had the  Falls Creek acquisition that is outside of Augusta. By being able to  provide access through a few hundred acres or a couple thousand acres,  it gets the public into tens of thousands of acres of some prime elk  habitat.   This is where we bring together some of these great wildlife  conservations, like the Rocky Mountain elk conservation, that see these  tools as critical to, one, help protect and expand elk habitat, but  importantly, Montana is still one of those States where a mom or a dad,  grandma or grandpa, aunt or uncle can take a son or a daughter, a niece  or a nephew or a cousin down to Walmart and buy an elk tag or a deer  tag over the counter and jump back in the pickup and go to our public  lands within an hour, sometimes even a shorter time than that.   That is something, as you mentioned, Senator Heinrich--    It is--every State has its own philosophy and ways they  are going to manage wildlife, but in Montana, in many cases, it is an  over-the-  [[Page S2954]]  counter tag. We have special draws. Antelope is still a draw. There are  some places for elk and deer that are a draw, but in most cases, for  elk and deer or a bear, you can go and buy that tag over the counter.  That is very unique.   As you mentioned, Senator Heinrich, it is so different from Europe.  What sets our country apart--while Europe may have beautiful castles  and chateaux and chefs and so forth, what we have are national parks  and our public lands. As you mentioned, it is something our forefathers  had the vision for. They went before us and set that aside. Had they  not done that--you never get that back. Had that not been put in the  hands of the public, we wouldn't have Yellowstone National Park or  Glacier National Park. They are such beautiful places. They would have  been subdivided. They would have been privately held, and the public  couldn't enjoy these treasures. I am grateful for that legacy. We get  to work on it here tonight, to continue to maintain it well and be  better stewards of these public lands.    Thanks, Senator Heinrich.   I am going to hand this over to the Senator from Ohio, as well as our  Senator from Tennessee, where it is so important to the Restore Our  Parks Act. I know we have a lot to talk about in our national parks.   I want to add one point, Senator Heinrich, about what you mentioned  around the economic benefits. Seventy percent of the fishing access  that is in Montana has been funded by the Land and Water Conservation  Fund--70 percent. As a kid growing up, I had a fly rod in my hand back  in the early 1970s before fly fishing became very popular. My grandpa  and my dad would take me out, not unlike in ``The River Runs Through  It.''   That is a classic movie. When Robert Redford and Brad Pitt came out  to Montana and filmed this amazing movie, it was filmed on the Gallatin  River, where I grew up fishing as a kid, in Bozeman. Little did we know  what a movie like that and fishing access might do to spur our fly  fishing industry in Montana. Now our outdoor recreation economy is $7  billion in Montana. What started out as access for the public and  primarily Montanans has turned into something that is an economic  driver, as others want to share the amazing experiences we have in  places like Montana, on our rivers and seeing a trout on a fly line. It  is an important economic driver.    I want Senator Portman from Ohio to speak.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Aubree Root of Richland County for her academic  achievements and desire to give back to her community.   Aubree is a graduate of Fairview High School and plans to attend  Minot State University to study psychology and art in the fall. She has  a desire to use her education to eventually work with children who have  experienced trauma once she graduates from college.   Aubree was awarded a scholarship by the ROI Foundation. The ROI  Foundation selects a Richland County graduating senior every year who  plans to pursue a career in the field of special education, psychology,  or any related field having to do with human services. Scholarship  recipients are selected based on their academic standing, their  involvement in the community, and their desire to work with those with  intellectual, physical, mental, or emotional disabilities.   It is my honor to recognize Aubree for receiving this distinguished  scholarship. Her selfless desire to receive an education in order to  support those in challenging situations exemplifies the Montana spirit  of serving others. I look forward to following Aubree's future  accomplishments, and I congratulate her for receiving this  honor.                            ____________________
