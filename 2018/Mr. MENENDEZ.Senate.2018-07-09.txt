 Mr. President, I rise to bring attention to the ongoing  conflict in South Sudan, and call on the administration to take further  action to help find a sustainable diplomatic solution.   Today, July 9, is South Sudan's Independence Day. Instead of  celebrating the seventh birthday of the world's newest nation, we find  ourselves lamenting the human costs of South Sudan's 4-and-a-half year  old civil war. The situation has created the largest refugee crisis in  Africa. An estimated 4.5 million people have been forcibly displaced.  An estimated 300,000 people may have been killed since 2013, but the  death toll could be far, far greater.   The humanitarian situation is dire. Seven million people--60 percent  of the population--require humanitarian assistance. Insecurity has  disrupted farming cycles, grazing patterns, and trade routes; local  markets have collapsed. Food prices have skyrocketed. Over 1 million  South Sudanese children are facing acute malnutrition, and parts of  South Sudan may be experiencing famine. While the United States, along  with other donors, has taken measures to help those in need, our  efforts have been thwarted on a variety of fronts. Relief supplies have  been repeatedly looted. Government restrictions and insecurity hinder  relief efforts.   The war has been characterized by horrific human rights violations.  The U.N. Mission in South Sudan reports that, from the outset of the  conflict, ``Civilians were not only caught up in the violence, they  were directly targeted, often along ethnic lines.'' The U.N. Commission  on Human Rights in South Sudan suggests that ethnic cleansing has  occurred. Forces on both sides have reportedly engaged in widespread  sexual violence. An attack on a residence for aid workers in Juba in  July 2016, during which Americans were assaulted and a local journalist  killed, highlighted the dangers facing aid workers and other  expatriates. According to the U.N., over 100 aid workers have been  killed since the war began. Hundreds of attacks on humanitarian workers  were reported in 2017. U.N. officials assert that targeted attacks  against civilians, humanitarians, and U.N. personnel in South Sudan by  government and oppositions forces may constitute war crimes or crimes  against humanity.  [[Page S4840]]    Just last month, Reuters reported that the ceasefire monitoring group  set up as part of the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict  in South Sudan known as the ARCSS has evidence that South Sudan's army  has massacred civilians, burned children alive, and gang-raped women  since the ceasefire agreement reached in December 2017.   In the worst incident detailed in the reports, a group of 200  government soldiers attacked the village of Nyatot in Upper Nile state  on February 12. Civilian survivors interviewed said they were  ``shooting randomly at everything and everybody.'' Twenty-two civilians  were killed and 72 wounded. South Sudan has denied targeting civilians  and called the reports, compiled in the last 3 months, exaggerated.  Despite pressure from the international community, the reports have yet  to be released publicly. If these reports are true, perpetrators must  be held accountable.   The U.N. Security Council ramped up its threats to impose sanctions  against six key individuals in South Sudan if the fighting continued  and no compromise was reached by the end of June. Under this most  recent threat of sanctions, President Salva Kiir and rival leader Riek  Machar held their first meeting since the 2015 deal collapsed in mid- 2016. They have signed yet another agreement and imposed a ceasefire,  but before the ink was dry, there were allegations that government  forces violated the ceasefire and reports that Machar's group --the  Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition --was opposed to key  elements contained therein, putting the agreement at risk.   The Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD, also said it  was developing punitive measures against violators of the ceasefire  agreement, although it is uncertain whether this will materialize in a  region that has been reticent to impose sanctions.   The United States played a key role in helping create the 2005  Comprehensive Peace Agreement that laid the groundwork for the 2011  referendum on self-determination, through which the people of South  Sudan overwhelmingly voted for independence. We have a role to play in  helping the people of South Sudan secure their future and find peace.  The administration has taken some steps, including imposing targeted  sanctions on individuals who threaten the peace, security, or stability  of South Sudan, a bilateral arms embargo, and Commerce Department  actions against South Sudanese companies in the oil sector. USAID  Administrator Mark Green traveled to the country in September 2017 and  pressed for a ceasefire and humanitarian access. U.N. Ambassador Nikki  Haley visited Juba and Sudanese refugees in October 2017 and has  pursued Security Council sanctions on those who are obstacles to peace.  Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Sigal  Mandelker, was in east Africa last month, where she urged countries to  stop illicit money flows from South Sudan into neighboring countries.  These actions are welcome. However, such engagements have been too  sporadic to generate sustained diplomatic momentum. Millions of South  Sudanese continue to suffer.   Despite what seem like positive developments in recent weeks, if past  is prologue, we should all be very concerned about whether the  agreement will hold. We must position ourselves to support it if it  does not collapse, but we must also be prepared to help find a way to a  sustainable peace if it does. High-level U.S. engagement has proven  decisive in achieving peace in the past; it could make all the  difference now, either in helping support this latest agreement or in  forging a new diplomatic solution.   I urge the administration to redouble its efforts on South Sudan by  taking the following steps: Consider the appointment of a special envoy  for Sudan and South Sudan. Addressing the conflict in South Sudan will  take concerted time effort and attention. If the Democratic Republic of  Congo, northeastern Nigeria, the Central African Republic, and Mali  weren't all in some form of crisis or another, our newly confirmed  Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs might be able to  devote the necessary time and resources towards the shuttle diplomacy  and intense negotiations required to end the conflict in South Sudan,  but time is a luxury that we don't have. During his confirmation  hearing to be Secretary of State in April, Mike Pompeo committed to  reviewing the utility of assigning a special envoy to South Sudan. When  he appeared before the committee to defend the administration's Fiscal  Year 2019 budget request in May, Secretary Pompeo indicated that he had  not yet reviewed the issue. Mr. Secretary, the people of South Sudan  have suffered long enough. It is time for a decision.   Develop a strategy, in coordination with partners and allies, for  incentivizing each of the member states of IGAD, the east African  regional body leading negotiations, to take constructive and decisive  actions aimed at ending the conflict. IGAD's efforts to date have been  commendable, but it is clear that, when it comes to developing and  implementing meaningful consequences for nonadherence to past  agreements, competing bilateral interests of member states have  overtaken effective collective action by the body. Unless member states  are willing to place peace in South Sudan above narrow parochial  interests, IGAD will continue to fail, and the people of South Sudan  will continue to pay the price. IGAD should lead the international  community in imposing an arms embargo and targeted sanctions, including  a travel ban and an asset freeze if this last initiative fails. Member  states should stop any and all material support they may be providing  to the government in Juba, and we must make clear that failure to do so  will affect our bilateral relationship with each of the countries in  IGAD.   Improve coordination with allies. The other members of the Troika  were taken by surprise by our announcement in May that we are reviewing  our assistance to South Sudan. Administration officials consistently  say that America first does not mean America alone. If that is the  case, we need to stop taking unilateral action. We should ensure that  our partners --if they really are our partners --are apprised of  actions in advance of our announcing them. I am not suggesting we give  them veto authority over U.S. policy. I am suggesting that we work in  concert with them so that our actions have more impact. If we consult,  we might just find that they want to cooperate with us.   Finally, we should maintain pressure in the Security Council. I am  pleased that Ambassador Haley has continued to pursue U.N. sanctions,  and I support her efforts. It is evident that the one thing that those  in power in Juba care about is protecting their self-interests. Let's  stop the supply of arms and materiel and hit the parties to the  conflict where it hurts: their pocket books.   Mr. President, I truly hope the news coming out of the region is an  indicator that things are finally moving in the right direction, but  there is ample room for doubt. I urge the administration to better  prepare to help the people of South Sudan reach the goals at the birth  of their new nation, tragically derailed by civil war and an  indifference of their leaders to their suffering.                            ____________________
