 Mr. Speaker, this year, my alma mater, the  University of Miami, celebrates the 75th anniversary of the Rosenstiel  School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.   Early on, in 1943, UM recognized the need to advance the field of  oceanographic research, establishing what was known then as the UM  Marine Laboratory in a small boathouse on Belle Isle in Miami Beach.   Fast-forward to today. UM's Rosenstiel School has transformed into  one of the world's premier marine and atmospheric research  institutions, including developing state-of-the-art approaches to  tackling some of today's most pressing environmental problems.   This vital research includes coral reef restoration and sustainable  fishing studies that have had a positive impact on south Florida as a  community and as stewards of our fragile environment. UM's efforts help  ensure that future generations enjoy our unique and beautiful oceans  for centuries to come.   I would like to congratulate UM Rosenstiel students and the staff,  both past and present, for their commitment to oceanographic and  atmospheric research and for the work that has made it this wonderful  institution that it is today.   So happy 75th. Go Canes.                  Honoring the Contributions of Stanley Tate     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a prominent  figure of not only our south Florida community, but of the entire  Nation, Mr. Stanley Tate. A Miami-Dade County native, Stanley Tate has  been successful in many roles, including businessman, civic leader, and  public servant.   Not long after Stanley graduated from college, he founded a general  contracting firm building private homes and apartment buildings. As a  young and driven newcomer to the industry, Stanley quickly became well- known and respected for his quality work, and he has continuously  expanded upon his success.   Stanley also knew that he could make a great, positive impact in our  community and beyond by involving himself in public service. He served  with the city council of Bay Harbor Islands in several capacities,  including mayor and assistant mayor for 20 years. He also served on the  board of directors of the Florida League of Cities and is a former  chairman of the housing resource team for Metro-Dade County.   It is because of his vast knowledge and proficiency that Stanley was  invited several times to testify here in D.C. before committees in both  the House and the Senate regarding housing and banking issues. Stanley  was also appointed by President George Herbert Walker Bush to be the  chairman of the National Advisory Board of the Resolution Trust  Corporation, and he was then nominated by President Clinton to be the  president of the RTC.   Stanley and I share the belief that every family should be provided a  way to save for their child's higher education, so I was proud to  partner with Stanley to help his vision become a reality with the  Florida Prepaid College Plan. It was his tenure in the early  developments of the program that helped ensure the program's viability  and success. In recognition of Stanley's efforts, then-Governor Jeb  Bush renamed the program the Stanley G. Tate Florida Prepaid College  Program.   As a believer in the Jewish faith, Stanley has always been active in  the Miami Jewish community and wa a strong and early supporter of our  ally, the democratic Jewish State of Israel. Stanley served as chairman  of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation and has been heavily involved in  the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, since the very  start.    Mr. Speaker, throughout his life, Stanley has selflessly devoted  himself to give back to others. So, thank you, Stanley Tate, for your  commitment to bettering the lives of so many in our community and our  great Nation. I am so proud to call you mi amigo, my friend.                            ____________________
