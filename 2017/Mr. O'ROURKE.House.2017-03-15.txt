 Mr. Speaker, it is great to be here tonight. I just  traveled with my good friend, close colleague, and fellow Texan--and  your fellow Texan--Will Hurd, who started with me in San Antonio,  Texas, yesterday at 7 a.m., San Antonio time, where we, because of the  inclement weather on the East Coast and because of his canceled flight  and the possibility that mine might also be canceled, decided to rent a  car in San Antonio and drive it here to Washington, D.C., in time for  votes this evening that started at 6:30 eastern standard time.   That road trip in a Chevy Impala, rented in San Antonio, took us from  San Antonio to Austin, to San Marcos, to Dallas, to Waco, to Texarkana,  and then into Little Rock in Arkansas, over into Tennessee--cities  including Memphis, Nashville, and Johnson City--and then through  Virginia, 36 hours total, 31 of them either driving or at a pit stop  fueling up on gas or grabbing a sandwich.   Mr. Speaker, there were really two reasons to do this. One was to  make sure that we could get to work and not allow the weather delays or  flight cancellations to stop us from doing the jobs that we were  elected to do on behalf of the people that we represent, but the other  reason was for a Democrat and a Republican to get together, get to know  each other, understand the issues before this Congress from each  other's perspective, and see if we couldn't find some common ground.   In addition, because each of us so deeply believes in transparency  and accountability, we allowed the people that we represent to join us  on that trip. We live-streamed the entire journey on Facebook Live,  with thousands of people from all over this country submitting their  questions, their comments, their suggestions, their advice, their  guidance, including where to get the best doughnut at midnight in  Memphis, Tennessee--which turns out to be Gibson's Donuts--where Mr.  Hurd from Texas and I had a chance to meet some  [[Page H2079]]  of the folks who make those doughnuts and some of the folks who eat  them. It was one of the best parts of the trip.   Mr. Speaker, I am just so grateful that there is an opportunity,  despite the deep divisions between our two parties at times and despite  the imperative to raise money, to campaign, to spend time away from  each other, understandably, with our families or listening to our  constituents back in our home districts. Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful  that we had a chance to spend some time together getting to know each  other, getting to talk about the issues that are important to the  people we represent and to this country at large.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to my friend from Texas (Mr.  Hurd), the gentleman who represents the 23rd Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, our journey began after picking up the car  at the rental lot at 5:00 a.m. with a breakfast at Mi Tierra cafe in  San Antonio where we were presented by the staff there with this  pinata, which became our mascot along the way. So, Mr. Speaker, I want  to make sure that you and our colleagues tonight have a chance to see  this.   Perhaps, on the more whimsical side, there was some discussion  amongst my friend from Texas (Mr. Hurd) and those who joined us on the  journey virtually through the Livestream about trying to encourage more  Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle in a way that would  allow them to take time with each other, to get to know each other, to  listen to each other and, yes, to talk about serious policy issues, but  also to find out a little bit about who they are, where they came from,  what excites them about their service, their families, the communities  that they represent. And that allows for what I hope will be a more  close, productive, and effective working relationship on behalf of the  people we serve.   Despite the obvious talent, Mr. Speaker, in this Chamber, Members  that I have had the pleasure to get to know over the last 4 years that  I have been here who hail from all parts of the country, from all  backgrounds, who are among the best and brightest in their communities,  who are here to do the right thing, to deliver for their constituents  and to put this country first. It is interesting that, despite that, we  haven't been able to get many of the big things accomplished for this  country. We can think about things like comprehensive immigration  reform or comprehensive tax reform, for that matter, or educational and  healthcare reforms that are going to impact every single family and  every single one of the communities that we represent.   I think part of the reason is that we need to reform the institution  itself. And those reforms could take the form of comprehensive campaign  finance reform or ending gerrymandering of districts and having a  national congressional redistricting committee that is nonpartisan that  draws those lines on rational, logical bases. Or we could have term  limits for Members of Congress so that you can't serve in what turns  out to be perpetuity for the political life of a community and have  some faith in the talent and the leadership that is produced in that  community that we all represent.   Those are things that are going to be tough to do, let's admit it.  Some of them require amendments to our Constitution.   Where we could start, Mr. Speaker, is just spending some time with  each other, taking a road trip, playing a game of basketball, going out  on a run, having a cup of coffee, having lunch together. As my friend  from Texas (Mr. Hurd) says that too often we are in our own corners.  And on our side, maybe that is in meetings about how to message those  good things that we want to do for the American public or outside of  this Chamber and away from our official responsibilities raising the  resources in order to get reelected or to get our colleagues from the  same party reelected.   Those are understandable and, yes, I think, necessary things to do,  but sometimes we do them to the exclusion of what is even more  important and necessary and, that is, getting to know each other, being  able to work with each other, and solving the problems and capitalizing  on the opportunities that face this country.   For whatever it is worth, 36 hours later, I feel like I have the  opportunity to do that with my friend from Texas. What I would like him  to do, if he would, is to share with us and with you, Mr. Speaker, some  of those issues that we talked about and some of the takeaways or the  conclusions or the things that we shared and learned.   I am going to tell you, at the outset, to set your expectations, we  didn't solve all of these problems. And we didn't even come necessarily  to common agreement on all of the big issues, but we definitely heard  each other's perspective. In some cases, we definitely moved a little  bit in the positions that we started with. And I will say that I  learned a lot.   I learned a lot about Mr. Hurd, his background, his perspective,  getting to talk to his dad, his sister, and his brother who all called  in while we were traveling across the country. But I learned about  those things that shape his views on the issues that he and I both care  about and why, in some cases, he sees a different means to getting to  the same goal that I want to get to and that the people I represent  want to get to.    There were a number of issues that we tackled and discussed.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) to share some of those  [[Page H2080]]  issues we discussed with you, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I will conclude by joining the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Hurd) in thanking the teams that made this possible in  our office, led by David Wysong, my chief of staff; John Meza, who  manned the communications; Samantha Stiles, chief of logistics, also  known as our scheduler; Cynthia Cano, our district director back in El  Paso; and everyone who works with them.   As my friend says, I also want to thank the tens of thousands of  people who participated in this over the course of the last 36 hours.  Some folks tuned in and they had to tune out because they had to go to  work, take care of a kid, get some sleep, or they were just bored by  what we were doing. But they understood the premise was that we were  not able or, in the gentleman from Texas' (Mr. Hurd) case, his flight  was canceled into Washington, D.C., because of the weather--I feared  that mine might as well be--and that we rented a car and that we had to  be in Washington, D.C., after leaving San Antonio at 7:00 a.m., by 6:30  p.m. on Wednesday in order to be there and vote and represent the  interest of our constituency. If we are to be honest with each other,  it was touch and go for a little while. We ran into a two-hour pileup  just south of Waco when we were still in Texas.   My friend from Texas (Mr. Hurd) has a penchant for getting to know a  town and wanting to spend some time in a coffee shop talking to the  owner about the art of making coffee and the philosophy that  accompanies that. It is a fascinating conversation to be sure, but it  added precious minutes that I and many of our viewers felt we could not  spare.                                time  2015    Yet, working together, balancing my friend's natural curiosity and  interests in the communities in which we were traveling, and my  desperation to get to Washington, D.C., in time to cast our votes, we  were able to arrive in 36 hours. Thirty-six hours total travel time we  were able to arrive with almost 30 minutes to spare, which if you  consider the context, the amount of hours, the 1,600-plus miles  traveled, that is a remarkable feat.   Look, I don't want to take too much from this, but I think we might  be able to find some encouragement that two Members working their way  across the largest State in the lower 48, and then through Arkansas,  Tennessee, and Virginia, were able together to make decisions necessary  to ensure that we were able to get to our destination in time, get our  job done, and represent those people that we serve.   That, for some reason, Mr. Speaker, was interesting to people. We had  thousands watching us, newspapers following, broadcast stations  carrying the feed from our car.   Why?   Because--and it shouldn't be this way--this is such an unusual event  for a Republican and Democrat, not to file a bill together--that  happens fairly often and I am grateful for that--but to sit down and  enjoy each other's company, learn from each other, and take on the  challenge of driving these 1,600 miles together.   I did not know my friend from Texas as well as I do now, 36 hours  later, and I didn't know how this was going to turn out.   Were we going to be able to stand each other's company? Were we going  to be able to take each other's driving? Were we going to be able to  make the  [[Page H2081]]  compromises necessary to decide where to eat, when to stop, when to  sleep, and how to get there?   Imperfectly, yet satisfactorily, we were able to do that, ultimately  get here on time.   We both thought as we finished votes this evening--because we got  here in time to cast those votes and went back to our office to thank  our staffs. As we were doing that, we thought that we owe it to each  other, to our colleagues with whom we work, all 435 of us, to say that  both of us want to do everything we can to build on this experience, to  share it with you, to thank those from the constituencies that we  represent and from across the United States who shared that journey  with us, who ensured that we had our seatbelts on, that my eyes were on  the road, that we were able to get some sleep in Nashville.   I want to thank everyone who had a part in this, and I just want to  thank this Chamber and those who sent me here for this very high honor  of being able to serve. It was really an amazing experience, and I am  going to use it to the best of my ability to serve my constituents to  the best of my ability, and make common cause with as many of my  colleagues that are here in this Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, I yield again to my friend from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank my friend from Texas  for joining me tonight on the floor of the House for his words, and for  taking the chance in driving across much of the country with me to get  here and making sure that we could fulfill our responsibilities; and  not just the immediate responsibility of getting here in time to vote,  which we were able to do, but our responsibility to find a way to work  with each other across party lines and address the important issues  before this country that are going to be critical for this country's  future success and the well-being of those that we represent.   Mr. Speaker, I don't think it is any accident that the Speaker pro  tempore tonight is also from Texas. I think this is a good moment for  our State. I think this is a good moment for this Congress. I think  this is a chance to strengthen the institution, and I am grateful for  the opportunity to serve here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
