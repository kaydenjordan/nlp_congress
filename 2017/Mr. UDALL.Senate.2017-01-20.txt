 Mr. President, today I voted against the confirmation of  General John Kelly to be Secretary of Homeland Security. I have deep  concerns about the homeland security policies that President Trump  advocated during the campaign, and I worry that as Secretary of  Homeland Security, General Kelly will feel it necessary to work to  advance those reckless policies. For instance, General Kelly was unable  to promise the Senate that the administration will refrain from  deporting our nation's DREAMers, and I am troubled by his stated plans  to reverse the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, DACA, program.  Furthermore, General Kelly did not provide sufficient assurance that he  fully opposes the President's wasteful and misguided plan for a border  wall.   However, now that he has been confirmed, it is my hope that Secretary  Kelly will be the voice of reason in the deliberations to shape the  Trump administration's homeland security policy and that many of the  reckless ideas candidate Trump espoused during the election will never  become reality.   While I voted against General Kelly, I recognize and appreciate his  long and distinguished career in the marines. I believe this  experience, particularly his final assignment as head of the U.S.  Southern Command, will serve him well. In addition, I am encouraged by  several statements General Kelly made during his confirmation hearing-- statements that are at odds with the dangerous comments President Trump  made during the campaign.   At the hearing, General Kelly spoke out against the use of torture  and said the U.S. should always abide by the Geneva Conventions. He did  state that building a wall along the southern border was not an  effective way to secure the border, though he has not promised to  oppose such a plan. He agreed with the intelligence community's  assessment that Russia was responsible for hacking into our elections.  He said that surveilling mosques and targeting Muslims as security  threats was unacceptable. Finally, he said the sweeping collection of  data on Americans violated the right to privacy and a much more focused  effort is needed.   General Kelly has a reputation for speaking truth to power--I  sincerely hope he does so as a member of the Cabinet, and I hope the  President will listen. New Mexico is a majority-minority border State  with thousands of hard-working families now living in fear of President  Trump's immigration plans. Unfortunately, I am deeply concerned that  General Kelly will be the instrument of the President's harmful and  backwards homeland security agenda.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Gen. Jim Mattis is an extraordinary  individual and an American patriot who has dedicated his life to  service of country.   Nevertheless, his nomination did concern me, given that it was  contrary to underlying law that has been in place since World War II.  This law restricts individuals who have come out of the military less  than 7 years ago from serving as Secretary of Defense. The reason for  this longstanding law is to ensure civilian control over the military.  Civilian control is an important American tradition which General  [[Page S357]]  Mattis himself called a ``fundamental tenet of the American military  tradition.''   Due to this fundamental concern, I opposed the legislation to create  an exception to the law to allow General Mattis to serve. I intend to  oppose any future such exceptions for any future President as long as I  serve in the Senate. However, now that the exception exists for General  Mattis, and he is eligible to serve and has been nominated, I supported  his confirmation today.   During his confirmation hearing, he clearly stressed that he  understood his new role and would work to ensure the longstanding  American tradition of civilian control. He will serve at the pleasure  of the new President, but his job now is not to simply give and follow  orders, but provide candid advice, ask tough questions, provide  civilian leadership, and exert broad management over all aspects of  DOD, not only warfighting. During his career in the U.S. Marines he has  distinguished himself both in combat and at home, earning the respect  of his fellow marines as well as servicemembers in every branch of the  military. He has also held his marines and anyone serving with him to  the highest of standards, emphasizing commitment to duty and the  importance of learning and perfecting their profession.   While I voted against a waiver for him to serve as Secretary of  Defense, I in no way can oppose him on the merits now that the waiver  has been approved. My vote on the waiver was no way a reflection of my  support for his qualifications, but a vote which I felt was important  to maintain the tradition of civilian control of the military, an  important American tradition which General Mattis himself called a  ``fundamental tenet of the American military tradition.''   As Secretary of Defense, he will be charged with the important task  of providing civilian leadership at the Department of Defense, the  largest agency in our country, and the one tasked with our national  defense.   New Mexico plays an outsized role in these efforts, beginning with  our national labs, that maintain our nuclear weapons and play an  important role in multiple defense efforts.   In addition, New Mexico is home to three Air Force bases. Kirtland  Air Force Base, one of the most diverse in the country, not only plays  a lead role in managing our nuclear weapons, but is both the home of  state of the art Air Force Research Lab facilities and AFSOC's premier  training wing--the 58th Special Operations Wing. Cannon Air Force Base,  home of the 27th Special Operations Wing, is at the tip of the spear in  our efforts to counter terrorist threats to the United States. Holloman  Air Force Base, which was recently selected to receive additional F- 16s, continues a proud tradition of training our future F-16 pilots.  Furthermore, White Sands Missile Range, which is utilized by all our  services, is the premier testing facility in the country. Finally, New  Mexico also shares the Army's Ft. Bliss with our neighbor El Paso.   I would encourage Secretary Mattis to visit New Mexico as soon as  possible to learn more about how New Mexico supports our Nation's  military. I am proud to support them and our many veterans who have  made New Mexico their home.                            ____________________
