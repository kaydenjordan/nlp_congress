 Madam Speaker, as a father, I believe that every life has  value, and I am proud to be pro-life.   But whether you are pro-life or not, my fellow North Carolinians and  Americans all across the country agree that government should not use  taxpayer dollars to fund abortions.   That is why the Hyde amendment was created.   The Hyde amendment has saved 2.5 million lives and protected the  conscience rights of Americans, all with overwhelmingly bipartisan  support.   In fact, Hyde has been renewed every year since 1976, under  majorities and Presidents of both parties, including President Barack  Obama.   However, in his most recent budget proposal, President Joe Biden  chose to ignore precedent and the will of the people by excluding Hyde  amendment protections.   This is a radical shift in policy.   Americans should not be forced to violate their conscience to pay for  abortions.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion  Act, and I ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
