 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as a number  of my colleagues have, to recognize that this Saturday, July 20, is the  50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.   Fifty years ago, Neil Armstrong became the first human to set foot on  the surface of the Moon and declared the moment ``one small step for  man, one giant leap for mankind.''   Along with Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, he launched from the  Kennedy Space Center in Florida and embarked on a journey that would  change the course of human history forever.   At the age of 8, I can remember watching the coverage of the landing  from my family living room, where we had moved the dining room table to  eat dinner and watch this historic occasion. I remember the landing  that occurred at 4:18 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on July 20. Along with  many other children of that time across the country, I was filled with  a sense of awe and wonder.   This consequential moment was sparked years before in 1961 when  President Kennedy stood before Congress and set forth an ambitious goal  of putting a man on the Moon before the decade's end, long before, as  he acknowledged, the materials had been yet invented to make that a  reality.    His bold vision became a reality on July 20, 1969. This achievement  would not have been possible without American innovation and work  ethic, paired with the support of the public.   Now, we are tasked with safely sending the first woman and another  man to the south pole of the Moon, where no human has traveled.   This mission, called Artemis, will send astronauts back to the Moon  by 2024, allowing us to establish a permanent presence on the Moon by  2028.   None of this can be achieved without a strong public-private  partnership between NASA and the commercial industry and the strong  support of the American people.   NASA works with companies, both large and small, from across the 50  States to prepare for the Artemis mission, as well as many other  projects NASA conducts in space.   In Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District, there are several  local businesses working with NASA. Just recently, NASA announced a  contract for infrastructure support service from the H.F. Lenz Company  in Johnstown to provide their engineering expertise.   In Bellefonte, Actuated Medical is working with NASA on additive  manufacturing methods and custom medical devices.   Public-private partnerships like these will fuel the next generation  of exploration.   Space is more than just a place of academic study, however. It is  instrumental to our national security, discovers new technologies that  have everyday applications, and encourages us to push the boundaries of  what is possible.   Mr. Speaker, the legacy of the Apollo 11 Moon landing is forever  enshrined in the hearts and the minds of Americans who witnessed the  moment 50 years ago this week. We must reignite our curiosity for space  exploration as we prepare to return to the Moon and seek further  horizons in the decades to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the importance of American manufacturing and to highlight  Pennsylvania's contributions.   This week, the White House hosted its annual Made in America  showcase, displaying products from all 50 States. Businesses of all  sizes were invited to participate in the event to highlight the  strength, creativity, and ingenuity of American manufacturers. I am  pleased that Pennsylvania's 15th District represented the Commonwealth  for 2 years in a row.   In 2018, BWP Bats, a baseball bat company from Brookville, traveled  to the White House to share their products with attendees. This year,  Zippo lighters, which are manufactured in Bradford, Pennsylvania,  McKean County, represented the Keystone State.   Businesses involved in manufacturing are vital to Pennsylvania's  economy. Advanced manufacturing ranks among the Commonwealth's top five  industries, and nearly 1 in 10 people across the Commonwealth work for  a manufacturer.   A strong manufacturing sector helps America stay competitive, and  supporting legislation that strengthens the industry bolsters our  Nation's potential for a prosperous future by keeping good-paying,  family-staying jobs right here at home.                            ____________________
