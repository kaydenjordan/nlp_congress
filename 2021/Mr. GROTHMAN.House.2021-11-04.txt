 Madam Speaker, this could be a very black week for  America in that there are rumors that the reconciliation bill will  pass. A lot of bad provisions are in there that are bad for the  economy, bad for the dollar. But I think the one that is going to have  the longest impact is the universal three- and four-year-old pre-K  expenditure.   In America, traditionally, the family has been in charge of raising  the children, but as is obvious from groups that helped the Democrats  retain the majority last time, there are people who don't like the  nuclear family and would rather have the government raise their  children. To have the government involved in universal pre-K will  permanently reduce the impact that American families have on their  children and permanently increase the ability of the government to  instill all of their frequently anti-Christian values on the various  young children.   I think in the long run, when we look back on this week and the  damage that it has done to America, we will look at the universal  three- and four-year-old pre-K provision as something that did more to  drag down America than anything else.                            ____________________
