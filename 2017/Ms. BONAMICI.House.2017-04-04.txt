 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 353, the Weather Research and  Forecasting Innovation Act, which also includes the Tsunami Warning,  Education, and Research Act.   The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act is a product of  hard work and negotiation over the past two Congresses. I want to thank  [[Page H2664]]  Congressman Frank Lucas, Chairman Lamar Smith, and former Environment  Subcommittee Chairs Jim Bridenstine and Chris Stewart, who were great  partners in getting us here today.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is responsible  for important work at the cutting edge of science and public service.  Weather forecasting is one of the most critical tasks for our country.  At a time when budget uncertainty jeopardizes some of the most  fundamental services NOAA provides to our Nation, it is imperative that  we support legislation like H.R. 353 to give the agency the resources  and flexibility needed to fulfill its mission.   The northwest Oregon communities I represent and communities across  the country rely on timely and accurate weather forecasts to decide  when to harvest their crops, when to go to sea to fish, how to navigate  the roads safely when there is freezing rain or snow and to prepare for  possible flood conditions.   The National Weather Service provides excellent forecasting products  to support our economy, but with the increasing frequency and severity  of severe weather events, there can be and should be improvements in  our forecasting capabilities and delivery. Improvements in forecasts  can provide more lead time to allow communities to prepare, especially  in severe weather events. More effective communication of forecast  information to the public and those in harm's way can reduce the loss  of life and property.   This bill connects the research side of NOAA--the Office of Oceanic  and Atmospheric Research--more effectively to the forecasting needs of  the National Weather Service, cultivating a research-to-operations  pipeline that is essential for the continued improvement of our weather  forecasting enterprise. The bill contains several provisions that will  improve interactions and information sharing between NOAA's researchers  and the National Weather Service. It improves communication between  NOAA and the broader research and private weather communities. The bill  also formally establishes the pilot program currently operating at NOAA  to engage in contracts with the commercial sector for weather  forecasting data.   Even the best forecasts will not adequately serve the public's needs  unless there are effective communication systems in place. H.R. 353  directs NOAA to do more research, listen to experts, and improve its  risk communication techniques.   The bill also establishes interagency coordination through the Office  of Science and Technology Policy across multiple agencies outside NOAA  that share responsibilities for weather research and forecast  communications. This is essential, and it highlights the important role  the Office of Science and Technology Policy and NOAA share to help  speed the adoption of best tools and practices across the various  agencies of the Federal Government.   The legislation before us today also includes the Tsunami Warning,  Education, and Research Act, legislation I have introduced over the  past three Congresses. The Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act  seeks to improve our country's understanding of the threat posed by  tsunami events by improving forecasting and notification systems,  developing supportive technologies, and supporting local community  outreach preparedness and response plans. This bill helps to address  the risk faced by communities on both coasts and in the Gulf of Mexico  by improving our mitigation and research program and enhancing  community outreach and planning.   Many, if not most, of my colleagues represent districts that have  experienced some kind of natural disaster. The threat of a catastrophic  earthquake and tsunami is real because of the Cascadia Subduction Zone.  West Coast Members take this threat very seriously.   I have heard from coastal communities, people who fish, the tourism  and maritime industries, marine and public safety officials, sheriffs,  emergency managers, small-business owners, older Americans, and  students who are concerned that their communities are not prepared for  a tsunami.   Students at Seaside High School, a coastal community in my district,  engaged in a year-long project to educate Oregonians about the threat a  tsunami has on lives and property. Three of the four public schools in  Seaside are still located inside the tsunami inundation zone. The high  school students have practiced their evacuation route, and they know  that, in the projected time between a major earthquake and the  devastating wave of a tsunami, they couldn't make it to higher ground.  That is unacceptable.   The University of Oregon and Oregon State University are working on  seismic warning systems and tsunami preparedness to help make sure that  our communities are prepared and have the best research available to  give the most warning time possible, and this bill compliments their  work.   I am proud to have worked on this legislation which is so important  to the people of northwest Oregon and all coastal communities, but I do  remain very concerned that the funding level is below current spending.  This cut would have serious consequences. The operation and maintenance  funding for the buoy network we rely on to detect tsunami could  decrease, adding hours of delay in appropriately warning coastal  communities.   Tsunami warning centers in Alaska and Hawaii are likely to see a  reduction in staff, resulting in gaps in coverage and creating greater  risks because of time delays in sending out accurate warnings and, in  some instances, not being able to provide adequate warning at all.   Tsunami are among the most deadly natural disasters. In the past two  decades, tsunami have caused the deaths of roughly a quarter million  people around the world. These disasters also have profound economic  consequences. The 2001 tsunami in Japan caused more than $200 billion  in economic losses.   We are fortunate, in the United States, to have been spared these  catastrophes so far.                                time  1445    But our coastlines, from the Gulf of Mexico to Alaska, are very  susceptible to the same kind of disasters we have seen in Indonesia and  in Japan. It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when.   Tsunami program activities protect coastal Oregonians just as  hurricane forecasting protects coastal Floridians, Carolinians, and  others up and down the East Coast of the United States. It is important  that we reauthorize these lifesaving activities, and just as important  to provide the necessary funding to support them.   I will work tirelessly with my colleagues to make sure this program  receives the full funding it needs to serve our communities and save  lives and property.   Although there are always areas where we can do more, this underlying  bill, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, with the  tsunami bill, is a good bipartisan agreement and one that I am proud to  support while continuing to ask for current levels of funding.   I ask my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on H.R. 353.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), the ranking  member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to thanking all my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle who have worked so hard on this legislation, I want to  take a moment, also, to thank all of the staff in our offices and  committee on both sides of the aisle who worked so hard on this  legislation.   I encourage all my colleagues to support the Weather Research and  Forecasting Innovation Act, which includes the Tsunami Warning,  Education, and Research Act. This legislation will improve weather  forecasting and tsunami preparedness.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
