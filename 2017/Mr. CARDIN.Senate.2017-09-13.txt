 Mr. President, earlier this week, we commemorated the  16th anniversary of the attack on our country on September 11. It was a  day that I think none of us will ever forget. We were attacked, and we  wanted to take all necessary action to protect our country and go after  those who perpetrated this attack against America.   I was part of the Congress at that time and was part of the Congress  that passed the 2001 authorization for the use of military force that  was targeted toward Afghanistan, and I was part of the Congress that  when we took up the 2002 authorization for use of military force  against Iraq, I voted against that authorization.   It has now been 14 years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the end  of the Saddam Hussein regime. Yet we still have the authority for the  use of military force against Iraq, and it is still being used. It is  time for that authorization to end. I take this time to support Senator  Paul's efforts to put a termination date on the 2002 authorization and  to put a termination date on the 2001 authorization.   The 2001 authorization was the first we passed. It was done virtually  unanimously. There was some objection, but very few, because we wanted  our country to hold those responsible in Afghanistan for the attack  against America. That authorization is now 16 years  [[Page S5254]]  old. Let me read for my colleagues exactly what that authorization  said, what we passed 16 years ago:         That the President is authorized to use all necessary and       appropriate force against those Nations, organizations, or       persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or       aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11,       2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to       prevent any future acts of international terrorism against       the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.    That is the authorization. It is pretty specific. It is pretty  specific to go after those who were responsible for the attack against  the United States that was centered in Afghanistan, and it was used for  that purpose. Our military took action against Afghanistan as a result  of the attack against our country, and that was authorized by Congress.   It is hard to understand how you can get from the reading of this  authorization of the use of military force today as congressionally  authorized against ISIS in the Middle East, in Africa, or anywhere in  the world, but that is the interpretation that has been given to the  action of Congress in 2001. I think that interpretation cannot be  defended.   Congress has a responsibility to act. We have a responsibility to  specifically authorize the new threats that we have against our country  and what military force is appropriate. That is our responsibility.  This is a different threat than we saw 16 years ago. It is our  responsibility to give congressional authorization for the use of  military force. Some say it cannot be done. Well, if it can't be done,  then we don't agree on the authorization of force.   Let me just remind my colleagues that the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, over 3 years ago, passed an authorization for the use of  military force. We came together in our committee, and I know Senator  Kaine and Senator Flake have worked on a proposal that is certainly  much more focused toward the current circumstances. Some of us may have  amendments to that, some of us may disagree with it, but that is the  debate we should be having. There should be no debate that the 2001  authorization does not apply to our current circumstances.   We should pass an authorization that is tailored to allow the  President to effectively go after the direct threats to the United  States. That is our responsibility. We owe it to the American people  and we owe it to the men and women who serve in our military to give  them clear authority from Congress in their military operations. There  clearly needs to be direction given by Congress. We have seen an abuse  of the 2001 authorization, so we need to be pretty clear.   I must tell you that I have heard over and over again from our  generals that there is no military-only victory against ISIS. We can't  win this by a military victory alone. We need to make sure that there  are leaders in countries that protect their citizens, not only their  physical security but good governance in their human rights.   We have new challenges we need to deal with--cyber threats against  the United States. We are concerned about a physical caliphate; now we  are concerned about a virtual caliphate as we take more and more of the  territory away from the ISIS forces. So that is what we need to do.   Senator Paul's amendment gives us that opportunity by saying quite  clearly that the 2001 and 2002 authorizations need to end--need to  end--that we don't today have clear authorization from Congress to  pursue the military campaign against ISIS, and we need to have that.   There are some who say: Well, what happens if we don't meet that  deadline? Well, let me tell you something. The President has plenty of  authority. Read article 2 of the Constitution. He has the inherent  power to protect our country and our national security, and he can take  action in order to do that.   I was particularly struck as to why we need the Paul amendment when I  received a letter in my capacity on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee from Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson. You see, the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee was having meetings, trying to  figure out how to proceed on the authorization for the use of military  force. During one of those meetings, we had the opportunity to have  Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson before us, and we had a candid  discussion about what type of authorization would make sense. It was  done in a closed setting so we could have a candid discussion, and I am  not going to reveal the specifics because I thought that is what we  should be doing. But I can tell you, I left with the impression that  there was room for Congress to work with the administration on the  authorization of force, and I was hopeful that we were going to have an  open hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the committee  of jurisdiction, on the AUMF.   We had similar discussions under the Obama administration. As a  result of those discussions, President Obama submitted to Congress what  he believed would be an appropriate authorization for the use of  military force. That authorization was never taken up, but he asked for  it.   Well, just recently, we received notice from Secretary Tillerson and  Secretary Mattis that the President does not want Congress to adjust  the authorizations because he has adequate authority to do what he  wants to do. I understand that. If you take their interpretation--it is  not just this administration; it is prior administrations'  interpretation of the AUMF--they have a blank check. But that is not  our responsibility being carried out.   We are the ones who are responsible for the authorization of force,  not the President of the United States, and according to this  President, he has blank-check authorization from Congress.   So it is our responsibility to make sure that when our men and women  are sent into harm's way, they have direct authorization from the  Congress of the United States unless, by the way, there is an urgent  situation that requires the President to act, which he can do under  article 2.   So I urge my colleagues that we have a chance to start this debate  right here and now by supporting the Paul amendment, and I intend to do  that.   With that, I yield the floor.
