 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support my bill, H.R.  6367, the Incentivizing Fairness in Subcontracting Act of 2018.   This bill will clarify what credit is given for certain  subcontractors and to provide a dispute process for nonpayment to  subcontractors. Simply put, this bill will help contractors receive the  credit they need to satisfy Federal requirements.   Small businesses put in a tremendous amount of effort to receive  Federal contracting jobs. There are tons of requirements, paperwork,  and costs that go into applying and being awarded these opportunities.   Unfortunately, even after a Federal contract is awarded, small  businesses still struggle. Whether it is a delay in payment due to the  lack of an administrative dispute process or not being able to count  lower tier subcontractors toward goals, many contractors face obstacles  during the implementation of their contracts, creating the need for  safe harbors to guarantee that they can move forward in the most  effective and efficient manner.                                time  1730    H.R. 6367 will do just that. This is a bill that provides the clarity  and resources needed to help contractors work at full capacity.   This bill is endorsed by the National Electrical Contractors  Association, an association whose 4,000 members are 85 percent small  businesses. NECA is the voice of about a $160 billion industry  responsible for bringing electrical power, lighting, and communication  to buildings and communities across the United States.   I am proud to work with Ranking Member Velazquez, the chairman, and  the Congressman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly). This is an important step  in  [[Page H8808]]  guaranteeing that our contractors are treated fairly when carrying out  their contracts.
