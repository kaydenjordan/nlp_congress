 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Terry Ottinger, who  has retired after 14 years of faithful service on staff with the  Lakeland Chamber of Commerce and, 17 years before that, as a business  owner. Few have done more to advance the cause of the local  entrepreneur than Terry.   Since 1921, the Lakeland Chamber of Commerce has served as an  advocate for business and, today, is the largest chamber in Polk  County, with over 1,400 investor businesses.   During Terry's tenure as chamber vice president, Lakeland has risen  to the fourth fastest growing metropolitan area in the Nation. His  leadership has been instrumental in expanding training workshops,  promoting small business development, and providing opportunities for  investors and visionaries to network.   The city of Lakeland is a stronger regional partner and a more  desirable location for prospective businesses because of Terry's  professionalism, strategic outlook, team building talents, and honest  friendship.   Thank you, Terry. Thank you for a lifetime of service. You are not  done, though, and we look forward to keeping you engaged in our  community for years to come.                            ____________________
