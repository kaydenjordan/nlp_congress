 Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank Chairman  Quigley for his leadership in putting this bill together so that  federal workers can get back to work.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FY 2019 Financial  Services Appropriations Bill, which provides more than $23 billion to  partially re-open the government.   This important bill would reopen the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)-- ensuring hardworking families receive their tax returns on time. It  would also help to restart the taxpayer assistance centers, which serve  approximately 2.5 million citizens monthly.   This shutdown is affecting real lives, Mr. Speaker. Real people.   According to the Washington Post, IRS furloughed employee Krystle  Kirkpatrick, said she and her family of four can scrape along on her  partner's machinist salary for a while, but she's already thinking  about signing up to be a plasma donor to earn extra cash. That's only  an extra $200.   Let me reiterate. A federal employee is considering becoming a plasma  donor--because her paycheck, from her federal government job, won't be  coming in the mail.   This is no way to run a country.   Mr. Speaker, the Trump shutdown is hurting real families and it's  hurting our economy. Let's pass this bill. Let's get the government  back open and get workers their paychecks.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Financial Services Bill.
