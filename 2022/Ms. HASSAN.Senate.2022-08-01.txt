 Madam President, I am honored to recognize Deborah  Cross of Manchester as July's Granite Stater of the Month. After  surviving stage 4 cancer, Deborah used her artistic talents to create  photo journals to help other cancer patients process their emotions and  find resilience.   After recovering from endometrial cancer in 2014 and living cancer- free for almost 4 years, Deborah received awful news from her doctor.  Her cancer had come back. While Deborah was devastated by the news, she  also found solace in a creative outlet that would also help others.   Deborah began creating booklets with strikingly edited photos of  nature in New Hampshire, for example, images of seagulls and ocean  sunsets around the New England coast. Below the photos are blank lines  where cancer patients can journal. Deborah hopes that the photos can  evoke deeper emotions that patients might be struggling with in a time  of intense personal hardship. In addition, some of the proceeds from  the sales go to the North of Boston Cancer Resource.   Deborah exemplifies the Granite State spirit of giving back to others  and bringing people together even during challenging times. She took an  immensely difficult experience--battling with stage 4 cancer--and found  her way through it by creating art that would touch others. I commend  her for her work and know that her story will inspire others to make a  difference in their communities.                            ____________________
