 Madam Speaker, for far too long, pregnant  workers in our country have lacked reasonable accommodations at their  workplaces. They need to keep their jobs to ensure economic security  for themselves and their families. Yet, without reasonable  accommodations they could risk their health and safety. I am proud to  cosponsor the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which would right this  wrong. This bill would require employers to make reasonable  accommodations for pregnant workers who need them. Without this  legislation, some may continue to work in unsafe conditions. Currently,  pregnant workers might be let go or forced into unpaid leave, just for  asking for reasonable accommodations. Some may quit their job to avoid  risking the health of their pregnancy. This is unacceptable. Pregnant  workers deserve better. They deserve these commonsense protections.  That is why I am proud to cosponsor and vote for this bill today.
