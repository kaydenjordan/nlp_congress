 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill,  which seeks to address our national mental health and substance use  crisis. I thank Congressman Pallone for this package of bills, which  includes my bill, H.R. 7105, known as the STOP Act.   The STOP Act advances a comprehensive and effective national effort  on underage drinking prevention, which includes a national adult- oriented media campaign and grants for community-based prevention  coalitions.   The legislation recognizes the importance of alcohol regulation and  the fact that alcohol is different than other consumer products and is  best regulated by states, consistent with the 21st Amendment.   Since the passage of the original STOP Act in 2006, we have witnessed  a 12.7 percent decrease in alcohol use amongst 12-to-20-year-olds. Yet,  alcohol continues to be the most widely used substance amongst youth,  accounting for 3,900 deaths and 225,000 years of potential life lost  annually.   We must continue to lead efforts to reduce underage alcohol use and  ensure the safety of our youth. I urge my colleagues to vote YES on  this bill.
