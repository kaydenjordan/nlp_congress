 Mr. Speaker, I thank our co-anchors and all the Members  who spoke.   I send one very clear message: The actions of the Tennessee  Legislature led by the GOP were a direct assault on our democracy and  on people's duly elected Representatives. It smacks of overt racism  that they would expel two of the youngest Black men in their body for  simply speaking on behalf of their constituents.   This is still an ongoing threat that we should be concerned about  because what happened in the Tennessee Legislature was a blow to our  democracy, and if it can happen in Nashville, it can happen in  communities all over our country.   This should concern every American, including my Republican  colleagues, because the hallmark of a vibrant and healthy democracy is  the very thing that the Republicans in the Tennessee Legislature shut  down: freedom of speech.   The Congressional Black Caucus won't stand by and allow another Jim  Crow era to take root while GOP legislatures abuse their power, as we  saw in Tennessee.   We stand with the ``Tennessee Three.'' We stand with the parents  calling for gun violence to end in their communities. We stand for free  speech. We stand for our democracy.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
