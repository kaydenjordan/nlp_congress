 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Yorkville  Village, Ohio, Council Member Ron Emerson for his commitment to the  community and for the years he has served as a public servant.   Mr. Emerson has served the people of Yorkville, Ohio, for 56 years.  He was first elected to the Yorkville Village Council in 1963 and  worked tirelessly to help the people of his hometown.   During his tenure, he has supported many civic improvements, secured  new  [[Page H2936]]  equipment for the police and fire departments, and even helped secure a  World War II cannon for the local war memorial.   When Mr. Emerson is not serving the people of Yorkville, he can often  be found at Ohio Stadium cheering on the Ohio State Buckeyes football  team.   Yorkville will be better off for generations to come thanks to Mr.  Emerson's service, and I am proud to call him not only a constituent,  but a friend.   I applaud Mr. Emerson's commitment to making a difference in his  community, and I urge my colleagues to join me in acknowledging his  service.                            ____________________
