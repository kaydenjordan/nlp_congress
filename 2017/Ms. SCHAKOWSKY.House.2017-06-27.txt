 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1215.   My Republican colleagues seem to have a fixation with caps. In their  healthcare bill, they slash Medicaid and, for the first time in its  history, cap Federal funding. The result: hospital closures,  reimbursement and staffing cuts, reduced access, and lower quality.  Now, in this bill, they want to impose another cap, a cap on  noneconomic damages for injured healthcare consumers.   So who will be hurt?   It will be people like the 76-year-old woman whose tailbone had to be  removed because her bed sores went untreated for 12 days or an 81-year- old resident who died because her ventilator was dislodged, alarms  sounded, and no one responded.   How about the family of a 92-year-old man who died after suffering  from malnutrition and dehydration and was found with live insects in  his eyes and mouth?   How do we put a $250,000 value on those injured?   Besides, this is a solution looking for a problem. There is no  medical malpractice lawsuit crisis. Between 2000 and 2015, the number  of claims dropped more than 40 percent and the amount paid fell 23  percent.   But we do face a medical crisis. Nearly half a million Americans die  every year from preventable medical errors, and many more are  permanently injured. This bill does nothing to solve that problem.  Instead, it just takes away the right of the injured consumers.                                time  1300    And if you believe that average Americans should not be barred from  the justice system as they seek to hold wrongdoers accountable, then  you must oppose this bill.
