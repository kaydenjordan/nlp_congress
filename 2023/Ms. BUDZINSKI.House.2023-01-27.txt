 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the first time as the  proud Representative of Illinois' 13th Congressional District. For  those of you who don't know me yet, Mr. Speaker, I am Nikki Budzinski,  and I am honored to serve the people of central and southern Illinois.   I am a trade unionist who came to Congress because too many Americans  work hard every day and still find themselves struggling to make ends  meet.   I am here to work across the aisle on commonsense solutions for  working families in the heartland. This week, I was appointed to serve  on the House Agriculture Committee and the House Committee on Veterans'  Affairs--two places where bipartisanship is still very much alive.   I am ready to get to work on the farm bill that supports Illinois  agriculture and the family farmers who  [[Page H475]]  keep our communities fed and our cars fueled.   I am eager to advocate for the heroes who put their lives on the line  to protect our families and our future. I look forward to bringing  voices from all of our communities to Congress as we tackle the most  important issues facing our country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank them for trusting me to represent them.                            ____________________
