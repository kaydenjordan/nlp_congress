 Madam President, I am pleased to rise today and join my  colleagues from West Virginia and Mississippi, and I join them to, once  again, call attention to the disastrous effects of President Biden's  price hikes and his policies.   Americans are facing soaring inflation that has not been seen in  generations. Price increases families are seeing at the grocery store,  at the pump, in monthly electric bills, and for basic housing needs  have far outpaced wage gains and left Americans struggling to make ends  meet.   The numbers speak for themselves. In 2022, annual average inflation  reached 8 percent, the highest level in 40 years. Rather than working  to solve the problem, the Biden administration seems set on making it  worse. You don't need to look any further than your kitchen to find the  latest example.   In 2022, the food-at-home price index, which measures grocery prices,  rose 18.6 percent--18.6 percent--reaching heights not seen since the  Carter administration. This rise in food prices is directly related to  increases in the cost of production faced by our hard-working farmers  and ranchers.   These increases are driven by the Biden administration's continued  regulatory overreach, failure to empower our domestic energy producers,  and failed economic policies. Our producers are facing increased prices  for diesel fuel, fertilizer, and for crop protection products, and  more. New regulations from this administration threaten to drive up the  cost of production even further.   The recently published ``Waters of the United States,'' or WOTUS, is  a prime example of regulations that will stifle our agriculture and  energy industries and make inflation worse. Instead of this disastrous  rule--this WOTUS rule--we should take a States-first approach to  protect our land and water that respects private property rights. This  comes on top of the administration's misguided approach to domestic  energy production, which has caused us to increase our reliance on  foreign energy suppliers, which has increased the price of the gallon  of gasoline by more than $1 since the administration took office--more  than $1 a gallon.   We should be empowering our domestic energy producers, including  those in my State of North Dakota, to restore our energy independence,  reduce our reliance on foreign oil imports, create more jobs here at  home, and help reduce prices for consumers. We need to unleash  America's vast energy reserves. That is the right solution to lower  prices and help provide hard-working families and businesses relief  from the record inflation that has been caused by the policies of the  Biden administration.   The Biden administration needs to stop doubling down on failed  economic policies. The administration needs to get government out of  the way and focus on the fundamentals. That includes increased domestic  energy production, securing our border, and taking meaningful action to  reduce inflation.   I yield the floor.                                  S. Res. 21
