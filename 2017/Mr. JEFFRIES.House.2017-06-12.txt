 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands for yielding, and for the phenomenal job that you  have done, along with my classmate, the distinguished gentleman from  Texas, Representative Marc Veasey.   As you know, I have great affection for the fact that you have a  significant connection to Brooklyn. We say back home, there are two  types of Americans: those who live in Brooklyn, and those who want to  live in Brooklyn.   But, certainly, this is a significant issue, that the Congressional  Black Caucus has gathered here today to discuss during this hour of  power, the opportunity for members of the Congressional Black Caucus to  speak directly to the American people on an issue of great  significance.   Since January 20, we have seen a disturbing increase here in America  in anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Black, anti-LGBT, and anti-Semitic  acts.   And the question is: Is this just a coincidence, or could it possibly  have something to do with the election of the 45th President of the  United States of America?   Now, in part, what we are seeing is connected to a historic backlash  that has often occurred throughout this journey that we have been on  here in America, that whenever we make significant progress, there is  always a backlash amongst some in America who have got a problem with  the fact that we have done things designed to be more consistent with  our values of liberty and justice for all, equal protection under the  law.   We know slavery was the original sin here in America. That was  corrected in the aftermath of the North's victory during the Civil War.  We had the reconstruction amendments: the 13th Amendment, abolish  slavery; 14th Amendment, equal protection under the law; 15th  Amendment, the right to vote regardless of race. That was progress in  America followed by the inevitable backlash.   The imposition of Jim Crow laws; a lynching epidemic; Black code,  segregation, particularly through just the Deep South. Progress  followed by backlash.   And then finally, in the 1960s, in an effort to create a more perfect  union and address the unfinished business in America, you had the civil  rights movement, anchored with the `64 Civil Rights Act, effectively  ended Jim Crow; the `65 Voting Rights Act, giving African Americans in  the Deep South, people of color throughout the country the right to  vote, unimpeded from things like grandfather clauses, and poll taxes,  and other types of shenanigans that people were practicing; the 1968  Fair Housing Act capped off the civil rights movement, followed by the  inevitable backlash.   Richard Nixon ran a racist campaign, a southern strategy, designed to  appeal to aggrieved Whites in parts of this country, particularly in  the Deep South, ushered in an era of resistance to the progress that  had been made, antibusing, antiaffirmative action.   And then, of course, we have got Barack Obama who was elected in what  many of us viewed as an incredible step in the right direction. African  Americans, having gone from the outhouse to the White House. Eight  years of tremendous progress in moving this country forward, followed  by the election of Donald Trump, a man who spent 5 years perpetrating  the racist lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of  America.   And many of us are wondering, why were so many people who worship at  the altar of White supremacy drawn to Donald Trump's campaign? What was  it about this individual that so many folks dripping in hatred flocked  to his candidacy? That is not to say that everyone who voted for Donald  Trump is a racist. We do know that every racist in America voted for  Donald Trump. That is a problem.   And so, again, I just ask the question in closing: Is this all a big  coincidence? We know part of it is the backlash that has often occurred  whenever we have made progress in America. But this President has a  responsibility to address the rise in hate crimes that have taken place  on his watch, whether or not his election is directly connected to it.   Many of us have our own suspicions, but he is the Commander in Chief.                                time  2000    He has got to tell his Attorney General, who is straight out of  central casting in terms of the good old boys: Your job as chief law  enforcement officer in the land is to enforce the laws whether you like  them or not.    In closing, Mr. Speaker, I will simply say that every  single thing that has been said--and I would urge you to challenge  anything as a fact. In fact, there are facts that have been left out in  terms of my remarks about the 45th President of the United States. I  have actually been kind of gentle as it relates to the person who is  occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue right now, but more to come. I would  welcome the Speaker to dispute anything that has been said in the name  of us trying to move this country forward consistent with the notions  of equal protection under the law and liberty and justice for all.
