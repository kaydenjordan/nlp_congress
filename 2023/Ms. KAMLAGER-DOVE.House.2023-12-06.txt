 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 30-year  anniversary of A Place Called Home, a nonprofit that has served  thousands of at-risk youth and families in the South Los Angeles  community.   A Place Called Home provides free programs that focus on job  readiness and mental health services as well as art and technology. It  allows children to explore creativity through their arts programming.   Earlier this year, they hosted the Latinx Theater Festival in honor  of Hispanic Heritage Month, where the children helped with ticketing,  light, and sound design for the productions.   A Place Called Home aims to increase children's likelihood of staying  in school and graduating, and in the past 30 years, it has supported  more than 500 first-generation students in their journey to college.   They serve 2,000 meals to students every week on top of the thousands  more they provide to families at home in California's 37th District.  None of this would be possible without their founder, Debrah Constance,  and CEO Norayma Cabot, who work tirelessly with the board and staff  every day to support my district's children and families.   I hope you will join me in celebrating this milestone for A Place  Called Home, and I look forward to seeing all that they do in the next  30 years and beyond.                Honoring the Life and Legacy of Mike Watanabe     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Mike Watanabe. He passed away last month after 77 years full  of life.   Mike began his service to the Los Angeles community when he joined  the Asian American Drug Abuse Program as a counselor in 1975. He saw  the impact that drug use had on his friends and community in the wake  of the Vietnam war and wanted to find a way to advocate for recovery  after earning his master's degree in social work. He became the  executive director in 1982 before ascending to the role of president  and CEO in 2004.   Through his decades of service with AADAP, he worked with community  leaders to support substance abuse recovery. AADAP's efforts have  served residents in California's 37th District for over 50 years.   Mike is remembered for his compassion, leadership, and unwavering  belief in building a supportive community.   My friend Mike always kept it 100. He built a family at AADAP and  throughout the Los Angeles area. Mike was a part of the Los Angeles  County Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Commission for 16 years, chairing  the Asian and Pacific Islander Constituent Committee and supporting  several other AAPI-focused organizations all aimed at substance abuse  recovery.   His support of early Asian-American community organizations left a  lasting impact on the success of today's nonprofits and Asian-American  services. We are all the better for having been impacted by Mike's  jovial spirit and passion for community service. He will be greatly  missed.   Please take a moment to honor the life of Mike Watanabe. My heart is  with his wife, Suzanne, and their family during this time.                           GOP Threat to Democracy     Mr. Speaker, I rise today for a moment of truth.  House Republicans pose a deep threat to our national security. It is  dependent on what we do domestically and upon how we support our allies  abroad, like Ukraine.   Ukraine will not be able to fend off Russia on its own, and  Republicans will be responsible if they refuse to act to counter war  criminal Putin's anti-West, anti-democracy assault.   I guess that makes sense, since the Republican Party has pledged  fealty to Donald Trump, a master anarchist who is focused on government  destruction, exploding democracy, and distracting and impoverishing the  American people. He is someone who just 2 weeks  [[Page H6155]]  ago called people vermin. He is using white supremacist code words.   The global stage is watching us because they are all in for Ukraine  and democracy, but Republican isolationism has hurt and will continue  to destabilize our democracy, weaken our allies, and remove the United  States from the global stage. When we leave, someone far more dangerous  will take our place and hurt us more.   No more distractions, conflations, or profligations. Mr. Speaker, the  time to get serious about this country is right now.                            ____________________
