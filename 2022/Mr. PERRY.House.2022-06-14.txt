 Madam Speaker, Supreme Court Justices are already  protected. Really? Really? They are already protected?   The Speaker said no one is in danger, no one is in danger after an  assassination attempt. I don't know if I would feel very protected. On  the very day of the assassination attempt, in violation of the law,  protesters are at the very house of the Supreme Court Justice being  intimidated by protesters.   The Speaker says that no one is in danger. I don't want to engage in  personalities, so I might say a high-ranking official on the other side  of the Capitol here said: You have released the whirlwind; you don't  know what will hit you. And then down the street, Pennsylvania Avenue,  a high-ranking official said there might be a mini-revolution.   Does that not sound like intimidation to you? It sure sounds like it  to me. I don't know what my friends on the other side of the aisle want  to happen. I don't know. I am not in their heads, and I am not in their  hearts. But I listen to what they say, and I watch what they do. We  should have passed this much longer ago when it was available to us,  and the fact that we didn't might be the cause for people to come to  assassinate a United States Supreme Court Justice.   This is not a third-world country. If you don't get your way, you  don't blow up the Court and kill the Justices. But, apparently, that is  what some people in America think is appropriate. It is not  appropriate. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
