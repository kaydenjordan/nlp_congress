 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate the 10th  anniversary of Moses Lake Baptist Church and to sincerely thank them  for their contributions to the Moses Lake community.   Madam Speaker, central Washingtonians are people of deep and sincere  faith. We know firsthand that churches and faith-based organizations  like the Moses Lake Baptist Church are fundamental to the well-being  and very fiber of our local communities.   From performing acts of service, to ensuring the spiritual and  emotional health of their congregants, particularly during the  challenging times of the past year, Moses Lake Baptist Church goes  above and beyond to deliver the Word of God to individuals  [[Page H873]]  and families throughout central Washington.   Madam Speaker, I have personally experienced the kindness and prayers  of the leadership, including Pastor Dennis Fountain and the  congregation at the church. I know firsthand how they spread the  message of love through God's teachings.   Madam Speaker, as we celebrate 10 years of faithful service, I extend  my congratulations to Moses Lake Baptist Church and wish them many more  decades of blessing our community.                            ____________________
