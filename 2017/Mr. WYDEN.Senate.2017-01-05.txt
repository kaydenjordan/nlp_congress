 Madam President, I want to begin my remarks this morning  by taking stock of how the 115th Congress, led by my Republican  colleagues, seems to be coming out of the gate. Here is what is coming  if the budget process that began this week plays out: 30 million  Americans from Portland, OR, to Portland, ME, will be in danger of  being kicked off their health care plans; sharply rising health care  costs for everybody else, even those who get their insurance through  their employer; broken campaign promises about a replacement coming on  day one. With this resolution, Republicans in the Congress are building  a Trojan horse of tax cuts for the most fortunate in America.   I want to discuss each of those issues this morning, but first let us  recognize the bottom line. What is at stake in this debate is whether  or not America is going to go back to the dark days when health care  was reserved for the healthy and wealthy. For nearly 7 years and  through 4 punishing campaigns, Americans have heard and felt the  steady, partisan drumbeat of repeal and replace from the other side.  Dozens and dozens of show votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act have  been held in either Chamber. There have been countless press  conferences, speeches, and hearings, even a government shutdown, and  the message is always the same. The President-elect himself said that  repeal and replace would happen--his words, not mine--simultaneously.   The replacement plan was coming. It would be fully written, ready to  plug in--no gap, no harm relevant to anyone in our country. The same  words, ``Coming Soon,'' have sat on that marquee for 7 years now. It  seems to me it is time to admit that the show will not open. This is a  broken promise, plain and simple. Americans are no longer looking at  repeal and replace; now it is repeal and run. The consequences will be  serious and immediate for tens of millions of Americans, both in access  to health care and the bottom line for family budgets across the  country. In short, it is a plan that will make America sick again.  According to independent analysis, nearly 30 million Americans will  lose their health insurance quickly after repeal. The first act of a  new Congress: Kicking 30 million people off the insurance rolls--that  is seven times the population of my home State.    The overwhelming majority of those 30 million Americans are not  wealthy people. They are not in a position to be able to afford to go  out and pick an expensive plan once the insurance companies get back in  the driver's seat. Millions come from working families who will lose  tax cuts for health insurance. Millions of others toil, often working  multiple jobs, but still what they bring home is just barely enough to  keep them out of poverty.   For many, signing up for Medicaid brought an end to the years when  they had to choose between visiting a doctor and putting food on the  table. If repeal goes forward, Americans all over the country are going  to face that dilemma once again. I think it is important to remember  that the danger of repeal does not end with Americans getting kicked  off their insurance plans.   Repeal will send costs skyrocketing for everyone across the board,  even those Americans who get their insurance through work, including a  lot of folks who say the Affordable Care Act has not touched them at  all. They are going to get a gut punch, a gut punch with higher  premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs. When you kick tens of millions  off the insurance rolls and send the markets into chaos, there is going  to be a ripple effect. Everyone is going to feel those harmful effects,  even those who have had the same plan from a particular employer for  years or decades. Rising costs are going to eat into paychecks,  crowding out the pay raises that our people need so desperately.   Colleagues, if you are watching this budget debate at home, I am sure  you are going to say: Why in the world would any lawmaker go forward  with this plan? I am going to go back to what I just said. In my view,  this is a Trojan horse of tax cuts for the wealthy and the most  fortunate.   When you look at both sides of the ledger, you see how exceptionally  unfair this scheme actually is. On one  [[Page S86]]  side, tens of millions of Americans lose insurance and suffer economic  pain. That is the typical family. On the other side, there are  substantial tax breaks for those at the top of the income scale.   One of the questions I am asked nearly every day in these halls, and  I am asked this by many in the press and elsewhere, is whether  Democrats are going to take part in this effort and what ideas  Democrats would put forward. I want to take just a minute to describe  why that question is so off the mark. First, you have to look at the  nature of the reconciliation process itself. Budget reconciliation is  inherently a partisan exercise. Inherently, it is not a process that  brings people together. It is a process that drives people apart. It is  inherently partisan.   A typical proposal that comes to the Senate floor is subject to  unlimited debate and unlimited amendments. Usually it takes 60  Senators, Members from both parties to come together and pass  legislation. It is very rare that a party builds that kind of  supermajority on its own, so the two sides have to work together. That  is the Senate at its best.   I see my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee,  Senator Enzi. He and I have served on the Finance Committee. At its  best, that is what the Finance Committee has always been about--trying  to find common ground, working together to get a proposal that can get  60 votes.   Reconciliation throws those unique characteristics of bringing  Senators together; basically, reconciliation just trashes it, throws it  out the window. In my view, when you use reconciliation the way it is  being used here, you are telling the other party you neither need nor  want their votes. It puts a one-sided proposal on the fast track to  passage, tight limits on debate and amendments, a bare majority of  votes required to actually pass it.   I am very concerned that what is at issue now is a serious misuse of  the reconciliation process. This is not a simplified procedure to  address a budget issue; this is an effort to ram through repeal and  run. Second, this is not your run-of-the-mill congressional debate  where you have both sides bringing their best ideas forward to tackle a  policy issue.   For years, my Democratic colleagues and I have said that we are ready  to work on a bipartisan basis to solve this country's health care  challenges. I think I have spent about as much time as anybody in the  Senate working to try to find bipartisan solutions to the country's big  health challenges. Back in 2008, 2009, we had a bipartisan proposal:  seven Democrats, seven Republicans. We had never had that before. I can  tell you, we Democrats are ready to work on a bipartisan basis to solve  the country's health care challenges.   For me, essentially what I have tried to make my top priority for  public service--health care is one-sixth of the American economy. It  has always been the issue that Americans care the most about because if  you and your loved ones don't have health, nothing else much matters.  So we ought to be working on a bipartisan basis to solve the country's  health care challenges, finding ways to bring costs down for families,  making prescription drugs more affordable, upholding the promise of  Medicare, and strengthening its guaranteed benefits.   When I was director of the Gray Panthers at home, a senior citizens  group, we always said that Medicare was a promise. It was a promise of  guaranteed benefits. We ought to strengthen that promise, particularly  updating it to incorporate changes in the program that reflect the  needs of the Americans who face chronic health conditions, which is  where the vast majority of Medicare dollars are going.   That is what we ought to be doing, upholding the promise of Medicare,  working together in a bipartisan way. But that is not what is happening  here. From the other side, what we have heard again and again is repeal  and replace, dozens of partisan votes producing legislation that burned  out in the Senate or met the veto pen.   Now, with a new administration, the Trump administration coming in,  the Republicans kick off a procedural scheme that slashes taxes for the  most fortunate, raises costs for typical Americans, and takes insurance  coverage away from tens of millions of people. No Democrat is going to  buy in to that proposition. The reason they won't is that the American  people are not going to buy into that proposition.   This scheme is going to bring on a manufactured crisis that does harm  to millions of Americans across the land, rocks our health care sector,  our providers, our plans--all of those who make up this health care  system. One side is pushing it, but the other side is saying: No, let's  not create this catastrophe.   That is why, in my view, the questions about Democrats signing on to  flawed, bad proposals miss the point. Everyone recognizes that the  strict and immovable strategy adopted by the other side 8 years ago  paid dividends in elections. But politics is different from governing.  Politics is different from governing because there are serious life- and-death consequences to actions that deprive Americans of health  insurance. Families are going to feel economic pain when premiums and  deductibles jump.   I believe Americans are going to speak out. They are going to rally  against an unfair, unbalanced bill that cuts taxes for the most  fortunate, while putting insurance companies back again in the driver's  seat. What is at stake here is pretty simple; it is whether or not  America is going to turn back the clock and go back to those dark days  when health care in our Nation was reserved for the healthy and the  wealthy.   My colleagues and I say no way. We are going to fight that unfair,  imbalanced approach in every way we can.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?   If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  legislative fellows in my office be given floor privileges for the  remainder of this Congress: Sophia Vogt, Emily Douglas, Kripa Sreepada,  Katherine Tsantiris, Chris Jones, and Noah Ben-Aderet.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
