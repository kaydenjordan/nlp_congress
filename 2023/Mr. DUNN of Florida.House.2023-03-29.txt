 Madam Chair, I rise today to express my support  for H.R. 1.   With this bill, the days of America's dependence on imported energy  are beginning to come to a close.   Under President Biden, gas prices have skyrocketed, leases for oil  and gas have been canceled, and electricity prices have soared.   Thankfully, multiple committees have come together to provide a  multilateral solution to these problems.   When H.R. 1 becomes law, it will lower energy costs and unleash  American energy, providing clarity for critical infrastructure  investors.   It will streamline energy permitting and exports and repeal the new  natural gas tax imposed by the Biden administration.   House Republicans are delivering on our promise to reestablish the  days of American energy independence.   Importantly, H.R. 1 slashes burdensome regulations that make it  difficult and unappealing to build in America.   Eliminating these barriers in conjunction with comprehensive  permitting reform will reverse the Biden administration's radical  energy policies that destroyed American dominance in the energy space  and compromised our national security.   Simply put, H.R. 1 will unleash American innovation and unlock  American resources for future generations.   I look forward to voting ``yea'' on H.R. 1, and I encourage my  colleagues to do the same.
