 Mr. Speaker, it is always a privilege to share the  Chamber with my fellow Northwesterner.   We have gone through this in the Ways and Means Committee with one of  the least productive hearings I can remember, and that says a lot in my  10 years on the committee. We do it good natured, but, frankly, it is  beside the point. And my friends from the Ways and Means Committee have  documented the fact that this is a solution in search of a problem.   The real outrage ought to be what is happening now behind closed  doors to take a flawed bill that came from the House, was actually made  worse in order to get the votes for it, and passed through on a narrow  party-line vote--actually, a number of Republicans voted against it-- lodged in the Senate, no public hearings. In fact, we are told that  they are not enabling people to actually get ahold of the documents to  know what is going on.   You know, it is stunning to me to have heard some of my Republican  friends complain about the process of the Affordable Care Act. I was in  the middle of that. We took a year. Three committees in the House had  multiple hearings, work sessions. There were actually some Republican  amendments adopted out in the open. CBO scored the bill so people knew.  Now we are on the verge of, we are told, having that sneak through the  Senate without the glare of publicity, without an open public process,  which will deny healthcare to millions of people--millions of people-- and shred much of the good work that has been done through the  Affordable Care Act.                                time  1415    We have been told and we acknowledge there are little things that we  could do to fine-tune it, but in 7 years of Republican crow and crow,  we have never had an opportunity to do that. Instead, this  administration and my Republican friends consistently made it worse,  destabilized, sent conflicting signals to the healthcare industry, to  the insurance companies. And you don't have to take my word for it.  News accounts quote people in the industry about what the Republicans  have done to destabilize it and try to make it fail.   There was a reason that virtually everybody in the healthcare space  was opposed to the Republican approach. It is not thoughtful. It is not  fair. It is not effective. It is not necessary. But today we are  looking at some provisions that will make it a little more burdensome.    Mr. Speaker, there may be some people that will be  swept up who had gotten care that they didn't, but there will be people  who will be swept up who were entitled to care who could not jump  through the hurdles or, at a minimum, had their care delayed. We  haven't properly analyzed that. But as I say, it is beside the point.   There are tremendous opportunities for us to work together on a  bipartisan agenda that we have in the Ways and Means Committee, of  things that we could move forward and agree upon to make healthcare  better, that doesn't depend on shredding the guarantees of the ACA;  that doesn't depend on gutting Medicaid, which more Americans rely upon  for their healthcare than any other program in the country. We wouldn't  have to mess with that.   Instead, we are having a sideshow. I don't know that it goes  anywhere, but it certainly isn't the issue that Americans could focus  on, should focus on, that is going to imperil their healthcare for tens  of millions of Americans if the Republicans have their way.   That is exactly why we are debating this today, to deflect attention,  occupy time, and prevent doing the job that we should have done right  here, and allow the Senate to be able to continue this unfortunate  process.
