 Mr. Speaker, as we recognize National  Police Week, we honor the brave men and women who keep our families  safe every day and pay respect to all those who have lost their lives  in the line of duty.   Unfortunately, Biden and extreme House Democrats have supported  defunding the police. Violent crimes have skyrocketed under Biden.  Homicides are up 13 percent, aggravated assaults are up 34 percent, and  rapes are up 24 percent.   2021 was the deadliest year in two decades for law enforcement  officers. Our family appreciates the town of Springdale Police Chief  ``Bear'' Richbourg and Lexington County Sheriff Jay Koon, who was just  recognized as Sheriff of the Year.   This week House Republicans voted on legislation supporting law  enforcement. Sadly, Biden allows terrorists to cross the border,  putting families everywhere under greater risk of the threat of mass  murder more than ever.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
