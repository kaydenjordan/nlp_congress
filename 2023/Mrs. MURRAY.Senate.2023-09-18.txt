 Madam President, having notified the Senate under rule V  of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I move to suspend rule XVI for  consideration of amendment No. 1092 to H.R. 4366.                                Cloture Motion    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call for the cloture motion filed today, Monday,  September 18, be waived.    For the information of all Senators, last week, an  overwhelming 91 Senators voted to begin debate on the bipartisan  appropriations package. This is a package of bills which--each one of  them passed the Appropriations Committee unanimously.   We have been working very hard in a bipartisan effort and in good  faith to set up a very robust process for amendments and for debate.  Unfortunately, a few Senators decided to object to us last week, and  now we are moving forward.   I would say a lot of Senators have come to me and others and spoken  on the floor about how much they hate doing a gigantic omnibus at the  end of the year. We have been working really hard on this package to  make sure we don't get stuck doing that once again. So if everyone is  serious about wanting to show that this place can actually work, well,  now is the time to come together to make sure we can do that.   We cannot let a few Senators toss out months of hard work to move us  closer to regular order and abandon an overwhelmingly bipartisan effort  to do something as basic as funding our government and then put us on a  collision course for another huge omnibus. That is why we are filing  for a necessary procedural vote today that we will vote on later this  week that will keep this bipartisan process on track.   Madam President, I would inform Senators that as we wait for this  vote to ripen, we are continuing to work through a list of amendments  and a package of amendments that we can approve as soon as we can get  the necessary votes to get back on the bill.   I yield the floor.
