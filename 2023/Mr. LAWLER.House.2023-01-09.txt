 Mr. Speaker, only in Washington can one defend doubling  the size of the IRS and spending $80 billion to hire 87,000 new IRS  agents.   According to my friends across the aisle, that is a good thing  because the billionaires and the millionaires don't pay their fair  share. Yet, according to the IRS, the top 25 percent of income earners  pay 89 percent of all income taxes.   Does anyone really believe that the 87,000 new IRS agents and  employees are going to really stop there? Of course not.   How else will the Democrats fund their out-of-control and reckless  spending? There aren't enough billionaires and millionaires in the  United States to pay for it.   My friends on the other side will do what they always do. They will  target hardworking taxpayers, families, and small businesses that are  the lifeblood of our economy. It has to stop.   Coming from a State like New York, we need to cut taxes. We need to  reduce the cost of living and make it more affordable for our  hardworking families.   Mr. Speaker, I proudly support this legislation and urge all of my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' and end the 87,000 new IRS agents that are  going to terrorize hardworking Americans.                                time  2030
