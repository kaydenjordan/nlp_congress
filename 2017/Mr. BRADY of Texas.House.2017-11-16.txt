Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Holding) for his leadership on this issue, in particular,  about international competitiveness for our workers. Residence-based  taxation is an idea we should continue to explore. We will continue to  work on this issue with him as leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that the  average family of four in the Fifth District of Georgia will see a tax  cut of $1,484.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Curbelo), who has been an advocate not only for Floridians but Puerto  Rico and a number of our families and communities around the country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. I would  note that families in Connecticut's First District will see an average  tax cut of $3,858 and grow jobs by 11,000 jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Curbelo).   Mr. Curbelo, you and Resident Commissioner Gonzalez-Colon have been  tireless advocates for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. I appreciate  the hard work you have done to help our fellow citizens on the island.  I agree, this tax reform bill is a good first step, and I look forward  to working with you on ideas to best serve the people on this island.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that families  of four, the average family in Oregon's Third District, will see a tax  cut of $2,200.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Hensarling), who is the chairman of the Financial Services Committee  and a dear friend of mine.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that the  average family of four in the Third District of Wisconsin will see a  tax cut of over $2,000.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot), who is the chairman of the Small Business Committee and a  champion for small businesses.                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Walker).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Buchanan), chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Harris).    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland  for yielding.   The intent of our tax reform bill is to achieve tax relief for  individuals at every income level in every State.   I agree with the gentleman, there are still some areas where we will  and can  [[Page H9403]]  make improvements. If the gentleman is willing to help us continue to  move this process forward today, I am happy to commit to working with  him to ensure we reach a positive outcome for his constituents to  reconcile our differences with the Senate.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   So I note that constituents in the 18th District of Texas, the past  speaker's district, that average families will see a tax cut of nearly  $1,000, and Texas will grow 81,000 new jobs and see higher paychecks as  a result of this tax reform bill.   We are proposing a Tax Code so fair and simple, 9 out of 10 Americans  will be able to file using a simple postcard system. There is a  fairness and equality for each American--knowing what each others'  deductions are because we have exactly the same ones.   This simplicity, this fairness, these larger paychecks, this is what  the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young).    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to work with the  gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) on this important issue for the  Alaska Native community. Under the tax bill, Alaska Native Settlement  Trusts would be unintentionally subject to a higher tax rate.   I thank him for bringing this to my intention. I assure him that I  will focus on this in conference as we finalize individual rate  structures between the House and the Senate. I also look forward to  working with him to advance the provisions of his bill in this  important area.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this historic legislation before us today represents a  crucial step to fulfilling our tax reform promise to the American  people, but it is not the final step. We are Republicans. We believe  the Tax Code doesn't belong to Washington. It belongs to the American  people. We will continue to work to make it better and improve at every  step of the way.   Before I make final remarks, I want to thank all of our Ways and  Means Committee members who have done so much and worked so hard, as  well as every Member of this House who helped make this opportunity  real for the American people.   I also want to say how grateful I am to everyone at the nonpartisan  Joint Committee on Taxation and the House Office of the Legislative  Counsel. Their careful analysis contributed so much to this bill.   Finally, I want to give special recognition to Barbara Angus, the  chief tax counsel on the Ways and Means Committee, and all of our staff  on the committee, who put their hearts and their souls and many  sleepiness nights in the development of this bill. I can't thank them  enough for their hard work and dedication.   Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives is, by its very design, the  Chamber of Congress closest to the American people. Today, this House-- the people's House--will pass historic legislation to improve the lives  of Americans nationwide.   For too long, this broken Tax Code has put the needs of the people  second, propping up Washington's special interests at the expense of  hardworking Americans.   For too long, this broken Tax Code has rewarded companies for  outsourcing American jobs instead of encouraging them to create jobs  here at home.   For too long, this broken Tax Code has eroded America's economic  leadership around the world.   This country used to be the standard-bearer worldwide for competitive  tax systems. Not anymore. Now the United States is barely a spec in the  rearview mirrors of so many of our international competitors.   In our businesses, our workers, our Made in America products, which  are the best in the world, are bearing the consequences of Washington's  failure to act. That stops now, and it stops with the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act.   With this historic bill, we will provide real simplicity for every  taxpayer, we will deliver real fairness to every hardworking American,  we will be more competitive than ever, we will win worldwide and here  at home, and we will see better jobs and bigger paychecks in every  community of this great Nation so people can keep more of their hard- earned dollars.   With this bill, we will deliver a new Tax Code built for a new era of  American prosperity.   So to Washington's special interests, who are now being propped up by  absurd carve-outs and loopholes, get ready to stand on your own. To our  international competitors, who are now leading the pack, get ready to  have some company. To the American people, who have waited years for  tax reform, get ready for the tax relief you deserve.   Today, this House--the people's House--is taking action on the most  transformational tax overhaul in a generation, and we are taking action  today. It is time for this old, broken Tax Code to go. It is time to  put the American people first.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our majority whip and a tremendous leader  on tax reform.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McCarthy), our majority leader and a champion for  tax reform.    Mr. Speaker, no one man has plowed the field for  tax reform for more years, more boldly, or more effectively than the  Speaker of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Ryan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
