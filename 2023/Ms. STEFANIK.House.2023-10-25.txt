 Mr. Speaker pro tempore, Mr. Clerk, colleagues, on  behalf of the House Republican Conference, I rise today to nominate the  gentleman from Louisiana,   Mike Johnson, as Speaker of the people's  House.   We convene this esteemed body today at a time of great crisis across  America, a time of unprecedented challenges in this hallowed Chamber,  and a time when the very existence of our most precious ally, Israel,  is under attack from forces of evil.   Yesterday, our dear colleague, our former Conference chair, the chair  of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, nominated    Mike Johnson in our Conference. She put it best when she said:  ``Trust has been broken, and we have come to a standstill. How do we  restore trust between Members, leadership, and ultimately between  Congress and we the people?''   Mrs. McMorris Rodgers noted that there is a sense that it cannot be  business as usual. She said: ``Above the Speaker's chair in the House  Chamber is our Nation's motto, In God We Trust.''   She went on to say: ``The times in which we are living demand  boldness, unity, and transformational leadership that begins with trust  in God and each other. Trust is when the magic happens. In the story of  King David, we are reminded that man looks at the outward appearance,  but the Lord looks at the heart.''   Today is the day that House Republicans will humbly look in our  hearts and elect   Mike Johnson as Speaker of the people's House.   A man of deep faith, Mike epitomizes what it means to be a servant  leader. A deeply respected constitutional lawyer, Mike has dedicated  his life to preserving America's great principles of life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness.   Mike is a titan on the Judiciary Committee and a dedicated member of  the House Armed Services Committee. As vice chair of our Conference, he  has united all of our members to speak clearly and boldly on behalf of  the American people. A friend to all and an enemy to none, Mike is  strong, tough, and fair. Above all, Mike is kind.   At this very moment, this Republican Conference knows that we live in  perilous times and that the American people are hurting. Families are  struggling under the pain of inflation caused by reckless, far-left  spending, unable to afford groceries, heat, or gas.   We have an inhumane open border, with millions illegally smuggled and  trafficked and tens of thousands of children lost in the chasm of the  incompetence and negligence of the Biden administration.   Israel is under attack by Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists committing  atrocities, with Israelis suffering the bloodiest days in modern  memory.   Crime is skyrocketing on our streets, while there are vicious calls  from the left to defund our great men and women in blue.   American energy production has been crushed by Joe Biden's radical,  failed far-left Democrat policies, causing seniors, farmers, and  families to pay more at the pump.   Americans fundamentally understand that the Federal Government has  been illegally weaponized against we the people, shredding the  Constitution, targeting conservatives and parents.   Yes, I will say it again: The Federal Government has been illegally  weaponized against we the people, shredding the Constitution, targeting  conservatives, parents, and even Joe Biden's top political opponents.   The people are looking to this great Chamber to save America, and  save America we will.   As we embark on the path ahead, I am reminded of Galatians 6:9: ``And  let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap if  we do not give up.''   House Republicans and Speaker   Mike Johnson will never give up.  Today is the day we get this done.   May God bless our next Speaker,   Mike Johnson, and may God bless the  United States of America.                                time  1300
