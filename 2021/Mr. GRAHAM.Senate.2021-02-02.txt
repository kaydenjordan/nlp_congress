 Mr. President, I will be responding to my good friend  Senator Sanders. Apparently, I will be the ranking member on Budget; he  will be the chairman. And I look forward to finding some common ground  where we can. Today is not that day, but hope springs eternal. There  are things I think we can do on the Budget Committee that will be good  for the country.   Here is the other side of the story. About a year ago--a little over  a year ago--the pandemic coming out of China was detected, COVID, on  the west coast of the United States. It has just done a number on us as  a nation. Over 440,000 people have died from COVID-related infections.  We finally got vaccines. They are in the pipeline. We need to get them  out quicker, but I do believe that the vaccines are going to help us a  lot.   To the American people who have been suffering, I think better days  lie ahead, but we are not there yet.   But here is what is different. February 2, 2021, things changed. Up  until now, we have been able, as a Congress and with the White House,  to pass things together regarding COVID. We passed over $4 trillion of  COVID relief in a bipartisan fashion up until today. Now, how was that  done?   You had a Republican President--President Trump--working with a  Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-controlled Senate  beginning of January--I guess, March of last year. Here is what we were  able to do together. Phase 1, we approved 96 to 1 the Coronavirus  Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2020. It  was $8 billion. That was early on last year when we really didn't know  what we were dealing with.   Then, we did $355 billion, 90 to 8. Then, the next was $1.9 trillion.  Listen to this: We spent $1.9 trillion, 96 to nothing. So it is not  like we don't see a need to spend money. Ninety-six to nothing, this  body agreed to spend $1.9 trillion last year.   After that, we did the paycheck protection enhancement of $355  billion by voice vote. It is not like people on this side don't see a  need.   We had a continuing resolution where we added another $8 billion, 84  to 10.   In the omnibus, we did another $1.04 trillion, 92 to 6.   So when you add all this up, we have appropriated $4 trillion to deal  with the problems associated with COVID--money for people who have been  struggling, money for hospitals and doctors, money for vaccine  development and distribution, direct payments, the PPP program to keep  small businesses from going under that can't operate at full capacity.  It has been a great program. It was bipartisan until now.   Here is what I want the American people to know: We have done a lot  together, and of the $4 trillion we have appropriated, to date, we have  spent $2.7 trillion.   Of the Federal Reserve actions we took allowing the Federal Reserve  to help business, we had a $5.7 trillion market cap, for lack of a  better term, and we have allocated $2.6 trillion.   The bottom line is, of the $900 billion that we passed recently--a  little over $900 billion--we have only spent 20 percent of the money.  And here we are being asked for another $1.9 trillion.   What is different between the first $1.9 trillion and this request?  When it was first offered, the $1.9 trillion, it was the largest single  appropriation, I think, maybe in the history of the country since World  War II. And the fact that 96 Senators would come together and pass it  96 to nothing tells you about the way we saw the problem. And we have  been adding and adding and adding.   Now we are to a point where the Biden administration is proposing  $1.9 trillion of additional spending. We haven't spent the money we  have allocated--nowhere near the money we have allocated. And you have  a bipartisan group of Republicans--10--who went to the White House  yesterday and said: What about a little over $600 billion? See if that  is enough   I am afraid the answer is going to be no.   So what has happened here? Democratic colleagues have won the White  House. And Biden is President; he won. It is a 50-50 Senate. The Vice  President makes it a Democratic-controlled body, to the extent that the  Vice President breaks ties. And you have a smaller majority in the  House than we have had in the last 20 years. But the consequence of  what I have just described is that my Democratic colleagues are now in  charge of everything.   When it was divided government--when you had a Republican President,  a Republican Senate, and a Democratic House--we were able to come  together with overwhelming votes to help the American people. Now we  find ourselves at a crossroads. Our Democratic colleagues are using a  process called budget reconciliation that begins today that would allow  them to pass the $1.9 trillion basically on a party-line vote--a simple  majority, not reaching the 60-vote milestone.   The 60-vote problem was never a problem up until now because  Republicans and Democrats were able to work together up until now. What  changed? They have got it all. Everything we told you would happen in  the election is coming true. You have one party in control of  Washington, and they are seizing the moment.   What a $15-an-hour minimum wage has to do with fighting COVID, I  don't know. But I do know this, now is the worst possible time to  increase the cost on small businesses in South Carolina in the  restaurant-hospitality industry. You are about to hit them with two  government mandates that are going to put them out of business. They  are all struggling.   A lot of States have reduced capability in terms of indoor dining.  DC, I  [[Page S229]]  think last week, for the first time, you could dine indoors at 25- percent capacity. States all over the country have different rules  about how small business operates.   The tourist industry is just about squashed. So people in the  hospitality industry, in the restaurant business, and in the service  industry, if this bill passes the way it has been proposed, are going  to have a $15-per-hour per-employee mandate. That is going to sink  them. They are going to have to lay a lot of people off because they  are barely making it as it is.   Here is what we are doing to those businesses. State and local  governments are mandating a reduction in revenue. Why? Because you  reduce the capability to earn money by reducing seating capacity and  the other things associated with fighting COVID. So what does the  Congress do? Do we relieve that burden by having more PPP? No. We  increase your cost of doing business.   This $15-an-hour minimum wage increase will dramatically increase the  cost of doing business to small businesses at a time they can afford it  the least. There are people out there working today that will be out of  work tomorrow if this bill passes.   My Democratic colleagues have taken the energy sector head-on. They  stopped the Keystone Pipeline. I don't know how many thousands of jobs  would be affected by that. But all of these mandates and all of these  changes in policies are making it really hard right now to employ  people.   So count me in for more COVID relief once I understand how the money  we have previously allocated has been spent.   I think continuing to spend at this level, without understanding what  the money in the past has done, is not very responsible. We have only  spent 20 percent of the $900 billion we passed just a few weeks ago.  Now we are going to do $1.9 trillion more?   Of the $4 trillion we did together, $2.7 trillion has been spent.  Over $1 trillion is sitting there not spent yet.   So I guess the point I am trying to make, and my Republican  colleagues, is that this $1.9 trillion package, there has been no  effort to make it bipartisan. We are spending a lot more money before  we understand how the money we spent actually works. And some of the  policy provisions in this package, I think, are going to do more damage  to the economy that is struggling to get back on its feet than good.  But they have the power, and they are using it.   He is right, Senator Sanders. When we had this authority, we cut your  taxes through budget reconciliation. That is what we did, so it is not  like Republicans haven't used this process. Democrats used it pretty  much to pass ObamaCare. But this is one area where there has been  pretty much a common view of things.   Taxes are different between Republicans and Democrats. Who decides  what healthcare you get--there are some people like my good friend from  Vermont who wants single-payer healthcare. That is one way of doing it.  I just disagree. Everything is about trying to help people. I don't  doubt the motives; I just doubt where we are headed is a good outcome  for the American people.   So the bottom line is, up until now, we have had bipartisanship when  it comes to COVID relief. The reason that bipartisanship has stopped is  because we have one party in control of the U.S. Senate, the House, and  the White House.   Here is what I think: That is going to end not well because it is not  like we don't want to help people; we just have a different view of how  to help. And we would like to let some of the money we have already  appropriated go to work and see how well it works and fill in gaps  where you need to fill in gaps.   Count me in for more payments, direct payments, beyond $600. Count me  out for giving $2,000 payments to people who make almost $200,000 a  year. I think it needs to be more targeted. I don't mind having more  direct payments; I would like to make it more targeted. And I don't  mind discussing raising the minimum wage when the COVID problem passes  and we get back on our feet; I do mind doubling it in the middle of a  pandemic.   And I do believe that this $1.9 trillion package is going to do more  harm than good to the American economy.   The reason we are having this debate the way we are having this  debate is because they have unlimited power, my Democratic colleagues.   You have chosen to do this. The 10 Republicans who went down to the  White House--I appreciate their effort. Maybe some good will come from  that. But this process we are engaged in today makes me wonder if it  was worth their time. Maybe we can pull a rabbit out of the hat and  find a bipartisan compromise consistent with what we have done over the  last year. If not, we are going to march down the reconciliation road.  We are going to take $1.9 trillion of spending and let one party spend  it. We are going to have one point of view about this money. We are  going to let people spend $1.9 trillion without any input from the  other side of the aisle, in a 50-50 divided Senate.    I don't know what you got from the last election. Here is what I got:  We did better in the House than I thought we would do; President Trump  lost, but it was still a close election from an electoral college point  of view; and the Senate is 50-50. I don't think the message from the  last election was ``We want Democrats to spend $1.9 trillion and deal  Republicans out.'' That is exactly what you are doing.   It would be different if we had had a history over here of trying not  to help. We were able, 96 to 0, to spend $1.9 trillion less than a year  ago. And now we want to spend $1.9 trillion again--after the money  previously allocated hasn't been spent?   All I am suggesting to my Democratic colleagues is, we are going to  have a different view on taxes, and we are going to have a different  view on healthcare, but this is the one area where I really do believe  there is a bipartisan middle ground to be had.   To Senator Sanders, there may come a time where I will work with you  to raise the minimum wage.   The PPP program has been highly successful. The $600 billion proposal  by Republicans has more money for that. It has more direct payments,  but it is more targeted.   Senator Manchin said that he wants more direct payments, but he wants  it targeted to people on the lower economic end.   Mike Rounds--one of our colleagues from South Dakota--got a check.   The bottom line is, I don't mind helping people, but there has to be  some sense that we can't just constantly write checks and hope one day  that doesn't come back to bite us.   One thing about a $15-an-hour minimum wage now--I think what it does  is put pressure on businesses that can't stand any more pressure. It is  going to cost people jobs that have a job. It is going to do more harm  than good in this environment.   When you combine the mandate of increasing wages where the $15 an  hour is the least wage and add what we are doing in terms of  restricting income generation, that is a formula for disaster for small  businesses.   This is it. If this bill passes the way it is written, there are  going to be thousands of people out of work who were previously working  in a small business that is going to fold. How does that help COVID?   If you don't believe that, you are not really walking and talking to  the people out there on the frontlines of this economy. The tourism  industry in Myrtle Beach, SC, has been decimated. You can't fly from  one State to the other without a 2-week quarantine. Hopefully, that  will begin to pass when we get vaccine distribution at a higher level.  But people along the coast of South Carolina in the hospitality tourism  business are hanging by a thread.   The PPP program has been a lifeline. The last $900 billion package  had a new round of PPP money. If we need more money, count me in.  Again, I would like to have a higher direct payment but not to people  who make $150,000, $200,000 in combined income.   This package is going to be devastating to the hospitality service  industry. It is going to take us down a path we haven't gone before,  which is a partisan approach to COVID. And I do believe--and maybe I am  wrong--that with some effort on our part, we can reconcile the  difference between what our Republican colleagues proposed and what  President Biden has proposed and find some middle ground like we have  in the past, but there doesn't seem to be a real effort to do that.   All I can say is that the American people want us to work together  for  [[Page S230]]  their benefit, and this will be the first time that I can recall where  we have spent $1.9 trillion based on one party's view of things. That  is not good. That is a lot of money--and it is so unnecessary.   I would encourage Senator Sanders and my colleagues on the other side  to give a chance to this negotiation and see if we can get there. I  hope we can, but this is not the right way. What we are doing today is  going to set into motion partisanship where there was previous  bipartisanship.   President Biden said he wanted to unify the Nation. You have picked  the one topic that we have been pretty unified on, and you are going to  disrupt that unification.   The first COVID package had a $600 Federal supplement to State  unemployment benefits, and I looked at that. My family was in the  restaurant business. Senator Sanders gave statistics about support of  the public. You are literally paying people more not to work than work.   I want to help people because they are out of work--no fault of their  own because of COVID--but when we went to $600, we were paying people  $23 an hour, I think, in South Carolina not to work. That did not go  over well with the public at large. We are trying to reduce that  Federal supplement down to $300, not $600, to help people who are out  of work but not to incentivize people not to go back to work when the  economy is beginning to open.   In this package, we go back to $400, and it goes all the way to  September, which means it is going to be harder to hire people back  when the economy does show signs of reopening. And it is beginning to  show signs of coming back. The faster the vaccine is distributed, the  more people who get inoculated, the sooner we can go back to business.   I would just say to my Democratic colleagues: You have chosen this  path. All of us are going to vote no to $1.9 trillion in spending--not  because we don't care; it is because we would like to see what the  money we spent in the past is doing before we add another $1.9  trillion.   A lot of the provisions in your proposal, we think, have very little,  if anything, to do with COVID, and it would be unfortunate if we go  down this road. But we are not in charge.   Now, 2022 will be here before you know it. Hopefully, by 2022, we  will have th American people build up immunity to COVID, and our  economy will come back the way it was before the COVID pandemic. Before  the pandemic, the economy was doing well for all sectors of the  American people. I think one of the things that helped was that tax cut  that Senator Sanders opposed. But we can have political debates about  that.    The point I am trying to make is, up until this moment in time, we  have been able to achieve overwhelming bipartisan support dealing with  the COVID problem that we all face. It really is disappointing and  disheartening that we are going to abandon that model when I don't  think we have to. But that will be up to my Democratic colleagues. That  will be up to President Biden.                             Biden Administration    And finally, a message to President Biden: You won; we lost. You are  the legitimate President of the United States. I want to help you where  I can. I just got a briefing about what you are proposing in  Afghanistan. I think it is darned good.   There are plenty of things we can do around here together--on foreign  policy and domestic policy. It doesn't have to be a fight to the death  all the time.   The infrastructure bill is there for the taking. I think most  Americans realize our roads and our bridges and our ports need  upgrading, and count me in for that. There are things that we can do.   President Biden, you can do something too. You can say: Slow down in  the Senate. Slow down in the House. I am going to see if I can find  middle ground.   I am telling you right now that $1.9 trillion being spent the way  this bill envisions is not responsible. We haven't spent the money we  have previously allocated. There is a lot in this bill that will cost  jobs at a time we need jobs, and you are not going to help the COVID  crisis by putting somebody out of work because of a government mandate  that business can't afford to fulfill because they are hanging by a  thread.   We will have some time in the next couple of days to talk about what  is in the package, what is not, our view of how this thing should all  unfold. I will yield back here with a sense of optimism.   To my Republican colleagues who went to talk to the White House,  count me in. If you can work something out, I would like to be able to  help. It is not like there is not some more money that can be spent,  but this approach--the way you are spending the money, the amount of  money in this approach, I think, is going to make this place less  unified. If you are looking for unity, this is a lousy way to get it.   With that, I yield.
