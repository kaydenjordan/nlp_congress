 Madam Speaker, our democracy is precious and it  must be protected. The last administration did test and attack it. We  know we must take action against tyranny. Tyranny battered our doors on  January 6, and on this floor today, we are going to fight back and  strengthen our democracy. This act restores accountability, ensures no  one--no one, not even, and more importantly, never the President--is  above the law.  [[Page H7590]]    Foreign governments are interfering in our elections. The last  President welcomed and clamored for interference in his bid for  reelection. This bill in contrast protects whistleblowers, it roots out  corruption, it prevents Presidential abuses of power to keep our system  of checks and balances sound.   These principles are not partisan, they are simply American. There is  nothing more American than voting for a bill to protect our democracy  and the future of our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I stand and I ask all my colleagues to stand with our  Constitution.
