 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1233 and ask  that it be reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of debate  equally divided.    Mr. President, this is the amendment we are waiting  for. This is a bipartisan amendment. This is so bipartisan that we have  already agreed to a voice vote, so listen carefully. Yes, thank you for  that.   Prepandemic, our public schools had identified about 1.5 million kids  who experience homelessness. That is 2.7 percent of all public school  students. So think about what that means. That was prepandemic. We know  that number is higher now.   Our amendment is pretty simple here. We reallocate less than 1  percent of the funding for the Elementary and Secondary School  Emergency Relief Fund to ensure that homeless youth and kids have the  resources they need to get into and succeed in school.   In Alaska and around the country, the COVID-19 pandemic and economic  downturn have increased the strain on our families and the need for  services. Too many of the kids have left their homes, been pushed out  of their homes, sometimes many of them to escape a dangerous situation.  They are dealing with the challenges of virtual learning. These kids  are worrying about where to sleep at night, how they are going to eat  dinner, if they are going to be safe.   This amendment ensures that these kids, no matter the trauma and the  challenges they face outside of the classroom, will have a safe place  to sleep and access to the wraparound services that they need. We have  a responsibility to ensure that this vulnerable population, many of  whom will be subject to predation, violence, or trafficking, is not  forgotten or left behind.   I would like to yield to my friend and my colleague Senator Manchin.
