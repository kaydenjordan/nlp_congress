 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 72, as  modified, and ask that it be reported by number.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Hagerty] proposes an       amendment numbered 72, as modified.    The amendment is as follows:                       (Purpose: To improve the bill)         At the appropriate place, insert the following:  [[Page S1227]]            SEC. ___. EMERGENCY FOOD AND SHELTER PROGRAM REORGANIZATION.         (a) Emergency Food and Shelter Program National Board.--        (1) In general.--Section 301 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless       Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11331) is amended--        (A) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:        ``(b) Members.--        ``(1) In general.--The National Board shall consist of--        ``(A) the Director;        ``(B) 2 members appointed by the Director in accordance       with paragraph (2);        ``(C) 1 member appointed by the Secretary of Homeland       Security;        ``(D) 1 member appointed by the Secretary of Housing and       Urban Development;        ``(E) 1 member appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture;       and        ``(F) 1 member appointed by the Director of the Office of       Management and Budget.        ``(2) Application for membership.--        ``(A) In general.--In appointing the members described in       paragraph (1)(B), the Director shall select from applications       of individuals seeking to serve as a member on the National       Board.        ``(B) Criteria.--In selecting applications of individuals       under subparagraph (A), the Director shall select the 2 most       qualified individuals who--        ``(i) have not less than 10 years of experience working on       public policy relating to housing and homelessness; and        ``(ii) are not from the same geographic region of the       United States.        ``(3) Conflicts of interest.--An individual may not serve       as a member of the National Board if, during the 5-year       period preceding the first day of service on the National       Board, the individual was an employee of an organization, or       an affiliate of an organization, that, during the preceding 5       fiscal years, received funding under this title.        ``(4) Revolving door.--During the 2-year period following       the final day of service of an individual as a member of the       National Board, the individual may not serve as an employee       of an organization, or an affiliate of an organization, that,       during a fiscal year during which the individual served as a       member of the National Board, received funding under this       title.        ``(5) Term limit.--An individual may not serve as a member       of the National Board for a period of more than 2 years.'';       and        (B) by striking subsection (e).        (2) Current national board members.--With respect to an       individual serving as a member of the Emergency Food and       Shelter Program National Board established under section 301       of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C.       11331) as of the date of enactment of this Act, for the       purpose of section 301(b) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless       Assistance Act of that Act, as amended by this Act, the       individual shall be deemed to have begun service on the Board       on the date of enactment of this Act.

Local boards are encouraged to expand participation of other       private nonprofit organizations on the local board.''.     Mr. President, in the last fiscal year alone,  appropriations to FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Program have  increased by more than 5 times, totaling approximately $1 billion in  the last 2 years alone. Currently, hundreds of millions of taxpayer  dollars appropriated to this program are doled out annually by a  national board comprised of the very same organizations that receive  those funds. This amendment in no way impugns the integrity of the  organizations involved. Rather, it helps them avoid the reputational  risks that can occur when the pitcher is also the umpire.   My amendment is simple and common sense. It will restructure the  Emergency Food and Shelter Program to ensure that the individuals  sitting on that board do not have this obvious conflict of interest.  Instead, the national board composition would be shifted to include  qualified individuals who do not work for the organizations that seek  funding from the board.   At a minimum, Congress must resolve this blatant conflict of interest  within the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, especially given its  dramatic increase in funding in recent years. That is what this  amendment does.   I yield back.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I yield the floor.    Madam President, in February, the Biden administration  argued to the U.S. Supreme Court that title 42 will terminate in May of  2023 with the expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency.   Removing one of the last tools available to Border Patrol agents  during a record-shattering border crisis is intolerable. Congress  should not stand by and refuse to address this obvious problem.   Title 42 authority was initially based on the pandemic, and while I  agree that the pandemic is over, the border crisis and the deadly drug  overdose crisis that it fuels are worse than ever.   Whether to maintain border security policy should not depend on  whether there is a pandemic. That is why I am reintroducing the Stop  Fentanyl Border Crossings Act today. This legislation would preserve  continued use of title 42 authority to combat drug trafficking at the  border.   Clearly, the deadly epidemic has not ended. Deadly fentanyl is  flooding American communities--deadly fentanyl, produced with the help  of the Chinese Communist Party and smuggled by drug cartels across our  southern border.   More than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in the last 12  months, most of them from synthetic opioids like fentanyl. It is the  No. 1 cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45.   The rise in fentanyl overdoses and deaths affects every State and  congressional district. It kills the young and the old, the rich and  the poor, in cities and in small towns alike. It is not a partisan  issue, and finding a solution shouldn't be partisan either.   When I talk to Tennessee sheriffs, they tell me that fentanyl is  becoming more and more lethal, how a so-called ``bad batch'' can kill  dozens of people. Once this deadly substance arrives in American  communities, it is too late. We have to stop it before it crosses our  borders. That is why I have reintroduced this legislation to combat  drug smuggling.   When I travel to the border, Border Patrol agents tell me that the  cartels use human waves of illegal border crossers as cover to  transport fentanyl and other deadly narcotics. While Border Patrol  agents are diverted to manage caravans of border crossers, the gap in  coverage is then exploited by the smugglers. In many cases, these are  well-planned and carefully coordinated occurrences.   The agents told me that ``the people don't stay at the border, and  the drugs don't either.'' They also told me that title 42 is the last  tool the Border Patrol has left to partially slow this ongoing tidal  wave of illegal crossings. We can't afford to take away this tool in  the midst of a crisis.   Letting title 42 end without creating a permanent, new authority to  replace it empowers drug cartels. It enables them to send migrants  across the border at strategic points, bogging down Border Patrol  agents with paperwork and processing that takes five times longer  without title 42. This dramatic increase in processing times absent  title 42 will significantly decrease the scarce resources available to  actually patrol our southern border. Cartels will then use the longer  and more frequent enforcement gaps to move more fentanyl across the  southern border. We cannot allow this to happen.   My legislation simply adds drug smuggling as an additional basis for  using title 42 authority. It would help Border Patrol stop drug  traffickers.   This should not be controversial. Yet, last Congress, Democrats  blocked its passage three times on the Senate floor. Now that we are  staring down at the end of title 42, it is time to pass this bill. I  hope my colleagues across the aisle will not let title 42 expire  without action. We must protect the border security tools we have to  stop the fentanyl flowing across our southern border before more lives  are lost.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 1199.
