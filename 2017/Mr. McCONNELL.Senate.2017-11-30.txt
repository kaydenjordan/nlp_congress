 Mr. President, from across my home State of Kentucky,  I have heard the calls for tax reform. For too long, hard-working men  and women have been held back by an economy that has failed to live up  to its potential. They are ready for us to get the economy going again.   For example, the East Kentucky Power Cooperative, which serves more  than half a million families and businesses in my State, recently wrote  to my office in support of tax reform. The cooperative encouraged us  ``to put more disposal income into the hands of hard-working citizens  and encourage investment and long-term economic growth.''   In addition, the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, which represents  thousands of businesses across the Commonwealth, recently wrote a  letter encouraging us to consider relieving ``the tax burden of small  businesses by simplifying the code and reducing costs.'' It concluded  the letter by asking the Senate to ``support federal tax reform to  achieve the economic growth that has been Kentucky's potential for so  long.''   This morning, a group of small business men and women from Kentucky  joined Senators here on the Hill with Small Business Administrator  Linda McMahon to discuss the urgent need for tax reform. I would like  to thank Senator Blunt for hosting this event to hear from these job  creators and to reiterate that they are at the forefront of our tax  reform efforts.   The people of Kentucky have struggled under our outdated and complex  Federal Tax Code. It is time to overhaul it and deliver real relief to  middle-class families and small businesses.   For a number of years, our friends across the aisle, including the  ranking member of the Finance Committee and the Democratic leader, have  vocally called for tax reform. They claimed they supported efforts to  close loopholes and help American businesses become more competitive  here at home. They claimed they supported policies to help prevent more  jobs from moving overseas. The good news is that is exactly what our  tax reform legislation does. So passing this bill to help keep jobs and  investment in the United States would be something upon which we can  all agree.   A group of economists from around the country recently penned a  letter expressing the need for tax reform. After examining the proposal  put forward, these economists agree that the House and Senate plans  have the ability to grow the economy and increase the income of  American families. In particular, they wrote that tax reform can reduce  the incentives for companies to move investment overseas. That means  the bill we are considering would discourage corporations from moving  jobs and investments abroad. For working families who have endured a  decade of lost jobs and opportunities, this is welcome relief indeed.   So why would our Democratic friends support this idea in theory but  then oppose legislation once they finally have the chance to put the  plan into action? What changed? Not the ideas. Not the need for tax  reform. The only change has been the person in the Oval Office.   This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to take more money out  of Washington's pocket and put more money into the pockets of hard- working families. We shouldn't let partisanship distract us from  delivering real relief to the middle class. Believe me, we will not.   Under Chairman Hatch's leadership, the Senate Finance Committee  passed this legislation that is the product of years of hard work,  dozens of hearings, and an open amendment process. I would like to once  again thank Chairman Hatch for his efforts to get us to this pivotal  point where we can consider a proposal that could truly help our  constituents.   First and foremost, the tax reform proposal before us today is good  for families. To a middle-class family of four in Kentucky who earns a  median income, a nearly $2,200-a-year tax cut could make a real  difference.   Second, the plan is good for small businesses and job creators. It  has earned the support of the NFIB--the National Federation of  Independent  [[Page S7508]]  Business--because it will help small businesses grow, invest, and hire  right here in the United States. As I said before, it will also make it  easier for other businesses to bring jobs and investments home.   Third, this legislation helps low- and middle-income families by  repealing ObamaCare's burdensome individual mandate tax.   This is a good bill. By overhauling our Tax Code, we can provide much  needed support to the men and women who sent us here.   Yesterday, the Senate took a crucial step toward relief. Every  Senator who voted to proceed to this important debate has already begun  to answer those calling out for tax reform. Now the Senate will work  through an open amendment process here on the floor where Members from  both parties will have the opportunity to offer their ideas. Tonight, I  expect that Senators will have the opportunity to vote on many of these  amendments.   This is our chance to deliver relief to hard-working American  families and to help the middle class get ahead. It is our opportunity  to overhaul our complex Tax Code and shift our economy into high gear.  We can pass many of the ideas we have discussed and supported for  years, and I urge all of my colleagues to work together to get this  done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier this week, North Korea tested  what appears to be an intercontinental ballistic missile that exceeded  the altitude and time of flight of previous missile tests. Public  reporting is that the missile achieved an altitude of 2,800 miles and  traversed a lofted trajectory, landing 620 miles from the launch site  within North Korea.   The test reminds us of the singleminded determination of Kim Jong Un  to develop a nuclear-armed ICBM that can successfully strike the United  States. That leaves our Nation with limited options. The first is to  convince him that any use of a nuclear weapon will result in an  overwhelming response, one that he will deem completely unacceptable.  The second is to remove any missile that our intelligence community  assesses is armed and can strike the United States or our allies. These  are grave considerations, but they are unavoidable. As Commander in  Chief, the President focuses on these matters on a daily basis.   In facing these threats--whether through diplomatic negotiations,  preparing to deter or to defeat a launch, or a significant decision to  protect the United States preemptively--the United States needs to  unify and rally our allies in each of these courses of action. That in  itself is a Herculean task. What makes it considerably more challenging  is the uncertainty surrounding our efforts to increase funding for our  military right here at home.   In April of this year, we as a body attended a briefing on North  Korea at the White House. The administration has been forthcoming on  both the urgency of the threat and their determination to face it  through a policy of maximum pressure and preparedness.   We have only a few weeks ahead of us to provide the Department of  Defense with the certainty that we are responding to its funding needs  and providing the stability in programs and resources required to  fulfill our strategy. Each of us talks about these goals. Each of us  talks about what we owe the All-Volunteer Force. How we work together  in the coming days is the test of those statements.   Certainly we can set aside partisan difference at a time when North  Korea, Iran, Russia, and the Taliban are seeking to bully our allies  and questioning our will and our leadership. Now is the time to come  back to the table, meet our responsibility by providing the Defense  Department the resources and certainty it requires, and answer those  questioning America's resolve.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Stabenow now be recognized to offer a motion to commit, which is at the  desk; that the time until 7 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form  for debate on the motion; that there be no amendments in order to the  instructions; and that at 7 p.m., the Senate vote in relation to the  motion with no intervening action or debate. I further ask that  following disposition of the motion, the majority leader or his  designee be recognized.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now  be a period for debate only to count against the underlying bill.    Mr. President, for the information of all Senators,  the Senate will continue to debate the bill tonight, but the next  rollcall votes will be at 11 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Friday, December 1; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 1 under the  previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:14 p.m., adjourned until  Friday, December 1, 2017, at 10 a.m.
