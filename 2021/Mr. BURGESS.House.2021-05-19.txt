 Madam Speaker, the pandemic has taken a terrible toll on  the country. The pandemic has taken a terrible toll on Congress. In its  current state, Congress is not working. We have restrictions on the  voting process, we have widespread proxy voting and remote hearings.  That has all contributed to the current state of dysfunction. But the  good news is this can be fixed.   Look, the Doctors Caucus are Members of Congress with medical  backgrounds, well-versed in evaluating medical risks and benefits for  patients, proposed courses of action, and we have worked vigorously to  educate our constituents that the coronavirus vaccines are safe and  effective, yet we are not setting a good example of what happens when  vaccine participation is high.   The Doctors Caucus has sent requests to the Office of the Attending  Physician and the Speaker of the House appealing for updated guidelines  consistent with the science and the Centers for Disease Control.   There will be a motion on the floor of this House later this  afternoon, fully supported by members of the Doctors Caucus. I urge all  Members to carefully consider that proposal and to vote in favor.                            ____________________
