 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in opposition to this bill. The bill last Congress went too  far; and the one in this Congress, in my opinion, is going too far as  well. The Commission, in my opinion, just needs a simple  reauthorization. I urge Members to consider this when deciding how to  vote on the amendments that will be debated here on the floor.   Title II actually makes it more difficult for the Commission to  function, and I am also concerned that title III's cross-border  rulemaking mandate will result in a race to the bottom for  multinational banks in the swaps market, which is a global market.   On top of that, this bill caps the agency's yearly budget at $250  million for the next 5 years, and it does this when every single  witness before the Agriculture Committee last year told us that the  agency needs more resources to do its work. Well, maybe that is the  whole point--that this bill will leave the agency to not doing much,  and I think that would be a mistake. We tried that once before, and we  found ourselves in a real mess.   Since we last discussed reauthorization, the market situation has  changed, and the CFTC has addressed many of our concerns through  rulemaking. Yet, the Agriculture Committee wasn't given the chance to  consider these issues before the bill was rushed to the floor here  today. So we are moving forward, once again, without regular order.   Again, I oppose this bill and urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 238,  legislation to reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,  better known as the CFTC. Instead of working through regular order to  produce an authorization bill that both Democrats and Republicans could  have supported, the majority in this House rushed to the floor a deeply  flawed piece of legislation that hamstrings the CFTC and undermines its  ability to react to changing market conditions.   The burdensome requirements in this legislation and the lack of  appropriate funding are nothing more than a misguided attempt by  Republicans to make it more difficult for the Commission to function-- to make it harder to protect consumers and make it more difficult to  rein in the abuses of Wall Street.   I strongly object to the authorization level in this legislation.  Basically, my Republican friends are flat funding the CFTC for 5 years,  and that is despite calls from the former and current chairman asking  us to provide additional resources to the agency to enhance their  ability to police Wall Street.   Now, Dodd-Frank significantly expanded the Commission's role in  overseeing our financial markets, and the Commission has done its part  to create rules that will help to prevent another financial crisis,  despite the fact that Congress has not provided appropriate funding.   Now, I get it. My Republican friends don't like Dodd-Frank. Ever  since they took back control of the House, they have tried to dismantle  the law piece by piece, which was enacted to protect consumers and  protect our markets in the wake of that terrible financial crisis that  practically ruined our economy.   Now, Republicans say they don't like regulation, and it seems they  especially don't like any regulation on Wall Street. Have they  forgotten the recent financial crisis that nearly destroyed our  economy? Have they forgotten who was primarily responsible for that  crisis? Apparently, they have. Now, I am not for endless and  unnecessary regulation. Nobody is. But I do think it is appropriate for  us to create commonsense rules that protect our markets and protect our  constituents' hard-earned dollars.   I find it troubling the Republican leaders in this House don't want  to provide necessary resources to the Commission to patrol Wall Street.  Without cops on the beat, who will ensure Wall Street actors aren't  gaming the system and putting the economy at risk for another meltdown.  I ask my Republican friends: When will Main Street take priority over  Wall Street?   I also take issue with the various provisions of this bill that will  both slow the agency's work and create new avenues for costly and  lengthy legal battles.   By the way, implementing these provisions will cost the Commission an  additional $45 million over the next 5 years and will require an  additional 30 full-time employees. So in addition to underfunding an  already overworked agency, we are creating a situation where even more  resources will be needed to satisfy burdensome and unnecessary  requirements. Now, that means fewer dollars for the Commission to carry  out its core mission of combating abuse and fraud in our markets and  ensuring end users, investors, and the public are protected.   Now, Mr. Chairman, our constituents didn't send us to Washington to  ignore bad actors in our financial markets. They certainly didn't send  us to Washington to create a regulatory environment that could put us  on a path toward another downturn. So who are we here to represent, the  Wall Street banks or our hardworking constituents who deserve elected  Representatives who do everything in their power to prevent another  financial crisis?   I would also like to say a few words about the cross-border  requirements imposed by this bill, requirements that would hamstring  the Commission's efforts to regulate the global swaps industry in  cooperation with regulators around the globe.   My colleagues across the aisle keep saying that this bill is  essential to help farmers, ranchers, utilities, and Main Street small  business. But the farmers in this country don't have a London office to  trade their swaps, they don't have a derivatives desk in Tokyo, and  they aren't trading interest rate swaps in Geneva.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.  [[Page H410]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Massachusetts.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chair, let's be clear about who the cross-border  provision in this bill is designed to help. It isn't end users. It  isn't farmers. It isn't manufacturers or utilities or Main Street  businesses. It is the small group of multinational financial firms that  have controlled the swaps market from the beginning. We have seen what  happens when they are left to their own devices. Crises in the swaps  market do not respect national borders and boundaries. And that is why  our regulators from the Commission have been engaged with their  international counterparts in crafting rules for these markets since  2009.                                time  1300    They should be encouraged in that effort in every way possible  through funding and expansive authority to get the rules right. This  bill provides neither.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided  legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran), a new member to the House and a new member of  the committee, and somebody who actually has experience in this  business during his storied career.   Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member with whom I  look forward to serving on the Agriculture Committee on behalf of the  people of Arizona.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my deep opposition to H.R. 238.  I am troubled by the way this legislation, the Commodity End-User  Relief Act, has been brought to the floor. This bill was only  introduced last week. It is being rushed to a vote.   I am especially bothered by the attempt to bring this bill to the  floor outside the rules of regular order. There were no committee  hearings. There were no markups held by the committee, and the Members  of the Agriculture Committee have been denied the opportunity to  discuss the merits of this legislation.   As a freshman member of the 115th Congress, I am especially bothered  that this bill has been brought to the floor before the Agriculture  Committee has even been fully organized. As a new member of the Ag  Committee, I am troubled that my colleagues think they can bypass the  important feedback provided during the committee process. I represent  over 80 communities in my district with a wide range of opinions and  interests. Hearing from my constituents and getting feedback is  critical to my duties as their Representative in Congress. We should  include their voices in the policymaking process, not just special  interests that have the resources to keep lobbyists here in Washington.   The committee process allows members to gather critical information,  have a positive discussion, and make necessary changes to the  legislation. As everyone on this floor knows, the committee process is  essential to ensuring that the interests of the American people are  truly represented in the legislation and brought to the floor. I  understand that this bill was brought up in the 114th Congress where it  was reviewed by the committee. It is only right that we maintain our  democratic principles and ensure that H.R. 238 fully undergoes  committee review in this Congress.   Mr. Chairman, this is not a partisan concept. These are the values I  held as a Republican State legislator, as a police officer working in  the community, and as a community leader.   Mr. Chairman, I ask: If this legislation was sent through the  committee in the last Congress, is it not going to the committee again?   This process subverts the rules of this Congress, which, I might add,  were established only last week. Bypassing the normal rules of order  marginalizes the voice of the American people in the legislative  process and forces a vote on legislation that is not complete.   I encourage my colleagues to make sure that the voice of the American  people is heard and this legislation is brought up under the rules of  regular order. For this reason, I ask my colleagues to join me in  opposing this legislation before us.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member of the Financial  Services Committee.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong  opposition to H.R. 238, a bill that would hamstring the ability of the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission to protect our Nation's farmers,  manufacturers, municipalities, and retirees. Indeed, the agency has  weighty responsibility to oversee our commodity, futures, and swaps  markets to ensure that they are not only fair to market participants,  but also that they are protected from manipulation, fraud, and abuse.   Such misconduct in these markets can impact everything from the price  of oil, natural gas, and bread, to the interest rates on mortgages,  credit cards, auto loans, and student loans.   As we saw in the financial crisis, fraud and abuse in the swaps  markets can lead to systemic risks. Recall that credit default swaps,  made famous by AIG, fueled the crisis, bankrupted millions of  homeowners, and cost taxpayers trillions of dollars. To prevent that  from happening again, Congress, in the Dodd-Frank Act, gave the CFTC  new authority over the swaps market and required it to adopt reforms  which, thanks to its hard work, are largely in place.   But rather than applaud the work of the CFTC and provide it with  funds it needs to do its job, Republicans continue to seek to undermine  its regulatory authority, impose new procedural hurdles, and ultimately  thwart its ability to protect the American people.   For example, H.R. 238 would impose onerous burdens and introduce new  litigation risks by requiring the CFTC to conduct what is known as  cost-benefit analysis slanted toward the industry, tying the CFTC's  hands and setting up roadblocks to prevent them from doing their job  and protect investors. This is a tactic used by opponents of financial  reform to prevent, delay, weaken, and now under a Trump administration,  repeal any rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.   This bill also would make it harder for the CFTC to police the  overseas derivatives operations of megabanks like Citigroup, J.P.  Morgan and Bank of America, even though the risk may still be borne by  U.S. taxpayers. It also creates an unreasonable and hard-to-overturn  presumption that the regulations of the largest eight foreign swaps  markets are equivalent to U.S. regulation, allowing global megabanks to  opt out of CFTC regulation.   H.R. 238 is simply a bad bill, but not leaving well-enough alone,  Republicans are attempting to make it worse through multiple  amendments. Troublingly, the Lucas amendment would create loopholes in  our swaps regime by exempting trades between affiliates. Therefore,  such trades would not have to comply with certain reporting, clearing,  or initial margin requirements, creating a dangerous blind spot in the  markets. What is more, the amendment is in direct contravention to  already-provided, targeted relief, including the inter-affiliate  clearing exemption that Congress passed in a bipartisan fashion in the  2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which contained numerous  safeguards to ensure appropriate CFTC oversight.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing that and other harmful  amendments, and oppose H.R. 238.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, if I could inquire from Chairman Conaway  if he has any more speakers?    Is the gentleman prepared to close?    Is the gentleman prepared to close?    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   In closing, I just wish that I could support a reauthorization bill,  a clean bill for the CFTC that came through the Committee on  Agriculture in regular order, but that is not what has happened.   I want to thank Chairman Conaway for his work in the last Congress,  trying to find common ground, and I hope that we can get back to  regular order in the future in the committee.   So again, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 238, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   According to the CFTC, there is a drafting error in this amendment. I  don't know exactly what it is, but they claim that there is a drafting  error.   They also claim that it prohibits the CFTC from entering into leases  going forward. They have expressed concern that this prohibition will  affect their ability to enter into contracts with GSA in emergency  situations and in order to sublease unused space.   This is one of the problems that I have with this bill in skipping  the process of consideration in the Committee on Agriculture. If we  would have done that, we would have had a chance to go over this and  figure out exactly what is going on and who is right and who is wrong  and what the situation is.   So, according to them, there are problems. We haven't gone through  regular order, so I reluctantly oppose the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Again, we are being told by the CFTC that this is not  the case.   So, again, I don't know who is right or wrong, and I appreciate your  offer to work with us to get to the bottom of this. Again, this is the  problem that you have when you don't go through regular order.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, as was indicated, this places a $5 million  limit on expenditures.   Again, I don't know if it is a drafting error or a difference of  opinion, but, according to the CFTC, they claim that this amendment  does things that were not explained and were not, in their opinion,  made clear in the amendment. I don't know if they are calling it an  error, or whatever it is, but there is a provision in there that says  that this fund, once it gets above $100 million, can't go above $50  million.   So what this does is it basically limits the amount, once they get an  amount to go back into the fund to replenish it. Again, I am not  exactly sure who is right or who is wrong here, but it is another  example of, I think, something that could have been avoided if this  would have come through the Agriculture Committee in regular order.   The CFTC's education initiatives to help consumers protect themselves  have been successful since this initiative began. The main expense is  the Web site BrokerCheck. The whistleblower awards have increased  recently and have been shown to be an effective method of enforcing the  Commodity Exchange Act.   So, again, I would ask opposition to the amendment and again make the  point that, had we gone through the committee process, we could have  resolved this and probably been on the same page.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota has yielded back.   The gentleman from Georgia yielded back his time. Does the gentleman  wish to request unanimous consent to reclaim the balance of his time?   Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Yes, Mr. Chair.   The CHAIR. Without objection, so ordered.   There was no objection.   Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I would point out that  there is over $200 million in the account. If somebody were going to  make $200 million subject to the appropriations process, I imagine any  bureaucrat would object if that was going to happen to their agency.   But the fact of the matter is, that is one of the ways that we as  Members of Congress are able to make sure that taxpayer funds are spent  where we expect them to be spent. This does not in any way, shape, or  form hinder the ability to pay out to whistleblowers. I firmly believe  we should be paying whistleblowers.   If the fund needs additional resources, we have the ability to  appropriate it, but it would prevent the agency from maintaining  balances well in excess of what was anticipated in the Dodd-Frank  legislation.  [[Page H423]]    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Conaway    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in  part B of House Report 115-3.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I support the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield my time to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), who was one of the original folks who  brought this forward and one of the original authors, I think, of this  provision. So I am going to let him carry the day on the opposition to  this amendment.  [[Page H424]]    The CHAIR. The gentleman from Connecticut will control the time in  opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes    Mr. Chairman, this amendment addresses a problem that  the CFTC is already well on its way to resolving in its proposed rule  on automated trading. It requires that the Commission must vote to  issue a subpoena to collect source code from high-frequency trading  firms before the Commission can examine it.   I support the protections for the source code as intellectual  property. I know Commissioner--soon to be Chairman, I think--Giancarlo  has made this a priority, but this amendment I think is poorly drafted.  Again, I don't want to harp on this too much, but it is something that  could have been resolved had we had a committee process to do this  bill.   One of the questions I have: I don't quite understand why this  language is in the bill regarding similar intellectual property. The  people at the CFTC, they don't know what this means, they don't know  why you put that language in there, and they think it is going to cause  a lot of problems. So we are trying to get at the source code. I have a  problem with that. But why is this language in there?   Would the gentleman be willing to explain to me why that is in there  and what it means?    I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Right.    Right.    Right.    Right.    What is that intellectual property that the CFTC might  go after? They don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. Is there  some reason?   The source code is what the issue is, right?    This isn't the government. It is the CFTC. It is a very  specific part of the government.    Well, right. I don't know what it means. They think it  is problematic, and I think it is another example of where we would  have been better off with regular order.   I oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. McClintock). The gentleman from Minnesota is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I am not exactly sure why this is needed,  but I don't have any problem with the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).   The amendment was agreed to.                                time  1400                     Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Lucas    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7  printed in part B of House Report 115-3.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment contains several troubling  drafting--some people call them--errors or, I guess, questions. It  prevents the CFTC from enforcing noncompliance with the final rule that  includes more forms than were targeted.   When we did our part of the Dodd-Frank bill, one of the things that I  thought was really not controversial was that we were going to try to  find out, once and for all, who owned all of these swaps; who was on  what side of positions. This is what caused the problem in the first  place with the financial meltdown. When Lehman Brothers went down and  we allowed them to go broke, it created this big panic, AIG didn't know  if they could cover their swaps or not, and it was going to unravel the  whole situation because these firms that were trading didn't know who  held what and what was going on. That was the underlying problem. So  what we were trying to do is get some understanding of where everybody  was in this market. When we were doing the bill, we made it very clear,  and I put in the legislation, that end users were not covered. That  shouldn't have been an issue.   The problem with this amendment is it looks like it is going to  include more than just that. So, I guess, again, this is a final  example in this bill of a process moving too quickly and a lack of  regular order.   Finally, it contains a section on foreign privacy laws that could  result in the agencies seeing a reduced scope of market in their  surveillance activities that may not be the intention. But, again,  without the chance to consider this provision in regular order, we are  not sure, and concerns that some people have remain unaddressed. So  this could have been resolved during the process. It hasn't been. In  its present form, I oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5-minute vote.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 239,  nays 182, not voting 13, as follows:                               [Roll No. 54]                                 YEAS--239       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Beutler      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (GA)      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Chaffetz      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Cuellar      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gottheimer      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Hice, Jody B.
