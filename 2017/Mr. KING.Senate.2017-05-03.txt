 Madam President, around here we often discuss bureaucracy  and regulation and overreach and government getting out of the way. I  want to point out and bring to the attention of the Senate and the  American people one of the most ridiculous actions of any government at  any level that I have ever encountered.   There is a wonderful program that provides support for students going  on to college, particularly low-income students and particularly in  rural areas. Every year our colleges and colleges across the country  file applications for this program called Upward Bound. It is one of  the most successful programs of the Federal Government that I have  encountered. I have met the students in Maine and from other parts of  the country. It is a program that helps these students make the  transition from their communities to colleges and to gain a college  education.   Applications are necessary, and applications have rules about the  size of the paper and that kind of thing. What has happened in this  case, on the application of the University of Maine at Presque Isle-- affectionately called UMPI--the University of Maine at Presque filed  its application, which was 65 pages. They met all the requirements, but  they made a terrible mistake. The rules of the Department of Education  say that the application must be double-spaced. Indeed, the application  is double-spaced, except for  [[Page S2693]]  an exhibit on page 21, which is single-spaced. It is double-spaced in  the body of the application, and there was one other infographic in the  application which was a space and a half--1.5 instead of 2--and the  application was rejected for that reason alone.   This is preposterous. This isn't a game. This isn't ``gotcha.'' This  is about real people. At the University of Maine at Presque Isle, it is  129 real people, and it is about their access to higher education,  their access to a better life, their ability to achieve success. The  application of their university was rejected because this little piece  on one page and a similar piece on another page was 1\1/2\ spaces  instead of 2. This is nonsense. This is the kind of thing that makes  people hate government. This is the kind of thing that makes people  say: What are they thinking down there? What is wrong with Washington?  Why can't they get something so simple as looking at the substance of  the application instead of applying what can only be characterized as a  bureaucratic rule?   I am not one of these people who attack bureaucrats and Federal  workers. In my experience, they are good people who are trying to do  the right thing, and they make enormous contributions to our country.  In this case, somebody somewhere in the Department of Education made a  dumb decision, and it is one that is going to impact my people in  Maine. I can't just keep quiet about it.   Last week, after letters from the Maine congressional delegation,  which I will place into the Record, the Department of Education  announced: Well, it probably wasn't the right thing to do. This wasn't  a very good policy. I guess we made a mistake.   The problem is, it doesn't help UMPI; it only helps people in the  future. I have worked with my colleague Senator Collins on this. She  has done research. Her office has discovered precedents where indeed  this kind of thing has happened before and they fixed it. They fixed it  so that the application could be considered.   By the way, the decision on these applications around the country has  not been made yet. We are not prejudicing anybody. We are not making a  change after the fact. All they have to do is go to page 1 of the UMPI  application and read it and forget about the fact that it is 1\1/2\  spaces in this little exhibit in the middle of the double-spaced  application. In fact, we can fix it. We will make this double-spaced. I  feel silly even coming to the floor of the U.S. Senate talking about  this double-space, 1\1/2\ spaces. What are we doing here?   Again, the reason I am so passionate about this is that these are  real people's lives. These are 129 young people who will not be able to  take part in this program, and very likely their entire lives can be  compromised by this. This is a big deal for them. It may be a little  deal for the Department of Education, but it is a big deal for the  University of Maine at Presque Isle and their students.   All I am asking is for the Department of Education and the Secretary  of Education to look at this obvious, ridiculous bureaucratic mistake,  correct it, and correct it for those who have been prejudiced by it. It  is not just the University of Maine at Presque Isle; I understand there  are a number of others across the country whose applications were  kicked out for similar reasons.   I understand there has to be some uniformity. It has to be written in  English. It has to be on reasonable paper that you can read, and it is  not to be handwritten. To reject an application involving 129 young  lives in my State because a little piece out of a 65-page application  has 1\1/2\ spaces instead of 2--give me a break.   This is something that can and should be fixed, and I assume and  believe the Secretary of Education and the people in charge at the  Department of Education will find a way to fix it and prove to the  people of Maine that the government in Washington is not crazy, that we  can make reasonable decisions, and that when we make a mistake--and  they acknowledged last week that it was a mistake, that it was not good  policy, and they have rectified it going forward. But let's admit the  mistake and relieve those who have been impacted by that mistake of its  weight, of the obstacle that it places in the way of young people's  opportunities.   I understand that this issue has arisen in Montana, Wisconsin,  Arkansas, West Virginia, New Jersey, Ohio, Washington, Delaware,  Alabama, Illinois, California, New York, Massachusetts, Florida, and  Maine. It is time for it to be addressed. It ought to be very simple,  and it ought to be taken care of in a matter of days--not weeks or  months, but in a matter of days--so that those young people and our  university can plan and implement and move forward in their mission to  enrich and enable the lives of our citizens.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the letter submitted to the Department of Education by the Maine  congressional delegation on this subject.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                  Congress of the United States,                                     Washington, DC, April 14, 2017.      Re University of Maine at Presque Isle's Upward Bound Grant           Applications #P047A170346 and #P047A170352.       Hon. Betsy DeVos,      Secretary, U.S. Department of Education,      Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary DeVos: We are writing to support the       applications submitted by the University of Maine at Presque       Isle (UMPI) for two grants under the fiscal year 2017 Upward       Bound Program competition and to express our strong concern       that the Department of Education has determined that these       applications are ineligible for consideration. As strong       supporters of the TRIO programs, we were particularly       troubled to learn that UMPI's applications were ruled       ineligible due to an unintentional, minor formatting       oversight, which UMPI has not been given an opportunity to       correct. According to UMPI, the Department's decision risks,       over the next five years, denying 960 disadvantaged high       school students the chance to fulfill their academic       potentials.        The Notice Inviting Applications for New Awards (Notice)       for the Upward Bound Program competition, published in the       Federal Register on October 17, 2016, includes formatting       criteria not mandated by Congress. They are arbitrarily       drawn, entirely unrelated to the substance of the       application, and do not provide any recourse for applicants       to correct minor, unintentional, non-substantive mistakes.        UMPI has applied for two Upward Bound Program grants, and       both have been deemed ineligible for the same reason. We       understand that the Department has relayed to UMPI that a       line-spacing error, appearing within two info-graphics on two       of the application's 65 pages, is the cause of the       ineligibility determination, as these two pages do not comply       with the Notice's double-spacing requirement. These info-      graphics are intended to help the reader review the       application efficiently and more easily and contain text that       is 1.5 line spaced instead of double spaced. It is obvious       that the figures merely supplement a well-prepared narrative.       Were they removed, or were UMPI permitted to adjust the line       spacing on these two pages, the application would easily       warrant the Department's review. Yet unbelievably, the       Department refuses to review UMPI's application and has       provided no opportunity for UMPI to correct this trivial       mistake. We strongly urge the Department to reconsider its       decision and to allow UMPI's application to be read and       scored.        We appreciate that the formatting standards issued by the       Department are intended to prevent applicants from attempting       to gain an unfair advantage by using clever formatting       strategies. When the application is reviewed as a whole, it       is clear that UMPI is not seeking to mislead the Department       or to gain any unfair advantage. In fact, the error was so       insignificant that UMPI could not immediately identify it and       had to seek additional guidance. Now, the Department's       inflexible and bureaucratic decision could result in the       elimination of a longstanding, successful, and greatly needed       program on the basis of a non-substantive error before the       application is even read.        The Department has not identified for UMPI any other errors       in its application. To deny UMPI's application a reading       because two figures do not meet an arbitrary typographical       format ignores the spirit of the Upward Bound Program, is       antithetical to congressional intent, and would seriously       jeopardize the future success of hundreds of students in       Maine.        The Upward Bound Program at UMPI serves 129 high school       students across Aroostook County, Maine, and has a strong and       long record of success in sending local low-income, first-      generation students to college. Since 1980, it has helped       students with great needs access the promise of higher       education.        We strongly urge the Department to apply some common sense       to the Upward Bound Program competition and read and score       UMPI's applications.            Sincerely,      Susan M. Collins,        U.S. Senator.      Bruce Poliquin,        Member of Congress.      Angus S. King, Jr.  [[Page S2694]]         U.S. Senator.      Chellie Pingree,        Member of Congress.     Madam President, I believe this is a simple case that could  be easily rectified, and I am confident--I am almost confident that it  will be. I trust that common sense will prevail and the well-being of  our students will be put above minor technical issues in an application  that is so important.    Thank you, Madam President.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Will the Senator yield for discussion?    Will the Senator yield for discussion?    Will the Senator yield for discussion?    Will the Senator yield for discussion?    I say to the Senator from Virginia, 48 years ago this  summer I joined the national legal services program and went to the  State of Maine, where I served people in a very rural area with a whole  range of problems. What I came to realize during that time was that the  promises of our democracy, the promises inherent in the American idea,  are not self-executed.   Every morning we pledge allegiance to this flag, and the last phrase  is critical: ``with liberty and justice for all.'' That is a promise  made to the people of this country. But the U.S. Supreme Court has  found repeatedly, as the Senator knows, that you can't achieve justice  if you don't have representation, particularly in an age of an  overlapping and complex legal system.   So I believe this is not just another government program. This is  part of the essence of the American idea. I remember being up in Maine  in this small town of Skowhegan, ME. I met a woman who was visiting  from England. She said: What do you do?   I said: Well, I work for this group that provides legal services to  low-income people in this region.   She said: How is it funded?   I said: By the government.   She said: Do you ever have to sue the government?   I said: Yes, of course. That is one of the things that you  occasionally have to do in order to protect the rights of your client.   She was amazed that in this country we would fund the legal support  of people who might actually occasionally bring cases against the  government itself. She thought that was wonderful and really epitomized  the idealism of this country. So I commend the Senator for raising this  issue during Law Day to talk about the importance of this in terms of  its relationship to the overall idea of America.   We talk a lot about justice. As you point out, across the street it  says: ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' But that often means you have to  have competent and professional advocacy and representation. The Legal  Services Corporation is not a big part of the budget. It has not grown  exponentially over the years. In fact, I suspect in real dollars, it is  smaller today than when I entered the service 48 years ago.   But I know it is important. It is important in Maine, with the Pine  Tree Legal Assistance, the Volunteer Lawyers Project, and the  volunteers from law firms around our State who volunteer to give their  time for pro bono legal assistance. But the hub of it is the National  Legal Services Program. To me, it epitomizes our commitment to  effectuate the promises of American life, not just to talk about them  but to make them real. So I commend the Senator for his comments.
