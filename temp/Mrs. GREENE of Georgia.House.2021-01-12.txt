 Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote the  President of the United States: ``I know that everyone here will soon  be marching over to the Capitol Building to peacefully and  patriotically make your voices heard.''   ``Go home with love and in peace. Remember this day forever.''-- President Donald Trump.   I condemn this violence. Republicans have condemned this violence.  President Trump has condemned this violence. But elected Democrats over  the past year have promoted violence, have supported it. They fund it  on their ActBlue fundraising platform.   There has been billions in damage caused over this past year, riots  all over this country. Do you know how many companies have endured  violence and destruction? I have 83 pages here of businesses that had  property damage, were burned, through the Minnesota riots.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article about the Minnesota  riots.                   [From the Star Tribune, July 31, 2020]           Buildings Damaged in Minneapolis, St. Paul After Riots             (By Josh Penrod, C.J. Sinner and Mary Jo Webster)    Twin Cities restaurants and retail stores were hit the hardest in the                  rioting following George Floyd's killing         In the first few days after George Floyd was killed by       Minneapolis police, rioters tore through dense stretches of       Minneapolis, St. Paul and other metro communities in       retaliation, causing millions in property damage to more than       1,500 locations.        In their wake, vandals left a trail of smashed doors and       windows, covered hundreds of boarded-up businesses with       graffiti and set fire to nearly 150 buildings, with dozens       burned to the ground. Pharmacies, groceries, liquor stores,       tobacco shops and cell phone stores were ransacked, losing       thousands of dollars in stolen merchandise. Many were looted       repeatedly over consecutive nights.        Other property--like gas stations, restaurants and even       parked cars--was set on fire, with much of it completely       destroyed.        The full extent of damage to Twin Cities buildings--      including residences, churches, nonprofits and minority-owned       businesses--could take weeks or months to calculate. Already       on the ropes from months of lost revenue during a global       pandemic, some businesses may never reopen as others are       still temporarily or indefinitely closed.        Buildings along a 5-mile stretch of Lake Street in       Minneapolis and a 3.5-mile stretch of University Avenue in       St. Paul's Midway area experienced some of the heaviest       damage. While this is an incomplete list, here's a look at       some of those hardest-hit areas.                Heavy damage near Minneapolis police precincts         For three consecutive nights starting on Wednesday, May 27,       rioters pummeled blocks worth of buildings near the       Minneapolis' Third and Fifth police precincts, inflicting       heavy damage.        On Thursday night, protesters torched and heavily       vandalized the Third Precinct, and destroyed at least 20       nearby buildings, including several restaurants, an Auto       Zone, Minnehaha Lake Wine & Spirits, a U.S. Post Office, a       cellphone store and the building that housed Talk Town Diner,       El Nuevo Rodeo and others. Midtown Corner, a multi-story       affordable housing project that was still under construction,       erupted into a towering inferno, burning so hot that it       melted siding off a nearby house.        The following night, about three miles west of the Third       Precinct, protesters blanketed the area near the Fifth       Precinct, heavily damaging at least seven buildings--      including a U.S. Post Office, a Wells Fargo branch, a       staffing agency and a Subway in a nearby strip mall.       Authorities also reported that shots had been fired at       officers in the Fifth Precinct area, but there were no       reports of injuries.          Fires near Midtown Global Market, heavy looting in Uptown         The Midtown Global Market area experienced one of the most       concentrated tolls during the Floyd riots. More than a dozen       businesses near E. Lake Street and Chicago Avenue were       destroyed by fire, and a few dozen more reported fire damage       with many being burned severely.        Less than two miles to the west near Hennepin Avenue and W.       Lake Street, nearly 40 businesses were broken into or heavily       looted, including large retailers like H&M, Timberland, an       Apple store, Kitchen Window and Urban Outfitters. Just a few       blocks away near Lyndale Avenue and W. Lake Street, a cluster       of nearly 30 businesses sustained property damage, including       several restaurants and bars. There was almost no fire damage       in this area, a stark contrast to other clusters along Lake       Street.                   Miles of damage along University Avenue         Across the river in St. Paul, the hardest-hit area was a 1-      mile stretch of the Midway along University Avenue between       Snelling and Lexington Avenues, although damage extended a       few miles, stopping just short of the State Capitol. In all,       more than 70 businesses were hit, with more than a dozen       sustaining serious fire damage.                         Twin Cities surrounding area         Rioters hit buildings well beyond Minneapolis and St. Paul,       with damage reported as far north as Blaine and as far south       as Apple Valley. Meanwhile, clusters of attacked storefronts       sprang up in places like Richfield, North St. Paul,       Maplewood, Brooklyn Center and Roseville:   [[Page H138]]          Our Vice-President-elect, Kamala Harris,  posted the Minnesota Freedom Fund bail link, encouraging people to  donate money to bail criminals out of jail.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record Vice-President-elect Harris'  tweet about the Minnesota Freedom Fund.      Kamala Harris      @KamalaHarris        If you're able to, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to       help post bail for those protesting on the ground in       Minnesota.        4:34 p.m. 6/1/20 Sprout Social    Mr. Speaker, we should not be hypocrites.
