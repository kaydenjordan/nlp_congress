 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin), my friend and colleague, and I thank my other colleagues also  who are here today to shine a light on the abuses that happened last  week and last weekend with the executive order that was passed and  signed into law by this President.   Mr. Speaker, this order is in direct contrast with the values that  this country was built on: foremost, to be a refuge. That is how so  many people in the history of this country have come here. Instead, our  President has chosen to close the doors on people who are fleeing  violence in their home countries, and it is based on their religion.   This ban is discrimination in its purest form. It does not make us  safer. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I believe that doing what we did has  actually put fodder into the hands of those who really do wish to do us  harm by being able to say that America hates Muslims, that America  hates Islam, and that America hates immigrants and refugees, none of  which is true to the history and the founding of this country.   The reality, Mr. Speaker, is that the International Rescue Committee  has said that it is more challenging for refugees to get into the  United States than anyone else. They are the most heavily vetted group  there is. As you can see here, there are 20 steps involved in the  process, and those who do get approved have been through the most  rigorous background checks, fingerprinting, and questioning.   Instead of making us safer, this ban is simply throwing people into  chaos. Many of us over this last weekend went to our airports across  the country--Dulles; New York; Seattle, Washington, my hometown. We  were called to the airport because there was chaos that erupted across  the country, chaos that erupted at the airports, because people who had  legal documents to come to the United States were coming in and being  told that the executive order meant that they no longer could actually  stay here in this country.   Mr. President, what happened then for me, when I went to the Sea-Tac  Airport at 1 in the afternoon on Saturday, I found a Somali family who  had been waiting, a U.S. citizen woman who had been waiting to be  reunited with her husband. She believed that finally she was going to  get to hold him in her arms. Instead, Mr. Speaker, what happened is  that he was put on a plane and sent back to Heathrow, but perhaps  somewhere else. We were not given any information about what was going  to happen to that gentleman.   We found out that there were two additional individuals who were  already put on a plane ready to be deported. We, along with the ACLU,  the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, and our governor, were able to  file for a temporary restraining order. We were able to take that  restraining order on our phone to the plane and say: Stop this plane.   That literally, Mr. Speaker, is how we were able to get those two  people off of the plane. We were able to then get them legal counsel  after much intervention.   Mr. Speaker, it should not be this way. This is a country that was  built by immigrants. It is a country that has welcomed people from  across the world to come here as a refuge, as a sanctuary. My State of  Washington is one of the top States in the country for refugee  resettlement. The reality is we are destroying the very principles of  compassion, of humanity, of being a refuge, of building this country  with immigrants and refugees.   Literally thousands of people came to the airport to say: We welcome  refugees; we welcome immigrants.   This is not the America that we know and love. We are better than  this.   This is not the first time I have had to fight against these illegal  deportations. After 9/11, we had similar situations, not as bad as  this, but we had the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System,  NSEERS. It required that men from 25 Muslim and Arab countries were  going to be fingerprinted and registered. This was under the Bush  administration. At the time, Attorney General John Ashcroft said: You  are either with the terrorists or you are with us.   That is a false choice, Mr. Speaker. The reality is that security and  liberty do not oppose each other. They go hand in hand, and we cannot  sacrifice one for the sake of the other.   Mr. Speaker, we were able to fight that, and we finally did end that  special registration program, but now here we are again. We know the  shame of history when we have not been on the right side of it. We know  that in 1942, 125,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry were put into  internment camps, and it took us a very long time to come back and  apologize. Mr. Speaker, when we did, we said we will never do that  [[Page H924]]  again. Yet, here we are for the first time again instituting a  religious test as to who can get into this country.   Let us be clear that it is a Muslim ban. It does not mean that every  single Muslim country necessarily has been targeted yet. But what it  does mean is that Muslims are being scrutinized in a different way  simply for being Muslim.    A constituent of mine called my office this week to tell me another  very disturbing story, and she told me that I could tell it here on the  floor. She was passing through immigration into Houston on her way back  home from Seattle. Dr. Angelina Godoy was traveling back from Central  America where she was doing research. She is a U.S. citizen. She said  she was so alarmed by what happened to her that she wanted to call and  get it on the record.   Angelina is a human rights professor and she has traveled through  immigration many times. This was the first time she said she had  experienced anything like this. Her immigration officer asked her about  her political views. When she said that she was deeply concerned about  the President's actions, he asked her why she wasn't concerned with all  the refugees that were flooding into our borders. And he used that word  ``flooding.'' When she said she didn't think that they were flooding  in, he told her that she can't tell him that based on the fake news she  is seeing on television.   Mr. Speaker, this is incredibly disturbing. Are we going to now check  the views of every U.S. citizen who is coming into the our borders to  see whether they agree with these executive orders or not?   Well, I am here to tell you that it may be the thought that fear and  patriotism together is the way to suppress dissent. We will not be  suppressed with fighting for the very values that make us great.   In cities around the country, what gives me hope is that people stood  up to stand up against this hatred. The Muslim ban is unconstitutional,  and we are standing here today to demand that it be repealed.   You can see here the chart that I referred to earlier. There are 20  steps that you must go through in order to be screened. Syrian refugees  are probably the most screened individuals in our country today. And  there are 5 million Syrian refugees who are pouring out of the country.   Mr. Speaker, this is not a time to turn our backs on them. This is a  time to make sure that we are taking care of the women, the children,  the families, the majority of refugees to this country who are women  and children and families. The majority who have family members here  that they are waiting to be reunited with, that is who we are talking  about, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I want to just conclude our earlier Special  Order where many of my colleagues spoke out in strong opposition to the  Muslim ban that was just signed by President Trump.   I would like to read a short paragraph from the letter that we have  now  [[Page H933]]  submitted to Secretary Kelly. It has been signed by over 110 of my  colleagues in the House. It requests that we have an immediate  emergency meeting and briefing. I include in the Record the entire  letter, and I will just read a short portion.   ``The Executive Order is both controversial and confusing. For  example, the International Rescue Committee called the Order `harmful  and hasty' noting `America has the strongest, most successful  resettlement program in the world.' Over 4,000 academics, including 25  Nobel Laureates, have signed a petition denouncing the Order, writing  `this measure is fatally disruptive to the lives of these immigrants,  their families, and the communities of which they form an integral  part. It is inhumane, ineffective, and un-American.' ''                                       House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, February 1, 2017.      Hon. John F. Kelly,      Secretary of Homeland Security, Department of Homeland           Security, Washington, DC.        Secretary Kelly: We write to strongly condemn the       President's executive order issued January 27, 2017, titled       ``Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry into the       United States,'' and the ensuing actions taken by the U.S.       Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its agencies, in       particular Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to implement       the order, and to request an urgent briefing regarding the       same. We hope you will urge the President to immediately       rescind the Executive Order, which has created profound chaos       and fear among refugees and immigrants who have been admitted       to the United States, as well as their families. As a nation       of immigrants that has been a refuge for people fleeing       persecution from around the world, these actions are contrary       to who we are as a nation.        We understand that you met yesterday at 4:30 PM with Chairs       and Ranking Members of relevant Committees to discuss       ``recent executive actions.'' You should understand that such       a time limited meeting with a subset of Members and Senators       in no way obviates the need for the briefing we are       requesting for all Members. Such full Member briefings are a       frequent occurrence on Capitol Hill after important events       such as the issuance of the January 27 Executive Order. They       allow all Members to benefit from the knowledge and       experiences of the executive branch so that we may be well       informed in our legislative and oversight affairs and serve       our constituents best. The full Member briefing regarding the       Executive Order is particularly needed given the unsettling       events of last evening--the abrupt firing of Acting Attorney       General Sally Yates and the termination without explanation       of Daniel Ragsdale as acting Director of Immigration and       Customs Enforcement (ICE). The need to brief the full       Democratic.Caucus is also necessary as we now understand that       guidance concerning the January 27 Executive Order has been       provided to Members of the Republican Conference, but not the       Democratic Caucus. According to yesterday's Washington Post,       ``substantive guidance [concerning the Executive Order was       given] to congressional Republicans . . . late Saturday. . .       . In a two-page memo that offered some details on the policy       . . .''.        The Executive Order harms our families, economy, and       national security. Over the weekend, individuals--some of       whom have been lawful permanent residents for decades--were       found stranded outside the United States, leaving families in       turmoil. Technology companies, including industry leaders       like Microsoft, Google, and Apple, report that the Executive       Order could directly impact their employees and hinder their       ability to attract the best talent from around the world. In       addition, the policy reflected in the Executive Order is       counterproductive to our national security. We understand       that scores of American diplomats stationed across the globe       are drafting a formal ``dissent memo'' to register their       objections, stating that the order will ``not achieve its aim       of making our country safer'' and will instead result in a       ``drop in international good will towards Americans and a       threat to our economy.'' We need to develop relationships       with Muslim countries and others seeking to combat terrorism.       Unfortunately, the Order alienates many of the groups we need       to have working alongside us.        The Executive Order is both controversial and confusing.       For example, the International Rescue Committee called the       Order ``harmful and hasty'' noting ``America has the       strongest, most successful resettlement program in the       world.'' Over 4,000 academics, including 25 Nobel Laureates,       have signed a petition denouncing the Order, writing ``[t]his       measure is fatally disruptive to the lives of these       immigrants, their families, and the communities of which they       form an integral part. It is inhumane, ineffective, and un-      American.'' The Order has resulted in widespread confusion,       as hundreds of individuals have been improperly detained at       our airports, at least four federal courts have issued stays       concerning the Order, and protests have broken out at       airports and other venues nationwide. At the time this letter       was sent, 16 State Attorneys General have condemned the       Executive Order.        In the interest of exercising proper Congressional       oversight of DHS and CBP and of holding agencies accountable,       we write to urgently request an emergency briefing this week       with you and others at DHS and the Administration concerning       the Executive Order. Among other things, we would like to       receive the following, either at or in advance of the       briefing:        Any DHS guidance, directive, or policy regarding       interpretation and implementation of the Executive Order,       specifically is it pertains to current visa holders seeking       entry into the United States, visa applicants, lawful       permanent residents, dual citizens, and U.S. citizens, as       well as clarification on the status of the individuals from       the seven designated countries in the Order who are applying       for or renewing immigration benefits.        Details on individuals who have been prevented from       entering the country, including the airport at which they       arrived, location of detention, number provided with       interpretation services, number who have been released broken       down by airport, number of individuals who were sent back       broken down by nationality, and a breakdown of the       immigration status of those being detained and those who were       sent back.        The manner in which DHS is complying with the various       court-issued stays of removal, including the number of       individuals who have been provided access to counsel.        What, if, any accommodations are being considered for       interpreters and translators from the seven designated       nations who have worked with our military and intelligence,       as well as notable academics coming to do research in the       U.S.        The manner in which the exceptions to the Executive Order's       application with respect to ``religious minorities'' will be       applied, particularly given Mr. Trump's series of statements       concerning his preference for Christian refugees.        In addition, and among other things, we would like to be       briefed by you on the accuracy of President Trump's assertion       that the Executive Order can be justified because then-      president Obama had ``banned visas for refugees from Iraq for       six months'' in 2011. It is our understanding that in 2011       the Iraqi resettlement program was subject to a simple       reduction for a short time while new security measures were       added, In stark contrast, Mr. Trump's Executive Order calls       for a suspension of all refugees, not just one category, in       addition to suspending the Syrian program indefinitely.        For decades both Democratic and Republican Presidents have       supported granting safe haven to families fleeing       persecution, violence, terror, sexual slavery, and torture.       At a time of unprecedented forced migration across the world,       the need for American leadership in these areas has not       subsided.        Given the urgency, widespread confusion and dangerous       impact of the Executive Order, we would appreciate hearing       from you as quickly as possible so that we may ensure the       briefing occurs by no later than Friday, February 3. The       lives and well-being of many individuals, as well as our       ability to partner with foreign governments to fight       terrorism, depends on it.             Sincerely,      John Conyers, Jr.        Member of Congress.      Zoe Lofgren,        Member of Congress.      Pramila Jayapal,        Member of Congress.        (And an additional 111 Members of Congress.)                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 22 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, February 3, 2017, at  9 a.m.                            ____________________
