 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 713, line 4, after the dollar amount insert:       ``(increased by $500,000) (decreased by $500,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan) and a Member opposed  each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I will be brief. My amendment moves a small amount of  money within the OSHA bureaucracy in order to put enforcement Federal  boots on the ground in the Pacific region where my district, the  Northern Mariana Islands, is.                                time  1730    Some of you may know that the Northern Mariana Islands are in a  transition from overreliance on foreign workers to an economy that is  predominantly U.S. workers. As part of that transition effort, last  month the House passed and the President signed into law an increase in  the fee that is used to train U.S. workers to replace foreign workers.  At the end of this month, minimum wage goes up bringing us within 20  cents of the U.S. minimum wage, $7.05 an hour. These changes are all  part of the strategy to make the workplace more accessible and  attractive to U.S. workers who are still on the sidelines unemployed.   There is one more small but important move we can make: assure these  potential U.S. workers that job sites are safe. We are fortunate to  have lots of investment in the resort industry in the Northern Mariana  Islands right now. Hotels are going up, and waterlines are being laid.  I imagine some Members have had a first job working construction, so  they know there are inherent dangers on a construction site. Frankly,  we have already had accidents.   Now every State has an OSHA office. There is an OSHA office in  Honolulu, but that is 4,000 miles away from my district, and we have no  Federal safety officer on duty in the Northern Mariana Islands. We need  a real Federal presence--boots on the ground--that will assure U.S.  workers that if they get a job working construction, the workplace is  safe. As I say, this is one more element in the strategy to put U.S.  workers into jobs.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this is moving money. We have enough money  for compliance education. The problem is that it is like having driver  education knowing that the next sheriff is 4,000 miles away--you are  not going to get caught driving. We need Federal boots on the ground.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey).    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers. I ask my  friends and my colleagues to please support this lifesaving amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
