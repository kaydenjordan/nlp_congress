 Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.    I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah, Mr. Romney, on  behalf of himself and Senator Collins, submits a question.   The clerk will read the question.   Oh, I apologize. The question is for both sides, and the time will be  evenly divided.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         When President Trump sent the disparaging tweet at 2:24       p.m. regarding Vice President Pence, was he aware that the       Vice President had been removed from the Senate by the Secret       Service for his safety?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House managers. And time will be  evenly divided.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. I'm sorry. Could the question be read again, Mr.  President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Of course.   Could the clerk read the question again.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         When President Trump sent the disparaging tweet at 2:24       p.m. regarding Vice President Pence, was he aware that the       Vice President had been removed from the Senate by the Secret       Service for his safety?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House managers are recognized for 2\1/ 2\ minutes.   Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. Thank you. Well, let me tell you what he  said at 2:24 p.m. He said:   [[Page S685]]              Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have       been done to protect our Country and our Constitution . . .       USA demands the truth!    And you know by now what was all over the media. You couldn't turn on  the television, you couldn't turn on the radio, you couldn't consume  any media or probably take any phone calls or anything else without  hearing about this and also hearing about the Vice President.   And here is what Donald Trump had to know at that time because the  whole world knew it. All of us knew it. Live television had, by this  point, shown that the insurgents were already inside the building and  that they had weapons and that the police were outnumbered.   And here are the facts that are not in dispute. Donald Trump had not  taken any measures to send help to the overwhelmed Capitol Police.   As President, at that point, when you see all this going on and the  people all around you are imploring you to do something and your Vice  President is there, why wouldn't you do it? Donald Trump had not  publicly condemned the attack, the attackers, or told them to stand  down despite multiple pleas to do so, and Donald Trump hadn't even  acknowledged the attack.   And, after Wednesday's trial portion concluded, Senator Tuberville  spoke to reporters and confirmed the call that he had with the  President and did not dispute Manager Cicilline's description in any  way that there was a call between he and the President around the time  that Mike Pence was being ushered out of the Chamber, and that was  shortly after 2 p.m.   And Senator Tuberville specifically said that he told the President:  Mr. President, they just took the Vice President out; I have got to go.   That was shortly after 2 p.m. There were still hours of chaos and  carnage and mayhem, and the Vice President and his family were still in  danger at that point. Our Commander in Chief did nothing.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Counsel for the former President.   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. The answer is no. At no point was the  President informed the Vice President was in any danger. Because the  House rushed through this impeachment in 7 days with no evidence, there  is nothing at all in the record on this point because the House failed  to do even a minimum amount of due diligence.   What the President did know is that there was a violent--there was a  violent riot happening at the Capitol. That is why he repeatedly called  via tweet and via video for the riots to stop, to be peaceful, to  respect Capitol Police and law enforcement, and to commit no violence  and to go home.   But to be clear, this is an Article of Impeachment for incitement;  this is not an Article of Impeachment for anything else. It is one  count. They could have charged anything they wanted. They chose to  charge incitement. So that the question--although answered directly no,  it is not really relevant to the charges for the impeachment in this  case.   And I just wanted to clear up one more thing. Mr. Castro, in his  first answer, may have misspoke, but what he said was Mr. Trump had  said ``fight to the death.'' That is false. I am hoping he misspoke.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my friend  Gary Herbert on a career of esteemed public service. Gary's steady hand  of leadership as the 17th Governor of Utah guided our State closer to  fulfilling its promise of safety, security, and prosperity for all  Utahns.   A son of Orem, UT, Gary faithfully answered his call to service in  his early life and career. From his missionary service for The Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to his military and civil service  as a staff sergeant in the Utah Army National Guard, to elected office,  Gary's unwavering early commitment to public service earned him the  respect and experience necessary for future success.  [[Page S703]]    Gary Herbert's unique ability to articulate sound public policy on  behalf of his community earned him a seat on the Utah County  Commission, where he demonstrated principled leadership for 14 years.  Soon after, Herbert was elected to serve as lieutenant governor,  overseeing multiple statewide commissions and the State electoral  office. Four years later, Utahns reaffirmed their State's leadership  with a record reelection victory for Governor John Huntsman Jr. and  Lieutenant Governor Herbert.   Governor Herbert assumed the mantle of leadership and gubernatorial  responsibilities on August 11, 2009, following the resignation of his  predecessor. For the next decade, the Governor approached significant  challenges with a sharp focus and principled decision making. He  surrounded himself with impressive public servants and exemplified a  compassionate and nuanced approach to good governance. Through an early  economic crisis and a myriad of complex public policy challenges  relating to civil liberties, faith, education, infrastructure, and  public health, Governor Herbert's legacy reflects his impressive  caliber of personal character and leadership in difficult  circumstances.   Gary's lifetime of public service is sustained by the devotion he  shares with former First Lady Jeannette Herbert and their children and  grandchildren. Our great State owes Gary Herbert and his family an  abundance of gratitude for years of integrity and virtue as Utah's  chief public servant. Utah will continue to shine as the brightest star  on our American flag.                            ____________________
