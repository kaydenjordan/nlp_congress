 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the Bureau of Land Management has a  mission set by Congress; that is, to manage the Nation's public lands  under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, which means  that public land should be open to everything, from hunting and grazing  to energy development and other reasonable uses.   The BLM currently manages more than 246 million acres of land and 700  million acres of Federal and non-Federal subsurface estate. Much of  these lands are in the West, where Federal acres coexist with private  and State-owned land. In order to manage its resources effectively, BLM  is required to provide resource management plans. This planning has  typically been led by BLM's field offices, in coordination with State,  local, and Tribal governments that provide local input on how best to  manage the land and its unique resources. However, in the final months  of the last administration, the BLM sought to apply a top-down  approach, essentially a one-size-fits-all, top-down approach to this  resource management process. They termed it the planning 2.0 final  rule.   The rule which was finalized in December changed how this planning is  done and undermined the well-established process by limiting the  ability of local input, public comment, and meaningful State  consultation.   The final rule also pulled decision-making away from the regional BLM  field offices and centralized it at BLM's headquarters in Washington,  under the concept of ``landscape-level planning,'' which lets  Washington define new  [[Page S1616]]  areas covering multiple States. The rule takes important decision- making away from local officials who know the land and understand the  needs of their communities.   The BLM rule sought to ignore the multiple-use requirements  established by Congress and diminishes the importance of energy  development. The rule tilts the balance in favor of conservation and  non-development and away from responsible energy development, as well  as other uses, like grazing.   In a State like North Dakota, with a distinctive patchwork of  underground Federal minerals and private or State surface ownership,  this creates more uncertainty for energy producers and more difficulty  for our ranchers. By repealing this rule, we are preserving our  longstanding tradition of allowing multiple uses on Federal lands,  while protecting the livelihoods of our ranchers, energy producers, and  many others. That is why this resolution is supported by the North  Dakota Stockmen's Association, along with the National Association of  Counties, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture,  the Farm Bureau, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Public  Lands Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, just to name a few.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the CRA on the BLM planning  2.0 rule. I thank Chairman Murkowski, the chairman of our Energy  Committee, for her leadership on this important issue.   The House passed this CRA on February 7 in a bipartisan manner. I am  hopeful the Senate will do so as well and send this bill to the  President's desk this week.   Today's CRA ensures that State, local, and Tribal input and expertise  should guide the management of our public lands. Let's stop the BLM's  planning 2.0 rule and give the people who live and work in these  communities a say on what happens in their hometowns. We can do that by  voting for this CRA. I urge my colleagues to do so.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.
