 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fallen  Marine, Cpl Daegan William-Tyeler Page. Corporal Page was a son of the  heartland, originally from Red Oak, IA, and raised in Omaha, NE. He is  one of 13 brave servicemembers who gave his life in service to our  country during the evacuation of Afghanistan. Just 23 years old when he  was killed at the attack at the Kabul airport, he gave his life  defending our citizens and our allies as they tried to escape from  Afghanistan.   Right after graduating from Millard South High School, Corporal Page  joined the Marines and was part of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine  Regiment. He enjoyed playing hockey, and was an avid sports fan,  especially of the Chicago Blackhawks. Corporal Page loved spending time  outdoors, hunting, and being in the water. He was a Boy Scout, a good  friend to many, and a member of St. Paul's Lutheran Church.   My prayers are with his parents, Wendy and Craig Adelson and Greg and  Jenni Page, as well as his brothers and sister, his grandparents, his  girlfriend Jessica Ellison, and his other family members and many  friends.   We all owe Corporal Page and his fellow marines a debt of gratitude.  He and those he served with rescued countless Americans and allies.  They went into the chaos of the withdrawal from Afghanistan to help  strangers that they never met--to save lives. There is no doubt in my  mind that many lives were saved because of Corporal Page's service, and  his sacrifice will not be forgotten.                            ____________________     Mr. President, border security is one of the  government's most important responsibilities. A sovereign, successful  Nation's self-determination and safety depend upon it, and we are no  exception.   Our border security rests exclusively with the Federal Government.  And the Department of Homeland Security--a Cabinet created in 2002, I  believe, in the aftermath of the September 11 attack--is entrusted with  this paramount duty of protecting our border.   Fusing homeland with security for its name wasn't an accident. That  wordage casts the Department's purpose to protect the country from  external threats, both from people and from products. And Americans pay  for that Department handsomely and for its responsibilities about $52  billion a year.   However, a grave, unprecedented crisis exists at our southern border.  Our television reminds us of that fact daily. Foreign nationals are  illegally crossing into our country from Mexico by the thousands every  day. I heard recently that last month was the biggest number coming in  for over 20 years. But illegal immigration isn't the only crime  cascading over our borders.   Mexican cartels are importing deadly drugs and trafficking humans.  These horrific, unabated events make very clear that the cartels  effectively control our southern border. They actually manage who and  what enters our country from Mexico.   But the danger is preventable. The trouble exists because the current  administration deliberately refuses to secure the border.   Homeland Security's border dereliction is inexcusable, and it happens  to be life-threatening, not only from drugs but from criminals and for  national security because terrorists have been arrested.   Communities across all States, then, are plagued by the crime and the  drugs killing Americans by the tens of thousands every year. The figure  from 2020 is over 93,000 Americans dying from drug overdoses--a 31- percent increase from just the previous year. That exceeds the Rose  Bowl's capacity, as just one example of comparison.   One drug is very prolific: Mexican fentanyl, probably fentanyl coming  through Mexico from China. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid. It is 50  times more potent than heroin. An infinitesimal amount, even as small  as a grain of salt, can cause a death. The cartels are producing the  deadly drug and smuggling it into the United States at record highs.  They are also adding fentanyl to other drugs for increased potency and,  of course, increased profits--often without the user of that drug even  knowing that fact--and sometimes even market that fentanyl-laced drug  into heroin.   Unsurprisingly, then, deaths result. From January 2019 to June of  2019, almost 62 percent of the overdose deaths involved a fentanyl- related substance.   The authority scheduling fentanyl analogs expire next month. Congress  must act to permanently schedule these drugs and punish the cartels and  the drug dealers who spread this poison across our communities.   We are a nation of compassion, but we are also a nation of laws. We  are not obligated under any charade of compassion to ignore border  crime, particularly the surge of deadly drugs killing tens of thousands  here each year. But the government, as we see, sits idly by as cartel  drugs poison Americans and unleash drug-related violence upon our  communities.   Border security is essential in keeping our public safety threats and  a cartel-controlled border presents our greatest criminal threat.   The Federal Government must be a staunch ally to the States in  stopping the crime. The cartels benefit immensely from an unsecured  border, and they are not exactly screening for threats to our national  security and public safety.   We have reached a critical juncture and must choose who actually  controls the southern border, and, consequently, our self-determination  and our safety. Violent drug cartels or home security--which is it? The  choice directs our future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, today, I speak to my  fellow colleagues on the extraordinary courage, bravery, and patriotism  that the men and women in our Armed Forces showed to the entire world,  yet again, in the last several months in Afghanistan.   Now, we see plenty of evidence that they were placed in an impossible  situation because of the bad judgment and leadership failures of  President Biden.   Despite President Biden's bad judgment, our men and women in uniform  again exceeded expectations. In the process of doing their job for  people whom they don't even know, we lost 13 of our best who gave the  ultimate sacrifice for their country, and 18 more suffered serious  injuries.   I pray--and I assume all Americans pray--for their families for the  loss that those families have suffered.   Those 13 young men and women will never, and should never, be  forgotten. They are heroes.   This disastrous exit was entirely avoidable, which makes the loss of  life even more gut-wrenching.   Intelligent and honest people can disagree on whether the Americans  should have left Afghanistan, but it is unthinkable that anyone could  justify the manner in which this administration carried out this  disaster.   The Biden administration left Americans behind. This is the United  States of America. We never leave our people behind. I have heard from  many Iowans who are outraged by this moral failure.   When he took office, President Biden arrogantly announced that  ``America is back.'' Now the world is seeing America in retreat. The  Russians and Red China are crowing over this comedy.   I and others have compared the imagery and the perception to the fall  of Saigon. But, remember, in that case, we had pulled our military out  before we broke our promises to the South Vietnamese military.   In this case, it appears that crucial support for the Afghan military  was withdrawn while we were relying on that same military to hold off  the Taliban long enough to complete our withdrawal.   I have been at many briefings related to President Biden's Afghan  exit. I have tasked my oversight and policy staff to do the same. Some  have been classified briefings; others were not classified. What I can  say--and what I believe the American people ought to know--is that this  administration couldn't track the state of play on the ground in the  way that they should have had the capability to do.   Every briefing gave a more dire and desperate picture than the one  briefing we received before. It was obvious that this administration  was losing control. Yet it was clear to me and my colleagues that the  administration never sufficiently changed its posture in the region as  the facts on the ground changed from bad to worse.   When the administration officials were questioned about this  strategy, they often publicly responded that what they were doing was  based on Presidential-level decisions.  [[Page S6532]]    Joe Biden owns this disastrous exit, plain and simple. But, also,  Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, and General Milley are not without  blame.   The exit has realized the worst fears of every Afghan who, over 20  years, learned to dream of peace, and every naysayer who said: Wait,  and they will leave. Our enemies were right, and now we have left.   The Biden administration certainly left the women of Afghanistan  behind. They are once again being beaten, killed in the streets for  supposed crimes, such as daring to speak, wanting an education, not  covering their faces, and, in some cases, simply walking in public.   The Biden administration, in its hasty exit, effectively armed the  Taliban with advanced American military weaponry that is now being used  to oppress the Afghan people. The Taliban is now patrolling our streets  in Kabul in American vehicles, wearing American uniforms, and carrying  American-made weapons.   Some of the violent terrorists released by the Obama administration  are now in political leadership roles in this Taliban regime. Other  members of the Taliban leadership have remained on the FBI's most  wanted list, and they have been on that list for many years, including  one with a $10 million bounty. Now, if this were a movie script, nobody  would believe it.   In addition to the equipment and the funds, it is crucial that we  remember the human cost in Afghanistan. We lost 2,461 servicemembers,  18 of whom came from my State of Iowa. We also lost 3,846 contractors,  66,000 American military and police, 1,144 allied servicemembers, 444  aid workers, and 72 journalists. These numbers hit home. They hit deep.  And we should never forget them.   These numbers also don't account for the stain on our national  reputation for blatantly disregarding the welfare of the Afghan people  who fought alongside us to help us accomplish our mission there.  Leaving behind allies will have consequences that will affect our  ability to build coalitions in the future. It will negatively impact  our ability to defeat future enemies.   Looking through the negatives, the heartache and the pain that our  country has suffered from this terribly executed exit, I remain  hopeful. Where the Biden administration has failed, we have seen  veterans and current members of our armed services filling the  leadership gap. Where our government didn't keep its promise by working  together, these veterans and current members of our armed services and  the groups associated with them quickly built ad hoc networks to ensure  their Afghan brothers-in-arms and their families were able to leave  their crumbling country safely.   Americans have been inspired by reports of Operation Pineapple  Express, organized by special operations veterans who, without even  being asked or without even asking for permission, helped hundreds of  Afghan allies and their families to safety.   One of the more inspiring stories from this disastrous exit involved  an Afghan family being guided by his former U.S. marine brother to  Abbey Gate at the Kabul airport. The Afghan family was instructed by  the U.S. Marine veterans to carry signs with them that invoked Marine  Corps phrases that our marines at Abbey Gate would understand but the  Taliban would not understand.   After several attempts, the marines on the wall saw the signs and  were able to retrieve the family and escort them through Abbey Gate  only moments before the suicide attack that took the lives of 11  marines, a Navy corpsman, a U.S. soldier, and scores and scores of  Afghan civilians.   When the Marine Corps veteran network was eventually able to make  contact with the interpreter, he was asked if he and his family were  all right. His reply was, ``Of course I'm good. I'm with marines.''   Now, that is just one story, but this isn't the only amazing story  regarding our veterans and our servicemembers. Pictures that were taken  during this time show the desperation of the Afghan people: mothers  desperately throwing their children to American troops in the hope that  even if the parents couldn't reach safety, their children could. These  pictures also show the pure hearts of these American warriors whom we  honor.   During this 20-year conflict, our service men and women have never  wavered in their duty to God and country, consistently showing their  ability to annihilate the enemy. They defeated the Taliban, liberated  the people of Afghanistan, and protected our country from further  terrorist attacks for 20 years.   During their final hours in Kabul, our young warriors did something  unimaginable for almost any other country's military: They injected  humanity into the dark fringes of a war-torn conflict during a mass  evacuation. We have seen the pictures of marines in full battle attire  holding crying infants. We have seen our servicemembers giving the  shirts off their backs to keep children warm. This stands in contrast  to the actions of political leaders thousands of miles away here, where  we stand this very day.   Despite the Taliban's most recent acts of barbarism, the Biden  administration has begun discussing potential recognition of the  Taliban as a government. The possibility of taxpayer-funded foreign aid  has been dangled as a carrot to incentivize their good behavior. This  is pure naivete on the part of anybody in this administration thinking  about that.   The Biden administration's string of foreign policy blunders has  created a domino effect that Americans will feel for years to come.  Afghanistan could once again become the epicenter for terrorist  activities that will launch future attacks on our Nation--hopefully not  another 9/11. I pray that my concerns will not become reality, but  somehow I have to have fear that they will be reality. At the very  least, Americans' credibility on the world stage with our allies, even  with our enemies, has taken a huge hit.   In the unfortunate event that our worst fears come to light, my  solace is in the knowledge that our service men and women continue to  have the strength to overcome the failures of our own political  leaders.   So, to my fellow Americans, let us never forget the sacrifices of our  men and women in the armed services and the sacrifices that that means  for protecting our freedom and security. Their service and sacrifice  have been of immeasurable value. All Americans owe a debt to them that  can never fully be repaid.                            ____________________
