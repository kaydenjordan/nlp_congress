 Madam Speaker, I am honored to rise today in support of a  critical piece of legislation, H.R. 3763, the Promoting United States  International Leadership in 5G Act of 2019, and I want to thank my  friend and colleague from Texas' 10th District.   There is no doubt information and technology hold immense power. And  it is amazing to be in the same building where the very first Morse  code telegram was received so long ago, right here in this building.   As America builds on that legacy of technology, we have an  opportunity to help lead the next global revolution, Industry 4.0, an  era of artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, and  cloud computing.   I am proud to represent an area, North Texas, that plays an  instrumental role in developing 5G; and it is imperative that we  establish an environment in which American businesses can thrive.   One of the companies guiding us forward in North Texas is Ericcson.  Their North American corporate headquarters, with 3,000 employees, is  in the Third District of Texas. Ericcson is investing in research and  development and partnering with other strategic American players to  accelerate 5G commercialization.   America's leadership begins now, and we can't allow opportunities to  shape the international conversation to pass us by, which is why this  legislation here today is so important.   H.R. 3763 will ensure America has a seat at the table when it comes  to determining the global telecom standards that this era will operate  within.   I am proud to represent a North Texas district with business taking  an active role in 5G development.   I want to, again, thank my colleague,  Mike McCaul. I appreciate his  leadership on this important issue.
