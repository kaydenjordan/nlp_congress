 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 350th  anniversary of the city of Sault Sainte Marie, MI. As one of the oldest  cities in the State of Michigan, as well as the United States, Sault  Ste. Marie is endowed with a rich history, dynamic present, and bright  future.   As early as 800 A.D., the Chippewa Indians, originally referred to as  Ojibway, inhabited the area now known as Sault Ste. Marie. The Chippewa  Indians called the region ``Bahweting,'' or ``the Gathering Place,''  due to the wealth of fish and fur found along the St. Marys River, the  only water connection between Lake Superior and the other Great Lakes.   In the early 1600s, British, French, and Jesuit missionaries ventured  to the territory, including Fr. Jaques Marquette. In 1668, Fr. Jaques  Marquette renamed the settlement Sault Ste. Marie in honor of the  Virgin Mary, establishing the first permanent settlement in the Great  Lakes region. Due to the abundant natural resources and strategic  location of the St. Marys River, the French and British repeatedly  fought over the area, as well as the right to trade with the Chippewa  and Ottawa Tribes. Although Fr. Jaques Marquette built the first  permanent structure, John Johnson is considered to be the first  permanent settler in Sault Ste. Marie. In the late 1790s, Johnson and  his family moved to the region to open a fur trade operation along the  St. Marys River. In 1797, the Northwest Fur Company constructed a  navigation lock approximately 38-feet long on the Canadian side of the  St. Marys River. Unfortunately, the lock was destroyed in the War of  1812.   In 1820, the Chippewa Indians signed the Treaty of the Sault that  turned control of Sault Ste. Marie to the United States. In 1852,  almost three decades later, the State of Michigan contracted Fairbanks  Scale Company to build a lock designed to permit waterborne commerce  between Lake Superior and the other Great Lakes. The Fairbanks Scale  Company constructed a system of two locks, each 350 feet long, called  the State Lock. The State of Michigan operated and maintained the locks  for more than a decade, but as the shipping traffic and vessel sizes  increased, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers assumed ownership of the  facility and constructed a larger lock, more than 515 feet long, named  the Weitzel Lock. Since then, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers oversaw  the construction and replacement of five locks, later known as the Soo  Locks, in order to meet the growing demand for larger vessels: First  Poe Lock, Davis Lock, Sabin Lock, MacArthur Lock, and Second Poe Lock.  Over the past 350 years, Sault Ste. Marie transformed from a base for  fisherman and fur traders to an international gateway for community  development and economic growth.   Today, Sault Ste. Marie is home to more than 13,000 residents who  enjoy the beautiful parks, historic downtown, and safe neighborhoods.  Situated in Chippewa County, the city provides a number of recreational  activities designed to enhance the quality of life for residents,  ranging from the Sault Seal Recreation Area and Voyageur Island, to the  River of History Museum and Sherman Park. Sault Ste. Marie is also  active in the preservation and promotion of historic landmarks,  including the Historic Locks Park Walkway, the John Johnston House, and  the Kemp Coal Dock Office. Recognized as ``the place where Michigan was  born,'' Sault Ste. Maris captivates the attention of residents and  visitors from around the globe.   I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the rich  history, significant contributions, and outstanding achievements of the  city of Sault Sainte Marie. I wish the city continued growth and  prosperity in the years ahead.                            ____________________
