 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6662) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to  extend the special election period under part C of the Medicare program  for certain deemed individuals enrolled in a reasonable cost  reimbursement contract to certain nondeemed individuals enrolled in  such contract, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6662         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 6662, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, our seniors deserve to have adequate time to choose the  Medicare plan that best fits their healthcare needs. This is especially  important today for seniors who are currently enrolled in a Medicare  cost plan that will be impacted by a mandatory transition date starting  on January 1 of next year.   That is why I authored and introduced this legislation, H.R. 6662,  the Empowering Seniors' Enrollment Decision Act, to ensure that cost  plan enrollees have extra enrollment time when choosing a Medicare plan  later this fall.   I want to thank my colleague, Congressman Kind, for his work on this  legislation, as well and his bipartisan support.   It is recognized there are more than 630,000 cost plan enrollees  nationwide. Approximately 400,000 of those enrollees are actually in my  State in Minnesota. Now some cost plan beneficiaries will be allowed to  stay with their current cost plan, and others will be deemed, or  automatically enrolled, later at the end of this year to a new Medicare  Advantage plan. Nondeemed beneficiaries, however, will be forced to  shop for new Medicare coverage.   This bipartisan bill we have before us today extends and moves the  special enrollment period for all cost plan enrollees from December 8  until the end of February of next year, 2019. So the bill would  essentially fix current law to allow cost plans to deem existing  enrollees into new Medicare Advantage plans in future years. H.R. 6662  provides much-needed certainty for our seniors.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the committee and Congressman Kind for  their work on partnering with this effort, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, just to remind our Members, I want to thank Mr. Levin  for his comments on the bipartisan components of this bill as well.   The bill does provide and ensure that there is certainty for our  seniors who may need a little bit of extra time as they navigate their  Medicare choices and they decide which choices and options are best for  them. This can be a cumbersome and confusing process.   I want to thank, again, Representative Kind, my colleague, for his  work on this bill. We look forward to having a strong bipartisan vote  in the House as it moves forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1515
