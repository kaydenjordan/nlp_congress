 Mr. President, we have had a number of discussions about  how to go about repealing and replacing the health care bill that is  now law in our country. We have had a number of very thoughtful  discussions on our side. I know a date has been put in this  reconciliation of January 27, and we realize that is not a real date.  That is a placeholder. That is the earliest they can come back.   In talking with leadership and working through this, we understand  that everyone here understands the importance of doing it right, giving  Tom Price, the new HHS person, the time to weigh in and help us make  this work in the appropriate way. For that reason, we plan to withdraw  this amendment and place our faith in the fact that we are going to do  this in a manner that works well for the American people.   I yield to Senator Portman.

Mr. President, if there is any time, I would like to also  say there have been a lot of concerns about the fiscal nature of this-- making sure that we do it in a manner that does not waste taxpayer  resources. There has been another concern--obviously, making sure that  these health care plans stay in place during transition. Both  discussions have been very thoughtful, very helpful, and I think that  everyone understands what is at stake in this process, and hopefully we  will move through it in a way that will reflect the fact that we want  this to work for the American people.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.   The Senator from Wyoming.
