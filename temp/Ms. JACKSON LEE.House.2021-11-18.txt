 Madam Speaker, over the last couple of months,  hundreds of individuals have come to Washington from all over the  country to protest the lack of the passage of the Voting Rights Act,  the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Act, and, as well, the Freedom to  Vote Act.   Freedom to Vote and John Robert Lewis voting laws are the  underpinnings of this great Nation. It exemplifies the beginning of the  Constitution, that we were created to create a more perfect Union. It  underlies the elimination of slavery, the right to vote for all people,  and due process.   We must move these important, crucial legislative initiatives that  are more than laws; they are the very heart of this Nation.   The Senate must move. It must move now.   More people are coming. They will be arrested, and they are insisting  that we move.   I am ready--I know we are, this House under Democratic leadership--to  pass both bills. We seek this legislation now. We cannot wait.   People want to vote, and they want to vote safely, and they want to  end the big lie. Let's vote.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his great  leadership.   This bill is about people; people who are working, people who need  help. It is about people; the American people.   I am very happy that this bill really focuses on the needs of people  in Texas. In Texas, people are paying $9,428 for a toddler, but we are  now going to provide them with childcare for 3- and 4-year olds, and  free childcare. We are going to provide it for 2 million-plus children  in the State of Texas. We are, in essence, going to make sure that  these children are learning.   You want to ask about inflation? That is corporate greed. Everyone  knows when corporations raise the price of goods, there is inflation.  But economists know that that is not going to exist because we are  putting money in the pockets of working men and women, giving them a  child tax cut.   We are also providing students to be able to go to community college,  HBCUs, 4-year colleges with $550 in Pell Grants. That is what this bill  is about, helping people; helping people with their childcare, helping  people go to school.   It is also about making sure that the hungry children in Texas are  able to eat. 1,642,000 students will be able to receive food. That is  what this is about; putting money where people are having the need.   And yes, making sure that uninsured people, 766,000 in Texas without  any insurance, suffering through the pandemic, now have insurance.   And we know that there has been an increase in violence; $2.5 billion  in preventing violence.   This is about people; people who will have housing. It is about  people. Vote for the Build Back Better Act. I thank President Biden.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in strong support of  the Build Back Better Act (RCP 117-18, H.R. 5376), and am proud to have  this opportunity to explain why this $1.75 billion package, conceived  and advanced by President Biden and House Democrats, makes visionary  and transformative investments to change for the better the health,  well-being, and financial security of America's workers and families.   Today we are completing the job we began with the passage of the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, which I witnessed President Biden  sign on the South Lawn of the White House.   To put it all in perspective, Madam Speaker, we have before us a once  in a century opportunity to make gigantic progress in making ours a  more perfect union, and to do it in a single bound with enactment of  the Build Back Better Act, the most transformative legislation passed  by this Congress since the Great Society and the New Deal.   I would urge my Republican colleagues to heed the words of Republican  Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully earlier this  year:   ``At this point in time in this nation, we need to go big. We need to  quit counting the egg-sucking legs on the cows and count the cows and  just move. And move forward and move right now.''   The same sentiment was expressed more eloquently by Abraham Lincoln  in 1862 when he memorably wrote:   ``The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the  occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We  must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.''   Madam Speaker, I am especially excited to support this bill because  it directly impacts the members of my community and will improve the  lives of Texans everywhere.   The Build Back Better Act will bring down costs that have held back  families in Texas for decades by cutting taxes and making child care,  home care, education, health care, and housing more affordable.   These investments will provide new learning opportunities for  children, help parents, and especially working parents, make ends meet,  and position the economy for stronger growth for years to come.   The Build Back Better Act will create good-paying jobs for residents  of Texas, combating climate change, giving our kids cleaner air and  water, and making America the leader in global innovation and 21st  century manufacturing.   Specifically, Madam Speaker, the Build Back Better Act delivers the  largest investment in child care and early education in history by  providing access to affordable child care.   Child care is a major strain for families in Texas, where the average  annual cost of a child care center for a toddler is $9,428, meaning  that a Texas family with two young children would on average spend 21  percent of their income on child care for one year.   The lack of affordable options also makes it difficult for parents,  and especially mothers, to  [[Page H6580]]  remain in their jobs, contributing to the 26.1 percent gender gap in  workforce participation between mothers and fathers in Texas.   The Build Back Better Act will enable Texas to provide access to  child care for 2,011,503 young children (ages 0-5) per year from  families earning under 2.5 times the Texas median income (about  $205,204 for a family of 4), and ensure these families pay no more than  7 percent of their income on high-quality child care.   The Build Back Better Act will provide universal, high-quality, free  preschool for every 3- and 4-year old in America.   In contrast, today, only 24 percent of the 775,102 3- and 4-year-olds  in Texas have access to publicly-funded preschool, and it costs about  $8,600 per year for those who cannot access a publicly-funded program.   The Build Back Better Act will enable Texas to expand access to free,  high-quality preschool to more than 588,286 additional 3- and 4-year- olds per year and increase the quality of preschool for children who  are already enrolled.   Parents will be able to send their children to the preschool setting  of their choice--from public schools to child care providers to Head  Start--leading to lifelong educational benefits, allowing more parents  to go back to work, and building a stronger foundation for Texas's  future economic competitiveness.   The Build Back Better Act cuts taxes and reduces some of the largest  expenses for workers and families, like education, health care, and  housing.   Madam Speaker, the average cost of a 2-year degree in Texas is $2,885  per year, and $11,096 per year for a 4-year degree, straining many  student budgets.   To help unlock the opportunities of an education beyond high school,  the Build Back Better Act will increase maximum Pell Grant awards by  $550 for students at public and private non-profit institutions,  supporting the 486,377 students in Texas who rely on Pell grants.   The Build Back Better Act will also invest in Texas's 112 minority- serving institutions and the students they serve, including  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges  and Universities (TCUs), and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs).   Madam Speaker, of the world's biggest economies, the United States is  second to last in investing in workforce development, and funding for  federal job training programs has dropped by almost half since 2001.   The Build Back Better Act invests in training programs that will  prepare Texas's workers for high-quality jobs in fast-growing sectors  like public health, child care, manufacturing, IT, and clean energy.  Fifty-nine public community colleges in Texas will have the opportunity  to benefit from grants to develop and deliver innovative training  programs and expand proven ones.   Madam Speaker, 18 percent of children in Texas live in food insecure  households, harming their long-term health and ability to succeed in  school.   The Build Back Better Act will ensure that the nutritional needs of  Texas's children are met by expanding access to free school meals to an  additional 1,642,000 students during the school year and providing  3,631,226 students with resources to purchase food over the summer.   When it comes to housing costs, more than 1.7 million renters in  Texas are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30 percent of  their income on rent, while homeownership remains out of reach for many  families.   The Build Back Better Act expands rental assistance for Texas  renters, while also increasing the supply of high-quality housing  through the construction and rehabilitation of over 1 million  affordable housing units nationwide.   The Build Back Better Act addresses the capital needs of the entire  public housing stock in America, and it includes one of the largest  investments in down payment assistance in history, enabling more first- generation homebuyers to purchase their first home.   Madam Speaker, access to affordable quality health care should be a  right, not a privilege, and residents of Texas facing illness should  never have to worry about how they are going to pay for treatment.   The Build Back Better Act will close the Medicaid coverage gap to  help millions of Americans gain health insurance, extend through 2025  the American Rescue Plan's health insurance premium reductions for  those who buy coverage on their own, and help older Americans access  affordable hearing care by expanding Medicare.   In Texas, that means 1,554,000 uninsured people will gain coverage,  including the 771,000 who fell into the Medicaid coverage gap, and  1,066,400 will on average save hundreds of dollars per year.   In addition, the Build Back Better Act will support maternal health  and invest in national preparedness for future pandemics.   Finally, the Build Back Better Act will expand access to home- and  community-based care to more of Texas's senior citizens and disabled  citizens and improve the quality and wages of caregiving jobs.   Madam Speaker, the federal budget is an expression of the nation's  values and the investments made to Build America Back Better are a  clear declaration of congressional Democrats' commitment to ensuring  that our government, our economy, and our systems work For The People.   These long-overdue investments in America's future will be felt in  every corner of the country and across every sector of American life,  building on the success of the American Rescue Plan, accommodating  historic infrastructure investments in the legislative pipeline, and  addressing longstanding deficits in our communities by ending an era of  chronic underinvestment so we can emerge from our current crises a  stronger, more equitable nation.   Madam Speaker, the bipartisan action we took in February 2021 when we  passed the American Rescue Plan was a giant step in the right  direction, but it was a targeted response to the immediate and urgent  public health and economic crises; it was not a long-term solution to  many of the pressing challenges facing our nation that have built up  over decades of disinvestment in our nation and its people in every  region and sector of the country.   We simply can no longer afford the costs of neglect and inaction; the  time to act is now.   The Build Back Better Act makes the transformative investments that  we need to continue growing our economy, lower costs for working  families, and position the United States as a global leader in  innovation and the jobs of the future.   This $1.75 trillion gross investment will build on the successes of  the American Rescue Plan and set our nation on a path of fiscal  responsibility and broadly shared prosperity for generations to come.   The Build Back Better Act will provide resources to improve our  education, health, and child care systems, invest in clean energy and  sustainability, address the housing crisis, and more; all while setting  America up to compete and win in the decades ahead.   The Build Back Better Act is paid for by ensuring that the wealthy  and big corporations are paying their fair share and Americans making  less than $400,000 a year will not see their taxes increase by a penny.   Let me repeat that: No American making less than $400,000 a year will  not see their taxes increase by a penny.   In sum, Madam Speaker, the investments made by the Build Back Better  Act will expand opportunity for all and build an economy powered by  shared prosperity and inclusive growth, and I would like to go into a  little more detail about the specific ways this bill will help the  people of Texas.   Contrary to what my friends on the other side of the aisle will say,  the Build Back Better Act will cut taxes for Texas families and  workers, not increase them.   Prior to the pandemic, 15 percent of children under the age of 18 in  Texas lived in poverty.   The Build Back Better Act will bolster financial security and spur  economic growth in Texas by reducing taxes on the middle class and  those striving to break into it.   Specifically, the Build Back Better Act extends Child Tax Credit  (CTC) increases of $300/month per child under 6 or $250/month per child  ages 6 to 17, which will continue the largest one-year reduction in  child poverty in history.   And critically, the agreement includes permanent refundability for  the Child Tax Credit, meaning that the neediest families will continue  to receive the full Child Tax Credit over the long-run.   The Build Back Better Act will also provide a tax cut of up to $1,500  in tax cuts for more than 1.5 million low-wage workers in Texas by  extending the American Rescue Plan's Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)  expansion.   The Build Back Better Act will address the existential threat Texans  face due to climate change by making the largest investment into our  country's green future in American history.   From 2010 to 2020, Texas experienced 67 extreme weather events,  costing up to $200 billion in damages.   The Build Back Better Act will set the United States on course to  meet its climate targets--a 50-52 percent reduction in greenhouse gas  emissions below 2005 levels by 2030--in a way that creates good-paying  union jobs, grows domestic industries, and advances environmental  justice.   The Build Back Better Act represents the largest ever single  investment in a clean energy economy--across buildings, transportation,  industry, electricity, agriculture, and climate smart practices in our  lands and waters.   And the Build Back Better Act will create a new Civilian Climate  Corps that will enlist a diverse generation of Texans in conserving our  public lands, bolstering community resilience, and addressing the  changing climate, all while putting good-paying union jobs within  reach.   In clean energy and in other sectors, the Build Back Better Act will  also strengthen domestic manufacturing and supply chains for  [[Page H6581]]  critical goods, benefiting American businesses, workers, consumers, and  communities.   The Build Back Better Act will deliver meaningful outcomes for Black  communities and help build an America in which all can thrive.   Black families are feeling the strain of the high costs of child care  and are two times more likely than white parents to have to quit, turn  down, or make a major change in their job due to child care  disruptions.   Only 26.8 percent of Black 3- and 4-year old children are enrolled in  publicly-funded preschool, while the average cost of preschool for  those without access to publicly-funded programs is $8,600.   Under the Build Back Better Act, the vast majority of working Black  families of four earning less than $300,000 will pay no more than 7  percent of their income on child care for children under 6.   This will expand access to the 9 out of 10 families with young  children across the country who are working, looking for work,  participating in an education or training program, or taking care of a  serious health condition, and who are making up to 2.5 times their  state's median income.   This means most families will cut their child care spending by more  than half--for example, for two Black parents earning $100,000 per  year, the Build Back Better Act will produce more than $5,000 in annual  child care savings.   The Build Back Better Act also offers access to free preschool for  all 3- and 4-year old children, providing Black parents access to high  quality programs in the setting of their choice--from public schools to  child care providers to Head Start.   The Build Back Better Act will also reduce the cost of home-based  care for the hundreds of thousands of older Black adults and Black  people with disabilities who need it and are unable to access it.   And investment in home care will raise wages for home care workers,  28 percent of whom are Black.   Almost 3.9 million Black people were uninsured in 2019 and even with  the Affordable Care Act's premium subsidies, coverage under the ACA was  too expensive for many families, and over 570,000 Black people fell  into the Medicaid ``coverage gap'' and were locked out of coverage  because their state refused to expand Medicaid.   The Build Back Better Act closes the Medicaid coverage gap while I  also lowering health care costs for those buying coverage through the  ACA by extending the American Rescue Plan's lower premiums, which could  save 360,000 Black people an average of $50 per person per month.   With these changes, more than one in three uninsured Black people  could gain coverage.   The Build Back Better Act also adds hearing coverage, including for  the more than 5.8 million Black people on Medicare.   And, the Build Back Better Act will make an historic investment in  maternal health, including for Black women, who die from complications  related to pregnancy at three times the rate of white women.   Madam Speaker, about 30 percent of Black renters pay over half their  income In rent.   The Build Back Better Act enables the construction, rehabilitation,  and improvement of more than 1 million affordable homes, boosting  housing supply and reducing price pressures for renters and homeowners  and will make investments to improve the safety, energy efficiency, and  quality of existing public housing, where nearly half of residents are  Black.   It also expands the availability of housing choice vouchers to  hundreds of thousands more families, including the nearly half of  current voucher holders who are Black.   The Build Back Better Act will remove lead-based paint from housing  units, which disproportionately affects Black children and provides  grants for resident-led community development projects in neighborhoods  that have faced systemic disinvestment.   The Build Back Better Act will ensure that the nutritional needs of  Black children are met by expanding access to free school meals during  the school year and providing students with resources to purchase food  over the summer.   Madam Speaker, about 22.1 percent of Black people fall below the  poverty line, struggling to pay expenses like food, rent, health care,  and transportation for their families.   The Build Back Better Act extends the Child Tax Credit, providing a  major tax cut to nearly 3 million Black people and cutting the Black  poverty rate by 34.3 percent, which will help the 85 percent of Black  women who are either sole or co-breadwinners for their families.   The Build Back Better Act permanently extends the American Rescue  Plan's increase to the Earned-Income Tax Credit from $543 to $1,502,  which will benefit roughly 2.8 million Black low-wage workers,  including cashiers, cooks, delivery drivers, food preparation workers,  and child care providers.   The Build Back Better Act increases the maximum Pell Grant by $550  per year for students enrolled in public and private, non-profit  colleges and make an historic investment in Historically Black Colleges  and Universities (HBCUs), as well as Tribal Colleges and Universities  (TCUs), and minority-serving institutions (MSIs).   Through high-quality training programs, career and technical  education pathways, and Registered Apprenticeships, President Biden's  Build Back Better Act will invest in training programs that will  prepare millions of Black workers for high-quality jobs in growing  sectors.   The toll of gun violence overwhelmingly falls on Black Americans and  other people of color.   For example, Black men make up 6 percent of the population but  represent more than 50 percent of gun homicide victims.   That's why the Build Back Better Act provides $2.5 billion to support  evidence-based community violence intervention programs shown to reduce  violence.   These programs are effective because they leverage trusted messengers  who work directly with individuals most likely to commit gun violence,  intervene in conflicts, and connect people to social, health and  wellness, and employment services to reduce the likelihood of violence.   Madam Speaker, no one is better prepared or more experienced to lead  the American renaissance that will be produced by the investments made  by the Build Back Better Act than President Biden, the architect of the  American Rescue Plan and who as Vice President during the Obama  Administration oversaw the implementation of the Recovery Act, which  saved millions of jobs and rescued our economy from the Great Recession  the nation inherited from a previous Republican administration.   And let us not forget that President Obama also placed his confidence  in his vice president to oversee the rescue of the automotive industry,  which he did so well that the American car industry fully recovered its  status as the world leader.   Madam Speaker, let me briefly highlight some of the key investments  made by the transformative Build Back Better Act that benefit all  Americans.   The Build Back Better Act will provide two years of free pre-K and  two years of free community college to ensure every student has the  tools, resources, and opportunity to succeed in life.   It will also invest in our teachers and institutions that serve  minority students and provide funding to give school buildings long- overdue infrastructure updates.   People lead happier, healthier, and more productive lives when they  have had access to high-quality education and that is why the Build  Back Better Act makes necessary investments to increase quality  education by four years for all students at no cost to hard-working  families.   The Build Back Better Act expands access to affordable, high quality  education beyond high school, which is increasingly important for  economic growth and competitiveness in the 21st century.   Specifically, the Build Back Better Act will increase the maximum  Pell Grant by $550 for more the more than 5 million students enrolled  in public and private, non-profit colleges and expand access to  DREAMers.   It will also make historic investments in Historically Black Colleges  and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and  minority-serving institutions (MSIs) to build capacity, modernize  research infrastructure, and provide financial aid to low-income  students.   The Build Back Better Act will help more people access quality  training that leads to good, union, and middle-class jobs and will  enable community colleges to train hundreds of thousands of students,  create sector-based training opportunity with in-demand training for at  least hundreds of thousands of workers, and invest in proven approaches  like Registered Apprenticeships and programs to support underserved  communities.   The Build Back Better Act will increase the Labor Department's annual  spending on workforce development by 50 percent for each of the next 5  years.   The Build Back Better Act expands access to quality, affordable  health care by strengthening the Medicare, Medicaid, and Affordable  Care Act (ACA) Marketplace programs that millions of Americans already  rely on.   It includes a major new expansion of Medicare benefits, adding a  hearing benefit to the program for the very first time.   Only 30 percent of seniors over the age of 70 who could benefit from  hearing aids have ever used them.   The Build Back Better Act strengthens the Affordable Care Act and  reduces premiums for 9 million Americans who buy insurance through the  Affordable Care Act Marketplace by an average of $600 per person per  year.   Just for example, a family of four earning $80,000 per year would  save nearly $3,000  [[Page H6582]]  per year (or $246 per month) on health insurance premiums and experts  predict that more than 3 million people who would otherwise be  uninsured will gain health. insurance.   The Build Back Better Act closes the Medicaid coverage gap, leading 4  million uninsured people to gain coverage.   The Build Back Better Act will deliver health care coverage through  Affordable Care Act premium tax credits to up to 4 million uninsured  people in states that have locked them out of Medicaid.   A 40-year old in the coverage gap would have to pay $450 per month  for benchmark coverage--more than half of their income in many cases  but thanks to the Build Back Better Act individuals would pay $0  premiums, finally making health care affordable and accessible.   The Build Back Better Act strengthens the ACA by extending the  enhanced Marketplace subsidies that were included in the American  Rescue Plan.   It also provides an affordable coverage option for the more than two  million Americans living in states that have not expanded Medicaid  under the ACA and do not earn enough to qualify for Marketplace  subsidies.   When the Build Back Better Act is fully implemented, soon gone will  be the terrible old days when too many Americans are forced to choose  between medical care and putting food on the table or affording other  necessities.   Madam Speaker, approximately 3.9 million Black people were uninsured  in 2019 before President Biden took office and even with the Affordable  Care Act's premium subsidies, coverage under the ACA was too expensive  for many families, and over 570,000 Black people fell into the Medicaid  ``coverage gap'' and were locked out of coverage because their state  refused to expand Medicaid.   Madam Speaker, nearly 1 in 4 Americans struggle to afford  prescription drugs but Medicare is currently prohibited from  negotiating prescription drug prices to get the best deal for American  seniors.   That changes with the historic Build Back Better Act, which  authorizes Medicare negotiation of drug prices for high-cost  prescription drugs, including drugs seniors get at the pharmacy counter  (through Medicare Part D), and drugs that are administered in a  doctor's office (through Medicare Part B).   Under the Build Back Better Act, drugs become eligible for  negotiation once they have been on the market for a fixed number of  years (9 years for small molecule drugs and 12 years for biologics) and  Medicare will negotiate up to 10 drugs per year during 2023, increasing  to up to 20 drugs per year.   The Build Back Better Act imposes a tax penalty if drug companies  increase their prices faster than inflation, which should end the  shameful days where drug companies could raise their prices with  impunity.   Perhaps most important, the Build Back Better Act directly lower out- of-pocket costs for seniors by capping the amount seniors pay for their  drugs under Medicare Part D at $2,000, a substantial reduction from the  more than $6,000 that seniors pay today on average.   The Build Back Better Act will also lower insulin prices so that no  American with diabetes pays more than $35 per month for needed insulin.   Madam Speaker, the cost of preschool in the United States exceeds  $8,600 per year on average, and for as long as we can remember, child  care prices in the United States have risen faster than family incomes,  yet the United States still invests 28 times less than its competitors  on helping families afford high-quality care for toddlers.   The Build Back Better Act supports families in need of child care by  providing access to safe, reliable, and high-quality care delivered by  a well-trained child care workforce.   The Build Back Better Act will provide universal and free preschool  for all 3- and 4-year-olds.   This is the largest expansion of universal and free education since  states and communities across the country established public high  school 100 years ago.   This is important because our nation is strongest when everyone can  join the workforce and contribute to the economy.   That is why this investment is vital to so many millions of-- especially women--who are often forced to choose between working to  support their family or caring for their family.   The Build Back Better Act will ensure that the vast majority of  working American families of four earning less than $300,000 per year  will pay no more than 7 percent of their income on child care for  children under 6.   Under the Build Back Better Act, parents who are working, looking for  work, participating in an education or training program, and who are  making under 2.5 times their states median income will receive support  to cover the cost of quality care based on a sliding scale, capped at 7  percent of their income.   The Build Back Better Act will help states expand access to high  quality, affordable child care to about 20 million children per year-- covering 9 out of 10 families across the country with young children.   For two parents with one toddler earning $100,000 per year, the Build  Back Better Act will produce more than $5,000 in child care savings per  year.   In addition, the Build Back Better Act promotes nutrition security to  support children's health and help children reach their full potential  by investing in nutrition security year-round.   The legislation will expand free school meals to 8.7 million children  during the school year and provide a $65 per child per month benefit to  the families of 29 million children to purchase food during the summer.   The Build Back Better Act will deliver affordable, high-quality care  for older Americans and people with disabilities in their homes, while  supporting the workers who provide this care.   Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of older Americans and  Americans with disabilities on waiting lists for home care services or  struggling to afford the care they need, including more than 800,000  who are on state Medicaid waiting lists.   A family paying for home care costs out of pocket currently pays  around $5,800 per year for just four hours of home care per week.   The Build Back Better Act will permanently improve Medicaid coverage  for home care services for seniors and people with disabilities, making  the most transformative investment in access to home care in 40 years,  when these services were first authorized for Medicaid.   The Build Back Better Act will improve the quality of caregiving  jobs, which will, in turn, help to improve the quality of care provided  to beneficiaries.   In the area of housing, the Build Back Better Act makes investments  to ensure that Americans have access to safe and affordable housing by  providing resources to increase housing vouchers and funding for tribal  housing.   It also supports investments in programs that will help address our  nation's housing crisis by increasing the supply of affordable homes  for those in need and investing in historically underserved communities  and those that have been previously left behind.   Specifically, the Build Back Better Act makes the single largest and  most comprehensive investment in affordable housing in history and will  enable the construction, rehabilitation, and improvement of more than 1  million affordable homes, boosting housing supply and reducing price  pressures for renters and homeowners.   It will address the capital needs of the public housing stock in big  cities and rural communities all across America and ensure it is not  only safe and habitable but healthier and more energy efficient as  well.   It will make a historic investment in rental assistance, expanding  vouchers to hundreds of thousands of additional families.   And, perhaps even more importantly, the Build Back Better Act  includes one of the largest investments in down payment assistance in  history, enabling hundreds of thousands of first-generation home buyers  to purchase their first home and build wealth.   In short, Madam Speaker, this legislation will create more equitable  communities, through investing in community-led redevelopments projects  in historically under-resourced neighborhoods and removing lead paint  from hundreds of thousands of homes, as well as by incentivizing state  and local zoning reforms that enable more families to reside in higher  opportunity neighborhoods.   The Build Back Better Act will spur and empower comprehensive action  to build an equitable clean energy economy with historic investments to  transform and modernize the electricity sector, lower energy costs for  [[Page H6583]]  Americans, improve air quality and public health, create good-paying  jobs, and strengthen U.S. competitiveness--all while putting our  country on the pathway to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2035.   The Build Back Better Act extends and expands clean energy tax  credits and supports clean electricity performance payments so  utilities can accelerate progress toward a clean electric grid at no  added cost to consumers.   The Build Back Better Act invests in clean energy, efficiency,  electrification, and climate justice through grants, consumer rebates,  and federal procurement of clean power and sustainable materials, and  by incentivizing private sector development and investment.   Another exciting aspect of the Build Back Better Act, Madam Speaker,  is that it will drive economic opportunities, environmental  conservation, and climate resilience--especially in underserved and  disadvantaged communities--including through a new Civilian Climate  Corps.   Madam Speaker, the Build Back Better Act includes a $100 billion  investment to reform our broken immigration system--and does it  consistent with the Senate's reconciliation rules--as well as to reduce  backlogs, expand legal representation, and make the asylum system and  border processing more efficient and humane.   Madam Speaker, immigrants eligible for such protection are an  integral part of Texas's social fabric.   Texas is home to 386,300 immigrants who are eligible for protection,  112,000 of whom reside in Harris County.   These individuals live with 845,300 family members and among those  family members, 178,700 are U.S.-born citizen children.   These persons in Texas who are eligible for protection under the bill  arrived in the United States at the average age of 8 and on average  have lived in the United States since 1996.   They own 43,500 homes in Texas and pay $340,500,000 in annual  mortgage payments and contribute $2,234,800,000 in federal taxes and  $1,265,200,000 in state and local taxes each year.   Annually, these households generate $10,519,000,000 in spending power  in Texas and help power the national economy.   The expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) enacted in the American  Rescue Plan has already benefited nearly 66 million children, put money  in the pockets of millions of hard-working parents and guardians, and  is expected to help cut child poverty by more than half.   The Build Back Better Act not only extends this meaningful tax cut,  but it also extends the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and  the expanded Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which help families  make ends meet and put food on the table, reduce child poverty, and  lessen the burden on hard-working Americans so they can provide a  better future for America's children.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R.  5376, the transformative, life-changing Build Back Better Act.    Mr. Speaker, on H.R. 3730, the legislation to amend  title 38, United States Code, to establish in the Department of  Veterans Affairs an Advisory Committee on United States Outlying Areas  and Freely Associated States, and for other purposes, that was voted  on, I was unavoidably detained. If I had been present, I would have  voted ``aye'' on H.R. 3730.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, in this season of giving, as we sit  down to our Thanksgiving table, I hope the American people will know  that we have handed them a gift over corporate greed that is insistent  on raising the price of goods. We presented to them the Build Back  Better Act.   And for those naysayers who want to talk about inflation, Mark Zandi  said, ``The bills do not add to inflation pressures, as the policies  help to lift long-term economic growth via stronger productivity and  labor force growth,'' that is from one of the renowned economists in  this Nation.   Madam Speaker, what I am fighting for is to make sure that Perla  Rosalez in Texas has health insurance for the first time in decades. I  remember that I cried when we were not able to give all of these  uninsured persons insurance. We are giving them health insurance and we  also--as chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland  Security, and Investigations--are giving community violence dollars to  stop the violence.   Madam Speaker, this is a bill we should pass. Support the Build Back  Better bill for the American people.
