 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the National  Defense Authorization Act.   Just this week, I returned from a bipartisan congressional mission to  the Middle East that underscored the importance of investing in our  national security and, of course, in our men and women in uniform.   This year's bill is the most robust military authorization in the  history of our country and includes a much-needed pay raise for our  troops.   I was also proud to add support for the Rock Island Arsenal, which is  in my district and has supported our men and women in the military  going all the way back to the days of the Civil War.   My amendment would allow Army arsenals to approve leases for  underused space and would require the Army to study how they can better  market available space on military installations.   The House also approved my amendment to expand important leasing  protections for Gold Star spouses and injured servicemembers.   Finally, I amended this bill to recognize cadet nurses as honorary  veterans for their patriotic service in World War II.   That is why today I will proudly cast a ``yes'' vote for this  National Defense Authorization Act.                            ____________________
