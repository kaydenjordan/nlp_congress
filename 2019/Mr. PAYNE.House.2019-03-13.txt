 Madam Speaker, a year ago this week, our country lost one  of its greatest legislators, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter.   In her 33 years in Congress, Louise Slaughter never backed down from  a righteous fight. Here is just one example of Congresswoman  Slaughter's grit. When she arrived in Congress, every single clinical  trial at the National Institutes of Health was aimed at White men, so  Congresswoman Slaughter secured the first $500 million of Federal  funding for breast cancer research.   My father and I both had the privilege to serve alongside  Congresswoman Slaughter. We knew her as a fierce champion for women and  workers throughout the country. There was something disarming about her  Kentucky drawl that really made you feel at home. She was a thoughtful  leader who could cut bad ideas down with her wit and determination.   Every time I left her presence, I left with a smile. Congresswoman  Slaughter was truly one of the best human beings I ever met in my life.  Her lifetime of service to this Nation will be celebrated by the  American people for decades.                            ____________________
