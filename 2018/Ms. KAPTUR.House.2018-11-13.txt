 Mr. Speaker, I rise to encourage every citizen to sign up  for health insurance coverage during open enrollment, which ends on  December 15. You still have several weeks.   For details about available plans, please visit healthcare.gov or  call 1-800-318-2596.   Health insurance is a vital protection that ensures Americans won't  be forced to put off a checkup or worry about going broke if they or a  family member gets sick.   As many in Ohio know, the average cost for 3 days in the hospital is  $30,000. The majority of personal bankruptcies in our country result  from healthcare expenditures.   There are many affordable health plans on the exchange. In many  cases, financial help is even available. In fact, 8 in 10 people  qualify for financial help, with most getting a plan for $75 a month or  less.   Health insurance can provide you and your family with health security  and peace of mind, and health insurance pays medical costs when you or  a loved one really needs medical care.   The marketplace provides access to quality and affordable health  coverage. In order to get in touch with someone local to learn more, go  to localhelp.healthcare.gov, or call 1-800-318-2596. Find out how much  you can save while signing up for good health insurance. You have until  December 15.                            ____________________
