 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a trailblazing first  responder from Roselle, New Jersey. On December 19 of last year, Rayna  Latimer was sworn in as the first-ever woman firefighter in Roselle,  New Jersey's history.   She has been called a hero, not just because she is a firefighter,  but also because she is paving a path for young girls who might one day  become firefighters in their own communities.   Rayna has lived most of her life in Roselle, and she has spent the  past 5 years preparing to become a firefighter. That is because helping  people has always been her passion, Rayna had told a local newspaper a  while ago.   Before setting her sights on the fire department, Rayna was a  corrections officer. That gave her a greater appreciation for first  responders.   She didn't set out to become the first female firefighter in Roselle.  Rayna just wanted to align her passions and her strengths.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Rayna  Latimer for her service to Roselle, New Jersey, and for inspiring young  people throughout her community.                            ____________________
