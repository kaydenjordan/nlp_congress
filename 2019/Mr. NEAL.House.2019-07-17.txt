 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 748) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal  the excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 748         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Middle Class Health Benefits       Tax Repeal Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 748, the Middle Class  Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019.   After a decade of fiercely debating the merits of the Affordable Care  Act, I hope we have turned a corner today and can now focus on  strengthening the parts of the law that work in the manner we had  intended and changing the parts of the law, which is not unusual, that  we believe could be improved.   This legislation, tirelessly championed by Representative   Joe  Courtney of Connecticut, with 367 bipartisan cosponsors, addresses the  so-called ``Cadillac tax,'' a part of the law that had the unintended  consequences of reducing healthcare benefits that were provided to  certain American workers.   More than 181 million Americans currently depend upon employer- sponsored health insurance. That is the majority of the American  people, including retirees, low-and moderate-income families, public- sector employees, small business owners, and nonprofit workers.   While the name ``Cadillac tax'' implies this excise tax only applies  to luxury health coverage, the truth is it will eventually apply to  almost every American with employer-sponsored health insurance.   At a time when American families are already worried about the  healthcare costs that apply to them, the Cadillac tax has had the  effect of increasing deductibles and out-of-pocket costs as employers  make changes in their plans designed to avoid the tax.   We have also found that the Cadillac tax affects health plans that  have higher numbers of workers with chronic diseases or serious  illnesses, that cover more than a million women or families, or that  offer coverage to part-time workers because premiums for those plans  are often higher.   This was not the goal of this tax when it was originally included in  the ACA. I know because I helped to negotiate and to write the  Affordable Care Act.   Congress wanted to encourage employers and insurance companies to  find ways to offer better coverage at lower costs. And, while many  actions in the ACA did bend the cost curve, leading to better care and  slower cost growth, this excise tax, indeed, did not.   We want employers to cover their workers with robust, meaningful  benefits. A good American job with a strong health benefit is part of  security.   Employers want this for their employees, labor wants this for their  members, and American workers and their families want to know they can  get the care they need when they need it.   This legislation, as I noted earlier, has strong bipartisan support  with a diverse group of stakeholder organizations endorsing the  legislation, from labor to chamber of commerce to patient  organizations.   If we fail to repeal the Cadillac tax, we will leave working families  with less healthcare coverage, higher out-of-pocket healthcare costs,  and little to no resultant wage increases.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.
