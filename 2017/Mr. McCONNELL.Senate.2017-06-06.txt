 Mr. President, every week, it seems we hear more news  about the failures of ObamaCare. For instance, 2 weeks ago, we learned  that nearly 70,000 people in parts of Missouri and Kansas will lose  their last insurance provider on the ObamaCare exchanges in 2018. From  rural towns to Kansas City, these Americans are being left without  options. Last week, we learned that thousands of ObamaCare customers in  Nebraska will be left with only one provider on the exchanges and that  the remaining insurer hasn't even decided if it is going to stay  through 2018. This week, we learned that the number of health insurers  participating in ObamaCare exchanges had declined by nearly one-quarter  from 2016 to 2017.   It has become painfully clear that ObamaCare is failing to live up to  its promises and is collapsing right in front of our eyes. If this  failed ObamaCare status quo continues, more Americans are likely to  lose their insurance options, more Americans are likely to continue  seeing their premiums rise, and more Americans are likely to get caught  in the downward spiral of ObamaCare.   It is time for our friends on the other side of the aisle to get  serious about moving beyond the problems of this law. They spent years  defending the system, promising it will get better over time and  claiming others were exaggerating ObamaCare's flaws, but here is the  reality our Democratic colleagues seem to be missing: ObamaCare did not  get better. The problems are real and have continued to get worse.   Now Democrats are trying to blame the failures of ObamaCare on  anything but--anything but--the broken healthcare law itself. They can  try to shift the blame, but the American people are not going to fall  for it.   Many Kentuckians have called for us to move away from ObamaCare to  bring relief to families. An official report released last month showed  that since ObamaCare's full enactment in 2013, average premiums in  Kentucky have skyrocketed by 75 percent.   A woman from Lancaster, KY, wrote to my office recently to express  her frustration. With high premiums and a staggering deductible, she  asked:         Why is there a law forcing me to pay for something I can't       afford? Either I can eat and pay my mortgage, or pay for       insurance.    Far too many Americans face these painful choices every day because  of ObamaCare. As the system continues to collapse around us, this  Kentuckian and many more like her are left to deal with the  consequences.   The ObamaCare status quo is unsustainable and unacceptable. Our  country can do better, and our country really must do better. I hope  Senate Democrats will join us as we move beyond the system's failures.  They can either continue to defend this broken system with its higher  costs and diminishing choices, or they can work with us to move beyond  ObamaCare toward smarter healthcare solutions. What is clear is that we  have to act. Otherwise, more Americans will be stuck paying the price  of ObamaCare's continuing failures.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on another matter, like those who  have called for relief from ObamaCare, many Americans across the Nation  are counting on us to ensure better quality healthcare for our  veterans. This is a critical issue for each of us no matter what State  we come from, no matter what party we represent. Our veterans have  sacrificed too much. In return, they deserve our support. We must keep  the commitment we have to them when it comes to ensuring that the VA is  providing the quality healthcare they rely on.   Unfortunately, as we all know, many VA facilities across the Nation  have long failed to provide our Nation's heroes with the timely and  effective medical attention they need. Already, Congress has taken a  number of steps to improve these facilities for our veterans and to  keep the faith for those  [[Page S3254]]  who have willingly and courageously fought on our behalf.   Now we can build on those efforts by passing the Department of  Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. As  the name implies, this legislation will enhance accountability measures  at the VA and better enable the Department to remove--to remove-- employees who are failing to meet the standards expected of them.   This bill, in conjunction with the continued administration efforts  like those Secretary Shulkin announced yesterday, will further improve  medical services offered to our veterans at VA facilities all across  our country. It was unfortunate to see this legislation held up in a  previous Congress, but I am proud that the Republican Senate has made  its passage among our top priorities.   I once again recognize Veterans' Affairs Committee chairman Johnny  Isakson and Senator Rubio for the part they played in moving this very  important bill forward and remaining vigilant on behalf of America's  veterans. I know we are all eager to advance it today and send it on  down to the White House for the President's signature.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, one final matter, today we will  confirm Courtney Elwood, the nominee for general counsel at the Central  Intelligence Agency. As Chairman Burr pointed out at her hearing, Ms.  Elwood has an impressive legal background. She graduated from Yale Law  School before clerking under Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the  Supreme Court, and she served as a former advisor to both Vice  President Cheney and President Bush, as well as to the Attorney  General.   In her role at the CIA, Ms. Elwood will be providing sound legal  advice to Director Pompeo, ensuring accountability at the Agency as a  whole, and overseeing a number of priorities that are key to supporting  our Nation's intelligence community. Her nomination has already earned  bipartisan support. I am sure that once she is confirmed, she will  serve our country well in this new role.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that S. Res.  184 be star printed.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Wednesday, June 7; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to Calendar No. 110, S. 722.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:25 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, June 7, 2017, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
