 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Bass for yielding, and  I thank the Congressional Black Caucus for their extraordinary  leadership.   The death of George Floyd has shaken the conscience of our entire  country and people around the world, and it has laid bare the racial  disparities in policing that Black Americans face every day but for too  long have been ignored. That is why millions of Americans are  peacefully protesting across our country demanding justice.   The Justice in Policing Act is bold and it is historic. It takes,  head-on, chokeholds, no-knock arrests, racial profiling, and the  militarization of the police. It will bring accountability and  transparency to police departments across our country and raise the  standards of the profession and instill best practices to ensure that  all Americans feel safe when interacting with law enforcement.   This legislation is the face of justice. It will make America fairer;  it will make America stronger; and every Member of this body should  vote for it.
