 Madam Speaker, since 2002, January has  been recognized as National Mentoring Month. We should all recognize  the positive impact that mentoring has on young people.   From our servicemembers at Cherry Point to the volunteers of the  Winston-Salem United Way, the coaches of LifeConnections in Alexander  County to the Western Youth Network in Boone, North Carolinians remain  actively engaged in mentoring opportunities across my State.   According to Mentoring.org, at-risk youth who were paired with a  mentor are 55 percent more likely to enroll in college; 78 percent more  likely to volunteer regularly in their communities; and 130 percent  more likely to hold leadership positions in their careers.   Madam Speaker, the numbers speak for themselves. Mentoring is a  cornerstone of the growth and development of young people across our  country.                            ____________________
