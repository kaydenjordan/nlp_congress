 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of the  brave first responders of the Orland Fire Protection District. Chief  Michael Schofield's team represents the best of Illinois' Third  District that we can possibly ask for.   These brave men and women are recognized not just as some of the best  firefighters in Illinois but in the Nation. They exemplify what it  means to be a public servant, and that is why I am honored to recognize  them in the Congressional Record.   When I met with the members of the Orland Fire Protection District,  their dedication to serving their community shone through. They told me  how they adapted to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic by creating  a first-of-its-kind response model. Their resourcefulness and  innovation saved countless lives across the southwest suburbs.   I honor their leadership. I honor their dedication. And I honor their  bravery.   Madam Speaker, I thank the Orland Fire Protection District for all  they do, and I am proud every day to serve them as their  Congressperson.                            ____________________
