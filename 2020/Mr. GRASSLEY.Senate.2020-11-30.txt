 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, like many Iowans, for the first time in  my life, I wasn't able to share a meal with my family this  Thanksgiving. That doesn't keep me from being thankful for the  essential workers of our country who have also missed many Thanksgiving  meals. Still, these essential workers provide and continue to provide  for and keep our country safe.   An essential job that often gets overlooked is that of the 86,000  Iowa farm families who produce the food that we consume on Thanksgiving  and the 364 days out of the rest of the year. That is why I am proud to  see Ron and Susie Kardel from Walcott, IA, get well-deserved  recognition this past week. You see, Ron and Susie, along with their  two turkeys, Corn and Cob, participated in a time-honored White House  tradition. That tradition is the National Thanksgiving Turkey Pardoning  Ceremony at the White House. This ceremony helps connect the dots for  many Americans, showing them that the food they put on the Thanksgiving  table isn't grown in a grocery store.   So I want to thank Ron, Susie, and President Trump for highlighting  Iowa agriculture this Thanksgiving. In a year that has been so very  difficult for most Americans, it is nice to see traditions like this  carried on.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
