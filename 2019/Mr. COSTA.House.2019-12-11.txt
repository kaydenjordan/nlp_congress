 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Farm Workforce  Modernization Act.   Let me first thank Chairperson Zoe Lofgren and Ranking Member   Dan  Newhouse for their hard work in forming this bipartisan compromise.   Farmworkers are some of the hardest working individuals you will ever  meet. I know. As a farmer's son, I have done that work. It is hard, but  it is skilled work. It is simply wrong that they are subject to living  and working in the shadow of uncertainty and fear of deportation.   Just last month in the city of Madera in my district, I met with  members of the United Farm Workers organization to tell them of the  promise of this bill. I spoke with these hardworking men and women and  their young children who work to put food on America's dinner table  every night.   I could see the hope in their eyes, hope for a normal life free from  the dread of possible family separation and deportation that hangs over  them every day when they leave to go work and hope for a chance to  change their reality and reshape their story.   We owe it to these individuals who do so much for us. This  monumental, bipartisan compromise is a unique opportunity to provide us  with the first meaningful reform in the immigration system in over four  decades.   Many of us would like comprehensive immigration reform for our  Dreamers and to fix our broken immigration system. For now, that is not  possible, but this legislation that would provide legal status for  seasonal and year-round farmworkers is.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with me and support the  Farm Workforce Modernization Act that we will vote on later today.                             Lower Drug Costs Now     Mr. Speaker, I also rise to support the Elijah E. Cummings  Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   Americans want Congress to tackle issues that they care most about,  and spiraling drug costs is one of the most important issues.   Passing H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, will  help lower prescription drug prices and hold drug companies accountable  for unfair price hikes.   Prescription drugs in the United States we all know are four times  higher than what they charge for the same drugs in many other  countries. The soaring cost of insulin is one example of the way we see  gouging, quadrupling over the last decade.                                time  1100    Diabetes is an epidemic in our country, affecting over 30 million  people in the United States and costing Americans more than $100  billion a year to manage.   In Fresno County, one of the counties I represent in my district in  the San Joaquin Valley, it is estimated 68 percent of the adults  between the ages of 55 and 69 have diabetes.   These Americans need insulin to manage their condition, but these  high prices are causing them impossible choices. The question is: Do  they pay for medication or do they put food on their dinner table,  making sacrifices that are simply unacceptable?   Democrats are committed to putting the healthcare of American people  first and stopping this unfair practice. So far this year, we have sent  multiple bills to the Senate to reduce healthcare and prescription drug  costs. Silence. Silence is the only answer we get from the Senate.   Tomorrow, we will pass another bill, H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now  Act, and this aims to stop drug companies from gaming the system  unfairly and raising prices on American families. That is what we are  trying to do.   This bill also builds on the Affordable Healthcare Act by adding $10  billion a year for expanding community health centers, which have been  instrumental in my area and throughout the country in increasing  healthcare and access to healthcare in rural America.   In my district, 400,000 people would benefit if we passed H.R. 3 and  it is signed into law. My constituents who rely on prescription drugs  are depending on us to act to ensure that medications are affordable,  and I intend to do that by voting to support this legislation.   It will also save Americans over $500 billion over the next 10 years.   So now is the time to act, and it is the time for the Senate to do  their job.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today is a monumental and historical day.  This bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2019 will truly  help people throughout the country.   I want to thank Chairperson Zoe Lofgren and Dan Newhouse for their  hard work over the last 9 months in bringing all the parties to the  table.   Earlier this year, in September, Chairperson Lofgren, with  Congressmen Panetta, Cox, and myself, held a workshop where all the  organizations from farm country, as well as the UFW, and others,  presented what needed to be done. And, lo and behold, it has happened.   My colleagues ask, Why do we need to have the urgency of this bill?   Well, last month I visited with United Farmworkers in Madera,  California, and told them the promise of this legislation. I saw in  their eyes, and their children who were there, I saw hope; a hope to  become free of fear and the fear of deportation; hope for the American  Dream, and all that that entails, that all immigrants past and present  have shared, in this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill today. The Senate  must pass it, and the President should sign it into law. This is the  right thing to do.
