 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  Alzheimer's Awareness Month.   Sadly, Alzheimer's is one of the fastest growing, costliest, and  deadliest epidemics facing our Nation. I am all too familiar with the  pain and heartbreak surrounding this dreadful disease because my mother  passed away in 2011 due to complications from Alzheimer's.   It is important to note that my experience is not unique. Over 5.7  million Americans are living with this disease, including half a  million Floridians. That is why I am a staunch advocate for Alzheimer's  research funding.   I am also proud to have recently cosponsored H.R. 4256, the BOLD  Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act. This bill  [[Page H5162]]  would create a modern public health infrastructure across our Nation  designed to increase early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's. It  would also focus on supporting the needs of caregivers who often bear  the lasting impact of this disease.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to stand with Alzheimer's  patients, with their families, and with their caregivers and support  this important bill.                            ____________________
