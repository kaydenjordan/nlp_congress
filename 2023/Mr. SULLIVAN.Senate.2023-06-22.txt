 Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to bring forward,  once again, my bill--the United States-Russian Federation Seafood  Reciprocity Act.   This is a really important bill for our fishermen throughout America.  This is a really important bill as it relates to sanctions against  Russia. It is a really important bill as it relates to not letting  Russia and China evade sanctions that the President of the United  States has put on them--the Russians, in particular.   It should be a bipartisan bill with regard to unanimous consent. I  tried to move it last year. It had an objection. We worked through the  objection and amended the bill to address the objection, in working  with the Biden administration, to try to fix this from an  administrative standpoint, but we were not getting anywhere.   Once I explain what is happening, I think every person watching-- every American watching--and every Alaskan, certainly, is going to go:  What the heck? Why on Earth are we not passing Senator Sullivan's bill?   What is the background?   Well, here it is.   You know, I often brag about the great State of Alaska as being the  superpower of seafood as over 60 percent of all of the seafood  harvested in America comes from Alaska's waters. We have the most  sustainable fisheries and the best managed fisheries literally in the  world. They feed Americans. They feed the whole world.   So this bill is about that, certainly. But it is about all fishermen,  including in Massachusetts. I guess my colleague from Massachusetts is  going to come and object, which is a real disappointment. But this bill  is also very much about geopolitics and going after the Russians, which  is all what we think, collectively, we should be doing after their  brutal invasion of Ukraine.   So what is the background?   Let me start with some explanation.   In 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula, the  United States imposed sanctions on Russia in a whole host of different  areas. The Russians retaliated with their own sanctions, and one of  those sanctions was that Russia banned the import of all American  seafood into Russia. It is a big market. It is certainly a big market  for my fishermen. But what was crazy about that is that the Russians  had banned the importation of America's seafood into Russia in 2014. So  what is that--8 years ago? 9 years ago? Yet we have kept our market  open to Russian seafood.   If you want to talk about an unlevel playing field, Russian seafood  pours into the United States pretty much duty free, and American  seafood--Alaskan seafood--going into Russia is banned. So that is just  wrong. That is just wrong. Russian seafood imports into the United  States have increased by close to 200 percent--200 percent.   Russian seafood companies are largely owned by Russian oligarchs, who  are supporting this war--Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine--and, of  course, they have been stealing market share from American fishermen,  undermining the markets for our U.S. fishermen that we have worked hard  on in our own country.   Does anyone in America think this makes sense? It doesn't. It  doesn't.   Much of this cash, the Russian imports--we are talking hundreds of  millions, up 200 percent--go back to the Russian oligarchs, the Russian  Government to help drive their war machine.   So since I came to the Senate 8 years ago, I have been trying with  every administration to stop this unlevel playing field. Again, Russia  imports hundreds of millions of dollars of seafood into our market  almost duty-free, going after American fishermen, and we can't export  one fish to Russia. Who thinks that is fair? So I tried with President  Obama--he wouldn't help; President Trump--he wouldn't help; and  President Biden. Well, it took a war--literally, it took a war--to get  some administration to try and fix this.   President Biden--to his credit and at my urging--when he issued his  Executive order targeting the Russians with sanctions, part of that  order included a prohibition of Russian seafood coming into America.  Great. That is what we needed. That is only fair. It goes after the  Russian war-machine oligarchs. That was welcome news, intended to  isolate the Russian economy. However--however--the Biden Executive  order--which, again, we appreciated very much. It is about time. It  took only 8 years for our own government to say: Wow. Look at this  unlevel playing field between Russia and America with regard to our  fishermen and our seafood. But the Biden Executive order has a  loophole. It has got a massive loophole that, of course, the Russians  are taking advantage of.   The vast majority of Russian seafood is harvested and frozen in  simple product forms and then--guess what--it is shipped to which  country? That other great dictatorship in the world--I am joking when I  say ``great''; it is a brutal dictatorship--China. So Russian fishermen  now send all their fish to China to get it reprocessed--laundered,  essentially. They fill it with phosphates. And guess where they ship it  to. The United States. Hundreds of millions of dollars of Russian  seafood now gets sent to China--another dictatorship--and they send it  back to the United States almost duty-free. That is a giant loophole.  It is happening every day. It is an outrage.   By the way, it is really bad seafood. It turns Americans off from  eating seafood. They fill it with phosphates, plump it up, nasty, and  they send it back to the United States.   So now Russia and China are colluding to avoid the Biden Executive  order. It is hurting American fishermen, once again, and it is  strengthening Russia: the oligarchs, the government, the Putin war  machine.   I have been working patiently--patiently--for a year with this  administration. The Deputy Secretary of the Treasury is supposed to  call me back today.   You better call me, Mr. Secretary.   The Secretary of Homeland Security, let's close this loophole. Let's  close this loophole. It is only benefiting Russia and China, for  goodness' sake, and it is hurting our fishermen. So I am not sure why  this isn't happening.   Again, I have been talking to the administration. The Secretary of  Homeland Security said: Senator, we will take care of this. You are  right. This is a loophole we can't abide by. CBP will enforce this. The  Deputy Secretary of the Treasury: Senator, we will work with OFAC to  close this loophole. That has been a year, and we are still waiting.  And the Russian war machine benefits from this. The Chinese, of course,  benefit from this. And American fishermen are getting screwed. Why  isn't our government helping?   Come on, Mr. Secretary. Come on, Mr. Deputy Secretary, call me today.  Let's fix this.   But we are not waiting. We are not waiting.  [[Page S2206]]    What I am trying to do now with my legislation is close the loophole.  It is going to broaden the application of the President's Executive  order to encompass seafood products harvested in Russian waters or by  Russian vessels. That is it. That is what my bill does. Who in America,  who in the Senate would be against that?   This will capture Russian-origin products, including those being  laundered in China. That is it. That is all I want to do.   With the U.S.-Russian Federation Seafood Reciprocity Act, every  Republican is cleared on it. Pretty much every Democrat has cleared on  it. And who wouldn't want to? Because if you are against this bill, you  are for Russian oligarchs who are still avoiding sanctions on seafood.  You are against the American fishermen, whether in Alaska or  Massachusetts, because they are getting screwed by this uneven trade  relationship, and you are helping the Chinese. I can't imagine anyone  being against this.   I am frustrated, as you can tell. My fishermen have been hurt by  this. The Russian war machine keeps giving revenues. The Russian  oligarchs who control these companies are getting richer. The Chinese  are getting richer, and the American fishermen are getting poorer. By  the way, American consumers are getting a pretty gross product from  China, filled with Chinese additives and phosphates.   So I told the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury: Hey, I have had  enough. Come on, you guys have got to fix this. It is not hard. We do  Russian origins--we do origins of seafood. Buyers know where this is  coming from.   I see my good friend--and he is my good friend--Senator Markey is on  the floor and probably is going to object, which would be really  disappointing. But even that, a year ago, when Senator Markey objected  to this, I said: Well, let's work together, so we did. And one of the  things we put in my bill is in this bill now; it has got a 90-day  provision to enforce it. So if you are an American seafood company  still importing Russian seafood--and you know it, by the way, so shame  on you, shame on you--but you are like: Hey, boy, I know. I am kind of  addicted to this Russian seafood that goes through China. I am going to  need some time to get other seafood markets for my seafood processors  in Massachusetts or New Hampshire. This bill says: OK. We will give you  90 days.    By the way, I have talked to Alaska fishermen. They say like, hey,  you need fish? Get it from us. Get it from America. Get it from Alaska.  Why are you getting it from the Russians and the Chinese? For goodness'  sake. Who the hell is for that? Who can be for that?   Our importers know how to trace, so that is not a good excuse.   This isn't about lost jobs. Like I said, we can supply the seafood  from Americans--great Alaskan and Massachusetts fishermen.   I am down here frustrated. The Biden administration won't close a  loophole that they promised me they would. It is not that hard. Come  on, guys. Really? You are OK with a loophole and the President's own  sanctions that provide hundreds of millions of dollars to the Russian  Government and oligarchs because you are cheating and going through  China? You don't want to close that loophole? I doubt if someone told  President Biden about this; he would want to close that loophole.   I am here on the floor, and I am going to ask unanimous consent for  my U.S.-Russian Seafood Reciprocity Act. It is the right thing to do.  Everybody knows it. Everybody knows it.   I hope my colleague Senator Markey is down here on the floor to say:  I support this bill because it is the right thing to do for fishermen  in Alaska and Massachusetts, and it is certainly the right thing to do  to keep the screws tightened on the Russian war machine.   So, Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Finance Committee be discharged from further consideration of  S. 2011 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I  further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed,  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, I certainly will continue to work with  my friend from Massachusetts--and he is my friend, and I have a lot of  respect for him. He and I work together on a number of things, but with  all due respect, that was a bit of a rope-a-dope tapdance you just  witnessed here on the Senate floor because he pretty much made the same  arguments 16 months ago--16 months ago; the same arguments, right here,  the two of us. Let me address a couple of these.   The issue of this tough on CBP to do this, it is not that tough. I  have talked to the head of CBP. Heck, I have talked to the Secretary of  Homeland Security. They can do this. The U.S. market demands a high  level of scrutiny on seafood supply chains. We already have  certification systems in place that require the kind of information  needed to enforce my legislation. Any seafood supplier who is serious  about their job knows that they have this information.   By the way, most seafood suppliers are getting off Russian seafood  because they know what is happening. They don't want to support this  Russian war machine.   Unfortunately, we are seeing some certification efforts, such as the  Marine Stewardship Council--shame on them--allowing themselves to be  pulled into a profit-driven mindset that is focused on one thing: money  and benefiting Russia. What do I mean by that?   You can hardly believe it. When I heard the MSC--supposedly, an  organization with a good reputation--the Marine Stewardship Council has  recently  [[Page S2207]]  certified Russian fisheries as sustainable, this is a joke. It is  ridiculous. Shame on you, MSC, helping fund the Putin war machine.    Regardless, I am 100-percent certain that any companies in America  now laundering Russian product--and you know who you are--companies  which, unfortunately, I worry my colleague from Massachusetts is  defending--they absolutely have the ability to trace and certify  exactly where the products are coming from. That is a fact. So this  argument, which was made 16 months ago, still doesn't work.   On the job loss issue, we put into this bill a 90-day provision to  prevent the disruption. U.S. harvests of seafood are largely from U.S.  citizens, including thousands of independent owners and operators of  fishing vessels and small businesses in coastal communities in Alaska,  in Massachusetts, and all over this great country. And they are being  hurt by this.   There are Massachusetts fishermen right now who want my bill to be  passed--100 percent. We know that. Certainly, thousands of Alaskan  fishermen. But if you want to compare jobs, let's go. Commercial  fishing is the top employer in terms of jobs in my State, and it is a  big employer in Massachusetts.   So to my colleague from Massachusetts, what I offered last year I  still offer now. Let Alaskan fishermen send their fish to you guys. Or,  heck, Massachusetts fishermen, don't rely on Russian fishermen  laundered through the communist Chinese economy to go to a few  processors in Massachusetts. That is why you are blocking this. No  offense, but that is why you are blocking this.   So, look, I know you are vigorously supporting Ukraine and so am I,  but this is a chink in the armor here. On this issue, you are not. And  we can solve this right now if you change your vote, my colleague, and  say: You know what, I am not going to object. Senator Sullivan is  right. My fishermen need this. Alaskan fishermen need this. Let's clamp  down on the Russian war machine.   Sixteen months ago my colleague from Massachusetts made these same  arguments--16 months ago. It is outrageous. I will continue to work  with him, but the rope-a-dope tap dance isn't convincing. We need to  move on this, Mr. President. How you could be down on the floor of the  U.S. Senate defending this laundering and undermining of President  Biden's Russian sanctions is beyond me. I will keep working it.   Maybe the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Deputy Secretary of the  Treasury, or maybe the White House--Jake Sullivan, you should care  about this. But for goodness' sake, let's not come on the Senate floor  and make the same arguments that were made 16 months ago that we  addressed in the bill that I just brought to the floor.   The only benefit, right now, of this objection--the only benefit--is  the Putin--the Russian war machine, the oligarchs who own the Russian  fishing industry, and the Chinese Communist Party leaders who are part  of the laundering process in China.   Every American fisherman loses right now. So I am going to keep  working this. And I am disappointed in my colleague, who made these  same arguments 16 months ago and is still not convinced.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I will take my colleague and friend from  Massachusetts up on his offer. Round 1; 16 months later, round 2. That  is a lot of people hurting, including Massachusetts fishermen, by this  unfair trading that we have with Russia--completely unfair. Again, they  can import all they want into the United States now through China. We  can't import at all there.   So I will work with him. The new provisions, by the way, are meant to  enhance the ability to trace the Russian seafood being laundered. So  that helps. It still has the 90 days to help Gorton's of Gloucester and  others to address this.   But at least my colleague is being honest, right? This is about  Gorton's of Gloucester. That is kind of what we knew. By the way, to  Gorton's of Gloucester, here is my message to you: Continuing to import  Russian seafood is a bad business idea. It is a bad business idea.  Funding the Putin war machine is a bad business idea. Most American  business companies have realized that.   So, Gorton's of Gloucester, here is my idea for you: Buy more Alaskan  seafood. Buy more Massachusetts seafood. Get off your addiction to  Russian war-machine seafood that is laundered through China. It is an  unsustainable business model, and at some point, even your U.S. Senator  is not going to be able to defend you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to join the other Members  of Alaska's Federal delegation--Senator Lisa Murkowski and  Representative Mary Peltola--in honoring our dear friend Dr. Reverend  Anna Frank. For decades, Reverend Frank has been a force for good in  Interior Alaska and across our State. As the first female Alaska Native  Episcopalian priest, she has given thousands of sermons and has  officiated over countless weddings, funerals, and baptisms. She has  served as a counselor for those in need, has been at the bedside for  those souls passing on to heaven, and has provided much needed solace  to those here on earth.   Reverend Frank was born in 1939 in Old Minto, 1 of 14 children.  Growing up in a village of less than 200 people, all living a  subsistence lifestyle, everyone in the village had to play their part  to survive and thrive. Her mother taught her how to trap muskrats and  set fish traps. She also had many other women in her life--her aunties,  who mentored her, as she has since mentored hundreds of other young  women.   After moving to Fairbanks, she married Richard Frank, a World War II  veteran and respected Athabaskan leader who was also from Minto--and  with whom she enjoyed a 57-year-long marriage. Together, Anna and  Richard Frank raised four children. During this time, Reverend Frank  earned her high school diploma. Her ability to persevere through  adverse conditions instilled in her the idea that, ``You have to do  things for yourself: don't live off people.''   Reverend Frank became a health aide and midwife in Minto--her  grandmother and aunt were midwives who had passed their knowledge on to  her--and again, she demonstrated her strength, compassion, and skill.  She was hired by Tanana Chiefs Conference to create their first health  education department in 1975.   Reverend Frank's job was to travel to the villages in the Interior  and to talk to Alaska Natives about modern health and medicine. It was  in this environment where Reverend Frank's experiences--the lessons she  had learned from her elders and knowledge that she had gained from her  western education--all came together. She found a way to reach out and  get the help they needed, in a way that worked for them. Soon after,  she was recruited to be a counselor, a position at which she excelled.   In preparation for Easter one year, Reverend Frank decided that  instead of giving something up for Lent, she would volunteer at the  village church. After that, she became a deacon. Nearly 10 years later,  she was ordained as an Episcopalian priest, the first Alaska Native  woman to be ordained. She worked for the diocese for over 12 years and  traveled internationally on behalf of the church. For her work, Dr.  Reverend Anna Frank was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by the  University of Alaska-Fairbanks in 2019.   Reverend Franks spent the majority of her life doing what needed to  be done. The countless problems she encountered, she tackled head on.  Reverend Frank traveled around Alaska, to numerous Native villages, and  held church services for anybody of any faith, who wanted to be  ministered to.   ``I understood two roads: our Native ways and the other world,'' she  once said. She was, and still is, a bridge between the old and the new.  She has served on numerous boards, including the Denakkanaaga Elders  group, the Alaska Commission on Aging, as well as the Fairbanks Native  Association. She continues her journey in ensuring that Alaska Natives  are seen and heard. She prays with them and for them. Reverend Frank  has given her all to enrich and enliven the lives of those around her.   She spoke to a reporter a few years ago about her lifelong journey.  ``As long as you're breathing it's never too late,'' she said. ``So  that's what I did in my life, I changed me, and I grew, and I tried to  help others. From where I came from, I have moved mountains.''   We thank her for the mountains she has moved, her faith, her tireless  service to our State and to her community and for all the many  blessings she has bestowed on so many. ``Ana Baasee','' Reverend  Anna.                            ____________________
