 Madam Speaker, I look forward to welcoming Vice President  Mike Pence to Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, on Wednesday.   Agriculture and manufacturing are vital to Wisconsin and our Nation.  However, unfair trade practices are hindering our manufacturers'  ability to create jobs.   USMCA is an important and improved trade deal between Canada, Mexico,  and the United States. That is why passing USMCA is important.   USMCA helps small family farms. USMCA supports American workers.  USMCA is a win for Wisconsin.   Vice President Mike Pence and I will be in Pleasant Prairie to push  USMCA across the finish line. The Trump administration has done a great  job negotiating this trade deal. It is now up to Congress to pass  USMCA. Let's get this done.   Madam Speaker, bring USMCA to a vote. Wisconsin workers and farmers  are depending on it.                            ____________________
