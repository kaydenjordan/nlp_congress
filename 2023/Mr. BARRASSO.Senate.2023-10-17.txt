 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of Sheridan's Senior Center, the Hub on Smith in Sheridan,  WY. The Hub is a cornerstone for the community. It provides essential  care, meals, and support to residents of Sheridan County.   To commemorate this outstanding achievement, the Hub is hosting ``50  for 50''--50 small events and opportunities to highlight staff,  patrons, and programs.   In 1972, Sheridan County created the Senior Citizen's Coordinating  Council to address the need for senior citizen services. The council  discovered many seniors were living alone and struggling to meet basic  needs. Poverty and lack of services resulted in a push for a nursing  home.   In 1973, the Senior Citizen's Coordinating Council was incorporated  into a private nonprofit organization, the Senior Citizens Council.  This began their longstanding commitment to the community. The Sheridan  Senior Center was established.   Numerous expansions of land, acquisitions, and services occurred over  the years. Longstanding relationships with volunteers, foundations,  individual donors, local businesses, local government, and elected  leaders are greatly responsible for the success and sustainability of  the Hub.   The Sheridan Senior Center rebranded in 2017 to the Hub on Smith, a  Center for All Generations. This was done to modernize the way services  are delivered and marketed. Folks now refer to the center as ``the  Hub.''   The Hub on Smith exemplifies their vision statement of ``Sheridan is  a community that improves the quality of life for people of all ages by  strengthening and supporting its elders and where elders contribute to  the well-being and foresight of the community.'' This is evident  through the many services provided to residents in these Wyoming  communities: Sheridan, Ranchester, Dayton, Arvada, Clearmont, Big Horn,  and Story.   The number and quality of services increased over the years. The Hub  on Smith prepares 400-500 nutritious meals daily. These meals can be  enjoyed in the center or delivered to residents' homes. The Sheridan  minibus was the first service provided by the center. Through  fundraising and expansions, Goose Creek Transit is now a door-to-door  service for appointments, grocery runs, trips to the Hub, and out-of- town medical appointments. The support center is a team of dedicated  information specialists, intake workers, care coordinators, and case  managers. They work together to offer an all-encompassing resource hub,  often referred to as ``the hub of the Hub.''   The Hub recognizes the importance of supporting family members and  caregivers. Programs such as counseling, support meetings, respite,  education, and training creates a strong network of care for this  courageous group. The Hub offers care to seniors both at the center and  in their homes. Registered nurses, certified nursing assistants, and  access care coordinators make up the Help at Home service. This is a  licensed home health agency that supports seniors while maintaining  their dignity and independence. The Hub's numerous services and  programs include Day Break, an adult daycare, Dementia Friendly  Wyoming, which furnishes education and training, and a Loan Closet,  lending durable medical equipment to patrons. Fun & Wellness provides  social engagement through educational sessions, dance, exercise,  outdoor adventures, arts, music, crafts, games, and more. The  Trailblazer Project trains volunteers to give one-on-one support to the  older adults who need it. The Grab `N Go Cafe is an alternative option  to congregate meals by offering unique foods and drinks. Sales from  Urban Thrift, a secondhand store on Main Street, directly benefit the  Hub.   There are over 350 individual volunteers who help the community in a  variety of roles. These include home-delivered meal drivers, teachers,  meal servers, registrars, musical performers, advisers, and board  members. Their commitment and willingness to give back reflects their  strong community spirit.   The Hub on Smith's mission is ``to celebrate, embrace, and serve  older adults for the betterment of our community.'' With 29 percent of  Sheridan's population 60 years and older, the Hub on Smith is a vital  resource for the city.   The dedicated staff and board members who keep the Hub on Smith  running are:         Board of Directors        Melissa Butcher, President        Lori McMullen, Vice President        Robert E.
