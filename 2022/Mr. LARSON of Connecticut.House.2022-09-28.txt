 Madam Speaker, I rise to compliment  Speaker pro tempore Bourdeaux on her service to this great Nation of  ours. I have very much enjoyed the privilege and honor of serving with  the gentlewoman.   I also rise to thank and compliment the Clerk's Office for all the  work that they do; the long days and hours that they put in, extending  well into the evening. Yet, on both sides of the aisle, the staff work  so hard, but day in and day out, it is the Clerk's Office here that  carries out the work in governance of this great country of ours. I  thank them for their service. God bless them. God bless America.                         senate enrolled bill signed    The Speaker pro tempore, Mr. Raskin, on Tuesday, September 27, 2022,  announced his signature to an enrolled bill of the Senate of the  following title:         S. 2293.--An act to amend the Robert T.
