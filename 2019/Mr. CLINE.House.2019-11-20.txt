 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Roanoke  Superintendent of Schools, Rita Bishop.   Superintendent Bishop has served the students of Roanoke City for  more than 12 years and will retire at the school year's end. Her tenure  is marked with significant accomplishments, and I applaud the passion  she exudes for the students of her district.   During her time of service to the community, graduation rates  improved from 60 percent in 2007 to now over 90 percent. Further, under  her leadership, all schools have achieved full accreditation division  wide, a feat that had never before been accomplished.   Additionally, Ms. Bishop was essential in launching Roanoke's summer  enrichment program RCPS-Plus. This program seeks to address what is  known as the ``summer slide'' by ensuring knowledge is not lost between  school years. Last summer, a record 3,400 students enrolled in this  program.   I want to thank Ms. Bishop for her dedication to improving the city's  education system and wish her a happy, well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
