 Madam Speaker, William Cullen Bryant said:       So live, that when thy summons come to join      The innumerable caravan which moves      To that mysterious realm where each shall take      His Chamber in the silent halls of death,      Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,      Scourged to his dungeon, but sustained and soothed      By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,      Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch      About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.    Ladies and gentlemen of the House, it has become my solemn duty as  dean of the Georgia delegation of the United States House of  Representatives to announce and include in the records and proceedings  of this august body notice that since we last convened, and  specifically, on Friday, July 17, 2020, the Honorable John Robert  Lewis, Representative of the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia,  our hero, our colleague, our brother, our friend received and answered  his final summons from God almighty and at that moment transitioned  from labor to reward.   The world is a better place because John Lewis spent his life  pursuing freedom, justice, opportunity, love, and peace for all of  humanity. While he is an icon in the history of America for his courage  and his sacrifice in making ``good trouble,'' his enduring humility  reflected the true timbre of his character. He inspired us as the  conscience of the Congress, and we have all been truly blessed to know,  love, and share the life and legacy of this extraordinary human being.   I ask that you join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the Members  of the Georgia delegation, in extending our deepest condolences to  John's family; friends; staff, including his faithful and devoted chief  of staff, Michael Collins; and all those around the world who mourn his  loss.   John, rest in peace and lie down with pleasant dreams, knowing that  this current generation will continue the fight for the ultimate  realization of your beloved community.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Graves), my  distinguished colleague.    Madam Speaker, I ask that all Members rise for  a moment of silence in remembrance of the Honorable John Robert Lewis.    Madam Speaker, I offer a privileged resolution  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution as follows:                                H. Res. 1054         Resolved, That the House has heard with profound sorrow of       the death of the Honorable John Lewis, a Representative from       the State of Georgia.        Resolved, That a committee of such Members of the House as       the Speaker may designate, together with such Members of the       Senate as may be joined, be appointed to attend the funeral.        Resolved, That the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House be       authorized and directed to take such steps as may be       necessary for carrying out the provisions of these       resolutions and that the necessary expenses in connection       therewith be paid out of applicable accounts of the House.        Resolved, That the Clerk communicate these resolutions to       the Senate and transmit a copy thereof to the family of the       deceased.        Resolved, that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn as       a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased.   The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
