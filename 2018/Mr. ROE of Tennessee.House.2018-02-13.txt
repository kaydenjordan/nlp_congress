 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4533) to designate the health care system of the  Department of Veterans Affairs in Lexington, Kentucky, as the  ``Lexington VA Health Care System'' and to make certain other  designations, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4533         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1)(A) Private First Class Franklin Runyon Sousley was born       on September 19, 1925, in Hilltop, Kentucky. Sousley served       as a marine in the United States Marine Corps during the       period beginning on January 5, 1944, and ending March 21,       1945. Sousley graduated from Fleming County High School in       May 1943 and chose to enlist in the United States Marine       Corps. Upon completion of military basic training, he was       assigned to Company E, 2d Battalion, 28th Marines, of the 5th       Marines Division at Camp Pendleton, California, as an       automatic rifleman.        (B) Private Sousley was promoted to a private first class       on November 22, 1944. Pfc. Sousley landed on Iwo Jima on       Friday, February 19, 1945, and actively fought in the battle       for the islands. During the intense fighting, members of the       United States Armed Forces secured Mount Suribachi and       hoisted a United States flag on top of the summit on February       23, 1945. On February 23, 1945, Pfc. Sousley, alongside       Corporal Harlon Block, HM John Bradley, Pfc. Rene Gagnon,       Pfc. Ira Hayes, and Sergeant Michael Strank followed orders       to raise a larger United States flag so it could be seen over       the island. The iconic photograph taken of the 6 men, while       they raised the United States flag attached to a heavy       Japanese pipe has led to an immortalized symbol of American       bravery, perseverance, and sacrifice endured by members of       the United States Armed Forces during the intense battles of       World War II. Pfc. Sousley was killed in combat by a Japanese       sniper around Kitano Point on March 21, 1945.        (C) Originally buried in the 5th Marine Division Cemetery       at Iwo Jima in plot 9, row 8, grave 2189, on March 22, 1945,       his remains were returned to the United States on May 8,       1947, where he was finally laid to rest at Elizaville       Cemetery in Fleming County, Kentucky. Pfc. Sousley was       posthumously awarded the Purple Heart, the Combat Action       Ribbon, the Presidential Unit Citation with \5/16\" Silver       Star, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific       Campaign Medal with \3/16\" Bronze Star, and the World War II       Victory Medal.        (2)(A) Mr. Troy Bowling was born on July 2, 1926, in       Hamilton, Ohio and completed his life's service on June, 17,       2017, at the age of 90 years old. At age 17, Mr. Bowling       began his service as a United States Marine and was a proud       member of the Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th       Division. During the United States campaign to end the war       against Japan, Mr. Bowling's unit was among the first to       arrive on the beachheads of Iwo Jima.        (B) While attempting to secure Mt. Suribachi, his unit came       under intense and concentrated fire, completely overwhelming       his unit. Two projectiles struck Mr. Bowling in the chest and       leg, leaving him critically wounded on the battlefield. At       that moment, Mr. Bowling said he looked to the heavens and       committed to serving mankind for the rest of his life if he       survived.        (C) Miraculously, a combat photographer and medical team       then carried Mr. Bowling to the safety of a landing craft       where he witnessed the planting of the American flag atop Mt.       Suribachi--an iconic image that persists as one of the most       legendary and triumphant moments of the war. The United       States Marines eventually took control of the island;       however, this victory came at a heavy cost as more than 6,800       United States service members gave their lives during the       battle of Iwo Jima.        (D) In keeping faith with his commitment to God made during       that battle, Mr. Bowling devoted more than 78,000 hours of       volunteer service to others at the Lexington VA Medical       Center. For more than 66 years, Mr. Bowling has risen through       the ranks within the Disabled American Veterans (DAV)       organization, holding nearly every position possible,       including State Commander. Mr. Bowling received the George H.       Seal Award for outstanding volunteer, which he received at  [[Page H1082]]       the 2005 National DAV Convention in Las Vegas and the       Lifetime Service Achievement Award from the Department of       Veteran Affairs. Mr. Bowling was also nominated and selected       to be inducted in the Kentucky Veterans Hall of Fame for his       lifetime of service to veterans.       SEC. 2.

Sousley       Campus''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4533, as amended, a bill  to designate the collective healthcare facilities of the Department of  Veterans Affairs, VA, in Lexington, Kentucky, as the Lexington VA  Health Care System; to designate the Lexington VA Medical Center  Leestown Division as the Franklin R. Sousley Campus; and to designate  the Lexington VA Medical Center Cooper Division as the Troy Bowling  Campus.   The bill is sponsored by my good friend Congressman Andy Barr from  Kentucky, and I am grateful to him for introducing this legislation in  honor of two American heroes.   One healthcare facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs located  at 2250 Leestown Road in Lexington, Kentucky, would be named the  Franklin R. Sousley Campus in honor of Private First Class Franklin  Runyon Sousley.   Private First Class Sousley was born in Hilltop, Kentucky, and became  a marine in 1944. Following basic training, he was assigned to the  newly formed Fifth Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California, and  slated for the upcoming invasion of Iwo Jima.   A force of 70,000 marines, including Private First Class Sousley,  landed on February 19, 1945, on the south side of the island of Iwo  Jima. On the fourth day of the invasion, Private First Class Sousley  was one of the six men in the famous photograph of United States  Marines raising the flag on Mount Suribachi. Tragically, he was killed  in action by a Japanese sniper 27 days later.   Private First Class Sousley was posthumously awarded the Purple  Heart, the Combat Action Ribbon, the Presidential Unit Citation with a  Silver Star, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Campaign  Medal with a Bronze Star, and the World War II Victory Medal.   The other healthcare facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs,  located at 1101 Veterans Drive in Lexington, Kentucky, would be named  the Troy Bowling Campus in honor of Private Troy Bowling.   Private Troy Bowling was born in Hamilton, Ohio, and was another  proud marine who served during World War II. Private Bowling's unit was  among the first to land at the beaches of Iwo Jima. His unit came under  intense and concentrated fire, completely overwhelming his unit.   Two projectiles struck Mr. Bowling, leaving him critically wounded on  the battlefield. At that moment, Private Bowling said he looked to the  heavens and committed to serving mankind for the rest of his life if he  survived. Miraculously, a combat photographer and medical team then  carried Mr. Bowling to the safety of a landing craft, where he  witnessed the planting of the American flag atop Mount Suribachi.   Private Bowling followed through on his battlefield promise to God,  devoting over 78,000 hours of volunteer service at the Lexington VA  Medical Center and rising through the ranks of the Disabled American  Veterans, eventually holding nearly every position possible, including  state commander.   At the 2005 DAV National Convention, Private Bowling received the  George H. Seal Award for outstanding volunteer and the VA Lifetime  Service Achievement Award. Mr. Bowling was also nominated and selected  to be inducted into the Kentucky Veterans Hall of Fame for his lifetime  of service to veterans.   After a life of service to our Nation and his brothers and sisters in  arms, he passed away on June 17, 2017.   Mr. Speaker, it is only fitting and appropriate that, a week before  the 73rd anniversary of the invasion of Iwo Jima, we honor both these  heroes by naming the two VA medical center campuses in Lexington,  Kentucky, after them. This legislation satisfies all the committee's  naming criteria and is cosponsored by the entire Kentucky congressional  delegation and supported by many Kentucky veteran service  organizations. I am proud to support it, as well, and urge my  colleagues to join me.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who is my good friend and Mr. Bowling's  Congressman from Lexington.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support this  legislation. From this Army veteran, I wish Private Sousley and Private  Bowling to rest in peace. Semper fi.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
