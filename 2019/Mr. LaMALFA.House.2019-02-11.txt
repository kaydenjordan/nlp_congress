 Mr. Speaker, instead of working in good faith to secure  our borders and reach a compromise to  [[Page H1509]]  avoid another shutdown, House Democrats have other ideas.   They argue that allowing ICE to increase adult detention beds from  40,000 to 52,000 is actually a bad idea--unbelievable.   Is there any solution the Democrats pose for securing our borders and  our sovereign Nation?   They don't want the agency to have the capacity to detain more  illegal immigrants who cross into the United States. Instead, just flow  right in, increasing the risk to our citizens, as we see time and time  again, especially in my home State of California.   Right now, there are 48,000 illegal immigrants detained thanks to the  increased enforcement of our sovereign border laws under this  administration.   Our county sheriffs are greatly concerned, however, that the new  numbers that the Democrats are posing for us will release up to 10,000  illegal immigrants--criminals, even--onto our streets, into our  country.   Instead of providing additional beds and allowing our Border Patrol  agents to do their jobs, they have actually proposed to knock that  number down to 35,000.   It appears my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would rather  release illegal immigrants into the community, many of them  traffickers, endangering our public.                            ____________________
