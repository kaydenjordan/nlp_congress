 Mr. Speaker, the clarity that I would like to offer  is that none of us should tolerate any shutdown of the government or  ever holding our Federal workers hostage to policy debates, and that is  for my colleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle and for  this administration.   But I think in all fairness, the clarity on the question of detention  beds is to make sure that the criminals are detained and to make sure  that women and children, like little 9-month-old Roger, have  alternative housing. That is the debate. But that debate can go on and  go on beyond holding the government hostage and our workers hostage.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to introduce the fact that I am  establishing the Congressional Children's Caucus, as we have done every  year since I have been here. Our focus is for better quality of life  for children, not only in this Nation but around the world. One of the  priorities will be hunger amongst children here in the United States  and around the world.   It is noteworthy that children do go to bed hungry here in the United  States, and it is important that we support the food nutrition programs  and the lunch, breakfast, and dinner programs in our public schools.   We must ensure that this Nation protects its children.                            ____________________
