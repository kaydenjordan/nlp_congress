 Mr. Chair, Texas is on the front lines of Biden's  unilateral assault on American energy, which has totally devastated our  economic recovery efforts and undermined our national security.   Rather than acknowledge the consequences of his disastrous energy  policies and change course, Biden has simply doubled down by dipping  into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is not meant for political  disasters but for national emergencies.   Since March of last year, the President sold more than 40 percent of  our strategic stockpile, bringing the SPR to the lowest levels in four  decades.   Even more irresponsibly, this administration has no plan for when and  how they will replenish our oil reserves, putting America in a  precarious position of weakness.   This legislation sends a strong message, Mr. Chair, to this  administration that they can no longer put their boot on the neck of  American energy production and then bail themselves out by raiding our  rainy-day fund, our rainy day reserves.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
