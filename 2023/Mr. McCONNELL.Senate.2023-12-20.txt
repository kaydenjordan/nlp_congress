 Mr. President, negotiations on border security  continue to make headway. I am grateful to Senator Lankford for his  uninterrupted focus on the task at hand, which is meaningful policy  changes.   Our colleagues at the negotiating table are under no illusions about  how difficult it is to fix our Nation's broken asylum and parole  system. They are working on what would be the first serious repair in  more than 30 years.   But there is no longer any disagreement that the situation at the  southern border is unsustainable and requires the Senate to act. This  is the core of America's national security. It will be an essential  part of supplemental legislation to address pressing security  challenges, and negotiations will continue in earnest until we get  there.   The Senate cannot afford to get this wrong. From South Texas to  Southeast Asia and from the Black Sea to the Red Sea, it is a  historically challenging and consequential time to protect America's  interests, our allies, and our own people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the world is witnessing the first land  war in Europe since 1945. Ukraine's citizen soldiers are in the  trenches right now, resisting Russian aggression with Western  assistance.   American leadership has strengthened the NATO alliance, prompted our  closest allies and trading partners to share more of the burden of  collective defense, and driven historic investments in the military  strength and industrial capacity we need here at home to compete with  our biggest adversaries. Finishing the job will require more of that  leadership.   Meanwhile, Israel is responding to the deadliest day for the Jewish  people since the Holocaust. Our ally needs the time, the space, and the  support required to eliminate the terrorist savages responsible for the  horrors of October 7, and the entire region needs American leadership  to restore deterrence against Iran and its terrorist proxies who attack  U.S. personnel with impunity.   From the other side of the world, our friends in the Indo-Pacific are  watching closely what goes on in Europe and the Middle East and  investing seriously in their own military strength because they know  that China is doing the same.   Our single greatest strategic adversary is growing increasingly  aggressive, increasingly advanced, and increasingly keen to seize an  edge over a global superpower that has failed to act like one.   So the stakes are high this holiday season for our allies and  partners on the frontlines of authoritarian aggression. The challenges  are real for brave American servicemembers who are spending this time  of the year far from home and loved ones to keep us safe.   It is a dangerous world, one that doesn't reward weakness. America  needs to show that we haven't forgotten how to lead and that we are  committed to restoring the hard power that leadership requires.   So I am encouraged by our colleagues' commitment to keep working  toward an agreement on national security, beginning with security here  at home. The Senate will not let the challenges we face go unanswered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask consent that the Senate recess  until 1:45 p.m.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:52 p.m., recessed until  1:45 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Ms. CORTEZ MASTO).                            ____________________
