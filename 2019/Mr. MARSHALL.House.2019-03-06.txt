 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the many women who  have shaped our country's successes and are inspiring our future.   This month, we celebrate Women's History Month and recognize the  women who have fought for equality and positively impacted their  communities. The courage and resolve of our women must not go  unnoticed.   In Kansas, we are always quick to highlight the great Amelia Earhart,  our hometown aviation pioneer. But today, I want to highlight the  millions of women around the world who have made and continue to make  significant impacts on their families, communities, and workplaces  through meaningful, everyday contributions.   My own mother, Nancy, taught me many family values that continue to  [[Page H2374]]  give me strength and guide me throughout fatherhood and in my career as  an obstetrician.   She instilled in me the value of proper nutrition at an early age,  which I was able to go on and explain in very commonsense terms to all  my patients as an obstetrician. My mom emphasized the importance of  a healthy breakfast and sitting down each night as a family for dinner,  something my wife, Laina, and I prioritized as parents as well.    She taught me all these lessons while also working a full-time job as  an office manager. Her dedication to her family and career didn't  garner news headlines, but it made a significant impact and allowed me  to grow up understanding the outcomes of hard work.   My wife, Laina, went to school to be a nurse at Butler County  Community College and later worked in the neonatal intensive care unit,  caring for premature babies. She made a huge impact on all those  babies' lives, as well as their families and their development.   Now, as a mother of four and grandmother of two, I often tell people  my wife has the most important job in America: raising our children.   I know there are millions of mothers around the globe who have and  continue to provide the same energy, time, and dedication to their  children, families, and communities. Too often, we don't take the time  to share and celebrate these contributions, but we all know a woman who  has made a significant impact on our lives.   As we celebrate Women's History Month, I challenge you to thank those  women who have positively influenced your life, improved our  communities, and contributed to the success of this great Nation.                  Recognizing Leadership of Dr. Bobby Moser     Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize my friend and  fellow western Kansas physician, Dr. Bobby Moser, for his leadership  with the Kansas Heart and Stroke Collaborative, an initiative funded  through CMS' Health Care Innovation Awards.   The effort started in 2014 with the University of Kansas Health  System, Hays Medical Center, 10 critical-access hospitals, and the  First Care Clinic to provide an innovative care delivery and payment  model designed to improve heart health and stroke outcomes for rural  Kansans.   When they first received this 3-year Federal grant, they were nothing  shy of ambitious. In their proposal, they aimed to reduce healthcare  costs by nearly $14 million and reduce deaths from stroke and heart  attack by 20 percent. The collaborative wanted to accomplish this using  data in a meaningful way, enhancing bedside care, and building  sustainable models for access and treatment.   They have indeed shown signs of good work, and they are expanding  their efforts. This group has helped hospitals track and audit data to  find ways to improve patient performance.   Dr. Moser recently reported that the clinical network of hospitals  has improved medications and delivery time for getting clot-busting  drugs to patients that literally save lives and prevent lifelong  paralysis.   Since its inception, these physicians have grown to reach more  counties and are able to help more patients. Now called Care  Collaborative, they are exploring new payment systems for rural  hospitals and focusing on expanding into new medical treatments, like  palliative care.   With more than 50 critical-access hospitals in my district, the  resources developed through this collaborative have been lifesaving and  critical for our hospitals and, most importantly, rural patients.                            ____________________
