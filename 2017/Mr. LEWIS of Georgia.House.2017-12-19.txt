 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and  ranking member, Mr. Neal, for yielding me time.   I rise to oppose this conference report with every bone in my body.   This bill is a $2.3 trillion cowardly gift to Wall Street, the rich,  and the wealthy. This bill was conceived in the darkness of the night  and birthed with the help of their donors and funders.   This bill is not for the people; it is not of the people; and, Mr.  Speaker, it is not tax reform. They reward their donors so that our  children and grandchildren will suffer. This is not fair, it is not  just, and it is below the dignity and the worth of this body.   Mr. Speaker, I have said on many occasions that you cannot get blood  from a turnip; you cannot justify robbing poor Peter to pay billionaire  Paul.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, when the bill comes due, the  chickens will come home to roost.   I urge all of my colleagues to be on the right side of history and  vote against this act.   I thank my good friend, the ranking member, Mr. Neal, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this conference report with every bone  in my body.   This bill is a $2.3 trillion holiday gift for Wall Street, the rich,  and the wealthy.   This bill was conceived in the darkness and birthed with the help of  your donors and funders.   This bill is not for the people. It is not of the people, and, Mr.  Speaker, it is not tax reform.   Working and middle class families, the sick, the elderly, and  generations yet unborn will bear the burden of this reckless act.   To pay for this so-called tax cut, Republicans will destroy the hopes  of those, who dream of affordable, quality health care.   To pay for this tax cut, Social Security, Medicare, and CHIP will be  on the chopping block.   To pay for this tax cut, bipartisan repairs of transportation,  affordable housing, and student debt will be out of reach.  [[Page H10203]]    To pay for this tax cut, every single federal program that matters to  the American people will be dealt a crippling blow.   You reward your donors so that our children and grandchildren will  suffer.   This is not fair. It is not just, and it is below the dignity and the  worth of this body.   Mr. Speaker, I've said on many occasions that you cannot get blood  from a turnip, and you cannot justify robbing poor Peter to pay  billionaire Paul.   Mr. Speaker, when the bill comes due, the chickens will come home to  roost.   I urge all of my colleagues to be on the right side of history and to  vote against this bill.                                time  1230
