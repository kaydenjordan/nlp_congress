 Madam President, the Republican leader comes to the floor  regularly with heartfelt concerns about the burdens facing America's  families. I share those concerns. I think all Senators share those  concerns. Inflation is a tough thing to deal with in the family budget.  I go home to Illinois to see the price of gasoline at the gas stations.  I shop in my local stores and see what it costs for the basics. I  understand that, although it is an inconvenience for me, for many  people, it is a hardship. So for the Republican leader to come to the  floor and remind us of that problem which we are facing in our economy  is certainly understandable.   Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Consumer Price  Index for the month of June. It came in higher than anticipated. Prices  rose by 1.3 percent in June, and when compared to June 2021, prices are  up 9.1 percent--the fastest year over year increase since 1981. When  you dive into the data, you will see that prices jumped within  categories that affect almost every household: food, energy, rent, gas.  We know, for many American families, a break can't come soon enough.   So what are we going to do about it, give speeches? There are a lot  of opportunities for us to do that, for the Republican leader and the  Democratic leader--or are we going to do something?   The Democrats think it is time to do something, and we have picked  one category of cost that is particularly important to American  families. It is the category of cost that not only is a life-and-death  issue but that determines the cost of health insurance for families. We  know that because we are told by the largest health insurers in the  United States that the cost of prescription drugs is driving the cost  of premiums for health insurance, so Democrats have decided to tackle  this directly.   Credit should go to our Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, who is in  negotiation now on prescription drug pricing with Senator Manchin of  West Virginia. I have been skeptical of the outcome of that  negotiation, but I am beginning to be encouraged by what I  [[Page S3287]]  hear from Senator Schumer and from Senator Manchin; that, in fact, we  can give relief to American families on the life or death inflationary  cost of prescription drugs.    Wouldn't that be a breakthrough? Wouldn't it be something if this 50- 50 Senate could end up doing something on a bipartisan basis that  American families actually feel and for which seniors in our country  would be able to say, ``There is a limitation on how much I am going to  be asked to spend for prescription drugs, and beyond that, I won't have  to pay''? That is amazing--a breakthrough. Would it have made a  difference when it comes to the cost of living for families? Of course  it would.   So you would think that the Senator from Kentucky, who comes to the  floor every day to give a speech on inflation, would be the leading  cheerleader in our effort to contain the cost of prescription drugs.  Wouldn't you think so? No. No. He has announced that he would oppose  the increased effort to lower the cost of prescription drugs because it  might raise taxes on the wealthiest people in this country. Hard to  imagine, isn't it? His sympathy for millionaires and billionaires gets  in the way of his caring for working families.   I think he should set it aside and should ask his colleagues on the  Republican side of the aisle to join us in a bipartisan effort to  contain the cost of prescription drugs.   We recognize how these price increases are squeezing household  budgets across America, and we take it seriously. We have plans to  lower prescription drug prices, decrease the price of gas at the pump,  help families with the cost of childcare, and increase the supply of  housing, all of which will address inflation, but item No. 1, priority  No. 1, is prescription drugs.   The Senator from Kentucky has said he will oppose that. I hope he  changes his mind. I hope, as he tells the stories of working families  who tell him of the burdens they face with inflation, that he will also  ask them the questions: How about reduction? How about prescription  drugs? Are those expensive for you? Does it create a hardship? You know  they do.   It is time for us to do something, and we would certainly like to  have the Republican leader on our team to deal with one of the serious  problems of the cost of living in America today.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr.  Blumenthal), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from New  Mexico (Mr. Lujan), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the  Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from New York (Mr.  Schumer) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Virginia.  Every Member of the U.S. Senate should have heard his words and, if  not, read his words to understand the gravity of the decisions by the  Supreme Court and the threats that have been made by Justice Thomas to  venture into even more areas, depriving us of our basic constitutional  rights in the name of States' rights.   I want to thank the Senator from Virginia. He gave a big part of his  life to civil rights litigation. And if you are a lawyer and heard his  presentation today, you would not want to be on the other side of the  courtroom. He is convincing; he is well-prepared; and he explains with  clarity why this is a moment in history which we should not ignore.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 1035.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 988.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, July 14, be waived.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr.  Blumenthal), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from New  Mexico (Mr. Lujan), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), and  the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) are necessarily absent.
