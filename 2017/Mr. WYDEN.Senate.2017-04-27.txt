 Mr. President, apparently the Trump administration  couldn't let its first 100 days go by without going after America's  National Monuments. Anybody who cares about protecting some of the  greatest treasures in Oregon and across the country ought to be  worried.   The President is lining up an Executive order requiring a review of  the boundaries of all National Monuments designated since 1996. It  might sound bureaucratic, but it is more than that. The President's  Executive order is a short-sighted attempt to roll back protections for  some of America's most cherished landscapes.   The Executive order flies in the face of a century-old tradition that  has ensured generations of Americans can enjoy natural treasures like  the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument in my home State.   Colleagues, for over 100 years, Presidents from both parties have  used authority granted by the Antiquities Act to permanently protect  special Federal lands as National Monuments, to preserve natural,  cultural, and historic values for the benefit of everyone. Two of  Oregon's most cherished areas were established as National Monuments  through the Antiquities Act: Oregon Caves and Cascade-Siskiyou. Both of  these areas have a remarkable diverse range of biological, geological,  and historic objects.   I am proud to have worked with President Clinton to establish the  original boundaries of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument in 2000.  I am proud to have worked with Senator Merkley to expand the monument  earlier this year and to expand the boundary of the Oregon Caves  National Monument in 2014.   There are two important points to make about this debate.   First, it is important that the individuals who live near and  recreate on these lands have an opportunity to make their voices heard.  As public lands everywhere, they ultimately belong to all of the  people.   Some people, the President included, say these monuments are an  example of overreach and designated without the right process.   On this issue, the President is wrong. These monuments are not the  result of administrative overreach. The boundaries of these monuments  are based on years of collaboration between the administration, States,  and local stakeholders.   The second point to make is about rural economies. National  Monuments, National Parks, and public lands across the United States  are important economic generators for rural communities.   According to a report released just this week, public lands generate  billions of dollars in consumer spending and millions of jobs every  year. In Oregon, the outdoor recreation economy generated $12.8 billion  in consumer spending in 2012 and over 140,000 direct jobs. Nationally,  the numbers are even bigger; in 2012, the outdoor rec economy generated  $889 billion nationwide and over 7 and a half million jobs.   Colleagues, there is an agenda behind this Executive order, and it  puts some of our greatest outdoor treasures and a lot of jobs in  danger.   Some members of this administration--including the Secretary of the  Interior--have said the right things about public lands, and that was  reassuring to millions of people who care about recreation. I hope it  wasn't just talk, and I certainly hope the President's Executive order  is not the first step in dismantling America's National Monuments and  public lands.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today  to honor Alter Wiener, a selfless Oregonian who endured the horrors of  the Holocaust and has shared his powerful story with countless students  and adults. I would like to share his story with the Senate so that my  colleagues can hear how he survived the Nazi atrocities and came to  live in Hillsboro, OR, teaching young men and women in my home State  the dangers of intolerance and exclusion.   Alter Wiener's story begins more than 90 years ago in the Polish town  of Chrzanow, where he was born on October 8, 1926. Like many Jewish  children, he attended both public and religious school and was taught  the importance of family and faith. What was a happy childhood ended  abruptly when the Nazis invaded his hometown in September of 1939. Mr.  Wiener fled with his mother and siblings, but his father, forced to  stay behind, was ultimately murdered by the Germans.   Barred from practicing his faith or attending school, Mr. Wiener was  eventually ripped from his home in the middle of the night and deported  to Blechhammer, a forced labor camp. He saw and experienced  unimaginable horrors as he was moved from labor camp to labor camp,  spending 3 long years in five concentration camps. When the Russian  Army freed him in May 1945, he weighed only 80 pounds.   Mr. Wiener made his way to New York City, where he joined his  cousins, the only other members of a family that numbered 123 to  survive the Nazi atrocities. In New York, he worked tirelessly to  rebuild his life, earning his high school diploma at age 38 and then a  degree from Brooklyn College. He got married, started a family, and  worked as an accountant. Through it all, he rarely spoke of surviving  the Holocaust or the atrocities he had witnessed and endured. He says  now that he simply didn't feel others would understand.   In 2000, Mr. Wiener moved to Hillsboro, OR. The Oregon Holocaust  Resource Center asked him to share his story, and, though he hesitated  at first, he ultimately agreed to speak at Century High School. To his  surprise, Mr. Wiener received hundreds of letters from students  thanking him for changing their lives.   Mr. Wiener has since gone on to volunteer his time and energy to  Holocaust education, giving more than 850 presentations to a wide range  of audiences. In 2007, he published his autobiography ``64735: From a  Name to a Number,'' detailing his harrowing experiences under the Nazi  regime and his life thereafter.   Many of my colleagues have heard me talk about my own family's  experience: how my parents fled Nazi Germany, how not everybody made it  out, how we lost family in Kristallnacht and at Theresienstadt.  Tolerance and inclusiveness are issues the Wydens take very seriously.  That is why it is so special for me to be able to pay tribute to Alter  Wiener today and to honor his work.   There is a concept in Judaism called tikkun olam, which means to  repair the world. Truly, I can think of no bigger way to describe Alter  Wiener's work than repairing the world. Every time he shares his story,  more people understand the horrors of Nazi persecution and the  inhumanity of the Holocaust. People also understand the importance of  tolerance, pluralism, and inclusion, and they see the power of the  human spirit to endure.   Today I offer my deepest affection and a heartfelt thank you to Alter  Wiener for using your voice to teach generations to come to never, ever  forget.                            ____________________     Mr. President. Every day, Social Security provides vital  benefits to millions of Americans who worked and paid into the system.  To ensure workers would receive full access to these fundamental  lifeline benefits, for many years, the law protected these earned  benefits from attempts to recover debts. However, 20 years ago,  Congress suddenly reversed course, and made a change to the law that  allowed the government to cut Social Security and other hard-earned  benefit payments in order to collect student loan and other federal  debts, like home loans owed to the Veterans Administration, and food  stamp overpayments. Now, more and more seniors are finding themselves  subject to government garnishment of their already modest Social  Security benefits in order to recoup student loan debts. In fact, the  New York Times published an editorial recently titled, ``Haunted by  Student Debt Past Age 50'' that highlighted the worsening struggle that  seniors face with student debt.   Student loan debt is becoming an increasingly serious problem in  Oregon and across the Nation, with students and their families burdened  by crushing student loan debt. Even in the best circumstances, many  families will struggle to pay off crippling loans for years to come.  However, for people who rely on benefits like Social Security after  retirement, disability, or the death of a family member, making  payments on student loans or other Federal debts can become an  insurmountable hardship.   Because of the lifeline nature of these earned benefits, for more  than 40 years the law prevented all creditors from collecting hard- earned Social Security, railroad retirement, and black lung benefits to  recoup debts. The only exceptions included unpaid Federal taxes, child  support or alimony payments, and court-ordered victim restitution.  These protections helped ensure that our social safety net programs  were functioning as intended--something I think we can all agree is  essential to preserving Social Security and other earned benefits.   Astonishingly, when the law changed as part of a 1996 omnibus budget  bill, these changes were never fully debated in Congress. This means  Members of Congress never had the chance to really explore how this  policy would affect beneficiaries. The legislation ultimately included  some protections for the most vulnerable, but even those protections  have not been updated in 20 years.   We now realize what a profound effect the loss of these protections  has had on retirees and individuals with disabilities, who often live  on fixed incomes. More and more seniors and people with disabilities  are having their Social Security and other lifeline benefits taken away  to pay federal debts. For example, according to a GAO report, in 2004,  about 8,000 seniors were living in poverty after having their benefits  garnished to recover a student debt. In 2015, over 67,000 seniors were  subject to garnishment for a student debt and living in poverty.  Congress should restore sanity to the system, and reestablish the  protections that these beneficiaries deserve.   That is why I, along with Senators Brown, Merkley, Feinstein, Hirono,  Schatz, Leahy, Nelson, Whitehouse, Gillibrand, Sanders, and Warren are  reintroducing the Protection of Social Security Benefits Restoration  Act. The bill would restore the strong protections in the law that  prevented the government from taking away earned benefits to pay  federal debts, and guarantee beneficiaries will be able to maintain a  basic standard of living by receiving the benefits they have earned.  The bill is supported by Social Security Works, the Arc of the United  States, Latinos for a Secure Retirement, Puget Sound Advocates for  Retirement Action, PSARA, AFL-CIO, the Economic Opportunity Institute,  the National Organization for Women, Justice in Aging, Gray Panthers  NYC, Alliance for Retired Americans, the National Committee to Preserve  Social Security and Medicare, Global Policy Solutions, AARP, the  American Federation of Government Employees, and the International  Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of  America, UAW.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 959         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
