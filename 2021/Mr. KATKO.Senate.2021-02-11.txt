 The President's role in this insurrection is       undeniable. Both on social media ahead of January 6 and in       his speech that day, he deliberately promoted baseless       theories creating a combustible environment of misinformation       and division. To allow the President of the United States to       incite this attack without consequences is a direct threat to       the future of [this] democracy.    After this trial, I hope you will come together and cast your vote  and make absolutely clear how we, as a Congress and as a nation, feel  about what Donald Trump did by convicting him, and to prevent this from  being ``only the beginning,'' as President Trump said, and to deter  future Presidents who do not like the outcome of a national election  from believing they can follow in President Trump's footsteps.   It is what our Constitution requires. It is what our country  deserves.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Representative DeGette will now return to show  how extremists were emboldened by the insurrection and planned to  attack the inauguration.   Ms. Manager DeGETTE. My colleagues have showed you the overwhelming  evidence of how President Trump's conduct assembled, incited, and  inflamed the mob. We showed how and why this attack, this violence, was  not only foreseeable but preventable. We showed that President Trump  knew his conduct could and would result in violence, and that when the  attack occurred, he did not fulfill his duty as Commander in Chief and  defend us. Instead, he was delighted.   Donald Trump incited a violent insurrection and he failed to defend  our Nation, our Capitol, this Congress, and our law enforcement from  the attack he incited.   Now I want to turn to the impact, the long-term harm of this conduct.  My colleagues and I will walk through the breadth and gravity of this  harm.   I would like to start with the effect President Trump's conduct had  on our domestic security. We saw firsthand how Donald Trump's conduct  emboldened and escalated domestic violence extremists. These folks are  known in the law enforcement community as DVEs.   These threats were and are made worse by President Trump's refusal to  take accountability and his refusal to forcibly denounce what his own  FBI identified as some of the most dangerous elements of our country.  Even as the attack was underway, he tweeted words of support to his  violent supporters, and then, in the aftermath on January 7, President  Trump made it clear this was only the beginning.   (Text of video presentation of 1-7-2021.)         President TRUMP. And to all of my wonderful supporters, I       know you are disappointed, but I also want you to know that       our incredible journey is only just beginning.    And he was right. Unless we take action, the violence is only just  beginning. In the aftermath of the attack, we saw a huge rise in  threats from domestic violence extremists, including specific threats  to the inauguration in DC, and also to all 50 State capitols. Our  intelligence Agencies confirmed that, in addition to these specific  threats, President Trump's conduct emboldened the very same violent  groups who initiated the attack and sparked new violent coalitions.   These groups believe that they are following his orders. They believe  that their acts of insurrection and violence are patriotic.   Violence is never patriotic, and it is never American. It is not the  Democratic way, and it is not the Republican way.   After the attack, the Nation's top defense and law enforcement  Agencies reported an increase in credible threats to the inauguration  from Donald Trump's supporters.   On January 13, 2021, a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the  Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the National  Counterterrorism Center found:         Since the 6 January event, violent online rhetoric       regarding the 20 January Presidential Inauguration has       increased, with some calling for unspecified `justice' for       the 6 January fatal shooting by law enforcement of a       participant who had illegally entered the Capitol Building,       and another posting that `many' armed individuals would       return on 19 January.    The Agencies also made clear why these threats were escalating,  especially regarding the inauguration. The report explained that a  primary motivating factor was:         The shared false narrative of a ``stolen'' election and       opposition to the change in control of the executive and       legislative branches of the Federal Government may lead some       individuals to adopt the belief that there is no political       solution to address their grievances and that violent action       is necessary.    In other words, President Trump's spreading of inflammatory  disinformation about the election incited the insurrection on January 6  and may lead to further violence.   Online, just as they did prior to the January 6 attack, Trump  supporters  [[Page S653]]  took to the internet to organize and document their desire and plans  for future violence at President Biden's inauguration. And indeed, in  the days shortly after the attack, several posters on extremist social  media websites made further plans for violence.   They posted:         Many of us will return on January 19, 2021, carrying our       weapons, in support of our nation's resolve, to which [sic]       the world will never forget!!! We will come in numbers that       no standing army or police agency can match.        We took the building once [and] we can take it again.    Other users, eager to participate in additional attacks, confirmed  that they were waiting on President Trump's instructions about what to  do next.   Referring to a future planned attack, a user on the online platform  known as Gab posted:         I'd like to come do this, but want to know, does our       President want us there? Awaiting instructions.    In fact, in the days leading up to the inauguration, multiple  individuals--many, potentially, in an attempt to carry out the plots  that I just previewed--were arrested in Washington, DC, including on  serious weapons charges.   One of those men was Couy Griffin, the founder of Cowboys for Trump,  who took part in the Capitol attack and was also arrested on January  17.   Here is what he said about his plans for violence.   (Text of video presentation of 1-17-2021.)         Mr. Griffin. You know, you want to say that that was a mob?       You want to say that was violence? No, sir. No ma'am. No. We       could have a Second Amendment rally on those same steps that       we had that rally yesterday. You know, and if we do, then       it's going to be a sad day, because there is going to be       blood running out of that building. But at the end of the       day, you mark my word, we will plant our flag on the desk of       Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.    ``Blood running out of that building''--this building, the Capitol,  where all of us are right now.   Now, the name Couy Griffin may sound familiar because he previously  faced controversy for a May 2020 video, where he said:         Mr. Griffin. The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.    Hear it from him yourself.   (Text of video presentation of 5-27-2021.)         Mr. Griffin. What I've come to the conclusion is, the only       good Democrat is a dead Democrat.    Now, when he said this, President Trump actually retweeted Griffin  and thanked him for that sentiment.   When Donald Trump retweeted this, he was no stranger to Griffin. In  fact, in March 2019, over a year earlier, Griffin and Trump had spoken  on the phone for nearly 30 minutes.   President Trump's conduct, without a doubt, made it clear that he  supported Griffin. In fact, Griffin even said so himself.   As Griffin later said about President Trump retweeting his  inflammatory comment about the dead Democrats:         It really means a lot to me, because I know that the       president of the United States has my back.    Remember, this is a man who was here on January 6, who was arrested  after threatening to come back here to make blood come running out of  this building.   Threats like Griffin's have triggered a deployment of forces the  likes of which we have never seen. There were approximately 25,000  National Guard troops brought in from around the country to protect DC  leading up to and on Inauguration Day.   As you know, many of those troops are still here.   Take a look at that.   These were scenes that played out all over the country. Five days  following the siege on the Capitol, on January 11, 2021, the FBI  warned:         Armed protests are being planned at all 50 State capitols       from 16 January through at least 20 January, and at the U.S.       Capitol from 17 January through 20 January.    As a result, at least 21 States activated their National Guards in  preparation for potential attacks. President Trump's incitement has  reverberated around the country, prompting massive law enforcement  mobilization in several State capitols, including in Washington,  Illinois, Michigan, and Georgia.   Look at these photos. This is what Donald Trump has done to America.  This massive deployment of law enforcement has cost the taxpayers  dearly. The National Guard deployment to DC alone is expected to cost  at least $480 million. The bills are also racking up in the States.  North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Wisconsin have  each spent about half a million dollars to safeguard their capitols in  the run up to the inauguration. Ohio spent $1.2 million over this same  2-week period. And, remember, this is at a time when State budgets are  already suffering under the weight of the pandemic.   Our brave servicemembers showed up. Thanks to their dedication and  their vigilance, the inauguration and the days leading up to it  mercifully proceeded without incident. In fact, after news broke of law  enforcement's preparedness for further attacks, leaders of the Proud  Boys and the Three Percenters militia, the organizers of the Million  MAGA March, they all now told their followers to avoid protests at or  leading up to the inauguration for fear that law enforcement would  crush them and arrest rioters who showed up.   Thank God there wasn't an insurrection sequel here on January 20, but  look at the price we have paid--the price that we are still paying. It  is not just dollars and cents. This Capitol has become a fortress, as  State capitols have all across the country. Our constituents no longer  have access to their elected representatives. Every Democrat and  Republican, including people who came here on January 6 peacefully, is  paying the price. And it is not just a loss of access; it is a dimming  of their freedom. It is a dimming of all of our freedom.   We must uphold our oaths, as the tens of thousands of law enforcement  officers have done in the wake of January 6, because if we do not,  President Trump's mob stands ready for more attacks.   Now, this should be no surprise. Having a Commander in Chief who  incites violence has given life to the existing violent groups he spent  years cultivating and has inspired new coalitions among extremist  groups who actually view January as a success. According to the FBI,  President Trump's assemblage of his mob was particularly dangerous  because ``in-person engagement between DVEs of differing ideological  goals during the Capitol breach likely served to foster connections,  which may increase DVEs' willingness, capability, and motivation to  attack and undermine a government they view as illegitimate.''   In other words, they all got to talking to each other.   This bulletin by our own Intelligence Committee was also confirmed by  concrete evidence. Rioters celebrated their roles in the January 6  attack on social media. They boasted about their success in breaching  the Capitol and forcing Members of Congress and the Vice President to  evacuate. Take, for example, rightwing provocateur, Nick Fuentes. The  day before the Capitol insurrection, Fuentes said this on his internet  show:   (Text of video presentation of 1-5-2021.)         Mr. Fuentes. What can you and I do to a State legislator       besides kill them? Although we should not kill them--I am not       advising that. But, I mean, what else can you do, right?    Fuentes was at the Capitol on January 6 and praised the insurrection  on a live stream as ``glorious'' and ``awe inspiring.'' He later said:         We forced a joint session of Congress and the vice       president to evacuate because Trump supporters were banging       down and then successfully burst through the doors.    Fuentes was not the only provocateur to revel in the violence.  According to Mike Dunn, a member of the Boogaloo Bois--an anti- government movement whose adherents helped lead multiple groups in  storming the Capitol--the Boogaloo Bois will be ``working overtime'' to  capitalize on the January 6 riots and hope it will lead to more action.  They said:         Just know there is more to come.    Proud Boys members were bragging about the attack on the Capitol. One  post on the Proud Boys telegram channel said:         People saw what we can do, they know what's up, they want       in.    The leader of the Proud Boys himself sent the same message. Enrique  Tarrio said the Proud Boys would be active during Biden's Presidency.  Tarrio stated:   [[Page S654]]              You're definitely going to see more of us.    Extremist groups are also boasting that the attack on our Capitol is  a boon for their recruitment efforts. Three Percent Security Force  leader, Chris Hill, says he has been contacted by several people  interested in joining since the insurrection. As one expert who focuses  on domestic extremism, Jared Holt, explained:         By all measurable effects this was for far-right extremists       one of the most successful attacks that they've ever       launched. . . . They're talking about this as the first stab       in a greater revolution.    As indicated by Mr. Holt, their perceived success has given them  encouragement to continue and to escalate attacks. Intelligence  agencies have also noted that these extremist groups will unfortunately  be targeting vulnerabl minority communities in the U.S.    A January 27, 2021, DHS bulletin warned ``long-standing racial and  ethnic tension'' of the sort that led to a man killing 23 people at an  El Paso Walmart in 2019 would continue to grow and motivate further  attacks.   The January 13 Joint Intelligence Bulletin report stated that in  addition to the other types of violence listed, ``DVEs may be inspired  to carry out more violence, including violence against racial, ethnic,  and religious minorities and associated institutions, journalists,  members of the LGBTQ+ community, and other targets common among some  DVEs.''   These prejudiced elements could be seen, visibly, in the crowd that  attacked the Capitol.   Pictured here is Robert Packer. Robert Packer is an avowed White  supremacist and Holocaust denier who proudly wore that sweatshirt,  which states ``Camp Auschwitz.''   These prejudiced elements could also be heard from the crowds. As you  have heard, the insurrectionists that attacked the Capitol on January 6  hurled racial slurs, including at Black police officers.   One officer described the trauma he experienced when the rioters  seized the Capitol. He said:         I'm a Black officer. There was a lot of racism that day. I       was called racial slurs, and in the moment, I didn't process       this as traumatic. I was just trying to survive. I just       wanted to get home, to see my daughter again. I couldn't show       weakness. I finally reached a safe place, surrounded by       officers, I was able to cry. To let it out. To attempt to       process it.    These extremist groups were emboldened because President Trump told  them repeatedly that their insurrectionist activities were the pinnacle  of patriotism. Well, let today be the day that we reclaim the  definition of patriotism.   Impeachment is not to punish but to prevent. We are not here to  punish Donald Trump. We are here to prevent the seeds of hatred that he  planted from bearing any more fruit. As my colleagues showed, this is  not the first time that President Trump inspired violence, but it must  be the last time that he is given a platform to do so. This must be our  wake-up call. We must condemn it because the threat is not over.   President Trump refused to condemn this type of violence. Instead,  over and over again, he has encouraged it. Our response must be  different this time. We simply cannot sweep this under the rug. We must  take a united stand, all of us, that this is not American.   Think back to August 2017, when a young woman was murdered during a  White supremacist rally in Charlottesville, VA. Her name was Heather  Heyer. Her mother's name is Susan Bro. Ms. Bro has been a steadfast  advocate for her daughter's memory. In a 2018 interview, she expressed  concern that people had rushed too quickly to reconciliation without  accountability.   (Text of video presentation of 8-11-2018.)          The President's role in this insurrection is       undeniable, both on social media ahead of January 6 and in       his speech that day. He deliberately promoted baseless       theories, creating a combustible environment of       disinformation and division. To allow the President of the       United States to incite this attack without consequences is a       direct threat to the future of this democracy.    Did the President encourage violence? Yes, no doubt that he did.   Final question: Did the President act willfully in his actions that  encouraged violence? Well, let's look at the facts. He stood before an  armed, angry crowd known to be ready for violence at his provocation.  And what did he do? He provoked them. He aimed them here, told them to  ``fight like hell.'' And that is exactly what they did.   And his conduct throughout the rest of that terrible day really only  confirms that he acted willfully, that he incited the crowd and then  engaged in the dereliction of duty while he continued inflaming the  violence. And, again, we don't have to guess what he thought because he  told us.  [[Page S664]]    Remember the video he released at 4:17 p.m.? Lead Manager Raskin  showed that to you yesterday, the one where he said:         We had an election that was stolen from us.    Remember the tweet that he put out just a couple hours later, 6:01  p.m., on January 6? You have seen it many times. You could see it on  the slide:         These are the things that happen when a sacred landslide       election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped       away.    That is what he was focused on, spreading the big lie and praising  the mob that attacked us and our government.   You heard Manager Cicilline describe reports that the President was  delighted, enthusiastic, confused that others didn't share his  excitement as he watched the attack unfold on TV. He cared more about  pressing his efforts to overturn the election than he did about saving  lives, our lives.   Look at what President Trump did that day after the rally. It is  important. He did virtually nothing.   We have seen--Manager Castro mentioned this--that when President  Trump wants to stop something, he does so simply, easily, quickly. But  aside from four tweets and a short clip during the over 5-hour long  attack, he did nothing.   On January 6, he didn't condemn the attack, didn't condemn the  attackers, didn't say that he would send help to defend us or defend  law enforcement. He didn't react to the violence with shock or horror  or dismay, as we did. He didn't immediately rush to Twitter and demand  in the clearest possible terms that the mob disperse, that they stop  it, that they retreat. Instead, he issued messages in the afternoon  that sided with them, the insurrectionists who had left police officers  battered and bloodied.   He reacted exactly the way someone would react if they were delighted  and exactly unlike how a person would react if they were angry at how  their followers were acting.   Again, ask yourself how many lives would have been saved, how much  pain and trauma would have been avoided if he had reacted the way that  a President of the United States is supposed to act.   There are two parts of President Trump's failure here--his  dereliction of duty--that I just have to emphasize for a moment.   First is what he did to Vice President Mike Pence, the Vice President  of the United States of America. His own Vice President was in this  building with an armed mob shouting ``Hang him,'' the same armed mob  that set up gallows outside. You saw those pictures.   And what did President Trump do? He attacked him more. He singled him  out by name. It is honestly hard to fathom.   Second, our law enforcement--the brave officers who were sacrificing  their lives to defend us, who could not evacuate or seek cover because  they were protecting us. I am not going to go through again what my  fellow managers showed you yesterday, but let me just say this: Those  officers serve us faithfully and dutifully, and they follow their  oaths. They deserve a President who upholds his, who would not risk  their lives and safety to retain power, a President who would preserve,  protect, and defend them. But that is not what he did.   When they, the police, still barricaded and being attacked with  poles--he said in his video to the people attacking them:         We love you. You're very special.    What more could we possibly need to know about President Trump's  state of mind?   Senators, the evidence is clear. We showed you statements, videos,  affidavits that prove President Trump incited an insurrection--an  insurrection that h alone had the power to stop. And the fact that he  didn't stop it, the fact that he incited a lawless attack and abdicated  his duty to defend us from it, the fact that he actually further  inflamed the mob--further inflamed that mob attacking his Vice  President while assassins were pursuing him in this Capitol--more than  requires conviction and disqualification.    We humbly--humbly ask you to convict President Trump for the crime  for which he is overwhelmingly guilty because if you don't, if we  pretend this didn't happen or, worse, if we let it go unanswered, who  is to say it won't happen again?   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, Members of the Senate, first of  all, thank you for your close attention and seriousness of purpose that  you have demonstrated over the last few days. Thank you also for your  courtesy to the House managers as we have come over here, strangers in  a strange land, to make our case before this distinguished and august  body.   We are about to close. And I am proud that our managers have been so  disciplined and so focused. I think we are closing somewhere between 5  and 6 hours under the time that you have allotted to us, but we think  we have been able to tell you everything we need to say. We will,  obviously, have the opportunity to address your questions and then to  do a final closing when we get there.   I just wanted to leave you with a few thoughts. And, again, I am not  going to retraumatize you by going through the evidence once again. I  just wanted to leave you with a few thoughts to consider as you enter  upon this very high and difficult duty that you have to render  impartial justice in this case, as you have all sworn to do.   And I wanted to start simply by saying that, in the history of  humanity, democracy is an extremely rare and fragile and precarious and  transitory thing. Abraham Lincoln knew that when he spoke from the  battlefield and vowed that ``government of the people, by the people,  [and] for the people shall not perish from the earth.'' He was speaking  not long after the Republic was created, and he was trying to prove  that point, that we would not allow it to perish from the Earth.   For most of history, the norm has been dictators, autocrats, bullies,  despots, tirades, cowards who take over our government--for most of the  history of the world--and that is why America is such a miracle. We  were founded on the extraordinary principles of the inalienable rights  of the people and the consent of the governed and the fundamental  equality of all of us.   You know, when Lincoln said ``government of the people, by the  people, [and] for the people'' and he hearkened back to the Declaration  of Independence, when he said ``Four score and seven years ago,'' he  knew that that wasn't how we started. We started imperfectly. We  started as a slave republic. Lincoln knew that. But he was struggling  to make the country better.   And however flawed the Founders were as men in their times, they  inscribed in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution all  the beautiful principles that we needed to open America up to  successive waves of political struggle and constitutional change and  transformation in the country so we really would become something much  more like Lincoln's beautiful vision of ``government of the people, by  the people, [and] for the people''--the world's greatest, multiracial,  multireligious, multiethnic constitutional democracy, the envy of the  world, as Tom Paine said, an asylum for humanity where people would  come.   Think about the preamble, those first three words pregnant with such  meaning, ``We the People,'' and then all of the purposes of our  government put into that one action-packed sentence: ``We the People .  . . in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure  domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the  general Welfare, and [preserve] to ourselves and our Posterity'' the  blessings of liberty.   And then, right after that first sentence--the mission statement for  America, the Constitution--what happens? Article I. The Congress is  created: All legislative powers herein are reserved to the Congress of  the United States.   You see what just happened? The sovereign power of the people to  launch the country and create the Constitution flowed right into  Congress. And then you get in article I, section 8 comprehensive, vast  powers that all of you know so well--the power to regulate commerce  domestically and internationally, the power to declare war, the power  to raise budgets and taxes and to spend money, the power to govern the  seat of government, and on and on and on.  [[Page S665]]    And then, even in article 1, section 8, clause 18, all other powers  ``necessary and proper'' to the foregoing powers. That is all of us.   Then you get to article II, the President, four short paragraphs. And  the fourth paragraph is all about what? Impeachment--how you get rid of  a President who commits high crimes and misdemeanors.   What is the core job of the President? To take care that the laws are  faithfully executed.   And our Framers were so fearful of Presidents becoming tyrants and  wanting to become Kings and despots that they put the oath of office  right into the Constitution. They inscribed it into the Constitution:  to ``preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United  States.''   We have got the power to impeach the President. The President doesn't  have the power to impeach us. Think about that. The popular branch of  government has the power to impeach the President. The President does  not have the power to impeach us.   And, as I said before, all of us who aspire and attain a public  office are nothing but the servants of the people. And the way the  Framers would have it is the moment that we no longer acted as servants  of the people but as masters of the people, as violators of the  people's rights, that was the time to impeach, remove, convict,  disqualify, start all over again, because the interests of the people  are so much greater than the interests of one person--any one person,  even the greatest person in the country. The interests of the people  are what count.   Now, when we sit down and we close, our distinguished counterparts,  the defense counsel, who have waited very patiently--and thank you-- will stand up and seek to defend the President's conduct on the facts,  as I think they will.   It has already been decided by the Senate on Tuesday that the Senate  has constitutional jurisdiction over this impeachment case brought to  you by the United States House of Representatives. So we have put that  jurisdictional, constitutional issue to bed. It is over. It has already  been voted on.   This is a trial on the facts of what happened. And incitement, as we  said, is a fact-intensive investigation and judgment that each of you  will have to make.   We have made our very best effort to set forth every single relevant  fact that we know in the most objective and honest light. We trust and  we hope that the defense will understand the constitutional gravity and  solemnity of this trial by focusing like a laser beam on the facts and  not return to the constitutional argument that has already been decided  by the Senate.   Just as a defense lawyer who loses a motion to dismiss on a  constitutional basis in a criminal case must let that go and then focus  on the facts which are being presented by the prosecutors in detail,  they must let this constitutional jurisdictional argument go--not just  because it is frivolous and wrong, as nearly every expert scholar in  America opined, but because it is not relevant to the jury's  consideration of the facts of the case.   So our friends must work to answer all of the overwhelming, detailed,  specific, factual, and documentary evidence we have introduced of the  President's clear and overwhelming guilt in inciting violent  insurrection against the Union.   Donald Trump, last week, turned down our invitation to come testify  about his actions, and, therefore, we have not been able to ask him any  questions directly as of this point. Therefore, during the course of  their 16-hour-allotted presentation, we would pose these preliminary  questions to his lawyers, which I think are on everyone's minds right  now and which we would have asked Mr. Trump himself if he had chosen to  come and testify about his actions and inactions when we invited him  last week:   One, why did President Trump not tell his supporters to stop the  attack on the Capitol as soon as he learned of it?   Why did President Trump do nothing to stop the attack for at least 2  hours after the attack began?   As our constitutional Commander in Chief, why did he do nothing to  send help to our overwhelmed and besieged law enforcement officers for  at least 2 hours on January 6 after the attack began?   On January 6, why did President Trump not at any point that day  condemn the violent insurrection and the insurrectionists?   And I will add a legal question that I hope his distinguished counsel  will address: If a President did invite a violent insurrection against  our government, as, of course, we allege and think we have proven in  this case--but just in general, if a President incited a violent  insurrection against our government--would that be a high crime and  misdemeanor? Can we all agree, at least, on that?   Senators, I have talked a lot about common sense in this trial  because I think, I believe that is all you need to arrive at the right  answer here.   You know, when Tom Paine wrote ``Common Sense,'' the pamphlet that  launched the American Revolution, he said that common sense really  meant two different things:   One, common sense is the understanding that we all have without  advanced learning and education. Common sense is the sense accessible  to everybody. But common sense is also the sense that we all have in  common, as a community.   Senators, America, we need to exercise our common sense about what  happened. Let's not get caught up in a lot of outlandish lawyers'  theories here. Exercise your common sense about what just took place in  our country.   Tom Paine wasn't an American, as you know, but he came over to help  us in our great revolutionary struggle against the Kings and Queens and  the tyrants. And in 1776, in ``The Crisis,'' he wrote these beautiful  words. It was a very tough time for the country. People didn't know  which way things were going to go. Were we going to win, against all  hope, because for most of the rest of human history it had been the  Kings and the Queens and the tyrants and the nobles lording it over the  common people? Could political self-government work in America was the  question. And Paine wrote this pamphlet called ``The Crisis,'' and in  it he said these beautiful words. And, with your permission, I'm going  to update the language a little bit, pursuant to the suggestion of  Speaker Pelosi, so as not to offend modern sensibilities.
