 Madam Speaker, Vladimir Putin's horrific war against the  Ukrainian people has all of us talking about how to prevent him and  other oil-rich autocrats like him from being able to afford to commit  these heinous acts in the future. It has also, all of a sudden, made  everybody in this town an energy expert. I am here to set the record  straight about a few things.   One, Russia is a petrostate. Fossil fuels are funding Putin's war  crimes against the Ukrainian people. Fossil fuels are funding Putin's  assault on democracy. Fossil fuels are funding the demise of post-World  War II stability in Europe. Putin's power comes from fossil fuels and  our world's dependence on them.   Two, you cannot end an addiction by increasing the supply. No amount  of increased fossil fuel extraction in the United States, which, I  should note, would take years, can take away Russia's influence on the  global energy market. Since fossil fuels are a global commodity, as  long as we depend on them, Americans will continue to be subject to  wild price fluctuations based on the whims of petro-dictators.   Three, when the fossil fuel industry and the conservative politicians  they bankroll go on television claiming the solution to the pain you  are feeling at the pump today is to drill more in the U.S., they are  lying to you. They are lying in a cynical attempt to take advantage of  a tragic situation to line their own pocketbooks. You deserve the  truth.   The truth is that there is only one long-term solution to stop  funding oil-rich autocrats and insulate Americans from energy price  inflation: Double down on our transition to cleaner, cheaper,  domestically produced renewable energy and energy efficiency.   The horror that we are seeing in Ukraine makes it abundantly clear  that clean energy isn't just necessary to protect against climate  devastation. Preventing wars and protecting our national security  demands investments in clean energy. American energy independence  demands investments in clean energy. Lowering costs demands investments  in clean energy.   Every day we fail to reach an agreement on the baseline climate  investments that were passed in the House is a day that Americans pay  the price at the pumps and oil-rich autocrats profit.   That is why I have led nearly 90 of my House colleagues in calling on  President Biden to lead a climate restart to reconciliation  negotiations centering the cost-saving clean energy investments as the  path forward to deliver tangible results to the American people. This  is a code red moment, and it cannot wait any longer.                   Supporting Women Who Are Sexually Abused     Madam Speaker, sexual assault is common among female  students of all ages, races, and ethnicities. On college campuses, one  in five women in college experience a sexual assault. Studies show that  students are at the highest risk of sexual assault in the first few  months of their first and second semesters in college.   This is unacceptable. Every woman everywhere has the right to live  free from abuse. This is why it was so important to reauthorize the  Violence Against Women Act, and I am proud that we finally passed that  reauthorization into law in our omnibus package.   But we also have to ensure that women who are at risk have trained,  trusted professionals who they can reach out to when they are at risk.  That is why I was pleased to introduce, and see included in the final  package, my amendment to ensure that appropriate campus faculty, such  as academic advisers or professionals who deal with students on a daily  basis, are trained to recognize victims of sexual and domestic  violence. We have to ensure that our campuses are equipped with the  tools and knowledge to combat violence against women.   If you are sexually assaulted, your experience is valid. It is not  your fault, and you are not alone. Please know there is a community of  people ready and willing to believe you, trust you, and support you.       Trading in Individual Stocks by Congressional Staff and Members     Madam Speaker, there is an iron rule of investing: unless  you are Warren Buffet or have access to insider information, you won't  make money trying to outsmart the market. Invest in mutual funds and  index funds to build your wealth.   And yet, according to a recent New York Times article, Members of  Congress are not only buying and selling a lot of individual stocks,  but we consistently outperform the market.   I don't see Warren Buffet here nor do I see a lot of people with long  track records of successful stock picking before they came to Congress,  but I do see a lot of people with access to a lot of inside  information, who know when we are about to change our defense contracts  or invest in domestic semiconductor capacity, update our antitrust  laws, or buy vaccines, and have the ability to trade on that inside  information.    Our responsibilities as Members of Congress are a trust from the  voters. Ethics matters. That is why I don't personally own or trade  individual stocks, and I encourage every Member of Congress to stop  trading stocks immediately. Even the appearance of impropriety by one  Member cheapens us all.   That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the Ban Conflicted Trading Act,  which would bar Members of Congress and senior congressional staff from  buying or selling individual stocks and other investments and from  serving on any corporate boards while in office.   We owe it to the American people to pass that bill and sign it into  law.                            ____________________
