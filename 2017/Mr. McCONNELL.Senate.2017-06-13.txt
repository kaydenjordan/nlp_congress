 Mr. President, yesterday, the Republican Senate took  another step to advance key sanctions legislation to hold Iran  accountable. The Iranians are pursuing a regional strategy intent on  empowering Shia militias, Hezbollah, their Houthi proxies, and other  groups. After years of the Obama administration's willingness to ignore  Iran's malign activities and failure to address Iran's provocations, we  finally have an administration that shares our desire to take a  stronger approach to keep the American people safe.   This legislation will enhance our ability to hold Iran accountable,  which is of great importance given Iran's continued testing of  ballistic missiles, its harassment of U.S. vessels at sea, and its  support of terrorism across the region.   At a time when we face many challenges both at home and abroad, we  must do everything we can to enable our country to counter threats  where they exist and protect the American people. That is why we will  keep working to pass this Iran sanctions legislation and, with it,  additional sanctions on Russia.   I again want to commend Senator Corker and the ranking member on the  Foreign Relations Committee and Senator Crapo and the ranking member on  the Banking Committee, who worked to craft this bipartisan agreement.   This is a signal. Russia's attempt to influence our elections last  year was the result of 8 years of a failed foreign policy. The Obama  administration's efforts to draw down our conventional capabilities and  commitments made it clear to aggressive states such as China, Russia,  and Iran that America would watch passively as they increased their  respective spheres of influence. This bipartisan amendment should  represent the first step in crafting a policy response to cyber attacks  against our country.   Now, two things must follow from this small step. First, our  Department of Defense and intelligence community must develop a  warfighting doctrine and strategy that recognizes cyber attacks, active  measures, and support of proxies as asymmetric, unconventional attacks  on the United States. Our response needs to be tied to the escalatory  ladder and an overwhelming response. No nation-state should be able to  attack our sovereignty without suffering an unacceptable response.  Sanctions represent only one facet of our foreign policy tools.   Second, Senators coming together to impose additional sanctions  against Iran and Russia should work toward providing the Defense  Department with the force structure and combat readiness necessary to  restore deterrents against these aggressor states. Again, sanctions are  only one foreign policy tool.   We must also restore both our foreign presence and our full-spectrum  warfighting capability as well. Doing so will send a message to those  nations that wish us harm, and it will reassure our allies.                            ____________________     Last, Mr. President, as it concerns our allies, later  today the junior Senator from Kentucky will move to discharge a  resolution of disapproval against American arms sales to Saudi Arabia.  It is important to note that our Sunni Arab allies are engaged in two  important struggles. The first is against ISIL and the extremist  ideology it espouses and the attacks it pursues. The second is against  Iran's efforts to expand its sphere of influence and revolution across  the broader Middle East. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab  Emirates are fighting against the Iranian proxy Houthi forces. As we  know, some have raised the issue of the Saudi conduct of that war, but  blocking this arms sale will diminish Saudi capability to target with  precision.   The complete arms sales package to Saudi Arabia includes munitions,  professional military education, training, air and missile defense  systems, and air  [[Page S3414]]  force modernization. Part of the training provided to Saudi Arabia will  be on subjects such as avoiding civilian casualties.   More important, as the counter-ISIL coalition continues to make gains  in Mosul and Raqqa, Iranian-supported militias in Iraq are posturing to  create a land bridge through Iraq and into Syria. This land bridge  could ultimately extend to Lebanon and improve Iran's support for  Hezbollah. So now is not the time to undermine one of our critical  allies in the Arab world by disapproving part of an arms sales package  that will improve Saudi capabilities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on another matter, the House of  Representatives will vote later today on the Department of Veterans  Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, which  would give the Department of Veterans Affairs more of the tools it  needs to hold bad actors accountable. Last week, the Senate passed this  bipartisan legislation on a voice vote, and once the House weighs in,  the bill will go to the President's desk for his signature.   Throughout our country, VA facilities have been plagued by widespread  dysfunction. Our veterans deserve the timely and effective care they  were promised, and I am committed to continue working with colleagues  in Congress and in the administration to make sure they get it. This  sensible approach has been a top priority of this Congress, and I am  proud that we came together to continue addressing the problems in our  VA system.   Representing Kentucky veterans is one of the greatest privileges I  have had as a Senator. Through their selfless service, America's  veterans have earned our admiration and our gratitude. This legislation  is just one example of how Congress and the administration are working  to keep our commitments to our Nation's veterans.   I would like to thank Senator Rubio and Chairman Isakson for their  work on this measure on behalf of our Nation's veterans. I look forward  to the House voting later today to send this bill to the President.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on one final matter, after 8 years  of sluggish economic growth under the Obama administration, I was  pleased to see some positive numbers out of last month's jobs report.  Now, following so many years of failed leftwing policies that held  Americans back, a new administration and a pro-growth Congress have  been working together to move our economy and job creation in a  positive direction. We have already undertaken what has been described  as the most ambitious regulatory rollback since Reagan, and we are  working hard in a number of other areas as well.   In fact, this month the administration is redoubling those efforts on  the economy, kicking off with an emphasis on workforce development.  These initiatives are a top priority for many States like mine, who are  proud to have a Governor who has been a staunch advocate for expanding  apprenticeship programs and preparing a workforce that can fill current  employment gaps while also attracting new businesses and job  opportunities to our State.   I have also been proud to play a role in supporting these efforts,  and I have worked to secure Federal funds for workforce development  programs in Kentucky. Specifically, I have been proud to help secure  funding for training and employment services for laid-off coal miners  in an effort to help them find new job opportunities.   Efforts like these are critical in preparing American workers for  success in today's global economy, but we know there is more we can do  to help. One way the Republican Senate is working to do that is through  tax reform. It has been more than 30 years since we last passed  comprehensive tax reform legislation, and since then, the international  economy has only grown more competitive. That is why it is imperative  that we do what we can to modernize our tax structure, as we also  better prepare America's workforce for the many challenges and the  global competition that face us in today's economy.   Over the past three decades, our tax system has grown increasingly  convoluted and punitive, making it harder for individuals and  businesses to succeed. In fact, according to the National Taxpayer  Advocate's annual report to Congress, ``if tax compliance were an  industry, it would be one of the largest in the United States.'' It is  not hard to see why, considering that our Internal Revenue Code is made  up of about 4 million words, which, to give some context, is nearly  seven times longer than Leo Tolstoy's notoriously lengthy ``War and  Peace.''   It goes on to say that ``a simpler, more transparent tax code will  substantially reduce the estimated six billion hours and $195 billion  that taxpayers spend on income tax return preparation; reduce the  disparity in tax liabilities between sophisticated or well advised  taxpayers and other taxpayers; enable taxpayers to understand how their  tax liabilities are computed and prepare their own returns; improve  taxpayer morale and tax compliance . . . and enable the IRS to  administer the tax system more effectively and better meet taxpayer  needs.''   In short, as that report observed, when it comes to our Tax Code,  there is no doubt simpler is better.   So how do we get a simpler Tax Code? With tax reform. But that is  just one of the numerous benefits that would come from a revised tax  system.   For instance, instead of inadvertently incentivizing companies to go  overseas, as our current Tax Code does, a revised system would  encourage businesses to keep jobs right here in the United States.  Instead of restricting businesses' ability to expand, create jobs, and  increase wages, as our current Tax Code does, a revised system would  open up more opportunities for workers. Instead of deterring the type  of growth that boosts the economy and puts more people back to work, as  our current Tax Code does, a revised system would actually promote  American investment.   These are just the types of solutions middle-class families need  right now, and they are the types of policies that the Republican  Senate will continue to pursue as we work to reform our tax  system. Fortunately, we now have an administration that is actually  interested in making our Tax Code simpler for families and American  businesses alike, without demanding $1 trillion in tax hikes for more  government spending.    Respective committees in the House and Senate have been working for  some time to move our tax reform efforts forward, and the Speaker and I  recently had a productive meeting with the President about this very  issue. I appreciate the good work my colleagues are doing on this  matter, especially the Finance Committee chairman, Senator Hatch, who  has long been an advocate for simplifying our Tax Code. He has been  working closely with committee members and Chairman Brady to advance  the tax reform our economy simply demands.   This is not an easy process. There are difficult issues that must be  navigated, particularly with respect to business reform, but I am  confident we can arrive at solutions that will be good for American  workers and the businesses that employ them. We have made progress  already, and we will keep moving forward as Members offer their input  for consideration.   I hope our friends across the aisle will come together in support of  these bipartisan objectives as well, but either way, we have to keep  working on this issue because we know the benefits tax reform can have  for the American people who, after 8 long years of sluggish economic  growth under the Obama administration, deserve a lot more.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  McConnell second-degree amendment No. 233 be withdrawn; that the  pending cloture motion with respect to amendment No. 232 be withdrawn;  that the amendment be modified with the technical changes at the desk;  and that at 2 p.m., Wednesday, June 14, the Senate vote on adoption of  the McConnell for Crapo amendment No. 232, as modified, with no  intervening action or debate and no second-degree amendments in order  to amendment No. 232 prior to the vote; finally, that following leader  remarks on Wednesday, June 14, the time until 2 p.m. be equally divided  in the usual form.    Mr. President, I just want to say to my colleague, the  Democratic leader, that I think this is a good example of the Senate at  its best. We all know this has been a period of rather partisan  sparring back and forth on a variety of different things, but both  sides were able to put that aside and deal with two important issues in  a very significant way. I think it is good for the Senate and good for  the country, and I thank the Democratic leader for his comments.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume consideration of S. 722.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the committee substitute amendment.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the underlying bill, S. 722.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls with respect to the cloture motions be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 92, S. 831.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:45 a.m. on  Wednesday, June 14; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of S. 722 as under the  previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:18 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, June 14, 2017, at 10:45 a.m.
