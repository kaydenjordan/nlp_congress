 Mr. President, I want to call attention to recent events  in El Salvador which have caused international concern, including in  the U.S. Congress.   I was a Senator in the 1980s, when social injustices and  authoritarian regimes in El Salvador led to a brutal civil war that  lasted 12 years. I traveled there during that period when the United  States was supporting the Salvador Armed Forces, despite their history  of corruption and collusion with death squads that carried out  political assassinations with impunity.   Finally, in 1992, after tens of thousands of lives lost and  atrocities including the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero and  six Jesuit priests and their housekeeper and her daughter by the  Salvadoran Army, the two sides signed the Peace Accords that ended the  war. Those Accords failed to solve the country's historical problems,  and the leaders of the Arena and FMLN parties failed to put  implementation of the Accords above their own corrupt, political  ambitions, for which they ultimately lost the support of the Salvadoran  people. But the Accords did establish the foundation for democracy,  including a clear separation of powers with checks and balances as well  as a limited constitutional role for the armed forces and the newly  formed civilian police to avoid ever again being used for political  purposes or repression.   I mention this history and the price in human suffering that was paid  for the chance to build a peaceful, democratic society in El Salvador,  at a time when key elements of the Peace Accords are under assault from  within the government itself and President Nayib Bukele.   In February 2020, in a show of force designed to intimidate the  Salvadoran Congress, which at that time his party did not control,  President Bukele, accompanied by heavily armed soldiers, occupied the  legislative chamber to demand passage of a law to pay for new  equipment. Fifteen months later, after winning a supermajority in the  Congress, he turned his attention to the judicial branch.   Under the Peace Accords, the Office of the Attorney General, formerly  an appendage of the Executive that was used for repression and  persecution of political opponents, became an independent institution,  acting as a fourth branch of government and appointed by a majority of  Congress to a 3-year term. Since the Congress is also elected for 3- year terms, every Congress gets to appoint an Attorney General. The  President has no say in the matter.   The Attorney General can be removed by a majority of Congress for  just cause and in accordance with due process. Attorney General Raul  Melara's term was to end on January 6, 2022, just 7 months from now,  and the newly elected Congress could have selected someone to replace  him after  [[Page S2542]]  that date. However, on May 1, President Bukele's supermajority in  Congress summarily removed Mr. Melara without cause and appointed a  political loyalist as Melara's replacement, contrary to the  requirements of the Constitution and raising serious doubts about the  continued independence of the office.   It is notable that prior to his dismissal, the ousted Attorney  General, with U.S. support, was investigating a number of cases of  corruption against top government officials, including a multibillion- dollar money laundering case. Then last week, in what can only be  interpreted as a flagrant attempt to shield themselves from  accountability, the Congress passed a law to provide retroactive  immunity to all government officials implicated in corruption involving  spending linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also last week, the Assistant  Attorney General in charge of the anti-corruption unit suddenly  resigned, for reasons that have not been explained, and was also  replaced by a Bukele loyalist.   Those actions were just the beginning. El Salvador's Supreme Court  has 15 justices elected for 9-year terms and distributed among  different chambers. Every 3 years, Congress can appoint 5 justices from  a list of 30 candidates submitted by the National Council of the  Judiciary. The President has no say in the matter.   Justices can be assigned to and transferred from any chamber, except  justices in the Constitutional Chamber who are appointed by the  Congress strictly for that chamber and cannot be transferred. The chief  justice of the Supreme Court is also selected by Congress from among  the five members of the Constitutional Chamber.   The newly elected Congress would have elected five justices from  different chambers of the Supreme Court in June from the already  submitted list of candidates. However, on May 1, the Congress removed  all five justices from the Constitutional Chamber and their  substitutes, without cause or due process, arguing that their rulings  were biased and contrary to the government's policies. Out of those  justices only one would have completed his term in June. The other four  from the Constitutional Chamber were serving terms until 2029.  Apparently, the role of the judiciary as a separate branch of  government that serves as an independent check on Executive power in a  democracy is unacceptable to President Bukele and his congressional  allies.   The Congress appointed new justices but not from a list of candidates  submitted by the National Council of the Judiciary. So not only was the  sudden removal of justices unconstitutional; so was the appointment of  new justices.   The Constitutional Chamber had played an essential, historical role  as a check on the Executive's abuse of authority, which is plainly why  its justices were targeted for removal. The chamber often rebuked the  Executive for overreaching in its actions, including the Bukele-ordered  military occupation of the Congress in February 2020. Thus, by removing  the Attorney General and the Supreme Court justices, the Congress gave  President Bukele control of all branches of government, creating a  situation in which corruption can flourish with impunity.   I have recounted these events because they have created a crisis that  could have profound consequences for El Salvador, and for U.S.- Salvadoran relations. My concern is not only what it means for  democracy in that country but what it could also mean for its economy  and the livelihoods of its people. The stifling of democracy ultimately  deprives already desperate people--suffering from the COVID pandemic,  two hurricanes in 2020, and gang violence--of any hope their lives will  get better, and this desperation is a major driver of migration to the  U.S. border.   The United States has always been El Salvador's largest trading  partner and its largest donor. CAFTA--the Central America Free Trade  Agreement--established not only trade preferences but labor, health,  and environmental standards. The results have been significant.   Forty-five percent of El Salvador's exports go to the United States  under CAFTA, which amounts to $2.6 billion a year.   Thirty-five percent of its imports come from the United States,  totaling $3.5 billion a year.   There are nearly 3 million Salvadorans living in the United States,  of whom 200,000 have temporary protected status. Collectively, they  send $6 billion each year in remittances to their relatives in El  Salvador, which amounts to 25 percent of the country's GDP.   On top of that, the United States has provided El Salvador with more  than $700 million in aid through USAID, the Millennium Challenge  Corporation, and other agencies in the last 5 years alone. Much of the  progress made with those funds is now at risk of being washed away.   The largest exporters in El Salvador are U.S. corporations, which are  also the largest employers in El Salvador.   President Bukele knows that his dictatorial actions are a direct  challenge to the United States and to the Biden administration's  emphasis on democracy, human rights, and combating corruption in the  region. Faced with criticism from the White House and the U.S.  Congress, he may point to China as an alternative to the United States,  as if a knight in shining armor from Beijing can gallop in and solve El  Salvador's problems.   But the people of El Salvador have no connection with China, and they  are not about to cast aside their longstanding relationship with the  United States. Trade with China has always been one-way and  characterized by dumping practices that have destroyed local industries  in El Salvador. There are no major exports from El Salvador to China  except occasional shipments of coffee and sugar. Chinese infrastructure  projects do nothing to help unemployed Salvadorians, when China sends  the steel, concrete, and even the Chinese workers to build them.   The Salvadoran private sector knows that China isn't the answer. They  know the country cannot prosper without democratic institutions and the  rule of law.   El Salvador is a sovereign country, and President Bukele was  democratically elected. He makes his own decisions. But the choices he  and his allies in the Salvadoran Congress make, that are eviscerating  El Salvador's democratic civilian institutions and empowering the armed  forces, have consequences for U.S.-Salvadoran relations. They have  consequences for our aid programs and for our support for financing for  El Salvador from the IMF, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the  World Bank and for our trade relations, and for visas.   This isn't about national sovereignty and foreign interference, as  President Bukele has falsely suggested. His actions directly affect the  United States, U.S. companies, our commercial relations, and the  welfare of millions of Salvadorans in the United States, as well as the  Salvadoran population.   I join others here and in El Salvador in urging President Bukele and  the Salvadoran Congress to reconsider their unconstitutional actions  and to restore the separation of powers and the rule of law. Don't  destroy the Peace Accords' greatest achievement. End the attacks on the  rule of law, respect the tenure of other justices and the Human Rights  Procurator, and appoint justices to the Constitutional Chamber and an  Attorney General following the established procedures and ensuring that  they are people with the necessary professional qualifications,  integrity, and independence.                            ____________________
