 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise today  understanding that the greatness of America will not be measured by the  number of nuclear-powered submarines we have. Its greatness won't be  measured by our B-1 bombers or our number of soldiers in uniform. The  greatness of our Nation will be measured by how do you treat the  persons who fly the B-1 bombers; how do you treat the persons who will  take on the challenges of the world who become the front line of  democracy; how do you treat them when they return home? This is how the  greatness of America will be measured.   The greatness of America will be measured by what kind of housing do  we give them, do we help them to transition from military life to a job  in civilian life? The greatness of America will be measured by the kind  of insurance that they get so that they can have the best healthcare  the world can afford.   This bill, this legislation, among other things, expands healthcare  services for a larger group of veterans who were exposed to toxic  substances, Agent Orange, for example. Many men have died and suffered  and didn't get the healthcare that they earned because we allowed a  nebulous notion as to what Agent Orange was doing to them to persist.  There is a presumption now.   This bill increases the number of veterans without service-connected  disabilities who can receive healthcare. If I had my way, you would get  all of your healthcare whether service-connected or not. But I don't  have my way. But I am going to support this bill because I want my  record to show that when I had the chance to help the veterans, I did  what I could, and I voted ``yes.'' I didn't cop out. I stood tall with  them. I want my record to show that I came to this floor and encouraged  my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  [[Page H1196]]
