 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to rolling back workplace  safety protections for American workers. This use of the Congressional  Review Act would endanger employees and throw away four decades of  precedent for the sole purpose of protecting companies that repeatedly  violate safety standards.   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, commonly known as  OSHA, is among the best tools we have to ensure that companies adhere  to basic safety standards. Because the agency's budget is so small  compared to its critical task, OSHA relies on accurate data to focus on  the companies that pose the greatest danger to employees.   The previous administration sought to clarify and codify the  responsibility companies have to maintain an honest record of their  employees' injuries and illnesses. This resolution would undermine  OSHA's ability to target serial offenders by removing companies'  obligation to keep reliable data about safety issues in the workplace.  If passed into law, the resolution would essentially grant amnesty to  companies with years of workplace safety violations, while sending a  clear message to employers that the Federal Government is no longer  committed to worker safety.   Mr. Speaker, I have asked the question many times since the President  took office, and I will ask it again today: How does this give power  back to the people? How does undermining workplace safety regulations  support middle class Americans? How does protecting companies that  repeatedly violate safety standards improve the life of workers? The  answer is that it doesn't.   I call on my colleagues to stand with working Americans who deserve a  safe workplace and vote ``no'' on this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the UAW opposing  the repeal of this rule and also a letter from National Nurses United  in opposition to H.J. Res. 83.   [[Page H1427]]                                                               UAW,                                                  February 28, 2017.        Dear Representatives: On behalf of the more than one       million active and retired members of the International       Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural       Implement Workers of America, UAW, we strongly urge you to       oppose H.J. Res 83. This misguided resolution undermines       workplace health and safety standards in the most dangerous       industries. The proposed legislation will make it much harder       for the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to       ensure the safety and health of America's workers.        Since the early 1970s, OSHA has required employers to       maintain a safety record for five years and make reports to       the Department of Labor (DOL). These records are used by       workers and employers to identify hazards, fix them, and most       importantly, keep accidents from happening in the future. DOL       utilizes these records to publish statistics on workplace       injury and illness rates and OSHA relies on them to allocate       scarce resources.        OSHA issued the recordkeeping rule to clarify an employer's       responsibility to maintain a safe workplace. The rule does       not impose any new costs or obligations on employers and only       covers larger businesses with the most high risk occupations.        Accurate injury and illness records are critically       important for workers and their families. Having the       necessary tools to collect complete and accurate data on       work-related injuries and illnesses is a key component in       reducing, mitigating, and eliminating hazards and deaths in       the workplace.        Historically, OSHA has assessed and enforced injury       recordkeeping requirements under every administration. In       turn, workers in America have enjoyed a much safer work       environment. We must not take away or reduce OSHA's role in       improving health and safety conditions for workers and we       must ensure the accuracy of the reporting requirements.       Tremendous gains have been made in workplace hazard       reporting. We cannot go backwards.        The UAW members have a long and storied history of securing       workplace protections for all of America's workers. This bill       undermines those gains and more than 40 years of solid       science and practice.        We urge you to resoundingly reject H.J. Res 83 and vote No       when it comes to the floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Josh Nassar,      Legislative Director.                                   ____                                           National Nurses United,                                                  February 27, 2017.      Re Letter in Opposition to H.J. Res. 83, Congressional Review           Act Resolution to Block OSHA Injury and Illness           Recordkeeping Clarification Rule.       Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chair, Committee on Education and the Workforce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Robert Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: On behalf of       over 150,000 members across the country and as the largest       organization representing registered nurses in the United       States, National Nurses United (NNU) urges you to oppose H.J.       Res. 83, which would block the Occupational Safety and Health       Administration's (OSHA) final rule clarifying employers'       continuing obligations to record workplace injuries and       illnesses. By revoking OSHA's authority to enforce       recordkeeping requirements, this Congressional Review Act       (CRA) resolution denudes the agency of the tools necessary to       identify and target patterns of workplace hazards. These       recordkeeping requirements are fundamental to OSHA's ability       to protect workers from job-related health and safety       hazards. But H.J. Res. 83 would leave OSHA with no functional       mechanism to protect workers from longstanding workplace       hazards--health and safety dangers on the job would go       undisclosed and uncorrected. Congress must oppose this GRA       resolution lest it place the health and safety of workers in       serious jeopardy.        The published final rule, known as the ``Volks Rule,'' is a       common-sense measure meant to align OSHA regulations with its       40-year-long practice of enforcing employer injury and       illness recordkeeping requirements as continuing violations       under of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH       Act). Under the OSH Act, Congress authorized OSHA to       promulgate rules requiring employers to maintain accurate       records of workplace injuries and illnesses. Since 1972,       under multiple Republican and Democratic Administrations,       OSHA has required most employers to make and maintain records       of workplace injuries and illnesses for five years from the       date of the injury or illness. Each OSHA Administration has       determined that the five-year record maintenance requirements       were continuing obligations of employers and that OSHA       citations could be issued if a violation were identified any       time within that five-year period. But a 2012 decision by the       D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in Volks Constructors v.       Secretary of Labor held that OSHA could not issue a       recordkeeping citation beyond a six-month period despite the       long-standing five-year recordkeeping requirements. There was       a gap in OSHA regulations, and the Volks Rule would fix it,       making agency recordkeeping rules consistent with its       decades-long enforcement practices.        To fulfill its statutory duties to protect America's       workforce from workplace safety and health hazards, OSHA       depends on its ability to enforce injury and illness       recordkeeping requirements. For OSHA to identify workplace       hazards and to develop effective means to correct those       hazards, complete and accurate information about what, where,       when, and how injuries and illnesses occur in the workplace       is vital. OSHA uses this information to develop injury       prevention plans and to efficiently direct OSHA's scarce       resources to worksites that pose the most serious hazards for       workers. Reliable workplace injury data is also fundamental       to the development and maintenance of effective occupational       health and safety standards. Moreover, federal, state, and       local officials also need reliable injury and illness data       during procurement processes, ensuring that taxpayer dollars       to contractors and subcontractors are going to fair and safe       workplaces.        The elimination of OSHA's ability to enforce rules on       workplace safety records allows--and even incentivizes--      employers to obscure ongoing workplace hazards. It would be       nearly impossible for OSHA to identify a recordkeeping       violation and conduct a comprehensive investigation within       six months of the injury or illness, instead of the full       five-year recordkeeping period. Chronic underreporting--left       unchecked if the Volks Rule was halted--erodes OSHA       inspectors' ability to enforce the country's occupational       health and safety laws and allows patterns of serious health       and safety violations to persist. The CRA resolution would       gravely weaken workplace health and safety protections,       exposing workers to serious harm while on the job.        Because workers deserve the full and effective enforcement       of the panoply of our worker protection laws, NNU urges you       to oppose H.J. Res. 83.            Sincerely,                                               Bonnie Castillo, RN,                                     Director of Health and Safety.
