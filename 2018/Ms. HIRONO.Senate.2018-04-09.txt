 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to place a maile lei on the lectern during my remarks.    Madam President, I rise today in remembrance of Senator  Daniel Kahikina Akaka. Senator Akaka, who served in the Senate for 23  years and sat at this desk, passed away on Friday morning, with his  wife of nearly 70 years, Millie, and his extended family at his side.   Since his passing, people across Hawaii have shared their memories of  and tributes to Senator Akaka. Each of their stories has a common  thread--Senator Akaka's dedication to living with ``aloha.'' Senator  Akaka embodied the ``aloha'' spirit. From meeting nearly every Hawaii  family who came to his office for a Capitol tour to serving as a  tireless advocate for veterans, the Native Hawaiian community, and  Hawaii families, Senator Akaka's care, empathy, and compassion were  evident to everyone who knew him.   When I was elected to the Senate, I requested Senator Akaka's desk to  be my desk. I did this because it represented continuity as Senator  Akaka's successor, and the desk is a symbol to me of his years of  service and the ``aloha'' he had for this body and the people of  Hawaii.   The last time I saw Senator Akaka was at last year's American  Logistics Association Hawaii conference. This gathering brings together  Hawaii businesses from across the State to market their products for  sale to military commissaries. Over 20 years ago, Senator Akaka worked  with small businesses and the military commissary network to create  this conference because he understood how much receiving a commissary  contract would mean to Hawaii's businesses, especially Hawaii's small  businesses.   The conference started with one small table with a few products and  grew to an entire ballroom full of local products and entrepreneurs.  Last year, the conference was named for Senator Akaka.   That is who Senator Akaka was. He brought people together to solve  problems and create opportunities. His legislative style wasn't flashy  or over the top. He put his head down and got to work, and he built  relationships with colleagues to get things done.   Senator Akaka's work on behalf of our Nation's veterans also  reflected his persistent, effective style. After serving in World War  II, Senator Akaka went to college under the GI bill and became an  educator. As chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, he was  a strong advocate for expanding the GI bill for a new generation of  veterans. He authored the post-9/11 GI bill, which was signed into law  in 2011.   Senator Akaka also championed the cause of the Filipino veterans of  World War II in Congress. These veterans fought for the United States  but were denied the benefits and citizenship they were promised.  Senator Akaka introduced legislation that would restore these veterans'  benefits and, with his leadership, this bill passed the Senate.   Later he and Senator Inouye successfully included language in the  2009 stimulus bill that provided onetime payments for these Filipino  veterans through the newly created Filipino Veterans Equity  Compensation Fund.   Senator Akaka also introduced bipartisan legislation to allow these  veterans to reunite with their children and families in the United  States. While this bill did not pass, President Obama established  through executive order the Filipino World War II Veterans Parole  Program in 2016 to allow the children of these veterans to reunite with  their parents in the United States. Some of these veterans have been  waiting for decades to reunite with their children.   Although Senator Akaka had retired, his insistence on bipartisanship  helped to build broad support for President Obama's decision to issue  this Executive order.   Senator Akaka was also instrumental in building support to award the  Filipino Veterans of World War II the Congressional Gold Medal that  passed in 2016, after years of continued effort.   Senator Akaka was also a champion for America's Native people and  served as chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. As the first  Native Hawaiian to serve in the U.S. Senate, Senator Akaka fought to  expand funding for Native Hawaiian healthcare, education, and housing  programs.   In 1993, President Clinton signed into law Senator Akaka's apology  resolution, which acknowledged the Federal Government's role in the  overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893. The resolution's unanimous  passage marked the 100th anniversary of the overthrow and was a  watershed moment for Native Hawaiians. It served as the first official  admission by the United States of the role it played in the overthrow  of the Hawaiian Kingdom.   Senator Akaka later worked on the Hawaiian Home Lands Recovery Act.  This law required the United States to make the Hawaiian homelands  whole by ensuring a repayment of lost use of lands originally set aside  by Congress but which were nevertheless transferred to or otherwise  acquired by the Federal Government.   The apology resolution and the Lands Recovery Act provided the  foundation for Senator Akaka's namesake legislation--the Native  Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, often referred to as the Akaka  bill, to establish a process to secure Federal recognition for Native  Hawaiians to achieve parity with the Alaska Natives and American  Indians.   When I served in the House of Representatives, I introduced the House  companion to the Akaka bill and testified about the importance of  passing this legislation in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate.  Senator Akaka reintroduced the Akaka bill for more than 10 years, but  it did not pass before he retired.  [[Page S1997]]    A former longtime Akaka staff member reflected on the Senator's  commitment to the Native Hawaiian community. She said:         Senator Akaka worked tirelessly to address the longstanding       issues resulting from the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii.       He felt strongly that there needed to be a process to bring       all parties to the table because without such a process these       issues remained festering sources of emotional pain that       would stand in the way of Hawaii being able to move forward       as a state and for Native Hawaiians to move forward as       indigenous peoples.    Building on his work, in 2016, the Department of the Interior adopted  rules creating a process that could reestablish a government-to- government relationship between the United States and Native Hawaiians.  While the Native Hawaiian community has differences on the issue of  Federal recognition, everyone can agree that Senator Akaka pushed for  the passage of the Akaka bill because he wanted equity and justice for  Native Hawaiian people.   Senator Akaka's advocacy for our country's Native people could best  be summarized in his own words during his farewell address to the  Senate, where he said:         The United States is a great country. One of the things       that makes us so great is that though we have made mistakes,       we change, we correct them, we right past wrongs. It is our       responsibility as a nation to do right by America's native       people, those who exercised sovereignty on lands that later       became part of the United States. While we can never change       the past, we have the power to change the future.    Many people also may not know that Senator Akaka was just as  committed to protecting Hawaii's land and water resources as he was to  improving the lives of Hawaii's people. In 1992, Senator Akaka  successfully passed his Tropical Forest Recovery Act into law, which  served as a basis for Federal conservation efforts that protect  Hawaii's plants and forests.   As with so many of his initiatives, the Senator was much ahead of his  time. This act provided a vision and blueprint for tomorrow's  conservation ethic, one that stressed the integration of ecology,  livelihoods, and culture; in short, an ethic that emphasized sacred  relationship between people and place, community and sustainably  managed resources.   Senator Akaka also leaves behind a demonstrated commitment to  bipartisanship. He was widely known for his faithful attendance at the  Senate Prayer Breakfast every week. Colleagues who attend that  breakfast regularly asked me about how he and Millie were doing.   During his farewell speech, Senator Akaka said:         In Congress and in our nation, we are truly all together,       in the same canoe. If we paddle together in unison, we can       travel great distances. If the two sides of the canoe paddle       in opposite directions, we will only go in circles.    Senator Akaka is deeply missed by all the people in Hawaii, and I  dare say he will be deeply missed by his colleagues in both the U.S.  House and the Senate. The maile lei is here to signify his devotion and  commitment to the people of Hawaii.   I yield the floor to my colleague Senator Brian Schatz.
