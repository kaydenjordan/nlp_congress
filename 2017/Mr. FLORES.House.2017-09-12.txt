 Mr. Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from Alabama  (Mr. Byrne), I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment with my  good friend from Alabama (Mr. Byrne), to address an ongoing  bureaucratic overreach of our country's ocean and inland economies.   Our amendment bans the use of Federal funds for the implementation of  the previous administration's National Ocean Policy. Executive Order  13547, signed by then-President Obama in 2010, requires that 60-plus  bureaucracies essentially zone the oceans and the sources thereof.   The National Ocean Policy's requirements are an encroachment into the  powers of Congress as set forth in Article I of our Constitution. These  activities have not been authorized by Congress, nor have any  appropriations ever been made by Congress to fund those activities. Yet  the bureaucracies continue to act as if those are irrelevant  prohibitions against their activities.   Mr. Chair, since 2010, this body has voted eight times in support of  this amendment in a bipartisan manner. This language also was included  in the base text to the fiscal year 2018 Energy and Water, Interior,  and Agriculture Appropriations bills. We are looking to get it in the  CJS bill now.   We are offering this amendment again because concerns remain that the  National Ocean Policy extends far beyond restricting ocean activities  and that it significantly impacts inland activity as well.   This amendment simply stops the funding of unauthorized bureaucratic  overreach. It does not have any impact on coordination, planning, or  congressionally authorized activities to take care of our Nation's  important oceans.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Culberson).    Mr. Chair, in closing, the issue is not whether or not we  want to take care of oceans. We all agree that we should take care of  our oceans. We all believe in being good stewards of the environmental  and economic interest in our oceans. But, Mr. Chair, we also believe in  trying to make sure that we have a government that adheres to the  Constitution.                                time  1615    Under Article I of the Constitution, all legislative powers are  returned to Congress--not some, all. That is the issue at stake here.  The Obama administration's National Ocean Policy has overstepped  constitutional statutory bounds.   Congress did pass a bill in the 106th Congress to create an Ocean  Commission to review and make recommendations. Since then, the 108th,  109th, 110th, and 111th Congresses each looked at those recommendations  and decided to take no legislative action. This must have been what  caused then-President Obama to move forward with his executive order  and to try to go around Congress. There have been no appropriations for  these activities.   Additionally, 81 groups have signed a letter asking the  Appropriations Committee to include this language to address this  unconstitutional bureaucratic overreach in their annual appropriations  bills.   Again, this is a simple amendment that stands up for the  constitutional rights of this body to create the statutes under which  this activity can be conducted and to transparently appropriate the  funds which authorize activities, should it so choose.   We are not against Ocean planning, as I said at the outset of this.  What we are for, though, is the Constitution. Again, this amendment has  been adopted with bipartisan support in this body eight times since  2010.   I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne), for his work  on this amendment, as well as to thank Chairman Culberson for his  consideration. I urge my colleagues to support this straightforward  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that  redirects $120 million from CMS overhead spending, which is a 3\1/2\  percent reduction, towards increasing funding in three specific areas:  $40 million for pediatric research, $40 million for Alzheimer's  research, and $40 million to address our country's opioid crisis.   The approval of this amendment will motivate CMS to modify its  current punitive bureaucratic culture. Today, hardworking American  families are demanding that their government find competent solutions  for a struggling healthcare system, and CMS' failure to properly  implement the Taking Essential Steps for Testing Act of 2012--or the  TEST Act, as it is more commonly known--is a notable example of  bureaucratic incompetence.   American families expect the Federal Government to work with  healthcare providers, not against them, to ensure the efficient  delivery of healthcare.   In 2012, the TEST Act was passed and signed into law due to the  mandatory and harsh sanctions that CMS was then imposing on hospitals  and labs that violated the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments  Act--or CLIA, for short.   While CLIA regulations are necessary, in some instances, the  sanctions that CMS imposed against hospitals and laboratories at the  time that inadvertently violated the statute were found to be draconian  and at odds with the efficient delivery of healthcare.   At the time the TEST Act was considered in 2012, Congress determined  that there were instances where a hospital or laboratory's violations  were accidental, unintentional, and resulted in no patient harm.   At the time, CMS lacked the flexibility to align the severity of the  sanctions for minor and inadvertent actions at the lab, resulting in  needless punitive penalties, such as revoking lab certificates and  banning principals from owning or operating certified laboratories.   The TEST Act was passed in 2012 to provide CMS with needed discretion  to substitute reasonable alternative sanctions in the event of minor or  inadvertent violations. In lieu of the previously mandatory sanctions,  the TEST Act allowed more appropriate remedies like directed plans of  action, onsite monitoring, and/or modest monetary penalties.   Yet, despite being given this mandate and this flexibility, CMS has  written its regulations and interpreted the underlying statute in a way  that are clearly at odds with Congress' intent in the TEST Act. There  are serious impacts when CMS fails to use their congressionally  mandated discretionary authority to issue appropriate sanctions.   Healthcare providers are forced to divert scarce resources to severe  penalties, to oppressive settlements, and/or to a costly appeals  process. These would not be needed if CMS had properly implemented the  TEST Act. This diverts scarce resources from patient care to dealing  with an out-of-control CMS, and negatively impacts healthcare in our  communities.   I have seen this firsthand in my district where a nonprofit faith- based community hospital committed an unintentional CLIA violation that  resulted in no patient harm. The hospital then self-reported that  violation, as we would expect any healthcare provider to do.   This hospital is my community's only level II trauma center and  provides a significant amount of uncompensated care to the lower income  population, including minority families. Yet, rather than working  collaboratively with the hospital, CMS ignored the TEST Act and,  instead, imposed crippling sanctions and forced the hospital to engage  in a burdensome appeals process.   This action will cost this important community resource over $100  million per year. This arbitrary unwarranted action by CMS forces the  hospital to divert finite resources toward an unnecessary bureaucratic  process instead of taking care of patients.   CMS needs to change its implementation of the TEST Act to follow the  law. In the meantime, my amendment sends a message that this is not how  we expect our Federal Government to act in a time when we are  articulating a new vision for building a better American healthcare  system.   This amendment does this by reducing CMS spending on bureaucracy by  $120 million and directing those funds toward true solutions for better  healthcare by finding cures for pediatric cancer, Alzheimer's, and  opioid abuse.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the bottom line is that hardworking American  families are tired of having unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats  ignore congressional intent when implementing legislation such as the  important TEST Act.   We must send a message to CMS today. Now is the time to right this  wrong. In the meantime, I ask my colleagues to support my amendment to  cut CMS by 3\1/2\ percent, $120 million, and to increase research  funding for pediatric cancer, for Alzheimer's, and for opioid  treatment. This amendment is a win-win amendment for American  healthcare.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
