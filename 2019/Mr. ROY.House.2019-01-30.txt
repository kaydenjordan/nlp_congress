 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from North Carolina for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, do you know what is hard to respond to?   It is hard to respond to my constituents at home who are witnessing  the theater of the absurd.   It is hard to respond to Laurie Vargas, a mother in San Antonio, who  lost her son, Jared, last summer to somebody who was here illegally,  who was captured and released, captured and released, stopped by law  enforcement, and then murdered her son.   It is extremely hard to respond to our members of the Border Patrol,  who go down to the river, the Rio Grande in Laredo, and are down there  with no cell signal, have no radio, can't see the river through the  cane, they are down there by themselves, they know the cartels have  operational control of the border, they know their lives are threatened  if they speak out about the cartels, they know that there are  terrorists who are leading cartel organizations across the border in  Nuevo Laredo, and we are doing nothing to give them what they need to  defend the United States of America.   I can't go home to the people in Texas 21 and explain to them why we  are here for 2 days having show votes and then leave on a Wednesday.  Explain that. Explain to the people why we are going to leave this  afternoon at 1:00 not securing the border.   It makes absolutely no sense to the American people when they watch  what happens in this body, and they wonder how the people's House  leaves them with an unsecured border and nothing more than show votes,  like we are going to have today, for political theater.
