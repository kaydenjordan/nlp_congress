 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Gail Smith  Cobb, a woman who touched the lives and hearts of so many in South  Carolina for 84 years. Gail Cobb's life was dedicated to ensuring Union  County was a great place to live, work, worship, and go to school.   She started serving her community when she was secretary of the Union  County Recreation Commission and then became the program director of  the commission, where she started multiple programs and events for  residents.   From there, she became the director of the Union County Recreation  Department, overseeing the hiring of employees, park maintenance, and  programming. More importantly, she worked for the county council in  maintaining effective budgets and funding for the recreation  department.   On top of her work within the local government, Gail also served on  the board of directors for the Salvation Army for over 5 years and sat  on the Union County Fair board for 10 years.   As an active member of the community and important leader in the  Union County High School Athletic Booster Club for over 30 years, she  made her community a better place for everyone. Gail volunteered and  gave most of her time and effort to support all of the athletic teams  and cheerleaders within the Union County athletic program, and she  spent tireless hours distributing tickets and collecting money to  ensure the program's success.   In the recent playoff game between Chester and Union, she was  recognized for her efforts, and the game was dedicated on her behalf.   In life, Gail was a shining example of a tireless servant. She was a  woman of faith and service. She will be greatly missed by the  community. In rest, may she find peace                            ____________________
