 Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to be here  tonight. As we all get started in a new session, we get started with  the newness and excitement. We have already hit the ground running.   This Congress is going to be one of action. The American people  spoke. They spoke loudly--they have been over the past few years-- saying that the direction of our country needed to change. By changing,  they meant change toward a government that is more conservative, one  that is listening to them and hasn't forgot that it is not about the  government worker that we are about in this place and not about  government in and of itself, but it is about what government does for  the American people.   Tonight, as I have taken on my role as the vice chair in the  Republican Conference, we have been talking about how we can introduce  our Members and also work to get our messaging out.   Tonight is the first night where we have some of our new freshmen  here on the floor, Mr. Speaker, as you can well attest to. We are going  to take time just to get to know them, where they came from, introduce  them to the floor, and introduce them to what we are going to be about  and what their passion is to share with as part of our majority going  forward.   The first gentleman is a dear friend from my home State of Georgia.  He is, as what we call back home a dagg, D-A-G-G. We don't use the  extra G, but we will do the first G. How about that?   He is a mayor from West Point, Georgia. He understands what real life  is about. He understands about making jobs and getting people taken  care of. He also is a dentist. He is going to stay on this side of the  aisle tonight, Mr. Speaker, because I am not going over there to find  out anything about that.   We are excited to have him. It is going to be a good time tonight.   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Georgia and his passion to serve and be a part of what is going to be  going on here. We are a week away from the inauguration of our new  President-elect, and we are excited about that and moving forward.   As we move across the country, all the way to Arizona, our next  speaker is the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs). I am looking forward  to serving with Andy Biggs on the Judiciary Committee. His background  is working to promote a conservative, small-business agenda, which is  something that is going to be valuable here. He is also an author. For  those of us working in intellectual property and copyright, that is  very important. There is so much job creation that is made by the  intellectual spark that comes from our entrepreneurs. Tonight I am  honored to have the second of our speakers, Andy Biggs from Arizona's  Fifth Congressional District.   I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Again, we see the quality and we see who the American people have  sent here, people like Andy Biggs. We got started with the REINS Act, a  bill that I sponsored that talked about reining in regulations. Andy  jumped in with a couple of amendments. He wanted to be a part of the  solution to start with.   Next up is a gentleman from Kentucky, the First District of Kentucky,  Mr. Comer. He comes to us from a farm background. He wore the blue  jacket and the green jacket, 4-H and FFA. He was the Commissioner  of Agriculture for the State of Kentucky. He has been a legislator. He  also is a good friend of my Commissioner of Agriculture, Gary Black.  Gary called me up and said there is a good one in Kentucky. I said when  Gary says that, we know something good is going on.    It is my pleasure, Mr. Speaker, to yield to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Comer).    I thank the gentleman.   Those are exciting values. My district is one of the more rural  agricultural districts. We are not far from Atlanta, but poultry is  important to my district, and I appreciate him bringing those values to  us.   Mr. Speaker, our next speaker is Brian Mast from Florida. I got to  know Brian when he was running for this office. I got to visit with him  in his district as he was running.   Let me just say that many times we talk about elections with campaign  ads and speeches, and all of those kind of things that are very true,  but it is also when a person connects with the people they are  representing. When they connect with them in such a way that it sort of  even transcends their ideological perspective. I remember a story that  I want to tell. We were at a polling precinct and we were holding  signs. People were early voting. I remember one lady parked her car and  got her young child out. She came up to Brian and said: I am a  Democrat; I am voting for other Democrats, but I am voting for you, and  I wanted my daughter to meet you.   When you make that kind of connection, that is what makes America  great. That is the kind of connection people need to have with their  Federal Government. That is why the people's House is such a special  place to be, and the people's House has a special Representative from  Florida.   I now yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast), representing  Florida's 18th Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, as you can tell, the passion  that this class brings is no more better exemplified than by our friend  from Florida (Mr. Mast).   We now go back north. All over this election, it was an election  heard clear all over the country, from the north to the south, to the  areas in between, from Georgia to California. We have new voices, fresh  voices here, ones who come from business, who made their life helping  others find the workforce skills, the development.   That is what my friend, Mr. Mitchell, from Michigan's 10th  Congressional District, Paul Mitchell has done. He has made that a  process in his life, one that he wants to lead, and he wants to lead by  helping others. There is no greater satisfaction than to watch somebody  else that you have helped succeed, and he understands that. So he  brings that desire to us tonight.   He comes from the wonderful State of Michigan. He is a Spartan,  Michigan State University. As he comes along tonight, we look forward  to what Paul Mitchell from Michigan's 10th Congressional District is  going to bring to us tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    I thank the gentleman for bringing that  passion for helping others, for bringing that passion to teach.   I have always said that I believe that those who want to get involved  in politics and run for elected office, there are two things that they  need to be a part of. Number one, they need to care for people deeply.  They need to make sure that they have people at the first and foremost.  They need to have alligator skin to let a lot of things roll off their  back, but they also need to have a heart that cares. They also need to  be willing to understand that our job involves teaching; and, Paul, I  appreciate you sharing that.   Our next speaker for the night, we share not only the privilege of  serving the people's House, but we also shared, up until just recently,  a common passion. We both served in the United States Air Force.  General Bacon distinguished himself in that regard, helping our airmen  all across the world, doing so with integrity and doing so with a  passion for this country that he will bring to this floor, and we are  excited about that.   He will take that passion for what is really the concerns of the  world and be a part of it. When I saw that in the Nebraska Home, when I  went out there and was walking with him and seeing and listening to him  talk, you could hear the desire to serve and to be a part of the  wonderful heartland of America.   I don't believe, Mr. Speaker, they could have sent a better witness  to not only blue proud Air Force values, but also American values. And,  hopefully, as we continue, all will see the Nebraska values shown in  General Don Bacon.   With that, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska's Second  Congressional District (Mr. Bacon).    It is good to have the General here.   It is going to be an interesting time. I know you are the last  speaker here, but not the last of all of the freshmen. We are going to  be doing this more in the coming weeks. But I just know as I watch  tonight, it is the passion of your class coming in.   I have watched you all as you have come and gone through orientation  and done all of the things together and that there is a bond. I notice  you come and sit together and you all talk together, and there is an  understanding that you all come here for a purpose bigger than  yourselves--and that is exciting to see. So I am excited to have you  here. It is going to be a good year.   Mr. Speaker, as we have introduced and talked about these new Members  and they have allowed themselves to introduce themselves, one of the  things that I wanted to do is just make sure, as we look ahead, we see  folks who have made a place--they made a place in their communities;  they made a place in their homes. As they look forward to serving here  in this Congress, we are looking forward to having them here.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take just a few moments to discuss something  else, and that is, as we move forward and as we continue here, the  majority, with these new freshmen and all coming in, are going to be  fighting for what matters. It is sort of amazing to me now that, as we  enter tomorrow and we take the first step toward repealing, really,  what is a disastrous law, it is amazing now the cries of: Oh, what is  going to be done? What are you doing now? But it didn't seem to matter  just a few years ago when they said: Here is what you are going to  have. You are going to take it no matter what it does. You want your  doctor? Keep him.   That is a lie.   You want to keep your health provider? Keep him. Your insurance is  fine.   That is a lie. It is amazing now how some on the other side are just  wanting to start yelling and saying: Oh, you have got to have a plan.   Have a plan?   Let's remind the American people why we are here. The majority is  here because of 6 years of poor decisionmaking. It started at the base  and has gone up. And we are going to continue as this majority to put  people first, those who get up every morning, who want a job, who want  to be able to go to their job and to start businesses and start and use  that intellectual capital so that they can continue to do those things  without government interference.   I heard just the other day as I was here working on a rule, Mr.  Speaker, I heard one of the speakers actually say that we should not  put these burdens on government employees because it would make their  jobs so much harder.   Please, tell me where the voice is for the American worker out in the  field every day just trying to make ends meet. It is in this majority.  And we will continue to put forth policy that takes away the government  overreach and puts it back where it belongs, and that is in the  entrepreneurs, the moms, the dads, the kids, those who have a dream  right now in a freshman English class or a science class, that have a  dream that one day they will own their own business or go further.   Mr. Speaker, let's put this in perspective. This majority is putting  people first, and over the past 6 years, the American people have  responded. It is now our time to act. People say, if you don't have a  plan, then you are not understanding. This is friends and neighbors  that elected us, and we will not fail in this moment.   We have said what we are going to do. We are going to put people  first in their businesses, in their jobs, and in their health care.  When we do that, that is what makes America great.   So tonight is the first night for letting our freshmen come, share  their heart. We have heard their passion. We are going to continue to  hear their passion as new and more freshmen come.   Mr. Speaker, you are part of that. There are many others that will be  a part. I am looking forward to leading in our majority, putting people  first, putting Americans first, and this country is going to be the  better for it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time.                            ____________________
