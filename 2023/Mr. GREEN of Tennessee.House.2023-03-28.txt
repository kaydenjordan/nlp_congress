 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Desert Storm and Battle of Mogadishu veteran, John Magness, for his  service to our country and to mourn his recent passing.   Mr. Magness and I graduated from West Point together in 1986, after  which he served 9 years in the United States Army. His early aviator  years were spent with the 4th Squadron, 2nd Armored Calvary Regiment  where he was charged with conducting border surveillance in his Cobra  gunship along 454 miles of the Iron Curtain after which he spent 4  years with the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, proudly  wearing the Night Stalkers name and supporting units like the Navy  SEALs and Army Rangers.   After time spent as a consultant for the United Arab Emirates, Mr.  Magness dedicated his time and talent to developing and enriching our  communities through his work with Hillwood Development Company.   Where Air Force bases lay vacant and unused, such as Norton Air Force  Base, Mr. Magness saw opportunity for flourishing. His efforts led to  the commercial and industrial development of the San Bernardino base,  now boasting of millions of square feet around the base. Fifteen years  after he started this project, the development had contributed over  $2.3 billion for the surrounding community.   On May 18, 2010, Colonel John McHugh, another West Point class of  1986 grad and dear friend of Mr. Magness was killed in action in Kabul,  Afghanistan, by a suicide bomber. As a result of his tragic passing and  his legacy, the Johnny Mac Soldiers Fund was created by the West Point  class of 1986 to help Colonel McHugh's family.   The fund's mission quickly expanded to serve as many families as  possible, giving back to those who gave their all. The fund honors  military service and sacrifice by providing scholarships to veterans  and military family members, especially to the children of fallen  servicemembers. It has awarded over $30 million in scholarship funds  since 2014 and supports 4,500 Johnny Mac scholars attending schools  across this country.   Having been a close friend of Colonel McHugh and a dedicated  supporter of veterans, servicemembers, and their families, Mr. Magness  dedicated himself to the Johnny Mac Soldiers Fund. To raise money and  awareness, Mr. Magness undertook the Aconcagua Challenge expedition,  tackling the largest mountain outside of Asia located in Argentina.   Undeterred by the 22,837-foot climb and exemplifying the West Point  class of 1986 motto, ``courage never quits,'' Mr. Magness summited the  mountain after 10 days of climbing, even after two of his three-man  team had to cease the climb for medical reasons.   Having conquered the mountain and accomplishing his mission, Mr.  Magness succumbed to ensuing medical complications and passed away in  the early morning hours of February 5, 2023.   Night Stalkers don't quit even after leaving the military service for  the private sector. Mr. Magness was a fierce supporter of the  organization's mission and the personification of former President  Teddy Roosevelt's ``The Man in the Arena,'' the man stained by ``dust  and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly . . . who spends himself in  a worthy cause.'' Mr. Magness died with his boots on serving his  country and its heroes.   Mr. Magness is survived by his wife, Angie, and their two children,  Chelsea Shelburne and John Michael Magness, Jr. He was also a very  proud grandfather of his 2-year-old grandson, Rhett.   His family, friends, and colleagues all describe him as a man of  strong Christian faith, a patriot, a loving father, a grandfather, a  husband, a soldier, a hero, a servant leader, and a friend. Mr.  Magness, or Magger as he was known by his friends, exemplified these  characteristics and more, all the while serving the community that he  loved so well.   In both his life and in his death, Mr. Magness modeled service for  all those around him. I was blessed to have  [[Page H1468]]  known him through our shared time at West Point and as a fellow Night  Stalker, and I know he is greatly missed by his family and friends.   John was buried at West Point yesterday, March 27, 2023, where he  rests in peace having completed his mission on Earth.   I will finish with the last stanza of the West Point alma mater:       And when our work is done,      Our course on Earth is run,      May it be said, well done      Be thou at peace.      E'er may the line of gray      Increase from day to day      Live, serve, and die, we pray,      West Point, for thee.    Well done, John.                            ____________________
