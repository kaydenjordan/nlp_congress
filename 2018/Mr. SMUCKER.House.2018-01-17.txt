 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Chris Smith for leading  the Pro-Life Caucus and for organizing this evening's Special Order.   This Friday, our constituents from all across the country will arrive  on the National Mall for the 45th annual March for Life. Last year's  March for Life was one of the first events that I had participated in,  here in Washington, after I took office in January of last year.   Hundreds of my constituents had marched down the National Mall. I had  the opportunity to meet with them afterwards and hear from them about  their hopes for the pro-life movement. They had just come back from  hearing the Vice President speak. He had spoken about life is winning  here in America. He said:         I've long believed that a society can be judged by how we       care for its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the       disabled, and the unborn.    Since that day, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that this Chamber has  taken steps to protect the lives of the unborn.   We passed the commonsense Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,  banning abortion after 20 weeks, the point at which we know that an  unborn child can feel pain.   We passed the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, ending taxpayer  subsidies of abortions, and codifying the Hyde amendment  governmentwide.   I was very happy to be part of a body that passed both of these bills  and, of course, voted for and supported those measures.   And this week, the House will vote on legislation--the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act--requiring medical care be given to  any child who survives an attempted abortion,  [[Page H469]]  with strict penalties for those who do not comply with the law.   Voting against this legislation would be unconscionable. A child,  made in the image of our Creator and born into this world, should not  need additional legal protections requiring medical care if they are  born alive after an attempted abortion.   But here we are, continuing our fight for the rights of the unborn  and the born. It is a fight worth fighting, and we aren't going to  stop.   I look forward to joining my constituents on the National Mall on  Friday to raise our voices for those who cannot yet speak. They have  our commitment to continue to work in this Chamber to protect the lives  of the unborn.
