 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate John Ferriola  on his retirement from Nucor Corporation after more than 28 years with  the company. He has been CEO since 2013 and has served as chairman of  the board since 2014. In his time with Nucor, he has worked at  facilities in Texas, Nebraska, and Indiana, and at the corporate  headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina.   Nucor takes scrap metal and recycles it into new steel products in  its electric arc furnaces. When Mr. Ferriola joined the company in  1991, Nucor was a small steel company that made less than $1.5 billion  in sales and had just opened two state-of-the-art steel mills in  Mississippi County, Arkansas. Last year, Nucor generated $25 billion in  revenue, making it the largest steel producer in the United States.   I have had the pleasure of working with Mr. Ferriola on the issues  affecting the domestic steel industry, particularly the need for strong  trade enforcement to ensure a level playing field for American  steelworkers. He frequently appeared before the Congressional Steel  Caucus to testify on the state of the American steel industry and has  served as chairman of the board for both the American Iron and Steel  Institute and the World Steel Association.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring John  Ferriola for his outstanding career in the steel industry. I wish him  all the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
