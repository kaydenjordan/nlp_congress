 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the state of the  economy and how progrowth policies are helping my district.   A headline last month on CNBC read: ``Jobs Surge in April,  Unemployment Rate Falls to the Lowest Since 1969.'' The U.S. added  263,000 new hires last month, including over 13,000 jobs in North  Carolina. On top of that, the labor participation rate increased. Many  people are coming off the sidelines and into the workforce, and the  manufacturing output continues to go up.   Mr. Speaker, when we cut taxes, slash red tape, and give employers  more certainty, they are able to employ more people. This just isn't  rocket science.   Just a few days ago, my district received great news. Honda Aircraft  announced plans to expand its global headquarters in Greensboro by  investing $15.5 million in a new facility on its campus. This will be a  huge boost for Guilford County, and that is why we cannot afford to go  backwards.   Tax cuts work.   Progrowth policies work.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  McHenry), the ranking member, for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1500. It is  deceptively, and yet cleverly, named the Consumer First Act.   Let's talk some facts.   House Financial Services Committee Republicans have been trying for  years to increase transparency and accountability at the CFPB. We have  tried to create an Office of the Inspector General for that purpose. We  have also tried to bring accountability by subjecting the CFPB to the  appropriations process. Yet, despite our attempts, we have been met  with opposition every single time to what used to be a bipartisan goal.   Now, today, we see a bill that my friends on the other side of the  aisle are pushing that would undermine our previous efforts to shine  some daylight on this agency. Rather than working with us to reform the  agency and its authorities, and rather than working with us to avoid  constant partisan policy shifts from Director to Director, rather than  working with us in a bipartisan manner, the majority is choosing to  move legislation today that simply advances their own political agenda.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this bill.
