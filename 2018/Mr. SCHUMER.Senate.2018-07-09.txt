 Mr. President, as everyone knows, later tonight  President Trump will announce his nomination for the upcoming vacancy  on the Supreme Court. Whoever fills Justice Kennedy's seat will join an  otherwise evenly divided Court and immediately obtain the ability to  affect the laws of the United States and the rights of its citizens for  generations to come.   Enormously important issues hang in the balance: the right of workers  to organize, the pernicious influence of dark money in our politics,  the right of Americans to marry whom they love, and the right to vote.   Two issues of similar and profound consequence are the fate of  affordable healthcare and a woman's freedom to make the most sensitive  medical decisions about her body. These two rights--affordable  healthcare and a woman's freedom to make sensitive healthcare  decisions--hang in the balance with this nominee. The views of  President Trump's next Court nominee could very well determine whether  the Senate approves or rejects this nomination.   President Trump has already made up his mind. President Trump has  repeatedly said that he believes Roe was wrongly decided. He has  promised, in his own words, to nominate only ``pro-life judges'' whose  selection will result in the ``automatic'' overturning of Roe  [[Page S4830]]  v. Wade. Those are his words: ``pro-life judges'' and ``automatic.''   He also said that Chief Justice Roberts has been ``an absolute  disaster''--his words--for voting to uphold the healthcare law and said  his judicial appointments ``will do the right thing, unlike Bush's  appointee John Roberts, on ObamaCare.''   It is near impossible to imagine that President Trump would select a  nominee who isn't hostile to our healthcare law and to healthcare for  millions and millions of Americans and who isn't hostile to a woman's  freedom to make her own healthcare decisions.   We can be sure of this because President Trump, during the campaign,  asked Leonard Leo, the founder of the Federalist Society, to assemble a  list of possible Supreme Court Justices for him to pick from. Mr. Leo  was not only aware of Candidate Trump's preference for a Supreme Court  that would reverse Roe v. Wade; he himself spent his career in pursuit  of it.   That is not just my view. According to Edward Whelan, one of the most  prominent legal conservative activists and bloggers, ``no one has been  more dedicated to the enterprise of building a Supreme Court that will  overturn Roe v. Wade than the Federalist Society's Leonard Leo.'' No  one has been more dedicated to overturning Roe v. Wade than the very  man who chose the list of 25.   That is what we are up against here. That is why America is on  tenterhooks, so worried about any choice from this list.   Let me repeat again that Mr. Leonard Leo is the man who assembled  Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees, and no one--no one-- has been more dedicated to overturning Roe v. Wade than Leonard Leo.   Normally, in the Senate we have a process of advise and consent on  the Supreme Court. In the old days, the President would consult with  Republicans and Democrats in the Senate on a qualified judge and, then,  after careful deliberations, nominate a jurist who could get bipartisan  support. What we have here is the exact opposite.   The President has gone to two ``far out of the mainstream'' hard- right groups--the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society--and  asked them, not the Senate, to advise and consent on a Supreme Court  nomination.   Whomever the President selects tonight, if that nominee is from the  preapproved list selected by Leo and the Heritage Foundation, everyone  ought to understand what it means for the freedom of women to make  their own healthcare decisions and for the protections for Americans  with preexisting conditions: Those rights will be gravely threatened.   We are going to hear a lot this summer about precedents. The  traditional question in these matters has been: Will the nominee defer  to precedent? Nominees will be asked if they respect settled law. This  is known as the principle of stare decisis. The nominee always answers  that, yes, he or she will respect and defer to precedent, and Senators  nod their heads, having received this rickety, vague assurance that the  nominee will not rock the judicial boat and turn the clock back  decades. But for two reasons, this standard of settled law--stare  decisis--is no longer an adequate standard by which to judge nominees.  Why?   First, we have ample evidence from the past several years of judges  who have sworn in their confirmation hearings to respect precedent and  then have reversed their stand once on the Court. For example, in his  confirmation hearings, then-Judge Gorsuch said:         Precedent is like our shared family history of judges. It       deserves our respect.    Last week--just last week--now-Justice Gorsuch voted to overturn 41  years of precedent in the Janus decision, relying on flimsy and  fabricated legal theory. It was so flimsy, in fact, that Justice Kagan  wrote in dissent that the majority overruled precedent, ``for not  exceptional or special reason, but because it never liked the decision  . . . subverting all known principles of stare decisis.''   Justice Roberts--another person who swore he would obey precedent-- said he would call balls and strikes as he saw them, that he would  interpret law rather than make it. Of course, it was Justice Roberts  who was then responsible for overturning 40 years of precedent in the  Citizens United decision, which so set back our politics and so  deepened the swamp that so many Americans despise, by allowing huge  amounts of dark money, unreported, to cascade into our political  system.   On two of the most important rulings in the history of the Roberts'  Court, a cumulative 81 years of precedent were thrown out the window,  despite the earnest promises of Justices Roberts and Gorsuch at their  hearings.   When they say they will obey settled law, you can't believe it. You  can't believe it because it just hasn't happened in this new  conservative Court that is so eager to make law, not interpret it.   There is a second reason, which is maybe even more important, why the  principle of ``I will follow settled law'' no longer works, and that is  President Trump. We already know that President Trump's nominee will be  prepared to overturn the precedents of Roe v. Wade and NFIB v.  Sebelius. We know that because President Trump has said so. When the  President has a litmus test for his nominees and only chooses from a  preapproved list of nominees designed to satisfy that litmus test, it  is certainly not enough for a judge to prove his or her moderation by  invoking stare decisis. Stare decisis and respect for precedent have  become an almost meaningless bar to set for a Supreme Court nominee. At  this critical juncture, with so many rights and liberties at stake,  U.S. Senators and the American people should expect an affirmative  statement of support for the personal liberties of all Americans from  the next Supreme Court nominee.    The American people deserve to know what kind of a Justice President  Trump's nominee would be. President Trump is the one who made a litmus  test for his nominee, not us. The onus is on his nominee to show where  he or she might stand.   Considering the ample evidence that President Trump will only select  a nominee who will undermine protection for Americans with preexisting  conditions, give greater weight to corporate interests than the  interests of our citizens no matter what precedent says, and vote to  overturn Roe v. Wade, the next nominee has an obligation--a serious and  solemn obligation--to share their personal views on these legal issues  no matter whom President Trump selects tonight.
