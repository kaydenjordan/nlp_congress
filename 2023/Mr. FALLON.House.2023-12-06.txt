 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to the  DETERRENT Act, a bill that will work toward preventing foreign  influence within America's institutions, colleges, and universities by  strengthening section 117 of the Higher Education Act.   Section 117 requires colleges and universities to report contracts  with and gifts from a foreign source that, alone or combined, are  valued at $250,000 or more for per calendar year.   My amendment will prohibit repeat-offending institutions from  obtaining waivers that will allow them to accept donations or gifts  from countries or entities of concern.   Some countries and entities, like China, pose a particular concern to  the United States, and as such, institutions are required under this  act to obtain special waivers if they wish to accept donations, gifts,  or contracts from them.   My amendment simply adds that if an institution fails to comply with  this act for 3 years, they are no longer eligible to receive these  waivers. It is kind of a ``three strikes and you are out'' deal.   Foreign funds can come with strings attached, as we all know, strings  that undermine our own national security. Foreign countries can use  investment in America's colleges and institutions to disseminate  propaganda, steal secrets and research, and, unfortunately, so much  more.   This is why countries that raise more concern have more supervision  over any of their donations or gifts, including waiver requirements.   This is really a commonsense amendment. We are not stripping away  waivers after the first mistake. We are not even stripping away waivers  after the second mistake. If it is the third time, if you neglect this  act, this is obviously purposeful and that is when we say, as I  mentioned before, three strikes and you are out. You have proven, if  you do that, that you lack the transparency and the trust that are  required to have these waivers permitted.   This amendment is not only about transparency and accountability, but  it is also fundamentally about our national security.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of our national security by  supporting this amendment. I hope this is bipartisan.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think I made my point clear. I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer yet another amendment on  the DETERRENT Act. It again deals with section 117, which requires  colleges and universities to report contracts or gifts that total over  $250,000 in a given year. It is, I think, very important because of the  nefarious influence that some foreign governments might exert on our  youngest and most talented minds.   When Secretary DeVos, in 2019, initiated investigations into just 12  universities to ensure compliance with section 117, the Department  found that $6.5 billion of previously unreported foreign gifts and  contracts were revealed. Despite this demonstrating a clear need for  increased investigation and enforcement, the Biden administration's  Department of Education refuses to open investigations under section  117 to ensure institutions aren't hiding foreign investments.   Think about that for a second: 12 institutions. $6.5 billion of gifts  revealed, when they were essentially audited. That is scary. It is  unbelievably frightening.   The underlying bill does not require institutions to maintain certain  information about foreign gifts and contracts, including unredacted  versions, which would allow for future investigations, if needed.                                time  1430    However, my amendment would change the minimum length of time that  they must maintain this information from 4 years to 5 years. It is a  step in the right direction. It is really rather minor, 4 to 5 years.  The yearlong extension, why this is relevant, is because if we had a  potential change in the administrations--regardless that  administrations last 4 years at a time--this would be protected with 5  years.   If we have a Department of Education that is uninterested or  unwilling to investigate potential foreign influences in our  institutions, this added extension of that 1 year could become very  impactful.   This should be, I think, in my humble opinion, a completely  bipartisan and noncontroversial amendment. It can go both ways. If my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have concerns about a future  Republican administration, this just adds that extra year of  protection.   This will also work toward restoring legislative branch relevance, as  we see the executive branch continually year over year, regardless of  what party is in power at the White House, eat away at our  constitutional oversight, and, frankly, authority in powers.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment  and in favor of the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, one of the other reasons why we should  hopefully get overwhelming support for this amendment is this--let me  give you a quick example.   In the final year of President Trump's administration, universities  reported $1.6 billion in foreign donations. In the entire first year of  the Biden Presidency, that number magically plunged to $4.3 million.   I doubt that the actual donations and gifts and such were reduced by  37,200 percent. I think it is merely a case of if section 117 isn't  going to be essentially audited, then these universities and other  institutions don't feel compelled to follow Federal law. That is  another reason why I think extending this from 4 to 5 years is  critical.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
