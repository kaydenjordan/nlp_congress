 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  the bill (H.R. 962) the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today alongside my colleagues to  speak out against the radical and dangerous policies being pursued by  Democratic leadership and State legislators across the country.   In New York, a new law legalizes what amounts to infanticide-- allowing abortions up to and even after birth for almost any reason-- and ends the safeguards that protect babies born alive after an  abortion attempt.                                time  1715    In Virginia, a similar bill is under consideration that could lead to  babies being denied lifesaving medical care. As Governor Ralph Northam  put it: ``The infant would be kept comfortable . . . and then a  discussion would ensue.''   I think this is sickening. That is why my colleagues and I have  called for the House vote on H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act, a commonsense bill to require that medical  care--just medical care--be provided to children who survive a failed  abortion.   Sadly, Democratic leadership in the House is standing in the way and  refusing even to allow an up-or-down vote on this issue. This is not a  partisan issue. It is simply what is right.   We have got to stand together against this radical and inhumane  agenda. We must act to protect the rights of all infants.   I am grateful to be joined in this call by so many of my colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the Third District of  Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Fourth  District of New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who is the co-chair of the  Bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, and I thank Representative  Chris Smith for his leadership and courage.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the  Second Congressional District of Alabama (Mrs. Roby).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from the Second  District of Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), who is the sponsor of H.R. 962, the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends who are here, Jaime,  Representative Roby, and Representative Ann Wagner standing here, and I  reiterate the reason we are here is that we are serious about this.   I did the unanimous consent tonight and asked the Speaker to bring  that bill down right now and bring it to a vote.   This is an issue of what is right and what is wrong. This is an issue  where we have been able to rise up together tonight and speak for those  who not only can't speak for themselves but those that could  potentially be born alive in this country and given a lethal injection  by a doctor or some other medical professional.   What is going on in this country is absolutely horrific.    I yield to the gentlewoman.    It does happen. We are going to do all we can to  absolutely prevent this happening. I thank my colleagues who have  spoken so far.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence), my  friend and fellow Hoosier from Indiana's Sixth District.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to my friend from the Second  District of Tennessee (Mr. Burchett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from the Fifth  District of North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to my friend from the First  District of Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the  Fourth District of Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), a great friend of mine who  stands for life every single day that she is here.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire on the time  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Utah's Second  District, Representative Chris Stewart.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Florida's  Fourth District, Representative    John Rutherford.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my fellow Hoosier from  Indiana's Fourth District, Representative  Jim Baird.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Michigan's  Seventh District, Representative Tim Walberg.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from South  Carolina's Fifth District, Ralph Norman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from West Virginia's  Third District, Representative Carol Miller.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Ohio's Sixth  District, Representative Bill Johnson.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), my friend from Washington's Fifth District.    Mr. Speaker, I would again inquire how much time I  have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. LaHood), my friend from Illinois's 18th District.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Walker), my friend from North Carolina's Sixth District.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Allen), my friend from Georgia's 12th District.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Olson), my friend from Texas' 22nd District.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues for  joining me this evening to stand up for the most vulnerable among us.   We stand together to defend the sanctity of life, to speak out  against a radical anti-life agenda that would effectively legalize  infanticide.   I have long fought to defend the unborn, but I am shocked that I now  have to defend the right to life of newborn infants. These precious  children are in peril, their rights are under attack, their lives are  under attack, and this House has the responsibility to act.   Tonight the American people heard our call to action. It is time to  vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Will the  leadership of this House listen or will the Democratic majority  continue to allow this march toward legalized infanticide?   If we don't send a strong message that every baby has been endowed by  its creator with inalienable rights, that we are not defending the  fundamental principles of the Constitution, if we don't protect these  children from harm, we are abandoning the basic truth of our humanity.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for standing with me here  tonight. I urge the support of House bill H.R. 962, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and to stand against infanticide.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
