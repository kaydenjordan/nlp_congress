 Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, as virtually every American now understands, Washington  is broken.   For years, Congress has spent irresponsibly and with what seems to be  little or no thought for how it might affect future generations.   We are passing along a bill that our children and grandchildren may  never be able to pay, and it is as immoral as it is unsustainable.   Meanwhile, our Nation's top military officials have repeatedly warned  Congress that the number one threat to our national security is our  debt.   We have no choice now but to correct this wrong and institute  policies that promote fiscal responsibility.   Currently, our national debt exceeds $20 trillion, and the number  increases every second. Mr. Speaker, when I do townhalls back home, I  put the debt clock up on the screen very often and allow our  constituents to watch that clock toll. It is frightening.   The last omnibus package, which is a whopping 2,232 pages in length,  allocated another $1.3 trillion. That is about $582 million of Federal  spending per page.   Our government is out of control, and we have to put an end to the  dangerous and clearly excessive spending patterns that are coming out  of Washington and out of this body.   As I have said on more than one occasion, people all across America  sit down at their kitchen tables and create budgets for their families.  Small businesses make countless sacrifices to manage their balance  sheets. And our government should act no differently.   We cannot continue to spend money we don't have and drive ourselves  further into the debt of hostile nations like China, who is the primary  creditor in holding all of our debt.   Passing a balanced budget amendment is a commonsense solution that  will put us back on the right track and restore fiscal sanity to the  Congress.   The balanced budget amendment will ensure our government acts as a  good steward of America's tax dollars, not only today, but for all the  days in the future. It has the potential to make the bloated budgets of  Washington a thing of the past.   Opponents of this amendment will say that passing this will force  serious cuts to our budget. And to that we respond and say: Of course  it will. We simply cannot get out of the hole that we have created  without making tough decisions. But that is our job. That is why we are  elected as the duly elected representatives of the people.   Right now, our country faces a point of no return with our debt, and  there should be nothing controversial about telling our Federal  Government to act within its means. This is simply about aligning and  agreeing upon our top priorities.   Thomas Jefferson said that the representatives of a nation should  never take on more debt than they themselves can pay in their own  lifetime.   We abandoned that principle a long time ago, and, unfortunately, we  have already far exceeded that amount in this body and in our lifetime,  and it is now our moral obligation to right this wrong.   This is really about who we are as Americans, if you listen to the  Founders. That is why I urge my colleagues to support the balanced  budget amendment to the Constitution, and help restore and preserve the  American Dream for our children and for all future generations.   We owe that to the country. Fiscal sanity, responsibility, and good  stewardship is why we were sent here, and it is what we must do.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. Handel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).  [[Page H3175]]         Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker), the  distinguished chair of our Republican Study Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear the  gentleman openly acknowledge that not a single Democrat voted for the  tax cut. I am sure the American people would love to hear that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Poliquin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time  to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, and I ask unanimous consent that he may control  that time.
