 Madam Speaker, biomedical research can  accelerate discoveries to alleviate human suffering due to illness if  we allow it.   The speed with which the COVID-19 vaccines were developed using  groundbreaking messenger RNA technology is one of the most important  biomedical advancements in 100 years.   By establishing the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health,  otherwise known as ARPA-H, we can harness those lessons for new  discoveries in many other diseases.   The potential for lifesaving treatments for devastating conditions  like ALS, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and cancer is right in front of us.  For millions of Americans suffering and the people who love them, this  can't come soon enough.                            ____________________
