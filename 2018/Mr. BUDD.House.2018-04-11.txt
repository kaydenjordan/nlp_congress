 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. Ross)  for leading the fight on this issue, and also for the support across  the aisle on this issue.   Mr. Ross' bill corrects another oversight of the Dodd-Frank Act by  reforming the nonbank SIFI designation process.   Mr. Speaker, this bill does not take away FSOC's ability to designate  nonbank financial institutions with the SIFI tag. It simply gives these  institutions a greater opportunity to be heard before their final  designation from FSOC.   FSOC should not be able to simply dish out this designation to these  institutions, subjecting them to Federal Reserve requirements, without  explaining their reasoning. Unfortunately, we have seen FSOC do this in  the past. This is especially important since nonbank financial  institutions are clearly different entities than banks are. Capital  requirements, for example, might not be suitable to address the risk  profile of nonbank financial institutions, so why even subject them to  these requirements.   This is not a smart regulation, Mr. Speaker. Simply put, the nonbank  SIFI designation process is not fair in its current form. Again, this  bill is a smart, targeted step that I am confident will benefit  investors and benefit our economy. Transparency and fairness should be  welcome and not rejected.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill.  [[Page H3127]]
