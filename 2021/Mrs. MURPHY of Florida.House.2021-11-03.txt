 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  bipartisan resolution.  [[Page H6156]]    This resolution honors the Cuban people who have protested peacefully  at great personal risk for their fundamental freedoms and a brighter  future for their families. These are men and women of courage and  character, confronting a ruthless and repressive regime.   Our resolution sends these patriots a simple message: America has  your back.   I feel a deep sense of solidarity with the Cuban people. When I was a  baby, my family fled a Communist country, and like many Cuban families,  we found refuge and opportunity in America. And like so many Cuban  Americans, I never take for granted the rights I am afforded in this  country because I know what the alternative looks like.   Following the historic protests in Cuba, I offered a bipartisan  amendment to an appropriations bill that would have increased funding  to support democracy, human rights, political prisoners, and internet  access in Cuba. To my grave disappointment, this amendment was  prevented from coming to the floor of the House by members of my own  party.    America must speak and act with moral clarity. We should support men  and women standing up to authoritarian regimes across the globe, and  especially in our shared neighborhood. I urge support for this bill.
