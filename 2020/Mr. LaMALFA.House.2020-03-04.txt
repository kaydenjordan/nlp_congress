 Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday, the West Valley girls  basketball team had a come-from-behind win to win the Northern Section  Division IV championship in northern California.   After going 23-8 in the regular season, West Valley shut out their  opponent in the fourth quarter to pull out a 29-26 victory.   After trailing 24-17 in the third quarter, Hannah Wayne scored seven  of the next eight points for the Eagles, creating a momentum that  allowed the Eagles to keep the lead for good.   Madalynn Bassett scored eight points, along with Hannah Wayne, for  lead scorer of the game.   Congratulations on the win to the West Valley Eagles, and head coach,  Lenny Ehn. Good luck in the play-offs for the State championship, we  will be rooting for you.                            ____________________
