 Mr. Speaker, I ask  unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 3440, the DREAM Act, to protect  Vanessa, a DREAMer from New Mexico, who dreams of becoming a doctor.    Mr. Chairman, I have an  amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment  prioritizes funding to study the treatment of detainees and the  conditions of private immigration detention centers.   ICE is increasing apprehensions and putting immigrant communities at  [[Page H7075]]  higher risk of apprehension, detention, and deportation. At the same  time, the Trump administration has lowered detention standards when  signing contracts with private facilities. This has led to the highest  number of deaths in ICE custody since 2011.   We have seen a complete disregard for civil and constitutional rights  of detainees, many of whom are torn from their families without basic  due process protections. These facilities are not holding prisoners.  They are holding asylum seekers who risked everything to start a better  life. They are holding hardworking community members. They are holding  family members: mothers, fathers, and children.   Information regarding detention facilities is already inconsistent,  outdated, and, frankly, overall lacking in transparency. Medical  neglect, poor treatment by guards, sexual abuse, and even in-custody  deaths plague numerous facilities across the country. Even worse,  repeat offending private prison companies continue to receive lucrative  contracts for additional facilities.   We have to have an objective and transparent review of these private  immigration detention centers. I urge my colleagues to join me in  voting ``yes'' for my amendment to ensure that detainees are treated  humanely and provided basic due process protections.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
