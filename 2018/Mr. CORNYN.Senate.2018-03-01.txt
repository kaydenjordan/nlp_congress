 Mr. President, this morning, I would like to start off  speaking about a very important day in the history of my State, a day  that inspires pride in the hearts of all those who were born in Texas.  I am here to commemorate Texas Independence Day, which will be  celebrated tomorrow.   On March 2, 1836, Texas adopted its Declaration of Independence from  Mexico. It is worth reading, and I would recommend it to anyone. This  happened in the context of a struggle that is perhaps best remembered  by the Battle of the Alamo, which laid some of the groundwork for  Texans' eventual victory.   On February 24 of that year, with his position under siege, an  important figure named William Barret Travis wrote a letter, which I  would like to read. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Texas Army, and  during the battle, his fellow soldiers were outnumbered nearly 10 to 1  by the forces of the Mexican dictator Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. Here  in the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats have had the honor of  reading the fabled Travis letter since 1961, when then-Texas Senator  John Tower started that tradition. The letter was addressed ``To the  People of Texas & All Americans in the World.'' Travis wrote:         I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under       Santa Anna--I have sustained a continual Bombardment &       cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man--The enemy has       demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison       are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken--I have       answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still       waves proudly from the walls--I shall never surrender or       retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of       patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to       come to our aid, with all dispatch--The enemy is receiving       reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or       four thousand in four or five days. If this call is       neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as       possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due       to his own honor & that of his country--Victory or Death.    Signed, ``William Barret Travis.''   What a letter it is. It is a reminder for all of us that the 189  defenders of the Alamo lost their lives, but they did not die in vain.  In fact, Texans wouldn't be around today if it weren't for them.   The Battle of the Alamo bought precious time for the Texas  revolutionaries, allowing General Sam Houston to maneuver his army into  a position for the decisive victory at the Battle of San Jacinto. I  would just note that I am honored to occupy the same Senate seat first  occupied by Sam Houston when he became a U.S. Senator after Texas  became annexed to the United States in 1845.   With that victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, Texas became a  sovereign nation--the Republic of Texas--for 9 years. For 9 years, it  thrived as a separate nation, and then in 1845 it was annexed to the  United States as the 28th State.   Many Texas patriots who fought in the revolution went on to serve in  the U.S. Congress--Sam Houston being one of them. Every single day, I  am honored to have the opportunity to serve 28 million Texans--a chance  I wouldn't have had without the sacrifices made by the brave men like  William Barrett Travis 182 years ago.
