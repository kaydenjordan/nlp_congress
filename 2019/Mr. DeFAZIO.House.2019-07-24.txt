SEC. 412. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON THE NEED FOR A NEW GREAT                     LAKES ICEBREAKER.         (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:        (1) The Great Lakes shipping industry is crucial to the       American economy, including the U.S. manufacturing base,       providing important economic and national security benefits.        (2) A recent study found that the Great Lakes shipping       industry supports 237,000 jobs and tens of billions of       dollars in economic activity.        (3) United States Coast Guard icebreaking capacity is       crucial to full utilization of the Great Lakes shipping       system, as during the winter icebreaking season up to 15       percent of annual cargo loads are delivered and many       industries would have to reduce their production if Coast       Guard icebreaking services were not provided.        (4) Six of the Coast Guard's nine icebreaking cutters in       the Great Lakes are more than 30 years old and are frequently       inoperable during the winter icebreaking season, including       those that have completed a recent service life extension       program.        (5) During the previous 10 winters, Coast Guard Great Lakes       icebreaking cutters have been inoperable for an average of 65       cutter-days during the winter icebreaking season, with this       annual lost capability exceeding 100 cutter-days, with a high       of 246 cutter-days during the winter of 2017-2018.        (6) The 2019 ice season provides further proof that current       Coast Guard icebreaking capacity is inadequate for the needs       of the Great Lakes shipping industry, as only six of the nine       icebreaking cutters are operational and millions of tons of       cargo was not loaded or was delayed due to inadequate Coast       Guard icebreaking assets during a historically average winter       for Great Lakes ice coverage.        (7) The Congress has authorized the Coast Guard to acquire       a new Great Lakes icebreaker as capable as Coast Guard Cutter       MACKINAW (WLBB-30), the most capable Great Lakes icebreaker,       and $10 million has been appropriated to fund the design and       initial acquisition work for this icebreaker.        (8) The Coast Guard has not initiated a new acquisition       program for this Great Lakes icebreaker.        (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress       of the United States that a new Coast Guard icebreaker as       capable as Coast Guard Cutter MACKINAW (WLBB-30) is needed on       the Great Lakes and the Coast Guard should acquire this       icebreaker as soon as possible.

Section 1903(d) of title 14, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (2) through (6) as       paragraphs (3) through (7), respectively; and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:        ``(2) recruitment and retention;''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H.R. 3409, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today and speak in strong support  of H.R. 3409, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2019. This is  genuinely bipartisan legislation which will reauthorize funding for the  United States Coast Guard Federal Maritime Commission for fiscal years  2020 and 2021.   The bill also advances other important provisions to help both the  economic competitiveness and effective regulation of the U.S. maritime  industry.   It is the latest in a long line of major legislation from this  committee, reported to the House on a bipartisan basis and underpinning  essential functions of government such as, in this case, the United  States Coast Guard and the Federal Maritime Commission.   I couldn't have better partners than I had: my ranking member, Sam  Graves; the chair of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime  Transportation, Sean Patrick Maloney; and the ranking subcommittee  member, Representative   Bob Gibbs. They worked hard on this  legislation, and many of their concerns were included in the final  product. Each of them has joined as an original cosponsor, which I  appreciate.   We have also worked with other members of the committee on both sides  of the aisle and the House to include provisions that address concerns  raised by them or their constituents.   We all know that, over the last few years, the Coast Guard budgets  have been inadequate, mostly a byproduct of mandatory cuts imposed by  the so-called Budget Control Act. This inadequate funding has left the  Coast Guard, as Admiral Schultz has said, at a tipping point. This  legislation, at long last, begins to reverse that downward spiral.   Mr. Speaker, there is $11 billion for the Coast Guard's discretionary  budget for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. This tracks the recently  increased appropriations of the last 2 fiscal years and builds in a 2  percent inflation adjustment to arrive at the highest authorized  funding levels for the Coast Guard in recent memory.   Is that totally adequate? No, it isn't. But it is at least  incremental progress in a time where we aren't seeing a lot of progress  on a lot of things these days.   I am particularly please that the top-line numbers for procurement,  acquisitions, and improvement have been pushed up to $2.7 billion and  $2.8 billion. That means the Coast Guard should be able to maintain its  ongoing recapitalization programs, including the critically important  offshore patrol cutter; the new fleet of polar security cutters, which  will be absolutely vital to deal particularly with the opening of the  Northwest Passage; and, also, to continue critical support for our  assets and activities in Antarctica.   It wasn't a great year for the Coast Guard when we had the stupid  government shutdown. They were continuing to carry out their critical  homeland security duties in addition to their daily lifesaving duties  and their drug interdiction duties, many in a high-risk profession, and  yet they weren't being paid.   They were escorting the subs out of Bremerton. The sailors were being  paid on the subs. The Coast Guard, which was providing critical surface  support and protection, was not being paid.   I had originally included in this legislation provisions to assure  that the Coast Guard would be paid in case of another government  shutdown. Unfortunately, the very stupid budget rules we have around  here say that we will pretend that they will never be paid--and if that  is the case, then we won't have a Coast Guard anymore--therefore, to  mandatorily pay them during a shutdown would count as new deficit, like  we are never going to pay them.   It is a pretty dumb rule, but those concerns were raised by people  above my pay grade, and I reluctantly removed the provision from the  bill. I am going to continue to push for that provision as we move  forward through the appropriations process and elsewhere. I will look  for any opportunity I can to recognize the service of the Coast Guard.   There is also, in this bill, a modest $1.4 million increase in the  budget of the Federal Maritime Commission. This will help them  implement the most extensive package of amendments to the Ocean  Shipping Reform Act since 1998, particularly looking at antitrust  oversight of foreign-flag commercial carrier alliances that transport  nearly 98 percent of U.S. foreign commerce.    Our overreliance on foreign-flag carriers to move the commerce of the  United States is a growing liability and, yet, unintended consequence  of our trade policies. Only now are we beginning to recognize and  grapple with the implications of this dependence on our national and  economic security.   The increased authorized funding of $29 million for the operating  budget should provide them with the additional resources they need to  actually be a cop on the beat and ensure foreign carriers abide by fair  shipping practices and compliance with all U.S. antitrust requirements.   I am also pleased with provisions that would boost coastwise trades  and, potentially, our shipbuilding industry.   We are reaffirming, yet again, long-term support for the Jones Act,  including clarifications as to how the Jones Act applies to maritime  transportation and heavy-lift activities that occur offshore.   I believe the language in this bill strikes a sensible path forward.  I look forward to resolving any outstanding questions and concerns in  conference with the United States Senate.   Just as important, the bill provides new authorities to address new  or emerging ocean technologies, including unmanned systems, to ensure  Coast Guard has enough competence to either use, or regulate the use  of, said systems; amendments to build on progress made last Congress to  improve maritime safety requirements; and it strengthens standards to  prevent discrimination, sexual assault and harassment and promote  gender equity in the Coast Guard at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy  and across the U.S. maritime industry.   This is vital legislation to the Coast Guard, and the maritime  shipyard workers across this country.   Again, I want to thank my colleagues.  [[Page H7285]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                      Washington, DC, July 16, 2019.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Defazio: I write to you regarding H.R. 3409,       the ``Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2019.''        H.R. 3409 contains provisions that fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security. I       recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House in an expeditious manner and,       accordingly, I will not seek a sequential referral of the       bill. However, agreeing to waive consideration of this bill       should not be construed as the Committee on Homeland Security       waiving, altering, or otherwise affecting its jurisdiction       over subject matters contained in the bill which fall within       its Rule X jurisdiction.        Further, I request your support for the appointment of       Homeland Security conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this or similar legislation. I also       ask that a copy of this letter and your response be included       in the legislative report on H.R. 3409 and in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.        I look forward to working with you as we prepare to pass       this important legislation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                     Washington, DC, July 17, 2019.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, U.S. House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 3409, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2019, which       was ordered to be reported out of the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure on June 26, 2019. I       appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation.        I acknowledge that by foregoing a sequential referral on       H.R. 3409, the Committee on Homeland Security does not waive       any future jurisdictional claims to provisions in this or       similar legislation. In addition, should a conference on the       bill be necessary, I would support your effort to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving provisions within this       legislation on which the Committee on Homeland Security has a       valid jurisdictional claim.        I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation,       and I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R.       3409.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Mucarsel-Powell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), who is the chairman of the  Committee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Van Drew).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just expanding a little bit on the former speaker,  Representative Graves of Louisiana, I would recommend to people the  video that became available last week of the Coast Guard boarding a  semisubmersible smuggling drugs. It is an extraordinary video and  extraordinary and precarious undertaking by the Coast Guard, jumping  from a Zodiac onto the top of this vessel, pounding on the hatch to get  the people to open the hatch and surrender.   Again, just reiterating what I said earlier, what they do with drug  interdiction far exceeds all of the other Federal agencies combined,  and yet they weren't paid during the shutdown doing these dangerous  activities, and what they do for Homeland Security, what they do on a  daily basis to provide search and rescue activities, keep our mariners  safe and maritime safety inspections.   So again, I regret that the technicalities around here didn't allow  us to move forward at this time, but I am determined that we will do  that.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to raise another issue, and I would hope  that the Coast Guard is listening.   I am very concerned. The largest acquisition program--I mentioned  earlier about the acquisition budget for recapitalization--is the  Offshore Patrol Cutter. Twice now, Representatives and Senators from  Florida have attempted to end-run the contracting process. They have a  shipyard that claims, that because of the hurricane, they didn't  underbid the contract.   No, no, no. They didn't. They didn't. But they need hundreds of  millions of dollars more to do the contract without going through a  bidding process, without any scrutiny, and without any information  being provided to this committee justifying those increases.   In fact, they are saying: Well, we can't get workers because of the  hurricane; it is just impossible. Well, we are rebuilding Tyndall Air  Force Base. Armed Services hasn't heard anything about that.   And then, also, they say: Well, it is going to take 1.3 million more  man-hours.   Well, what does that have to do with not being able to get skilled  labor? The allegations by some others in the industry are that they  underbid the contract, and now they are trying to come up with a  rationale.   It is further disturbing that a former Commandant of the Coast Guard  runs this organization. And I am very concerned that the Coast Guard is  now contemplating asking Homeland Security to invoke a law they have  never used before, claiming national security to renegotiate between  the current Commandant of the Coast Guard and the past Commandant of  the Coast Guard running this shipyard the terms of this contract.   That is not right. It doesn't protect the taxpayers. It doesn't  protect the contracting process. I am going to be pushing very, very  hard on this issue.   That said, there are many meritorious things in this bill, and I will  yield back the balance of my time after recommending a unanimous vote  by the House of Representatives. Hopefully, the Senate won't take 1\1/ 2\ years to get the bill done this time, so actually it will be a 2- year authorization instead of a 2-year/1-year authorization.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1984) to amend chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code,  to require the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to  annually submit to Congress a report on all disaster-related assistance  provided by the Federal Government.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.  [[Page H7288]]    The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1984         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Disclosing Aid Spent to       Ensure Relief Act'' or the ``DISASTER Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) At a time of constrained budgets, it is fiscally       prudent to understand the amount and the scope of the Federal       Government's involvement in providing disaster-related       assistance to communities in need.        (2) The Federal Government does not provide a single,       publicly available estimate of the amount it is spending on       disaster-related assistance.        (3) Because recovery is a long-term process, providing       disaster-related assistance requires significant Federal       resources to support a multi-agency, multi-year restoration       of infrastructure and commerce in affected communities.        (4) Understanding the expenditures of individual Federal       agencies for disaster-related assistance will help better       inform the congressional appropriations process, as well as       presidential budget requests.        (5) Knowledge about disaster-related expenses will       illustrate opportunities for reducing these expenses through       efforts to reduce vulnerabilities to future natural       disasters.       SEC. 3. PURPOSE.         The purpose of this Act is to require the Director of the       Office of Management and Budget to annually submit to       Congress a report on all disaster-related assistance provided       by the Federal Government.       SEC. 4. REPORTING OF DISASTER-RELATED ASSISTANCE.         (a) In General.--Chapter 11 of title 31, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new       section:       ``Sec. 1127. Reporting of disaster-related assistance         ``(a) In General.--On the same day that the President makes       the annual budget submission to the Congress under section       1105(a) for a fiscal year, the Director of the Office of       Management and Budget shall submit to Congress a report on       Federal disaster-related assistance for the fiscal year       ending in the calendar year immediately preceding the       calendar year in which the annual budget submission is made.       Disaster-related assistance encompasses Federal obligations       related to disaster response, recovery, and mitigation       efforts, as well as administrative costs associated with       these activities, including spending by the following       agencies and programs:        ``(1) Department of Agriculture:        ``(A) Agriculture Research Service.        ``(B) Farm Service Agency.        ``(C) Food and Nutrition Service.        ``(D) Natural Resource Conservation Service.        ``(E) Forest Service.        ``(F) Rural Housing Service.        ``(G) Rural Utilities Service.        ``(2) Department of Commerce:        ``(A) National Marine Fisheries Service of the National       Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.        ``(B) Economic Development Administration Economic       Adjustment Assistance.        ``(3) Army Corps of Engineers of the Department of Defense       (Civil).        ``(4) Department of Defense (Military):        ``(A) Military Personnel.        ``(B) Operations and Maintenance.        ``(C) Procurement.        ``(D) Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation.        ``(E) Military Construction (MILCON) and Family Housing.        ``(F) Management Funds.        ``(G) Other Department of Defense Programs.        ``(5) Department of Education:        ``(A) Elementary and Secondary Education.        ``(B) Higher Education.        ``(6) Department of Health and Human Services:        ``(A) Administration for Children and Families.        ``(B) Public Health and Medical Assistance.        ``(C) Public Health Emergency Fund.        ``(7) Department of Homeland Security:        ``(A) Federal Emergency Management Agency:        ``(i) Emergency Declarations.        ``(ii) Fire Management Assistance Grants.        ``(iii) Major Disaster Declarations.        ``(iv) Administrative Assistance.        ``(B) FEMA Missions Assignments by Federal Agency.        ``(C) Community Disaster Loan Program.        ``(8) Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD):        ``(A) Community Development Block Grants.        ``(B) Rental Assistance/Section 8 Vouchers.        ``(C) Supportive Housing.        ``(D) Public Housing Repair.        ``(E) Inspector General.        ``(9) Department of the Interior:        ``(A) Bureau of Indian Affairs.        ``(B) United States Fish and Wildlife Service.        ``(C) National Park Service.        ``(D) Wildland Fire Management.        ``(10) Department of Justice:        ``(A) Legal Activities.        ``(B) United States Marshals Service.        ``(C) Federal Bureau of Investigation.        ``(D) Drug Enforcement Administration.        ``(E) Bureau of Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.        ``(F) Federal Prison System (Bureau of Prisons).        ``(G) Office of Justice Programs.        ``(11) Department of Labor:        ``(A) National Emergency Grants for Dislocation Events.        ``(B) Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Dislocated Worker       Program.        ``(12) Department of Transportation:        ``(A) Federal Highway Administration: Emergency Relief       Program (ER).        ``(B) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).        ``(C) Federal Transit Administration (FTA).        ``(13) Department of the Treasury: Internal Revenue       Service.        ``(14) Department of Veterans Affairs.        ``(15) Corporation for National and Community Service.        ``(16) Environmental Protection Agency:        ``(A) Hurricane Emergency Response Authorities.        ``(B) EPA Hurricane Response.        ``(C) EPA Regular Appropriations.        ``(17) The Federal Judiciary.        ``(18) Disaster Assistance Program of the Small Business       Administration.        ``(19) Department of Energy:        ``(A) Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and       Emergency Response.        ``(B) Office of Petroleum Services.        ``(20) General Services Administration.        ``(21) Other authorities as appropriate.        ``(b) Content.--The report shall detail the following:        ``(1) Overall amount of disaster-related assistance       obligations during the fiscal year.        ``(2) Disaster-related assistance obligations by agency and       account.        ``(3) Disaster for which the spending was obligated.        ``(4) Obligations by disaster.        ``(5) Disaster-related assistance by disaster type.        ``(6) Response and recovery spending.        ``(7) Mitigation spending.        ``(8) Spending in the form of loans.        ``(9) Spending in the form of grants.        ``(c) Availability of Report.--The report shall be made       publicly available on the website of the Office of Management       and Budget and should be searchable, sortable and       downloadable.''.        (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of chapters for       chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following new item:  ``1127. Reporting of disaster-related assistance.''.       SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.         The reporting requirement under the amendment made by       section 3(a) shall take effect with the budget submission of       the President under section 1105(a) of title 31, United       States Code, for fiscal year 2022.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1984.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1984, the Disclosing Aid Spent  to Ensure Relief, or DISASTER Act, introduced by the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters).   In 2018 alone, there were 14 natural disasters that each resulted in  more than $1 billion in losses. Already in 2019, the President has  granted over 50 major disaster emergency or fire management  declarations under the authorities of the Stafford Act.   While insurance partially covers the cost of disaster recovery, the  Federal Government, along with State, local, Tribal, and territorial  partners, is spending billions of dollars annually to respond to and  recover from these events across more than three dozen departments and  agencies. That results in the fact that there is no clear and  consolidated information regarding Federal spending on disasters.   The DISASTER Act would change that by requiring the Office of  Management and Budget to annually compile and publicly release a report  on disaster-related spending across the Federal Government.   I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters) for introducing  this bill so that we can obtain, in the future, this vital consolidated  information and have it also be available to taxpayers of the United  States.  [[Page H7289]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this commonsense measure.  It will do more to shed light on how limited taxpayer resources are  being spent. Doing so will help better inform how we prioritize  policies and spending to drive down disaster-related expenditures in  the future and more effectively provide relief.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill. I urge my colleagues to  join me in support, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters), the author of this excellent legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this excellent  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3245) to transfer a bridge over the Wabash River to the New  Harmony River Bridge Authority and the New Harmony and Wabash River  Bridge Authority, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3245         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Restore the Harmony Way       Bridge Act''.       SEC. 2. TRANSFER OF BRIDGE AND LAND.         Notwithstanding any provision of the Act of April 12, 1941       (55 Stat. 140, chapter 71), not later than 180 days after the       date of enactment of this Act, the White County Bridge       Commission shall convey, without consideration, to the New       Harmony River Bridge Authority and the New Harmony and Wabash       River Bridge Authority, any and all right, title, and       interest of such Commission in and to the bridge across the       Wabash River at or near New Harmony, Indiana, in the       approaches thereto, and in land underneath or adjacent to       such bridge and its approaches.       SEC. 3. REPEAL.         The Act of April 12, 1941 (55 Stat. 140, chapter 71) is       repealed effective on the date that the White County Bridge       Commission completes the conveyance described in section 2.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3245.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3245, introduced by the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).   The legislation is very similar to a bill, H.R. 6793, which passed  the House by unanimous consent during the 115th Congress but failed to  achieve the consideration of the United States Senate.   H.R. 3245 conveys the Harmony Way Bridge to the New Harmony River  Bridge Authority in Illinois and the New Harmony and Wabash River  Bridge Authority in Indiana.   The bridge currently remains owned by the Federal Government under  the White County Bridge Commission, but the commission is no longer  active.   The bridge, which was constructed in 1930, connects White County,  Illinois, with Posey County, Indiana, across the Wabash River. It was  placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 but has been  closed since 2012 when an engineer's inspection discovered structural  integrity issues, which made the bridge unsafe for vehicular traffic.   This legislation allows the States of Indiana and Illinois to jointly  work together to restore the Harmony Way Bridge and determine the  future of this historic landmark.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I urge that the House do support and pass this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1307) to provide for an online repository for certain  reporting requirements for recipients of Federal disaster assistance,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1307         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Post-Disaster Assistance       Online Accountability Act''.       SEC. 2. SUBPAGE FOR TRANSPARENCY OF DISASTER ASSISTANCE.         (a) Establishment of Repository for Reporting       Requirements.--The Director of the Office of Management and       Budget, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury       and the head of each covered Federal agency, shall establish       a subpage within the website established under section 2 of       the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of       2006 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note) to publish the information       required to be made available to the public under this       section.        (b) Submission of Information by Federal Agencies.--Not       later than 30 days after the end of a calendar quarter, each       covered Federal agency that made disaster assistance       available to an eligible recipient during such quarter shall,       in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management       and Budget, make available to the public on the subpage       established under subsection (a) the information described in       subsection (c), and ensure that any data asset of the agency       is machine-readable.        (c) Information Required.--The information described in       this subsection is, with respect to disaster assistance       provided by the covered Federal agency--        (1) the total amount of disaster assistance provided by the       agency during such quarter;        (2) the amount of disaster assistance provided by the       agency that was expended or obligated to projects or       activities; and        (3) a detailed list of all projects or activities for which       disaster assistance dispersed by the agency was expended,       obligated, or used, including--        (A) the name of the project or activity;        (B) a description of the project or activity;        (C) an evaluation of the completion status of the project       or activity;        (D) any award identification number assigned to the       project;        (E) the Catalog for Disaster Assistance number assigned by       the Federal Emergency Management Agency;        (F) the location of the project, including ZIP codes; and        (G) any reporting requirement information being collected       by a covered Federal agency with respect to that agency's       disaster assistance.        (d) Guidance.--Each covered Federal agency, in coordination       with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and       the Secretary of the Treasury, shall issue such guidance as       is necessary to meet the requirements of this Act.        (e) Agreement With Private Entity.--The Director, if       necessary for purposes of transparency, may enter into an       agreement with a private entity, including a nonprofit       organization, to develop the subpage required under this       section.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act, the following definitions apply:        (1) Covered federal agency.--The term ``covered Federal       agency'' means--        (A) any agency providing assistance under the Robert T.       Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42       U.S.C. 5121 et seq.);        (B) the Small Business Administration; and        (C) the Department of Housing and Urban Development.        (2) Disaster assistance.--The term ``disaster assistance''       means any funds that are made available by the Federal       Government in response to a specified natural disaster,       including--        (A) any assistance provided by the Administrator of the       Small Business Administration as a result of a disaster       declared under section 7(b) of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 636(b));        (B) any assistance provided by the Secretary of Housing and       Urban Development for--        (i) activities authorized under title I of the Housing and       Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.)       related to disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration       of infrastructure and housing, and economic revitalization in       the most impacted and distressed areas resulting from a major       disaster declared pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster       Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.);       and        (ii) flood insurance coverage provided under the National       Flood Insurance Program pursuant to the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.); and        (C) any assistance provided under the Robert T. Stafford       Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121       et seq.).        (3) Eligible recipient.--The term ``eligible recipient''--  [[Page H7292]]         (A) means any entity that receives disaster assistance       directly from the Federal Government (including disaster       assistance received through grant, loan, or contract) other       than an individual; and        (B) includes a State that receives disaster assistance.        (4) Specified natural disaster.--The term ``specified       natural disaster'' means--        (A) a fire on public or private forest land or grassland       described in section 420 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster       Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5187);        (B) a major disaster declared by the President under       section 401 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 5170);        (C) an emergency declared by the President under section       501 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 5191); and        (D) any other natural disaster for which a disaster       declaration is made by the Federal Government.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1307.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1307, the Post-Disaster  Assistance Online Accountability Act, introduced by the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Meadows).   When a major disaster strikes, the American people should know how  and where their disaster funds are spent without wading through reams  of inscrutable government paperwork.   H.R. 1307 would simplify the data collection process for Federal  disaster recovery projects and activities by establishing an online  repository to which agencies could submit information on projects and  spending.   In order to increase transparency to the public, the bill would also  create a page on USASpending.gov for the public to track agency  disaster recovery activities and the amount of assistance expended, on  a quarterly basis.                                time  1415    Federal agencies need to be accountable to the victims of disasters  so that they can have peace of mind when they are at their most  vulnerable.   I strongly support the bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri. He has been a great  partner in these and other ongoing efforts by the committee.   I urge the positive adoption of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a  cosponsor to H.R. 1307--the Post-Disaster Assistance Online  Accountability Act, which establishes a centralized location where  Federal Agencies will publish information on disaster assistance.   This legislation requires reports every 3 months, that are available  to the public regarding the total amount of assistance provided by  agencies, the amount of funding that obligated, and where the funds are  going, including all projects or activities that received funding.   To date, roughly 32 percent, or $13.6 billion, of all funding, $42  billion dollars, Congress has appropriated to Puerto Rico has actually  been received by the communities and families who are trying to rebuild  their lives on the island.   With this legislation my constituents will know exactly how much  funding is still expected to come to Puerto Rico and to their  communities. They will be able to see the process that agencies are  making for timely dispersals of funding and holding them accountable.   Again, I want to thank Rep. Peters and Ranking Member Meadows again  for their work on this Disaster recovery related bill.
