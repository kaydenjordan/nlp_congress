 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which will  continue operations for several Federal agencies and, importantly,  appropriate funds to be used in securing the southern border.   We have talked for years about securing our border. This is important  for the entire Nation. My perspective comes from representing a  district hard-hit with the opioid epidemic. Mexico and the United  States have a mutual interest in securing our border.   Heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamines, and other narcotics flow  northbound while, importantly, illicit cash is flowing southbound. This  illicit cash is fueling a reign of terror by Mexican drug cartels that  have murdered more than 200,000 Mexico citizens over the last 10 years,  and only 5 percent of them have been prosecuted.   They have killed priests. They have killed journalists. They have  killed students. And they have killed each other. There are mass graves  all over Mexico.   Mr. Speaker, we need to secure that border for the benefit of both  countries. It is past time we do this, and I ask support for this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, as we approach the holidays, I want to take  a moment to talk about a difficult subject: suicide.   Suicide is epidemic in our Nation. According to the American  Foundation for Suicide Prevention, suicide is currently the tenth  leading cause of death in the United States, ending 48,000 lives in  2017.   For those who are suffering, you need to know you are not alone and  there are many who care about you. There is hope for healing. Every  person was created for a purpose, though it may be difficult at times  for a person to find that purpose.  [[Page H10501]]    One of the most basic, and often most effective, ways to help prevent  suicide is to ensure that our loved ones, friends, colleagues, and  anyone else in our lives feels connected and has a sense of belonging.  There is great virtue in reaching out to the marginalized and  neglected, especially young people who may be lonely or bullied.   For those who are despondent and having suicidal thoughts, services  like the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is vital. The hotline is a  free support service available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week: 1-800- 273-8255, 1-800-273-TALK.   As we enter this season of hope, let those who are hopeless encounter  the encouragement that everyone needs.                            ____________________
