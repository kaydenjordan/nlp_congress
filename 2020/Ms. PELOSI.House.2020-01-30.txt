 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  thank him for his courageous leadership in bringing this important  legislation to the floor.   I commend the two makers of the resolutions, Congresswoman Barbara  Lee and Congressman Ro Khanna for their exceptional leadership, and I  urge a positive vote on this important legislation.   Just to put it in some perspective, as Members of Congress, our first  responsibility is to keep the American people safe, and that includes  both our servicemembers abroad and our families at home. Three weeks  ago, this House honored that duty by passing the War Powers Resolution  to limit the President's military actions regarding Iran.    We all salute Congresswoman Slotkin for her leadership in putting  that forth. Now we are taking additional steps to protect American  lives and values by passing two strong pieces of legislation:  Congresswoman Barbara Lee's legislation to repeal the 2002 Iraq  Authorization for the Use of Military Force, AUMF, and Congressman Ro  Khanna's legislation to prohibit funding for military action against  Iran not authorized by Congress.   We thank them for their longstanding leadership to protect American  lives, and we thank all Members who have worked tirelessly on this  priority, including Congresswoman Eshoo  [[Page H725]]  who had similar legislation in this regard.   Members of Congress continue to have serious, urgent concerns about  the President's decision to engage in hostilities against Iran and  about its lack of strategy moving forward. Let us just stipulate that  we all agree that Iran is a bad actor; that they treat their people  terribly; that they are a menace to the region; and that we have  sanctions against them for their spreading of technologies and other  resources to terrorists in the region.   We don't want them to have a nuclear weapon, and I think that the  President's decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement was wrong,  but that is not on the floor today. What is on the floor today is for  us to, again, honor our constitutional responsibility to protect and  defend--we take that oath--but also to honor our responsibilities, the  power to declare war that is written into the Constitution for the  Congress.   Over time, that has been, shall we say, usurped by administrations,  both Democratic and Republican, and now, to an extent that practically  abrogates whatever is in the Constitution.   This morning a YouGov poll said that 60 percent of the American  people oppose war with Iran and 68 percent want to remove all troops  from Iraq.   There is no appetite for war in our country. I was stunned recently  to be with a delegation in observance of the 75th anniversary of the  end of the victory at the Battle of the Bulge, a very decisive battle  in World War II. There were 19,000 Americans who died in that war.   There were all of the heads of state present, but the VIPs for us  were the veterans who were there; some of them now, 75 years later, in  their 90s, but still vigorous. One of them who spoke for the veterans  talked about the band of brothers and the allies, that there was  multilateralism, and the horrors of war, and the glory of that victory.  But at the end of his speech he said: ``Maybe I shouldn't say this, but  I will. I urge all of you to pray for peace.''   I spoke to him afterward and thanked him for that and he said: ``It  is so important.''   Even our President Kennedy who said that we will fight any foe, pay  any price--what he said in his inaugural address--he has said that  unless men end war, war will end men.   So we have to be very careful about how we engage in protecting the  American people and remove all doubt in anybody's mind that we will.  Think of me as a lioness. If you come near our cubs, you are dead.   So this is not about not understanding our responsibility and our  strength. But as warriors, that gives us even more power to be  peacekeepers. All we are saying is: Let's do this carefully and not in  a way that escalates.   I remember after that weekend I got the call from the administration  confirming that we had made the attack on Soleimani--who was a terrible  person, no doubt about that--and I said: ``Well, why did you not inform  the Gang of Eight as you were required to do?''   That Gang of Eight are the four leaders, House and Senate, Democrats  and Republicans; and the four leaders of the Intelligence Committee,  House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans.   ``Why did you not inform the Gang of Eight?''   And their response was: ``We really had to keep this close.''   You wanted to keep it ``close'' from not honoring your responsibility  of notifying or consulting with the Congress of the United States?   I didn't expect to hear that from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I  did probably expect to hear it from the Secretary of Defense. But that  cannot be the way we proceed. Congress has the constitutional  responsibility.   The administration has a responsibility, too, and we respect that.  And that is why when we redid the War Powers Act it was respectful of  the power of the President, but also the power of the Congress of the  United States.   They failed to appropriately notify the Congress. Then the President  issued an insufficient War Powers Act notification that raised more  questions than it answered, and it was classified in its entirety,  leaving the public in the dark about our national security.   When the President finally briefed Congress, their own party Members  described the briefing as ``insulting and demeaning'' with one GOP  Senator saying it was the ``worst briefing I have ever seen.''   When the President asked me if I agreed with that characterization, I  said: ``There is stiff competition for the worst classified briefing we  have ever seen from this administration.''   And now it appears that the President may have even misled Congress  and the public about the threats facing our troops related to this  conflict. For 2 weeks, the President insisted there were zero injuries  or casualties from Iran's attack on our military bases, contradicting  multiple news reports.   But over the past week, the administration has admitted that there  were injuries, first reporting 11 servicemembers who were diagnosed  with traumatic brain injury, TBI, and then 34 and now 50 of our troops.  TBI, as defined by the National Institutes of Health is: `` . . .  damage to the brain, whether from impact, penetrating objects, blast  waves or rapid movement of the brain within the skull'' and is a  leading cause of death and disability for Americans.   This serious injury is understood in both the military and medical  communities to be the ``signature wound'' and the ``silent epidemic''  of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.                                time  1030    Yet the President minimizes our soldiers' wounds saying:   I heard they had headaches and a couple of other things, but I can  say and I can report it, not very serious.   Not very serious? That is not what the Veterans of Foreign Wars says.   The Veterans of Foreign Wars put out a statement saying they expect  an apology from POTUS. TBI is a serious injury and not one that can be  taken lightly.   Madam Speaker, I include their statement for the Record.                       VFW Expects Apology From POTUS                             [January 24, 2020]         Kansas City, MO.--``In light of today's announcement from       the defense department that 34 U.S. service members suffered       traumatic brain injuries as a result of Iran's retaliatory       strike and President Trump's remarks which minimized these       troops' injuries, the Veterans of Foreign Wars cannot stand       idle on this matter.        TBI is a serious injury and one that cannot be taken       lightly. TBI is known to cause depression, memory loss,       severe headaches, dizziness and fatigue--all injuries that       come with both short- and long-term effects.        The VFW expects an apology from the president to our       service men and women for his misguided remarks. And, we ask       that he and the White House join with us in our efforts to       educate Americans of the dangers TBI has on these heroes as       they protect our great nation in these trying times. Our       warriors require our full support more than ever in this       challenging environment.''--William ``Doc'' Schmitz, VFW       National Commander     Madam Speaker, Americans have a choice: to keep the  American people safe or to enable the administration's dangerous  escalation which is happening again without the consent of Congress or  the knowledge of the public.   We want to see a strategy. What is the purpose? What is the mission?  What is the strategy involved in this?   Madam Speaker, I urge the President to work with Congress to advance  an immediate and effective deescalatory strategy that prevents further  violence.   Our brave servicemen and -women, their families, and all Americans  deserve smart, strong, and strategic action, not the administration's  reckless and rash policies. Therefore, again, I urge our colleagues to  support the Khanna amendment and the Barbara Lee amendment.   I thank them for their leadership. I thank Chairman Engel for the  moderation that he has brought to this, the experience that he has in  terms of war, in terms of peace, and in terms of Congress' role in our  foreign affairs.
