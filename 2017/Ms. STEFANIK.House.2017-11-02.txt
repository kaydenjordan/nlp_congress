 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. This critical healthcare  legislation provides a 5-year extension to the CHIP program that so  many children and low-income families rely on.   In my district alone, over 21,000 children use CHIP for access to  low-cost healthcare services.   I am also proud that this legislation includes a needed 2-year  extension of funding for community health centers. This is an issue I  have worked hard on, as almost 95,000 people in my district receive  critical healthcare and preventative services from these centers.   There is still much more work to do to improve our healthcare system  for families in the north country.   In Congress, I will keep fighting to protect the programs our  district depends on, and I will continue working toward the affordable,  high-quality healthcare system that my district deserves.                            ____________________
