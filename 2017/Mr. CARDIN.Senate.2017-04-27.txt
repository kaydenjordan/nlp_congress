 Mr. President, July 18, 2017, marks the 70th anniversary  of the day that the ship Exodus 1947 arrived in Haifa, Israel.   The story of Exodus 1947 is as important today as it was 70 years  ago. In 1947, the world was horrified and outraged by the British  policy of violently preventing Holocaust survivors from reaching  Palestine and forcing their return to Europe and refugee camps in  Germany. Watching the British Navy ram the Exodus 1947, which had 4,515  Holocaust survivors on board, inflamed world opinion and prompted the  United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, UNSCOP, to scrutinize  the actions of the British. Eventually the British were forced to end  their policy of preventing Jewish immigration to Israel, and the State  of Israel was born.   Why is the story of the Exodus 1947 so important that we are still  talking about it 70 years later? After all, geopolitical transitions  have launched multiple large-scale refugee migrations around the world  in the 20th century, including Armenians in 1915, Russians in 1917,  Chinese in 1949, Hindus from Pakistan and Muslims from India in 1947,  East Germans between 1945 and 1961, Bosnians in the 1990s, Rwandans in  1994, Syrians in 2016--and many more.   The story of the Exodus 1947 is important to remember and consider  today because it reminds us of our responsibility to protect human  rights, help people outside of our own borders, stand up for Americans  values, and work with our allies and international organizations to  advance our goals. It reminds us that our work is not finished. It  reminds us that, while it was the Jews on the Exodus 1947 70 years ago,  political outrages around the world continue to require our leadership  and our action.   As a U.S. Senator from Maryland and vigilant friend of the Chesapeake  Bay and Maryland's Maritime history, I would like to highlight the fact  that, prior to its service in support of Jewish refugees from the  Holocaust, the Exodus 1947 was called the President Warfield and it  sailed the Chesapeake Bay for the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. The  President Warfield changed hands many times, from the Baltimore Steam  Packet Company to the British Navy to the U.S. Navy to the Potomac  Shipwrecking Company, which was actually acting as clandestine  purchasing agents of the Haganah who wanted the  [[Page S2609]]  ship because the conditions that made it ideal for navigating the  Chesapeake Bay, shifting sand of 3 feet or less in depth, made it ideal  for getting immigrants quickly and closely up to the coastal areas of  Palestine.   After the Haganah secured the ship, she was retrofitted in Baltimore  from where she sailed towards France to pick up 4,515 Holocaust the  refugees and deposit them in Palestine--a plan which was destroyed  after the British rammed the ship, prevented the refugees from  disembarking in Palestine, detained them in inhumane conditions, and  eventually returned them to Germany.   The world witnessed the inhumane treatment of the Exodus's passengers  and some righteous people cried out. We continue to talk about the  Exodus 1947 to remind ourselves never to forget both our suffering and  our empowerment.   I would like to acknowledge all who have made the creation of this  memorial possible. Along with a series of associated commemorative  projects, the Exodus 1947 memorial is the culmination of decades of  tireless effort by the Jewish American Society for Historic  Preservation, JASHP, to recognize the historic events that led to the  formation of Israel. In particular, I applaud the work of Dr. Barry S.  Lever, chairman of the 50th Anniversary Commemoration of the Final  Voyage of the SS President Warfied--Exodus 1947, the Jewish Museum of  Maryland, the Chesapeake Bay Museum, and the individuals and  organizations here and abroad who have aided in the efforts to honor  the Exodus 1947 and its passengers.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to introduce the Medicare Home  Health Flexibility Act of 2017. I am pleased that my colleague, the  senior Senator from Nevada, Mr. Heller, has agreed to cosponsor this  bipartisan, no-cost legislation that would allow occupational  therapists to perform the initial home health assessment visit and  comprehensive assessments in cases in  [[Page S2620]]  which occupational therapy is ordered by the physician, along with  speech language pathology and/or physical therapy services, and skilled  nursing care is not required. Our bill will help ensure that Medicare  beneficiaries receive timely access to essential home health therapy  care.   Occupational therapists have long been recognized as a valuable  component of our Nation's healthcare workforce and a critical aspect of  home healthcare because of their focus on patients' functional  capabilities and their expertise in home safety. Physicians frequently  order occupational therapy as part of an initial plan of care for  patients requiring home health care, alongside the qualifying services  of physical therapy, speech-language pathology, and skilled nursing.  Under certain circumstances, an occupational therapist is allowed to  perform the comprehensive assessment to determine a Medicare  beneficiary's continuing need for home healthcare. However, under  current Medicare law, occupational therapists are not permitted to  conduct the initial assessment for home health cases, even when  occupational therapy is included in the physician's order and when the  case is exclusively related to rehabilitation therapy. Additionally,  occupational therapists are not allowed to complete the comprehensive  assessment unless occupational therapy is the qualifying service.   By permitting occupational therapists to perform initial home health  assessment visits and comprehensive assessments in limited  circumstances, the Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act can help  prevent delays in the time it takes for Medicare beneficiaries to  receive essential home healthcare, especially in underserved areas  where access to physical therapists and speech language pathologists  may be limited. On January 13, 2017, the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services, or CMS, released the final conditions of  participation, or COPs, for home health agencies participating in  Medicare and Medicaid. These new COPs expand the content of the home  health comprehensive assessment to include the patient's functional,  psychosocial, and cognitive status, all of which are areas of expertise  for occupational therapists. The new COPs also require the creation of  a patient-centered plan of care that is informed by the comprehensive  assessment. As a result of their comprehensive education and unique  training, occupational therapists are qualified to perform the  necessary assessments to adhere to these new CMS home health  guidelines.   It is important to note that the Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act  would apply only to rehabilitation therapy cases in which skilled  nursing care is not required. Nurses would still be required to conduct  the initial assessment for all home health cases in which skilled  nursing care is ordered by the physician. Also, although the  legislation would allow occupational therapists to conduct the initial  home health assessment visit and comprehensive assessments, it would  not alter the existing criteria for establishing eligibility for the  Medicare home health benefit.   I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Heller and to support the  Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act to correct the discrepancy in  Medicare regulations between therapy providers and to help ensure  timely access to essential, high-quality home health therapy care for  Medicare beneficiaries.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 977         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Home Health       Flexibility Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2.

(a) In General.--Notwithstanding section 484.55(a)(2) or       484.55(b)(3) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, or any       other provision of law, an occupational therapist may be       designated to conduct the initial assessment visit and to       complete the comprehensive assessment for an individual who       is eligible for home health services under title XVIII of the       Social Security Act if the referral order by the physician--        (1) does not include skilled nursing care;        (2) includes occupation therapy; and        (3) includes physical therapy or speech language pathology.        (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in subsection (a) shall       be construed to provide for initial eligibility for coverage       of home health services under title XVIII of the Social       Security Act solely on the basis of a need for occupational       therapy.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 983.
