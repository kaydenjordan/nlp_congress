 Mr. Speaker, this bill is historic because it buries the  myth that the cause of childhood poverty is a lack of character, or a  lack of hard work, or a lack of love. The bill affirms the simple truth  that the cause of poverty is a lack of income to cover basic  necessities.   No child in America should be deprived of food, of medicine, of  clothing, or of education because of the accident of birth. That is  what this bill stands for. It represents and marks an ideological  revolution on behalf of justice.
