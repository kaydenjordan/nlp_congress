 Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate learned that its  quiet persuader will be leaving us after a long and distinguished  career. Senator Thad Cochran's retirement will mark the end of a tenure  defined by steady, honorable leadership.   Since the day he arrived in this Chamber, Thad's focus has been  squarely on serving the people of Mississippi with integrity. For  nearly four decades, he has done exactly that, and he has earned the  admiration and gratitude of countless friends and colleagues along the  way.   Those of us here today are proud to have had the privilege of working  with Senator Cochran. His expertise as chairman of the Appropriations  Committee will be sorely missed. So too will be the collegiality,  warmth, and grace that is so characteristic of the senior Senator from  Mississippi.   But the Senate's loss is Thad's family's gain. As we say our  farewells over the next few weeks, I know all of our colleagues will  join me in wishing him every happiness in his next chapter.   Mr. President, on another matter, the Senate will vote today to begin  consideration of S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and  Consumer Protection Act.   This bill recognizes a simple truth: Small community banks and Main  Street credit unions are not the same as the multitrillion-dollar banks  on Wall Street. It is a simple enough observation, I might add, but, at  present, our laws fail to account for it.   Since Washington imposed the Dodd-Frank financial regulations back in  2010, small-scale lenders have been subjected to a litany of new  regulatory, compliance, and examiner demands that were designed with  the country's largest banks in mind. Dodd-Frank's enormous regulatory  burden has been inefficient and unhelpful for financial institutions of  all sizes, but it has hit Main Street lenders especially hard.   Many small banks have had to hire additional staff and expend  additional resources solely to deal with the staggering compliance  burden. According to a survey conducted last year, community bank  compliance costs have risen to an average of 24 percent of net income.  Let me say that again. Community bank compliance costs have  [[Page S1344]]  risen to an average of 24 percent of net income.   This regulatory burden crowds out the capital that is available to  American families and small businesses, especially in rural  communities. According to researchers at the Harvard Kennedy School,  community banks provide over 50 percent of all small business loans and  nearly 80 percent of agricultural loans. In Kentucky, for example,  there are more than 100 community banks and more than 20 credit unions.  Many of them are the only financial institutions that are present in  rural and underserved communities.   But while Dodd-Frank supposedly took aim at too big to fail, in the  first 4 years after it passed, the share of U.S. deposits in small  banks shrunk by nearly a quarter. Deposits in small banks shrunk by a  quarter in the first 4 years of Dodd-Frank. That means less access to  capital for young couples who are looking to purchase their first home,  less credit for aspiring small business owners who need help in turning  dreams into reality, and fewer options for farmers and ranchers who are  hoping to expand.   The bill before us this week will continue to unwind the damage  caused by an administration and Democrat-run Congress that kept its  foot firmly on the brake of the American economy. This is a modest but  critical bill. By streamlining regulations, it will bring relief to the  small financial institutions that have been hurt by Dodd-Frank's one- size-fits-all approach.   In a certain respect, this bill is a perfect complement to tax  reform--further expanding opportunities for American families,  communities, and small businesses. It is the product of years of work  and a robust committee process. It is also a truly bipartisan bill,  cosponsored by an equal number of Republicans and Democrats or  Independents. Senators had and still have a wide diversity of views on  Dodd-Frank, but there is a widening agreement that we should not  continue allowing this unintended consequence to wreak havoc on  community banks and small credit unions. I hope that soon we can turn  that consensus into law.                                  Tax Reform    Mr. President, on one final matter, every day we hear more ways that  tax reform is immediately helping American workers, job creators, and  middle-class families across our country, but this generational reform  was not designed to be a flash in the pan. We are already seeing ways  it will continue to benefit hard-working Americans even decades down  the road.   Along with bonuses and wage increases, many of the 400-plus companies  that have announced enhanced employee benefits are also significantly  expanding their contributions to workers' retirement savings accounts.   In recent years, tight budgets have forced too many families to forgo  investing for the future in order to cover today's expenses. Recent  estimates suggest that two-thirds of Americans do not contribute to a  401(k). A lack of retirement savings can seem like an abstract concept  for young workers, but for some senior citizens, it becomes a harsh  reality. While the poverty rate for Americans under 65 has decreased  since 2015, it has increased among those 65 and older.   Tax reform is already helping remedy a part of the problem. Many  companies and small businesses alike have announced plans to reinvest  tax reform savings in their employees' retirement accounts. Cigna is  adding $30 million to its employee 401(k) program. Aflac is doubling  its 401(k) match for its 10,000 employees. In Kentucky, workers will  benefit from increased or accelerated retirement contributions by major  employers such as UPS, Brown-Forman, Anthem, and FedEx.   As employers of all sizes continue following suit, more American  families will have more flexibility as they plan for the future. At the  same time, of course, lower tax rates are increasing take-home pay,  making it a little easier to cover today's expenses. More money in  workers' pockets for today and more money in their retirement plans for  tomorrow--all thanks to tax reform.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Wednesday, March 7; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed. Finally, I ask that  following leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion  to proceed to S. 2155.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Portman and  our Democratic colleagues.
