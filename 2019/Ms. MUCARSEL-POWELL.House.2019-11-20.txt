 Mr. Speaker, today we recognize Latina Equal Pay  Day. I want to start by emphasizing that the gender pay gap is real,  and it hurts Latina women and families.   We know that Latinas make only 54 cents for every dollar that a White  non-Hispanic male makes for doing the same job. Let that sink in for  just one moment. In 2019, Latina women get paid 54 cents for every  dollar a non-Hispanic man makes for the same work.   In fact, a Latina must work an additional 35 years to catch up to the  earnings of a 60-year-old man, averaging to about $1.1 million in loss  of earnings during a 40-year career. Continuing to ignore this  disparity has repercussions in many aspects of our economy, and it  leaves over 40 percent of families that are headed by a Latina in  poverty.   We must find a way to close the wage for the sake of our mothers, our  sisters, our daughters, and our families.                            ____________________
