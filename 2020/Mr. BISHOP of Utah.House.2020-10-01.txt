 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from  the Speaker's desk S. 886 entitled the Indian Water Rights Settlement  Extension Act, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.    Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, since the minority leader is  supportive, or I wouldn't be here, and I am the ranking member and I am  supportive of it, and the Navajo Nation has been told. The chairman of  the committee is in support of it, does that not constitute the  clearance guidelines that would allow the Speaker to entertain the  motion?    Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, does that clearance have to be in  the form of a written statement to the Chair?    Mr. Speaker, one final parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, is the Speaker telling me that if  the Republicans have cleared this bill and are in favor of it, it has  to have a written clearance from the Democrat side more than simply  verbal commitment to the Tribes?    Mr. Speaker, did you tell me the form the  clearance has to have? In what form must it be?    Mr. Speaker, thank you for your enlightenment.                            ____________________
