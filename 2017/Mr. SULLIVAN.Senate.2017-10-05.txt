 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, nearly every week I have been coming  down to the Senate floor to recognize someone in my State who has made  a difference for Alaska and really has made a difference for all  Americans. It is my favorite part of the week to actually come down and  talk about Alaska to my colleagues in the Senate, to the folks in the  Gallery, to the press, and to the American people watching. It is what  I refer to as our time to talk about the Alaskan of the Week.   Many watching and on the floor and those who have visited our great  State know that Alaskans think it is the most beautiful place in the  world. There are natural wonders everywhere. We had a beautiful summer.  We have resilient, warm-hearted, fiercely independent but accepting  people. We have challenges in Alaska just like the rest of the country,  but at the heart of our State are kind, generous people full of  different cultures and backgrounds that we celebrate.   Most people don't know this about Anchorage, AK: My hometown is  probably the most culturally and ethnically diverse city in the  country. We have places of worship all over the city and the State that  reflect that great diversity of Alaska and America.   One of the stalwarts of our faith community for the past 47 years has  been Pastor Alonzo Patterson of the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church,  and he is our Alaskan of the week. Every Sunday he fills his church  with spirit, joy, and gospel music punctuated by ``amens'' that float  through the church, down the street, and work their way into our  community and into our hearts. That is what he has been doing for 47  years. For decades, those sermons have inspired countless Alaskans to  help feed the hungry, provide homes for those without, and strive to  create a more just country, State, and society, and a more just  community.   Let me tell you a little bit about Pastor Patterson. He was born in  Wilson, LA, and raised in New Orleans. Like a lot of Alaskans,  thousands of Alaskans, he joined the military and made his way up to  Fairbanks, AK, in the 1960s, where he founded the Corinthian Baptist  Church, and he ministered to the congregation there. Then, in 1970, he  was called to Shiloh, one of the few African-American churches in  Anchorage. He designed and rebuilt Shiloh at its current location, and  under his leadership, Shiloh's membership, its facilities, and its  energy took off.   He has conducted thousands of marriages and baptisms. He has given  thousands of eulogies, celebrated graduations and anniversaries,  counseled countless couples, people who are grieving, people who are  rejoicing, people who are suffering, and he has helped turn that into  action--not just for the African-American community but for all people  and all races in our community and in our State.   Pastor Patterson told a reporter:         The church was and always has been a sanctuary in the Black       community. It is the meeting place, the community center, the       focus for support and help, the place you come to be       important, the psychologist for your particular problem, the       time to shout out your frustrations and the only place to be       significant.    He continued:         You could be a Deacon or something in the church where in       the rest of the community you were just another Black person.       The church was for us a panacea for many of the social ills       that existed then and still have relevance.    That is what he talked about. That is his heart and soul, how he saw  his church and congregation. Thanks to Pastor Patterson and Shiloh, the  city is a more inclusive place for all. He has helped heal those social  ills for thousands of our fellow Alaskans.   One of his friends, Celeste Hodge Growden, a member of the church,  said:         He and the church have led the way for a lot of things that       have been accomplished here [in Anchorage]. Pastor Patterson       always says, ``leaders lead.'' That is the way he has lived       his life. He is not in the background.    During election time, Pastor Patterson organizes a huge ``get out the  vote'' campaign. He was instrumental in getting a Martin Luther King  memorial in Anchorage--a 10-year-long endeavor.   She also talked about the groups he chaired, founded, and led beyond  his congregation, including Bridge Builders of Anchorage, the March of  Dimes Foundation, the Martin Luther King Jr. Foundation of Alaska, and  the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Anchorage.   You know, with leaders like this, the list goes on and on. In  addition to Corinthian Baptist Church in Fairbanks and Shiloh in  Anchorage, Pastor Patterson also planted Eagle River Missionary Baptist  Church and Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church of Palmer.   I have been uplifted to the core when my wife Julie and I have gone  to Shiloh and listened to Pastor Patterson preach and listened to the  beautiful--and I mean beautiful--Shiloh choir sing. It is a spiritual  and energizing experience like no other. I love attending services at  Shiloh.   On November 5, 2017, Pastor Patterson's 80th birthday, he will be  giving his last sermon as pastor of Shiloh, and I certainly plan on  being there. He is stepping down for Pastor Undra Parker, who will be  the new and dynamic leader of Shiloh--another great Alaskan, another  veteran--and I know he is going to do a great job. But of course it is  a bittersweet time for Shiloh's parishioners because of the foundation  Pastor Patterson built.   The church, the singing, and the amens will continue on Earth and the  church in Anchorage, AK, as it is in Heaven. God bless Pastor  Patterson, his wife of 61 years, First Lady Shirley Patterson, and the  congregation of Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church for all they have done  and continue to do for our community.    Congratulations to Pastor Patterson for being our Alaskan of the  Week.    Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about my Members on  the other side of the aisle who are doing something that is just not  helping the United States of America right now; that is, obstructing  progress with regard to the new administration.    I understand that right now my party is in the majority, and to be  honest, I have been someone who thinks we should spend a lot more time  here in the Senate, working in the Senate and getting things done. We  have a lot of work to do. But I see that people back home can get  frustrated with some of the lack of progress, and some of that we can  address by spending more time in this body.    Some of the questions that are coming out are about why things  aren't getting done. It is a good question. Answers can be complicated,  but what it mostly boils down to is that a lot of issues in this body-- a lot--rely on consensus. The rules were carefully constructed so that  the minority has a say in the legislative process. For the most part, I  believe that is a good thing. As a former President once pointed out,  we are not a red or blue America; we are the United States of America.    With that said, the people did elect us to come here and start  getting  [[Page S6345]]  things done. Implicit in their votes for a new President and a new  administration was to be able to put people in the Federal Government  to work, to focus on growing the economy, and to focus on rebuilding  the military after a 25-percent cut over the last 8 years, to focus on  better jobs and higher wages.    Throughout history, whether it has been Republicans or Democrats,  the minority party has understood this. When a new administration gets  elected, they start to put nominees in place, and the Senate takes  action. We hold hearings and we have votes to put Senate-confirmed  officials in the Federal Government to work. If you don't like the  person, you can ask them tough questions in hearings and you can vote  against them on the floor of the Senate or in committees. But what we  are seeing right now is pure obstruction. On every single nominee, the  maximum amount of time is required before there is even a vote. This is  something new. This is something different. In fact, the current  minority leader said the following words in 2013:          Who in America doesn't think a President, Democrat or       Republican, deserves his or her picks for who should run the       Federal Government agencies? Nobody.     That was the minority leader in 2013. They were wise words then, but  apparently he and his Members have forgotten those words.    I have some facts here on the board. At this point in time, 10  months into President Obama's Presidency in 2009, the Senate had  allowed more than 318 nominees to be cast by a simple vote. The Senate  only asked for a procedure known as cloture five times. Essentially,  President Obama got elected, and the Senate Democrats and Republicans  worked to get his team put in place. Yes, the Republicans did that.  Certainly, I wasn't here then. They voted against some of these  nominees, and that is fine. But what they did was they let them come to  the floor for a vote.    In contrast to what I mentioned about President Obama's first year  in office, only 100 of President Trump's nominees have been confirmed  through voice vote. That is less than one-third of the courtesy given  to President Obama 8 years ago. Cloture votes for Trump's nominees have  been required for 100 nominees. Remember, I just said there were five  for Obama's nominees 8 years ago. There have been 100 for Trump's  nominees, and only 63 have been allowed by simple voice vote. What does  that mean? It means that each vote requires a 2-day waiting period and  then another 30 hours of debate. That is what it means.    The press won't write about it. My friends in the press sitting up  here in the Gallery won't write about this. The contrast between the  Trump treatment by the Senate and the Obama treatment by the Senate is  incredible, and we don't hear a word out of the press on this. And this  isn't partisan; this is just hurting the American people. There was an  election, and now we need to fill the government with people who can  run agencies. With all due respect to my friends on the other side of  the aisle, they are not doing it. They are not allowing it.    We had a vote on an Eighth Circuit judge last week. It had to go  through cloture. We essentially spent the whole week on this--2 days  and 30 hours. The judge passed the Senate by a 95-to-1 vote. It was a  95-to-1 vote. He wasn't controversial at all so what was the point? The  point was simply to delay.   Again, here is the difference. Nominations sent to the Senate are  about the same. President Obama had more 8 years ago but not too many  more. There were 520 versus 443 for President Trump confirmed. At this  time during the Obama administration, there were 342. Trump has 163. So  that is 66 percent for the Obama nominees 8 years ago and 37 percent  for the Trump nominees.   The press will not write about it, but this is a disservice to  Americans, whether you are a Democrat or Republican. I will just  mention a few. We have had nominees, such as the Assistant Secretary  for Health in Health and Human Services. It came out of committee  several weeks ago. It is sitting on the floor. The Assistant Secretary  of Health, it is not a controversial position for the company, but it  is an important position. I bet that person is going to finally get  passage from the Senate at some point by a big supermajority, but we  are delaying it. We are delaying it.   I really would love it if the minority leader would come down, look  at the American people, and just say: Here is why we are delaying. Here  is why we are delaying. Explain it. They love to do this kind of stuff,  procedural ``dark arts,'' thinking people aren't watching. People  understand this.   The head of a leading Democratic think tank told the press they  intend to hold up and tie up floor time on every single Trump  administration nominee. Now, if that happens, if they take the time for  every nominee--there are over 1,000 who need Senate confirmation--and  they take the entire amount of time they are allowed with cloture and  other votes, if they don't extend the courtesy that was extended to  President Obama when he was trying to put his team in place, the Trump  administration will never have a team in place. It will literally be 4  years.   I hope today the press starts writing about this because the  difference here in 8 years is quite remarkable and yet nobody is  talking about it; that being that the minority leader and my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle stop obstructing what every other  administration has had in terms of a courtesy, which is, if you win the  election, whether you liked it or not, you work with the other side in  the U.S. Senate to get your people in place--Department of Defense  officials, Department of Transportation officials, Department of Health  officials, Environmental Protection Agency officials. We have to get  the country moving again, and the obstruction, which is unprecedented,  by the minority leader and unfortunately many of my colleagues on the  other side is only harming the American people. It is only harming the  progress that the vast majority of Americans want, whether you are a  Democrat or a Republican. I am hopeful they are finally going to change  and start moving forward nominations and letting us vote on them so we  have an opportunity to actually get this country moving again.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.
