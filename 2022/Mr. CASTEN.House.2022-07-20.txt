 Mr. Speaker, the West is burning and we can't get the  water to put it out, thanks to a 1,200-year drought.   Louisiana insurance companies are failing due to rising sea levels.   Families are paying more than ever to cool their home and fill up  their tank with ever more expensive fossil fuels.   And this week, we learned that a majority of the Senate thinks that  is fine.   They are fine with Americans paying too much for energy. They are  fine with Americans keeping our economy coupled to Putin's war machine.  They are fine with stealing from consumers and stealing from our future  to subsidize fossil energy producers today.   If you have a solar panel on your roof, if you have an electric  vehicle in your driveway or an energy-efficient home, you are helping  your planet and you are helping your wallets.   In the House, we are making that opportunity available to all  Americans and, yet, the Senate has failed us. Their failure is not only  a failure to do their job, it is not only a failure of leadership, the  U.S. Senate is increasingly an embarrassment, and I am sick of  apologizing for them.                            ____________________
