 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a native of the 21st  Congressional District of Texas, Master Sergeant Matthew Williams.   Master Sergeant Williams received the Medal of Honor at the White  House 2 weeks ago for his heroic actions while serving as Weapons  Sergeant, Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha 3336, Special  Operations Task Force-33, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.   According to the Medal of Honor citation, on April 6, 2018, Williams,  his team, and roughly 100 Afghan commandos were airdropped from  helicopters into a mountainous area in Afghanistan's Shok Valley.   The terrain was too rough for the helicopters to land, so the  soldiers jumped from 10 to 12 feet off the back of the helicopters to  start the mission. Some landed on jagged rocks. Others landed waist- deep in a river. None of them were detoured from the mission.   After making their way through fast-moving water and up rocky  terrain, an element of Williams' team faced an onslaught of machine gun  fire, sniper fire, and rocket-propelled grenades.   Williams and his group were forced to take cover. Once Williams  learned members of his team were trapped and taking heavy fire, he  quickly joined a small assault team to assist the wounded and the  troops taking heavy fire.   Williams led the group up the mountain and across a 100-meter valley  of boulders and difficult terrain toward the American troops in danger.                                time  1030    Quickly, they set up a human chain to bring the wounded down the  mountain. As they were setting up the chain, one of his fellow soldiers  was hit. Without a moment's hesitation, Williams braved enemy fire to  give the soldier first aid and get him out of the line of fire.   After helping his fellow soldier, Williams immediately turned around  and fought his way back up to the mountain to where his teammates were  pinned down.   After taking out multiple insurgents, Williams worked to get his unit  organized. He then went back to putting himself between enemy fire and  his fellow soldiers, to protect them as they were making their way to  safety.   Insurgents began attacking a small house at the base of the mountain  the American troops were using as the collection point for casualties  and injured soldiers. To buy time for helicopters to extract the  wounded and get them to safety, Williams led a counterattack against a  group of over 200 insurgents, fighting them off as his troops were  being saved.   Master Sergeant Williams' actions were critical in helping to save  the lives of four wounded soldiers. There is no doubt that Williams  protected his fellow soldiers from grave danger. Because of his actions  and that of his brave teammates, no American servicemembers were  killed.   Master Sergeant Williams exemplifies the selfless commitment our men  and women in uniform give to the United States of America, our values,  and our way of life.   Master Sergeant Williams from Texas-21, from Boerne, Texas, the State  of Texas and the entire Nation is proud of the honor you received 2  weeks ago.                        Honoring Service of Rick Perry     Mr. Speaker, I also want to say a few remarks quickly about  my friend and former boss, and the former Governor of the State of  Texas, Rick Perry. He is going to be ending his service as the  Secretary of Energy, I believe at the end of this month.   He is a patriot, a proud veteran of the Air Force, and a proud Aggie,  which he and my Aggie wife like to remind me of regularly.   He was born in Paint Creek, Texas, in a house that didn't have indoor  plumbing. He lived in that house for 5 years without indoor plumbing.   He worked up to graduate from A&M, serve in the Air Force, serve as a  State representative, as the Texas Agriculture Commissioner, the  Lieutenant Governor, and the 14-year Governor of the State of Texas.   He is my friend. I respect him immensely. I thank him for his service  as the Secretary of Energy.   I would just say that when I worked for him, I was battling Hodgkin's  lymphoma, and the Governor could not have been more gracious and more  supportive of me and my young family at the time.   He will always be someone for whom I will be happy to crawl across  broken glass for any day, any week, anywhere in the United States. I  know his public service is far from over because he loves this country  so much.                        Questions for Majority Leader     Mr. Speaker, I would make only one other point in my  remaining 20 seconds.   I heard the distinguished majority leader talking about the  whistleblower. We are in the middle of the Nation focusing on what the  House of Representatives is doing, and the Nation is wondering why we  aren't working on the things that will make their lives better:  lowering healthcare prices, balancing the budget, securing the border,  and doing the work that we should be doing to make their lives better  in the United States of America.   To listen to the majority leader talking about the whistleblower in  some hallowed respect when that very whistleblower had an attorney who  was talking about a coup in 2017, I would ask one question: Why hasn't  this alleged whistleblower fired that attorney?   Did the whistleblower know that the attorney was talking about a coup  in 2017? If he did, why did he hire him? If he didn't, why hasn't he  fired him?   Those would be my questions for the distinguished majority leader.  [[Page H8833]]                                ____________________
