 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  today's bill which is a bipartisan, good faith effort to begin to  provide relief to millions of American families and workers. While not  perfect, it is a good start.   In the last few weeks, I spoke to thousands of my Central Valley  neighbors. Last week, I had a townhall where 9,000 constituents called  in. They are scared. They are worried. But they are looking for  guidance and leadership, and today they are looking for relief.   No American should have to choose between paying rent and putting  food on their table. But without immediate assistance, this is exactly  the choice they will have to make.   As a Representative of the top ag district in the top ag State, I am  proud this bill shores up vital safety net programs for our farmers and  ranchers and  [[Page H1841]]  their families. But I am disappointed about this bill's glaring  shortcomings which must be remedied in a future bill.   This bill punishes mixed-status households and denies some American  citizens benefits they deserve. It does not put a penny in the CDFI  Fund to help disadvantaged communities.
