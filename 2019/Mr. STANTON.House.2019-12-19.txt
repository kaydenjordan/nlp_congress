 Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 698.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 19, 2019, on page H12221, ``*ERR08*'' inadvertently  appeared at two places.

Passing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is essential to creating new  jobs and strengthening the economy of my home State of Arizona.   Those of us in border States understand the value of trading with our  neighbors, and I can tell you, growing trade relationships with Mexico  and Canada is essential to Arizona. This new agreement will offer a big  lift to our local companies.   Already in Arizona, nearly 230,000 jobs rely on across-the-border  commerce. That means 230,000 paychecks buying holiday gifts, 230,000  paychecks putting food on the table for their families, and 230,000  paychecks contributing to our State's economy.  [[Page H12261]]    Today we have a real opportunity for job creators, from multi- national companies, to mid-size and small businesses, from tech workers  to farmworkers. There is no doubt that the new USMCA is a win for all  Arizonans.   This is a bipartisan agreement. It sets a new standard for creating  trade rules that are enforceable, good for American workers, and  effectively consider how business is done in the 21st century.   Importantly, it reasserts Congress' role in trade policy.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal and the trade working group for  their hard work in getting this deal done.
