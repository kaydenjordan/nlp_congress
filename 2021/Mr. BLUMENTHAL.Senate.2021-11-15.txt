 Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy  heart to pay tribute to Frank Zullo, an extraordinary public servant  who passed away on May 26, 2018, at the age of 85.   Born and raised in Norwalk, CT, Frank started his law practice in  1957 in his hometown. The next year, the Norwalk Junior Chamber of  Commerce named him ``Young Man of the Year.'' He was elected mayor of  Norwalk in 1965. At only 33 years old, Frank was the youngest mayor in  the city's history, in addition to being their first Italian-American  mayor.   Throughout his three terms, Frank worked closely with the people of  Norwalk, listening to their concerns and striving to initiate positive  change. Against the backdrop of the civil rights movement, the Vietnam  war, and the Cold War, Frank faced local challenges head on and  diligently united his constituents. Frank was known for his compassion  and did everything he could to make Norwalk a welcoming city for all of  its residents.   Frank became a symbol of the city, and his leadership ushered in a  new era of participation in Connecticut politics, in which residents  saw the difference they could make as part of his administration. His  legacy is enduring, and for the rest of his lifetime, Frank was often  called upon for guidance by his successors, who recognized his  remarkable accomplishments. He also helped establish the Connecticut  Conference of Mayors and served on the executive board of the U.S.  Conference of Mayors as a trustee and member.   Admired for his lively spirit and giving personality, Frank committed  himself to serving Norwalk in a multitude of ways, both when he was  mayor and when he returned to practicing law. One notable example  includes his role as chair of the Norwalk-Wilton Chapter of the  American Red Cross Board's Water Safety Program, in which he taught  hundreds of young people lifeguarding and swimming skills. He also  chaired the Board of Trustees of Norwalk Hospital and the University of  Bridgeport, chaired the First Taxing District Water Department, and  served as a member of the Board of Trustees for the Maritime Aquarium  at Norwalk.   Following Frank's passing, a memorial rose garden was constructed in  his honor by the First Taxing District of the City of Norwalk. Though  the celebratory programs were canceled because of the COVID-19  pandemic, the Frank N. Zullo Memorial Rose Garden stands as a fitting  tribute to a man  [[Page S8078]]  who spent his lifetime bettering the city.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to recognize  Albert Bros., Inc., as it celebrates 125 years of outstanding industry  in Connecticut.   The company began with Nathan and Lewis Albert peddling scrap metal  across Connecticut upon their arrival in Waterbury from Lithuania. In  1895, the Alberts, demonstrating the entrepreneurial skill and energy  for which our Nation is known, opened their own scrap yard,  establishing Albert Bros., Inc.   Over the past century and a quarter, Albert Bros. has grown into one  of New England's foremost scrap metal recyclers and processors, using  Connecticut ingenuity to turn waste products into productive materials.  Their exemplary work has earned them accolades from the State of  Connecticut and recognition on an international scale.   Though they reached their 125th anniversary during the COVID-19  pandemic and were unable to celebrate, Albert Bros. has marked this  milestone by relocating their offices and significant warehouse and  processing facilities to a new location. In September of this year,  they officially moved to the site of the old Waterbury Rolling Mills,  giving their plant an impressive new setup as they continue to serve  the people of Connecticut and beyond.   Albert Bros. is now in its fourth generation of family ownership and  remains unstintingly committed to innovation, thoughtful expansion, and  workplace safety. I had the privilege of visiting the company and  speaking with a number of employees, and I can attest firsthand to  their remarkable, dedicated work ethic.   As Albert Bros. celebrates its anniversary and establishes its new  plant, I applaud the company on its extraordinary record of  accomplishment. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating  Albert Bros., Inc, on over 125 years of excellence.                            ____________________
