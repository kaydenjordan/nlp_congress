 Madam President, today I would like to recognize a  good friend who has meant so much to those in St. Louis, across  Missouri, and throughout the Nation. Betty Thompson passed away Sunday,  July 11, 2021, at the age of 81.   Betty was a great leader, respected voice in the community, and was  known for her service to others. Along with her public service, she was  known for her generosity and caring nature to help those in need. She  was the first African American to serve on the University City City  Council and remained on that council for 18 years. She then was elected  in 1997 to serve in the Missouri House of Representatives where she  represented the 72nd District until 2004. From being a State  representative to her advocacy for civil rights, she truly was a beacon  of light.   Betty and I saw each other many times over the past 12 years. She  provided a welcoming environment no matter the place and was always a  trusted counsel during our conversations.   Jack and Betty Thompson were a month away from celebrating their 62nd  wedding anniversary. Along with her husband, Betty is survived by her  children Tony Thompson, Sonja Branscomb, and Kwame Thompson, and seven  grandchildren. She was preceded in death by her son, Tyrone Thompson,  and grandson, Tyrell Thompson.   I am grateful to have known Betty and thankful for the impact she has  had on my own life, as well as those around Missouri.                            ____________________
