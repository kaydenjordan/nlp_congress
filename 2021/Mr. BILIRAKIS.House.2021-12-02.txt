 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I refuse to stand by  and watch as America's ability to ensure the safe and efficient  movement of goods, people, and services throughout our transportation  network continues to be diluted. Our priority focus right now should be  strengthening our Nation's economy and increasing our global  competitiveness.   The policies of this President and Democratic Party leaders in  Congress are exacerbating or simply ignoring the underlying supply  chain crisis. These policies include the mishandling of the COVID  response in ways that are prolonging unemployment and worker shortages  across the economy and pushing for a multitrillion-dollar spending  spree that is driving up prices of everything from gas to groceries.   Mr. Speaker, these efforts only serve to weaken American  competitiveness and shrink our economy.                            ____________________
