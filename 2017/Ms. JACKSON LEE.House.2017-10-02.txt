 Mr. Speaker, with the humblest of hearts, I cannot  imagine the fear and the horror of those who heard those violent sounds  late last night in Las Vegas, nor the horror of family members who had  to wonder where their loved ones were or are now calling numbers to  discern what happened.   One of my closest relatives was in Las Vegas, and I can only imagine  what they went through, as I had the great fear myself, not knowing  where and what.   I think the American people expect us to mourn and to honor them and  to have a moment of silence, but I believe that the American people  demand, and should, and those families who are now mourning, that we  should be sensible.   Mr. Speaker, we should not ever put on the floor of the House the  deregulation of silencers. Can you imagine how many more would have  died if the perpetrator who had ten guns had a silencer?   We have to confront domestic terrorism. We can't run away from it. We  have to confront automatic weapons no matter what, where, and how.   My prayers are with the families, but I think they demand, Mr.  Speaker, action from this Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in the  Congressional Black Caucus in drawing attention to this year's  catastrophic hurricane season that has severely impacted the Texas,  Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this Hurricane Season.   The biggest challenge for residents of the 18th Congressional  District is accessing the assistance that is available to them.   From getting rooms in hotels for those displaced by flood waters to  finding Disaster Assistance Centers that are accessible--when so many  cars were damaged by Hurricane Harvey flood waters.   This past Saturday, I joined with representatives from FEMA to  provide critical information to Houstonians attempting to recover from  the catastrophe of Hurricane Harvey.   Many of them are still waiting for home inspections and need answers  regarding the appeals process and how best to utilize Home Inspection  Teams.  [[Page H7665]]    I am calling on FEMA to create a new app to provide homeowners with  instant status updates on the inspection process,'' said Congresswoman  Jackson Lee. ``This app should speed up the process of scheduling FEMA  inspectors for a home visit if your home has not been inspected in more  than 10 days.   This will help the many who are struggling to get their lives back in  order.   This week, FEMA announced the creation of a new housing program under  the Direct Housing Assistance Program, which allows FEMA disaster  relief funding to go to individual homeowners or to local governments  to provide housing. To be considered for this program, people must  first register with FEMA at www.DisasterAssistance.gov.   Local government immediate disaster assistance housing options are as  follows:   1. Multi-Family Lease and Repair:   Direct assistance to repair or improve existing multifamily housing  such as apartments in order to provide more housing for survivors.   Properties must be three or more units, with each unit providing  complete living facilities for cooking, eating, and sanitation. Hotels,  motels, and extended stay hotels are not eligible at this time.   2. Direct Leasing:   Direct Leasing: Enables local governments to lease a property that  typically would not be available to the public, such as corporate  lodging.   Local government enters into the lease agreement on behalf of  individuals or households. Various types of housing properties may be  eligible.   Manufactured Housing Options (Mobile Homes and Recreational  Vehicles):   Direct housing places manufactured housing units on private land or  commercial pads.   Local permitting may apply.   There are conditions to receiving housing assistance, but no  assistance will be available if an application to FEMA is not made.   It is problematic for constituents from the 18th Congressional  District, when I know that 81,950 FEMA applicants have been rejected.   I know that tens of thousands are still displaced with over a 1  million cars having been destroyed by flood water it is difficult to  get to the Disaster Recovery Centers.   I continue to work to get more Disaster Recovery Centers opened  before the October 24, 2017 deadline to make sure that FEMA resources  are as accessible as possible.   We know that site for housing must be suitable.   There will be Hauling and installation included only for those people  who have applied for FEMA assistance and have be approved to receive  assistance.   An inspection of the site to determine suitability will be scheduled.   Partial Repair and Essential Power for Sheltering (PREPS):   PREPS provides minor repairs to homes in locations with limited  housing options.   For eligible properties that have incurred limited damage displacing  individuals from their homes.   PREPS provides basic, emergency home repairs--not to include finish  work.   3. Direct Assistance for Limited Home Repair:   Program provides partial repairs to homes with significant damages.   Program can include partial repairs to a damaged home where  alternative housing is not available or is not cost-effective.   FEMA will determine eligibility for permanent housing construction on  a case-by-case basis.   All other forms of housing assistance must be exhausted before the  program can be considered.   Some Hurricane Harvey survivors are getting an extension to stay  temporarily in hotels while they look for an alternative place to live.  October 14 is the new checkout date for the Transitional Sheltering  Assistance (TSA) program, which pays for short-term hotel stays.   All applicants for FEMA recovery assistance have the right to appeal  if they are dissatisfied with FEMA's determination letter. All appeals  must be in writing and explain the reasons why FEMA's decision may not  be correct. The appeal should include any documentation that FEMA  requests or that supports your claim. Appeals can be submitted via  computer by opening a Disaster Assistance Center (DAC) account at  www.disasterassistance.gov.  In addition to all of the needs of family are the needs of small  businesses who are going to be instrumental in rebuilding our  communities.   I will soon introduce a bill to provide grants of up to $100 thousand  to qualified small business owners to help them with Hurricane  Recovery.   I thank my Colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus for joining  in this Special Order and I look forward to our efforts to meet the  needs of people who are impacted by this hurricane Season.   I would also like to include in the Record an article from Vox  regarding climate change:                       [From vox.com, Sept. 28, 2017]  One of the Clearest Signs of Climate Change in Hurricanes Maria, Irma,                          and Harvey Was the Rain         Warmer temperatures are increasing the energy and moisture       available to hurricanes.        The intensity of Hurricane Maria, which made landfall on       Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm on September 20, was part       of why it was so devastating to the island and its weak       infrastructure, leaving Puerto Ricans in a humanitarian       crisis.        But this year's intense Atlantic storm season had another       element tying its biggest events together: a monstrous, and       sometimes deadly, amount of rain.        Images of the flooded metropolises of Houston,       Jacksonville, and San Juan with overtopped dams, billowing       sewage, and flooded homes show that torrential rain can be       one of the most devastating consequences of hurricanes,       especially in urban areas where concrete makes it harder for       water to drain and where people can drown.        Scientists say the extreme rainfall events that feed these       floods are on the rise for many parts of the world, and this       year's hurricanes fit that trend. In particular, rising       temperatures in the ocean and the air alongside booming       construction in vulnerable areas are fueling the increased       risk from massive deluges.        Of the seven hurricanes this year so far, Harvey, Irma, and       Maria stand out not just for the amount of rain they dropped,       but for how fast they dished it out.         Why hurricanes under warmer conditions can dump so much rain         Downpours go hand in hand with hurricanes, since the       cyclones are powered by evaporating and condensing moisture.        Warm ocean waters provide the fuel for hurricanes, and warm       air causes the water to evaporate. This moisture-laden air       then precipitates as rainfall during a hurricane, dissipating       the heat energy from the water.        ``Tropical cyclones are very, very good at converging a       whole lot of heat in one place at one time,'' said Kossin.        Air can hold about 7 percent more water for every degree       Celsius increase in temperature, Kossin explained.        That means warmer air and warmer water could lead to       larger, more intense hurricanes, which in turn lead to more       rainfall. (The Saffir-Simpson scale only accounts for       windspeed, but precipitation is closely linked to a storm's       intensity.) Scientists are studying these links to understand       how future storms will respond to these conditions.        ``Hurricanes live and die by the amount of rainfall they       make out of moisture,'' said George Huffman, a research       meteorologist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.        But where that water lands depends on the speed and the       course of the storm, and not all areas are equally       vulnerable.        ``We know that in particular that [the regions around]       Houston, Louisiana, and Florida are prone to some of the most       extreme precipitation events in the United States,'' said       Sarah Kapnick, a researcher at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid       Dynamics Laboratory. ``We do see signs of precipitation       extremes increasing in these regions.''        It's challenging to make direct comparisons between extreme       rainfall events since their weather systems (e.g.,       hurricanes, thunderstorms) behave differently, so scientists       draw on several benchmarks depending on the situation.        These include the peak rate of rainfall, total volume of       rain, the three-day average rainfall, and the maximum depth       of rainfall. And all of these are separate from flooding,       which is governed by local geography and how people use land,       in addition to the rates and total amounts of rain.        ``There is a difference between a 100-year rain event       versus a 100-year flood event,'' Kossin pointed out.    Harvey was able to dump an extraordinary quantity of rain because of                       how it held still over Houston         Hurricane Harvey hovered over the Gulf Coast in late August       and dumped 33 trillion gallons of water on US soil, according       to some estimates, and is now the wettest storm in US       history.        ``When a storm stalls, that has more to do with the larger       scale flow fields it's sitting in,'' said Kossin. ``That was       just very, very bad luck.''        The total volume of rain is easier to calculate when a       storm remains over a fixed area, but it much harder to suss       out when hurricanes remain mobile and dump water over a wide       swath of land and ocean.        NASA's satellite measurements reported rainfall rates from       Harvey as high as 5.8 inches per hour (meteorologists define       ``heavy rain'' as greater than 0.3 inches per hour), while       the National Weather Service showed that a ground-based       rain gauge in Nederland, Texas, reported 60.58 inches of       rainfall, a new record.        Meteorologists still have to vet this number, but if       confirmed, it would best the previous record--52 inches in       Hawaii from Hurricane Hiki in 1950--by 8 inches.        The US Geological Survey reports that flooding causes an       average of $6 billion in damages and 140 fatalities each       year. And this year was not an average year, with Harvey       alone costing upward of $180 billion and killing more than       75.        The waters from flooding can linger for days, causing       injuries, spreading disease, and hampering relief efforts.       The majority of Harvey's victims drowned after the storm,       while others were delayed from life-saving care. In one case,       a woman died from a flesh-eating bacterial infection after       falling into the festering Harvey floodwater in her house.  [[Page H7666]]                             Irma's peak rain was over Cuba         Hurricane Irma, meanwhile, set a record for its sustained       intensity.        ``Irma was a complete standout: 185 mph and stayed there       for a day and half,'' Kossin said. ``These storms do not stay       there that long.''        This intensity was matched with a firehose of rain, dumping       water at 10.8 inches an hour, reaching depths of 20 inches in       Cuba and 15.8 inches in Florida.        The downpour led to flooding from 23 rivers and creeks in       Central and North Florida, forcing highways to close. The       state reported at least seven deaths from drowning.        In Cuba, Irma's storm surge overtopped the Havana seawall,       while unrelenting rain turned the capital's streets into       rivers, killing at least 10 people .       Maria took direct aim at Puerto Rico and then regained strength         With tropical force winds reaching 230 miles from its       center, Hurricane Maria completely engulfed Puerto Rico as it       bisected the 100-mile wide island, picking up steam again one       it was clear.        Satellite measurements already show that it poured as much       as 6.44 inches of rain per hour and has left Puerto Rico       shrouded in darkness.        The Cordillera Central mountain range that forms the spine       of the island of Puerto Rico acted as a juicer for Hurricane       Maria, Huffman explained.        Perhaps the worst blow from Maria was the 150 mph winds       that knocked down 80 percent of the island's power       transmission lines and 85 percent of its cellphone towers,       leaving people in the dark and struggling to contact each       other. But the flooding from rainfall has been a hazard too,       including threatening to breach Guajataca Dam in the Western       part of the island, forcing hundreds to evacuate.        At least 18 fatalities have been reported in Puerto Rico so       far, including two police officers who drowned.             The climate signal in deluges like these is emerging         No single weather event--even an extreme one--can be       ``caused'' by climate change, as Vox's David Roberts has       explained in detail. And when talking about hurricanes,       researchers are quite hesitant to even estimate how much       climate change is to blame. Huffman said he's not yet sure if       this storm season is ``unprecedented'' in its ferocity.        However, rising average temperatures are definitely an       important element of huge storms like Harvey, Irma, and       Maria.        Warmer temperatures are driving sea level rise, which is       increasing risks from the storm surges that often herald       hurricanes.        Increasing heat is also warming up the ocean, and hotter       air holds onto more moisture, increasing the available energy       for hurricanes.        And independent of cyclones, extreme rainfall events are on       the rise.        Kapnick noted that even individual rain storms can be       overwhelming, like storm that drenched Baton Rouge last year       with 31.39 inches of rain and three times the volume of water       of Hurricane Katrina throughout Louisiana in 2005.        As the chart below shows, the amount of rain from a once-      in-every-30-years rainstorm like the one that immersed Baton       Rouge has gone up due to warming:        ``In this region where we have known precipitation       extremes, we have been able to detect an increase in       precipitation extremes due to a warming climate,'' Kapnick       said.        And scientists are getting better at figuring out when the       torrential downpours are coming.        ``If you pay attention, we've had a really remarkable       series of forecasts,'' said Huffman. ``For Irma, we knew four       to five days in advance that there would be a sharp right       turn. Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have dreamed of doing       that.''        ``Everything we see is consistent with what we expect       climate change to do,'' Kossin said.     Instruments sometimes can't stand up to the extreme weather they're                             trying to measure         Huffman explained that researchers aim to combine different       instruments to get a robust handle on rainfall.        ``The gold standard is rain gauges because they physically       collect the rain,'' said Huffman.        The next option is ground-based radar, which covers a wider       swath of the weather than rain gauges, but less directly       measures rain.        But take a look at what happened to a weather radar station       in Puerto Rico:        This illustrates part of the challenge of attaching numbers       to extreme weather events. Many of the systems used to track       them are also vulnerable to them, leaving only indirect       figures and estimates.        What's more, both rain gauges and ground-based radar have       limited ranges, leaving vast stretches of ocean where       hurricanes spend most of their existence unmeasured. And when       a hurricane does make landfall, gales can knock them down.        ``We don't really have anything on the surface [of the       ocean] to tell us the details,'' said Huffman. ``When the       chips are really down, sometimes satellites are the only       choice.''        That means the full accounting for the rainfall from       Harvey, Irma, and Maria could take months to deliver as       meteorologists piece together their models with the       measurements they have.        However, scientists are eagerly waiting for the dust to       settle so they can confirm their suspicions about the record-      breaking storms this year. The American Geophysical Union       added a last-minute session for researchers to present their       findings on Harvey and Irma at their December meeting.        ``There's going to be a tremendous amount of research       coming out in the next few months,'' Kapnick said.                            ____________________
