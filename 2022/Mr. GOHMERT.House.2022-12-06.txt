 Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful to my fellow Texan, and I  am not saying that lightly, dear friend, with whom a lot of battles  have been fought for organizing this Special Order. And I can also  honestly say that in my 18 years here I have never been more  uncomfortable on the floor than I have been listening to these  comments. I had no idea--I never asked--I had no idea how much time I  have spoken. Is that really right?    When I came to Congress I had seen that the country was  in trouble and having been a history student and having loved history,  I knew no republic lasts forever. I knew we were about to the extent of  the length of time that republics come and go. I didn't expect to be  here 18 years, but I had hoped that when I left I could feel we had  perpetuated that liberty for at least another generation, hopefully,  much more.   As I sat here listening to the gracious comments, I was taken right  back to Ben Franklin's speech in the Constitutional Convention in 1787  after they couldn't agree on much but his words: ``I have lived, sir, a  long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of  this truth--that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow  cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an  empire could rise without His aid? We have been assured, sir, in the  sacred writings that `except the Lord build they labor in vain that  build it.' ''   It just seems to me that we have much less concern or desire overall  for having the Lord help build the House. I know historically what that  means.   I have been deeply encouraged on seeing the people that have come in  since I did, and especially in recent years, and I am taking great  heart from the fact that we have got some fighters that have come in.  If I have helped inspire some, as they said, that is something I can  take with me, but I will continue to follow what goes on here and help  in any way I can. I am very grateful.   I see my dear friend from Louisiana is here, and I thank God that He  brought him through his brush with death because we have been better  for him being here. I thank all of those who have spoken tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I would like the Record to reflect that  after 5 years or so of cooking ribs on the gutter or balcony or  whatever you want to call it of the Cannon Building, the Architect of  the Capitol decreed I couldn't do that anymore and found a provision  that indicated that. But it was   Steve Scalise of Louisiana that went  to bat with the powers here that ultimately allowed me to start cooking  ribs again. I will always be grateful because that is maybe the only  time I ever left a good taste in people's mouths. So I am very grateful  to Steve for helping make that happen. You were the one that  facilitated that, and I am grateful.    Obviously, the people whom I have to thank in addition  to my family, Kathy is--well, I don't think I could have gotten elected  without her help both running for judge and then for Congress. My girls  have put up with so very much. They have taken abuse for my positions  and things I have said, done, and fought for.   But I have always felt that I was the most fortunate Member of  Congress because of whom I got to represent, the people of east Texas.  We are so blessed in Texas. I am really blessed they took a chance.  Nine of twelve counties had not elected a Republican for Congress, and  I am grateful that they took a chance on me. So I will always be  grateful to the people of east Texas. My service is not over, it will  be in a different capacity.   One of the things that has really bothered me during my time is other  Christians saying: Louie, we don't have to worry, God is in control.   That is so frustrating.   I love what my friend, Pastor Tommy Nelson says:         Just because God is in control doesn't mean He wants us to       lean on our shovel and pray for a hole because He gave us all       tools and expects us to use the tools while we are praying,       that is fine, but use what He gave us.    We have heard from people who have done that. There are so many more  that are tied up other places. But it really has been an inspiration to  me to see the people who are coming in, who have come in, like those we  have heard from; they are smart, ethical, and care deeply about America  and about America's future. So that is an encouragement to me. I am so  glad I got a glimpse of that.   Actually, when I decided I had to at least try, as late as I got into  the race for Attorney General, I knew, I had seen, I had heard, and I  had become friends with people whom I knew were going to be fighting  for what is right. We don't have to agree on everything.   It was an honor for me to know Bobby Rush. Even though some gave me  grief because I did not vote initially for his Emmett Till bill; I was  for it, but then when they cut the maximum sentence back to 10 years,  that was just such a shortchange. As a former judge, I couldn't imagine  being limited to 10 years in sentencing somebody involved in some  conspiracy like that, to do something as horrible as that. So I was  very pleased--because of Congressman Rush's constant never giving up  and continuing to push--when we got a bill that was more deserving of  his name and Emmett Till's name.   There have been great opportunities. I know there are good people  here. I will continue to pray for this body. I am just thankful that I  got to serve with the folks here.
