 Madam Speaker, over the past few weeks, we have made it  very clear how important it is for the United States to produce its own  energy rather than rely on other countries for our supplies.   The President and his allies have made things very clear that this is  the thing that they want to do, shutting down American energy  production, but the reality truly is that we can produce energy cleaner  and more efficiently than any other nation on the planet.   This administration decided to shut down American pipelines and shut  down American energy production, which has done nothing but drive up  the energy costs while threatening our national security and  strengthening our adversaries around the globe. We simply cannot allow  this to continue.   President Trump's hard work to increase energy production and his  leadership actually made us energy independent instead of energy  dependent during his time.   America has the resources and the ability to meet our supply needs,  and I encourage the President to end his assault on American energy.                            ____________________
