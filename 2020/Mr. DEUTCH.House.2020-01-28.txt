 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Minnesota for  yielding.   I appreciate the kind words of the ranking member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, and I appreciate his leadership.   Special thanks, as well, to the ranking member of the Middle East,  North Africa, and International Terrorism Subcommittee, Mr. Wilson, for  his leadership on these issues and his commitment to standing up for  the Iranian people.   In mid-November, popular protests against the Iranian regime began  and rapidly spread to at least 100 cities throughout the country, in  the most significant anti-government protests in Iran since 2009.   While protesters took to the streets in response to an increase in  fuel prices, they also called for structural reform of the Iranian  political system. They condemned current and former leaders.   In response, Iranian authorities shut down the internet. Security  forces used lethal force, killing hundreds of people, marking the  highest casualty rate of any protest movement in Iran since the Islamic  revolution 4 decades ago. And they arrested over 7,000 more.   Protesters returned earlier this month after Iran shot down Ukrainian  Airlines Flight 752 as it took off from Tehran's International Airport,  killing all 176 people on board, and then tried to cover it up.   The Iranians in the streets were frustrated by the regime's lies,  frustrated by their incompetence, and chanted against the IRGC and  against the Supreme Leader. As in November, Iranian authorities met  these protests with unlawful, disproportionate force.   Congress has long expressed bipartisan support for the human rights  of the Iranian people, including the rights to peaceably assemble and  the right to protest.  [[Page H593]]    Congress has also supported the rights of Iranian dissidents and  authorized the licensing of communication services to improve the  ability of Iranian people to speak freely.   In keeping with that tradition, H. Res. 752 expresses the support of  the House of Representatives for the rights of the Iranian people to  free expression and condemns the regime for its crackdown on the  recent, legitimate, peaceful protests in Iran.   The resolution condemns the Iranian regime's serious human rights  abuses, its significant corruption, destabilizing activities abroad,  and urges the President and the Secretary of State to work with the  international community to ensure that violations of human rights are  part of all formal and informal multilateral or bilateral discussions  regarding Iran.   I also encourage additional efforts by this House to support the  people of Iran. These include initiatives proposed by my colleagues,  like the one by Representative   Tom Malinowski, to end the ban on  Iranians and other citizens of predominantly-Muslim countries from  entering the United States. If we truly support the Iranian people, we  need to allow them to visit so they can experience our vibrant society,  so they can experience democracy, so that they can see pluralism and  our great democratic traditions. I look forward to working with my  colleagues to help advance these measures as well.   I thank my colleagues for their strong support of this resolution  which demonstrates that Congress stands with the Iranian people and  supports their right to live in a free society.                                time  1415
