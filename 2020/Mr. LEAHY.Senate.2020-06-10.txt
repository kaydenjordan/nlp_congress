 Mr. President, under normal circumstances, thousands of  visitors, staff, and members file through the United States Capitol and  Senate and House offices every day. As we slowly begin to reopen our  economy, businesses, and other public places, all eyes on Capitol Hill  turn to the guidance and counsel of Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending  physician of the U.S. Congress and Supreme Court. Since 2009, when he  joined us in the Capitol, Dr. Monahan has been a trusted voice of  reason and an exceptional healthcare provider to me and hundreds of  other lawmakers.   Dr. Monahan is an accomplished physician and rear admiral of the U.S.  Navy. He began his career as a public servant after college, when he  joined the Navy as a member of the Health Professions Scholarship  Program. In 1989, while working as a resident at the National Naval  Medical Center, Dr. Monahan discovered a connection between cardiac  arrhythmias and the antihistamine, Seldane, a discovery that lead to  the removal of the drug from the market. Dr. Monahan has spent years  working in the attending physician's office, as a staff physician and  later as the assistant attending physician. Dr. Monahan has also served  as the chairman of the Department of Medicine at the Uniformed Services  University of Health Services and has taught at the university as a  professor of pathology and medicine focusing on cancer, oncology, and  hematology. Dr. Monahan's many achievements, medical expertise, and  decades of public service make him an asset to the Capitol and an  invaluable colleague.   Dr. Monahan has played a particularly important role lately, as both  the Senate and the House of Representatives work to strike a balance  between limiting exposure to a pandemic and continuing to work for the  American people. Dr. Monahan has provided remarkable guidance to House  and Senate leaders on how to safely conduct business and operate in the  Capitol. Moving forward, as we continue to deal with the COVID-19  pandemic's economic and public health consequences, I am grateful to  have Dr. Monahan to guide us along the way.   Dr. Monahan is an accomplished photographer, and I have had the  privilege of seeing many of his photographs and being with him in  different parts of the world when he has taken some. All make one  seeing them wish they were there. The reality but especially the  artistry of his photographs are wonderful. Visits to his office are  healthy and healing in so many ways.   Dr. Monahan was recently profiled in The New York Times, and I ask  unanimous consent that the article, ``Doctor to Congress and Supreme  Court Toils to Sidestep Politics amid Pandemic,'' be printed in the  Record.  [[Page S2874]]    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, May 16, 2020]   Doctor to Congress and Supreme Court Toils to Sidestep Politics Amid                                  Pandemic     Dr. Brian P. Monahan has found himself in the middle of politicized     debates over how quickly to reopen the country and who should be                            testing for Covid-19                            (By Emily Cochrane)         Washington.--When Senator John Barrasso, Republican of       Wyoming, sought guidance on how to protect his family,       including his 94-year-old father-in-law, when he returned       home from the nation's capital amid the coronavirus pandemic,       a doctor offered him some blunt advice.        Don't go home just yet, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending       physician of Congress, told Mr. Barrasso, directing him to       quarantine for 14 days before rejoining his family. ``You're       a visitor,'' Dr. Monahan said.        But when House Democratic leaders wanted counsel on whether       they could safely reconvene in the Capitol with Covid-19       still spreading--a debate with political dimensions as a       partisan divide was emerging across the country over how       quickly to reopen--Dr. Monahan was less absolute. Returning       to Washington carried health risks he would not recommend       taking, he told Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and       Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority       leader. But it was up to them to decide what to do.        They opted to delay their return, and on Friday, partly       because of Dr. Monahan's warnings, moved forward with plans       to institute remote voting in the future.        It was typical of Dr. Monahan, the 59-year-old Navy rear       admiral who is known in the halls of the Capitol as much for       his meticulous attention to medical detail as he is for his       efforts to stay completely out of politics.        ``He is both an executive with lots of health care       responsibilities--particularly now--and also has the unique       relationship with members that a small-town doctor would have       with the patients he knows and sees,'' said Senator Roy       Blunt, Republican of Missouri and chairman of the Senate       Rules Committee. ``He's in a unique role at a unique time.''        As government doctors have emerged as trusted public voices       and political figures in the face of a fearsome pandemic--      appearing in White House news conferences and as witnesses at       marquee hearings--Dr. Monahan has maintained an uncommonly       low profile.        He never issued a public statement offering his opinion on       whether Congress should reconvene, although he shared his       warnings with House leaders and privately told senior       Republican officials that his office did not have the       capacity to screen all 100 senators for the coronavirus when       they returned to work. When Alex M. Azar II, the health       secretary, said he would send 1,000 tests to Capitol Hill to       accommodate them, Ms. Pelosi and Senator Mitch McConnell,       Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, turned down       the offer, wary of the optics of receiving special treatment       at a time when testing was scarce--and prompting President       Trump to suggest on Twitter that ``maybe you need a new       Doctor over there.''        Dr. Monahan, who declined to be interviewed, has been a       calm and professional voice of reason during the pandemic,       according to interviews with more than two dozen lawmakers,       Capitol officials and medical professionals who know him.       They say he has taken a personal interest in his influential       clientele, which also includes the nine Supreme Court       justices, even as he fields politically charged questions       about reopening, testing and precautionary measures.        Operating out of a nondescript clinic tucked away in the       heart of the Capitol, Dr. Monahan and a small staff have been       exceedingly busy since the pandemic took hold, consulting       with lawmakers who have contracted Covid-19 or exposed to       someone infected with it, doling out health recommendations       in detailed memos ahead of votes, and producing a series of       videos released on an internal website to educate lawmakers       and their staff on how to protect themselves.        Dr. Monahan has filmed and produced the videos by himself       in his office, often seated next to an elaborate bouquet of       white flowers and a tiny plastic model of a pangolin, the       scaly mammal that may have been an intermediary carrier of       the virus.        In the videos, he typically walks through the most recent       recommendations offered by the Centers for Disease Control       and Prevention and demonstrates medical equipment, such as a       thermometer and a variety of masks (including one made by his       wife, using a black shopping bag and a sewing machine).        ``He has a big job--two houses of Congress, two parties to       deal with--but he's not political in any way,'' Ms. Pelosi       said. ``He treats us all with respect, and we respect his       judgment in return.''        Dr. Monahan in 2009 became the seventh man to serve as       attending physician, taking up a position that has always       been held by a Navy doctor. The House first approved a Navy       officer to work out of the Democratic cloakroom in 1928 after       one lawmaker died and two collapsed, with several hours       passing before a doctor could arrive in each case. Two years       later, the Senate extended that doctor's jurisdiction to       include its own members, leading to the establishment of the       Office of the Attending Physician.        The office provides care to lawmakers for a fee, as well as       offering some services and emergency care to staff and       tourists. The first physician, Dr. George W. Calver, who       began his work just before the start of the Great Depression,       displayed placards in cloakrooms and elevators across the       Capitol with his nine ``Commandments of Health,'' including       ``Accept Inevitables (don't worry)'' and ``Relax       Completely.''        Dr. Monahan was born in Connecticut, the son of Irish       immigrants who came to the United States in the 1950s. His       mother grew up in Kilkee, while his father grew up in a house       with a thatched roof without running water or electricity in       Lissycasey. The first in his family to attend college, he       worked full-time at a supermarket while commuting in a yellow       Volkswagen Beetle to Fairfield University, a Jesuit college--      an education, he would tell graduates in 2011, that meant,       ``you are called to be `men and women for others.' ''        He studied biology and chemistry, and after graduating,       joined the Navy through its Health Professions Scholarship       Program, enticed in part by the offer of free tuition and a       living allowance in exchange for a commitment to three years       of service.        ``Brian was always the smartest kid in the class,'' said       Dr. William Dahut, a medical oncologist who spent time with       him in both medical school and the Navy. ``If there was a       publication or data, Brian knew that data and knew that       well.''        In 1989, as a resident in the cardiology ward in what was       then the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., he       treated a 39-year-old woman for potentially fatal cardiac       arrhythmias. The patient had taken the popular antihistamine       Seldane, and his contribution to research on that medicine--      and its connection to the arrhythmias--later helped lead to       its removal from the market.        Dr. Monahan rose through the ranks of the Navy, becoming a       professor of medicine and pathology at the Uniformed Services       University of the Health Sciences in Maryland, as well as       participating in a number of national organizations related       to cancer, oncology and hematology.        While serving as the Chairman of the Department of Medicine       at the university, he received a call for a meeting in which       officials with congressional leadership asked him to become       the attending physician on Capitol Hill when his predecessor       retired.        He has since become a fixture on Capitol Hill,       participating in congressional trips and functions and       releasing health assessments for presidential and vice-      presidential contenders, including Senators Bernie Sanders,       the Vermont independent, and Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia.       (Mr. Kaine also asked him for ``a tuneup'' before hiking the       Virginia section of the Appalachian Trail.)        In 2016, it was Dr. Monahan's assessment of Justice Antonin       Scalia's health at the time of his death--including sleep       apnea, coronary artery disease, obesity and diabetes--that       influenced the decision to decline an autopsy of the justice,       The Associated Press reported at the time.        ``He was the one who advised me to go to the hospital,''       said Representative Ben McAdams, Democrat of Utah and one of       the first lawmakers to contract the virus, said of Dr.       Monahan. ``He was clear: `I strongly recommend you go to the       hospital--this is serious.' ''        The congressman has spoken with the doctor at least a dozen       times since, he said in an interview on Thursday--but had yet       to meet Dr. Monahan in person.        An avid photographer, Dr. Monahan's photos are present in       offices around the Capitol--and he has been known to offer       advice on how to best capture a scenic landmark or vista on       trips overseas.        He checks in with his powerful patients frequently,       including long after they have recovered.        ``I've been around for a long period of time, and he just       takes more of a personal interest than anyone else I've ever       known in that position,'' said Senator James M. Inhofe,       Republican of Oklahoma and chairman of the Senate Armed       Services Committee, who has been on Capitol Hill for more       than three decades. ``He just seems to be genuinely       interested in me--and he's that way with everybody.''                            ____________________
