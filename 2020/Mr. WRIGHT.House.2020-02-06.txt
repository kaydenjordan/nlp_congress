 Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2474, the  next in the long line of job-killing legislation that we have  considered this Congress.   Dubbed by the National Retail Federation as ``the worst bill in  Congress'' and referred to by the Chamber of Commerce as a ``major  threat'' to American jobs, the bill's faults are almost too numerous to  count. Repealing state right-to-work laws, codifying harmful and  burdensome Obama-era regulations, and violating employee privacy are  truly just the tip of the iceberg.   Democrats are selling this legislation as pro-worker, but, in fact,  it's the opposite. This bill is anti-worker choice and freedom. They  would like you to believe that while they need secret ballot elections  to choose their own Party leadership, workers do not deserve that same  fundamental American right when voting to unionize.   To see the potential effects of this legislation look no further than  California. AB5 is already wreaking havoc on small business and  independent contractors across the state. Workers are having to  reevaluate their careers and livelihoods. The PRO Act includes all of  AB5's flaws but none of its numerous carveouts.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on H.R. 2474.
