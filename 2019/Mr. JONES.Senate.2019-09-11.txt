 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I get into the substance of what I  want to talk about, I am going to take my own personal opportunity to  remember those whom we lost 18 years ago today. Like everyone else, I  remember the events. I was at home with my family and young children,  not knowing what was going to happen and seeing things happen. I can  remember taking one of my kids to daycare when the second tower  collapsed and the radio announcer simply saying, ``They are both  gone,'' and the emptiness we felt.   We remember today, we honor today, and we honor not only those whom  we lost but honor those responders who were there and who still suffer  the pain from having to deal with all of that.
