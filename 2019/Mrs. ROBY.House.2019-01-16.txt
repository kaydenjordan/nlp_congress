 Mr. Speaker, 45 years ago this month, the Supreme Court of  the United States offered its infamous Roe v. Wade decision that  legalized abortion on demand in this country. While many abortion  activists celebrate this anniversary as a victory for so-called women's  health, it represents a particularly somber occasion for those of us  who advocate for life.   Since that 1973 ruling, more than 60 million unborn children in this  country have had their lives terminated by abortion. To say this is a  tragedy is an understatement--60 million.   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that I am unapologetically pro-life. I  believe that life begins at conception and that we should work harder  to build a culture that values life at every stage.   While not everyone shares my convictions about life or on certain  policies surrounding rights of unborn children, our pro-life momentum  is still strong. This Friday, thousands of Americans will gather just  outside of this building at The National Mall to participate in this  year's March for Life, an annual event where the pro-life community  comes together to advocate for the lives and rights of unborn children.  Some of the activists gathered here on Friday will have traveled from  Alabama's Second District, as far as 900 miles, to stand up for life.   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to send a message to  the thousands of pro-life marchers, especially those from southeast  Alabama I have the privilege of representing in Congress:   Thank you. Thank you for your dedication to this most worthy cause.  It is our responsibility to speak out for those who cannot speak for  themselves. I am deeply grateful for your commitment to this incredibly  important duty, and I, along with my pro-life colleagues here in  Congress, stand with you.   My promise to you is that I will continue to use this seat in  Congress that I have been given to be a vocal advocate for the unborn.  I will continue to join you in defending the defenseless. Our momentum  is strong, especially during this time each year, but our work is far  from being complete. I won't stop fighting until our laws and policies  protect life at every stage, and I hope you won't either.                            ____________________
