 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Joel Graves, principal at Lincoln County High School, for  his tremendous impact on the students in Eureka and the local  community.   Joel was selected as the recipient of the 2019 Montana Association of  Secondary School Principals' Principal of the Year award in late  January.   This prestigious award recognizes outstanding school leaders who have  succeeded in providing high-quality learning opportunities for  students, as well as demonstrating exemplary contributions to the  profession.   Joel's commitment to the young people of North Lincoln County has  earned  [[Page S5837]]  him the recognition and admiration of his colleagues, students, and  teachers across the State. His leadership as an administrator has  fostered an environment where the teachers at Lincoln County High  School can excel in providing their students a quality education. He is  a strong supporter of encouraging young Montanans to explore all  educational opportunities, including career technical training and the  trades.   It is my honor to recognize Joel Graves for his excellence as  principal of Lincoln County High School. I look forward to following  the wonderful successes that will come out of Lincoln County High  School because of Joel's leadership.                            ____________________
