 Mr. Speaker, I was in my mom's home county of Madison  County last week to announce the details of my new bill, the Local Law  Enforcement Protection Act, H.R. 4500.   I made this announcement standing alongside the respected men and  women of our local law enforcement departments across the region,  including our great Madison County sheriff, Todd Hood.   My bill protects those who protect our communities every day by  prohibiting States and localities that roll back or eliminate qualified  immunity from receiving certain Federal grants.   Law enforcement officers risk their lives to defend our homes,  families, and our neighborhoods. They face real danger. In 2020, 264  police officers were killed tragically in the line of duty. As of July  2021, that number already stands at 148.   As the defund the police movement goes mainstream in liberal cities  and State capitals, and failed progressive policies like bail reform  make our streets less safe, it is more important now than ever to stand  with our law enforcement officers.   Police should always be accountable to the communities they serve,  but they should never be subjected to unfair attacks or harassment  simply for doing their job. Efforts to remove qualified immunity are  misguided and ultimately hurt honorable officers who serve with  integrity.   That is why I introduced this legislation, and I urge my colleagues  to support this commonsense bill.                            ____________________
