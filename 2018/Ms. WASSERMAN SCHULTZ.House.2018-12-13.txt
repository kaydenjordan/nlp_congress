 Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor to stand  today in solidarity with my sister, ``mi hermana,'' Ileana Ros- Lehtinen, in calling for what is long overdue: statehood for Puerto  Rico.   The residents of Puerto Rico, more than 3 million strong, have been  U.S. citizens for more than 100 years, yet they continue to be denied  equal rights, including voting representation in this body.   This inequality has consequences. As we saw so vividly in the  aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has faced injustices that no  U.S. State would have to endure.   The Puerto Rican people have demonstrated their preference for  statehood repeatedly, and they should be given a chance to cast a  straightforward vote whose results will be respected: yes or no on  statehood.   My departing colleague from south Florida will be greatly missed in  this cause, and in so many others, but I know she will continue the  fight as a private citizen. I will fight twice as hard in her absence  to ensure equality for Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans once and for all.   I will miss you, friend. ``Te voy a extranar, amiga.''                            ____________________
