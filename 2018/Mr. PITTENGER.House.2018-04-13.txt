 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his exceptional  leadership on this important consideration and legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the gentleman from  Arkansas, as well and the whip of the Financial Services Committee, for  his work on H.R. 4790, the Volcker Rule Regulatory Harmonization Act.   Mr. Hill's legislation streamlines the rulemaking process by granting  the Federal Reserve sole authority to make exemption determinations  under the Volcker rule. This simplification is a vital change from the  confusion and the regulatory inconsistencies of the current Volcker  rule by resolving the problem of having five different regulators  weighing in on the same issue. This bill also exempts community banks  under $10 billion in assets from the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I want to note that, according to the FDIC, community  banks with less than $10 billion in assets represent 92 percent of the  insured institutions. Now, more than ever, actions like this need to be  taken to provide relief to community banks and smaller financial  institutions.    Look no further than my State in North Carolina, which has lost 50  percent of its banks since this financial crisis and the inception of  the Dodd-Frank bill. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hill for his work on this  bipartisan piece of legislation. It is long past time that we provide  commonsense reforms to overly complex regulations passed under the  Dodd-Frank Act. This is why I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in  voting ``yes'' on H.R. 4790.
