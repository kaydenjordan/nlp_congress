 Madam Speaker, I stand with my Republican colleagues  tonight as the people's House faces an unprecedented and illegitimate  impeachment process.   House Democrats' secret impeachment proceedings behind closed doors  are keeping the American people in the dark. Members in the minority  are being shut out of the process, which threatens to erode the most  basic standards of transparency in our Nation's government.   The Mueller investigation didn't give them what they wanted, so now  they conduct secret proceedings behind these closed doors. This simply  is unacceptable.   As I have continued to state on behalf of my constituents, Congress  should be legislating on behalf of the American people, not wasting  valuable legislative time and millions of taxpayer dollars.   We should be passing the USMCA and meaningful reforms for our farmers  and ranchers. We should be passing bipartisan infrastructure  legislation, and we should be addressing the devastating crisis of  missing and murdered indigenous women.   Instead, House Democrats choose to continue endless partisan  investigations and reckless impeachment inquiries. Madam Speaker, the  American people deserve more.                            ____________________
