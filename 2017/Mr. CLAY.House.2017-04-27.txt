 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this bill, the Fannie and Freddie  Open Records Act of 2017.   I want to start by thanking the sponsor of this bill, Chairman  Chaffetz, for working with the Democratic members of the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform to address concerns that we raised as  well as concerns raised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The  bipartisan cooperation that was demonstrated on this bill should be a  model for this body.   This bill would apply the Freedom of Information Act to Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac while they are in conservatorship or receivership.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are stockholder-owned, government-sponsored  enterprises chartered by Congress to purchase mortgages and pool them  into mortgage-backed securities to create liquidity in the mortgage  market.   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were brought into Federal conservatorship  under the control of FHFA in September 2008. According to the CBO,  during the financial crisis, Treasury purchased $187 billion of senior  preferred stock from the two entities to ensure that they could  continue to operate. Neither entity has drawn on Treasury support since  2012, both have returned to profitability, and the dividends they  generate are paid to the Treasury.   There are some practical concerns with the underlying bill because it  would apply FOIA to these private companies for the first time. The  amendment Chairman Chaffetz will offer addresses some of those  concerns, which I will discuss when we consider this amendment.   I would like to discuss some concerns with language that was added in  this bill at the Rules Committee to address the estimated cost of the  bill.   CBO estimates that this bill would increase the administrative costs  of Fannie and Freddie by $310 million, with $10 million of that  resulting in direct spending. This bill would address those costs by  requiring commercial requesters to pay for processing FOIA requests  made to Fannie and Freddie. This would be a significant change from the  way FOIA typically works.   It is unclear how Fannie and Freddie could reasonably estimate how  many FOIA requests they would receive or to know how to distribute  administrative costs equitably among commercial requesters.   The bill would allow Fannie and Freddie to determine how much they  [[Page H2921]]  would charge commercial requesters. Whatever cost estimation  methodologies Fannie and Freddie choose to use, the methodologies will  almost certainly be challenged, potentially leading to litigation,  which would be handled by the Department of Justice.   It is highly likely that banks would file FOIA requests to obtain  information about the business practices and holdings of Fannie and  Freddie. The costs charged to them for their requests would then be  passed on to consumers.   I believe this language was intended to be helpful, but it is one  result of applying to private companies a statute designed to apply to  government agencies. We should carefully analyze this provision and its  likely consequences as this bill moves forward in the legislative  process. There may be a better way to address this issue.   I also hope that the chairman will continue to seek ways of expanding  transparency in government, and that the committee's next step will be  to require the disclosure of White House visitor logs.   The White House recently reversed what had been the Obama  administration's policy of disclosing the records of who comes and goes  from the White House. The president of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton,  said:   ``This new secrecy policy undermines the rule of law and suggests  this White House doesn't want to be accountable to the American  people.''   I look forward to working with the chairman to address this very  troubling reversal of a critical government transparency policy.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not  opposed to the amendment.   The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Missouri is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, which  would make improvements that address concerns raised by FHFA.   The manager's amendment would make several important improvements to  the underlying bill. This amendment would provide Fannie and Freddie 6  months to implement the bill. This time is important to ensure they  have staff and procedures in place to process FOIA requests.   This amendment would also clarify that Fannie and Freddie could use  exemption 4 of FOIA in the same way that FHFA can currently use it to  protect trade secrets and commercial or financial information generated  by Fannie and Freddie.   Exemption 4 protects ``trade secrets and commercial or financial  information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.''  Exemption 4 requires that that information can only be protected if it  comes from an outside source rather than being generated by an agency  itself.   Without the language added by this amendment, there would have been  uncertainty as to whether confidential business information that would  have been protected if Fannie or Freddie sent it to FHFA would have  been protected when those entities were, themselves, responding to FOIA  requests.   I appreciate Chairman Chaffetz' willingness to work with us in  addressing these concerns, and I urge all Members to support this  manager's amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will be postponed.                     Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Clay    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in  part B of House Report 115-96.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentlewoman from the  Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), I offer amendment No. 3.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of the bill, add the following new section:       SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act, or the amendment made by this Act, may       be construed as precluding or restricting the disclosure of       information regarding any proposed new product or significant       new product term prior to loan  [[Page H2923]]       purchasing, or substantive negotiation with an interested       party regarding purchase of loans with such new product or       significant new product term.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 280, the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Clay) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment  offered by the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett). This  amendment simply makes clear that the application of FOIA to Fannie and  Freddie will not limit disclosures regarding the loans to which Fannie  and Freddie offer any type of guarantee or support.   I agree that Americans have the right to know what loans and other  agreements Fannie and Freddie are backing. Earlier this year, Fannie  Mae created a ``pilot program'' under which Fannie has backed a large  investor's purchase of foreclosed homes that the investor will then  lease. The public certainly has a right to information about such  programs.   As Ms. Plaskett's amendment makes clear, such disclosures should  occur before any loans are purchased or backed so that Congress can  assess the potential effects on all stockholders, including taxpayers,  home buyers, and renters. I appreciate the gentlewoman's thoughtful  amendment, and I urge all Members to support it.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Simpson) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1694) to  require additional entities to be subject to the requirements of  section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the  Freedom of Information Act), and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 5- minute vote on passage of the bill will be followed by a 5-minute vote  on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 425,  nays 0, not voting 5, as follows:                               [Roll No. 233]                                 YEAS--425       Abraham      Adams      Aderholt      Aguilar      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barragan      Barton      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Bergman      Beyer      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (GA)      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bost      Boyle, Brendan F.
