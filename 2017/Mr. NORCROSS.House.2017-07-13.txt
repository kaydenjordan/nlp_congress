 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I come here today to speak in opposition to the  amendment, one that would hurt the local economy, devalue workers' pay,  and take a very important tool out of the toolbox for both Republicans,  Democrats, and Americans.   Almost 100 years ago, two Republican Congressmen, James Davis and  Robert Bacon, realized there was a problem with Federal contracts.  Those contracts were unfair to the local economies. So in 1931,  Congress unanimously approved Davis-Bacon prevailing wage. It ensures  that construction workers are paid the same as construction workers in  that local community.   The prevailing wage is based on surveys of local wages and benefits,  not whether there is a union or not. It keeps the community vibrant,  and it takes into account those things that happened in that local  community. So when you hear the term ``if it ain't  [[Page H5796]]  broke don't fix it,'' this is a classic example.   They are trying to talk about surveys and methodologies. Quite  frankly, this system has worked for over 80 years. They are talking  about technicalities, but the fact of the matter is this is about  cutting wages in your local community. Why would you ever want to go  back and say, I want to hurt the people I represent? But apparently  that seems to be what we are doing.   So we want to make sure that local workers are paid a fair wage. The  system has worked fine for so many years and makes sure that those men  and women who work hard each and every day are properly compensated.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).   Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Norcross, my co-chairman of  the Congressional Building Trades Caucus, to be able to discuss this.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to this amendment offered by  my friend from Arizona. His amendment would change dramatically the  methodology used to determine wage rates paid to construction workers  across America.   While this proposal may appear to be reasonable at first blush, it  would dramatically depart from the current practice and would result in  massive pay cuts for working families.   Unlike the current system, the methodology would not take into  consideration the total value of all wages and benefits into account.  It excludes the cost of pensions, healthcare, and, vitally, training  that we need to have.   So what we are trying to say, Mr. Chairman, is the full benefit must  be considered, and it is not in this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, as someone who began in the construction industry in  1965, 52 years--after 52 years in this business, I understand how the  Davis-Bacon Act works and how it works across the country.   So let's not forget, these wage protections are not just for union  workers but for all construction workers. It ensures that the local  workers can make a fair living on projects in their community. This  amendment, unfortunately--as well intended as it might be--would  undermine that. I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Chairman, I want to just bring this back home.   Why in the world would you ever want to cut the wages of the men and  women you represent? This is about fairness, leveling the playing  field. It works, and we want to continue it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will  be postponed.          Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Thomas J. Rooney of Florida    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6  printed in House Report 115-217.   Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at  the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Strike section 541 (page 146, beginning line 20), relating       to prohibition on release of military service academy       graduates to participate in professional athletics.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Thomas J. Rooney) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.  [[Page H5797]]    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.   Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, on April 29, Secretary  Mattis issued guidance requiring graduates of the Air Force Academy,  West Point, and the Naval Academy to compete 2 years of active  commissioned service before they can seek permission to pursue a  professional sports career while at the same time fulfilling their  service obligation.   Traditionally, the service Secretaries may exercise discretion over  whether or not to permit the very few academy graduates with the  exceptional athletic talent to jointly serve either in the reserves, in  Active Duty, or a combination of both, and be part of a professional  sports team.   My amendment supports the flexibility and the discretion that has  always been built into the Secretary of Defense's discretion to  determine on a case-by-case basis how to deal with his own personnel.   Section 541 of this year's NDAA replaces Secretary Mattis guidance  with a far more stringent, one-size-fits-all policy that allows for no  exceptions, without explanation.   No one is saying that graduates should not fulfill their service  requirement. No one is saying that graduates shouldn't pay for their  education.   Section 541 is a significant departure from the policy which allows  the Secretary of Defense and the military branches discretion, and more  specifically, today, it handcuffs our own Secretary Mattis from  implementing the policy as he sees fit, just like Secretaries of the  past have always done.   Section 541 stipulates that academy graduates must fulfill, without  exception, 5 years on Active Duty before they are able to request  release to pursue an athletic career. This policy is overrigid and will  make it nearly impossible for graduates of our service academies to  pursue any professional athletic career.   Denying student athletes on a Secretary-approved, case-by-case basis  the opportunity to pursue a professional athletic career in conjunction  with their military service is a mistake. The possibility, no matter  how remote, of going pro is a powerful recruiting tool that can attract  exceptional, diverse high school athletes to attend and excel in our  service academies.   Very few college athletes are talented enough to play professionally.  I played college football and I ended up here. Most high school  athletes dream and believe that they can go pro. The truth is, most  won't. But to kill that dream before a student chooses a college also  ruins the chance of the academies from recruiting top athletes.   Why does this matter? Because striking section 541 will maintain  Secretary Mattis' policy, which was created to ensure that preserving  the option for our academy athletes, we do so in a way that maintains  the readiness and lethality of our military services. But it is also  about morale at the academies.   I taught at West Point. I serve on their board today. I served on the  Navy board before. I can tell you that if section 541 is retained, we  lose out on the boost in morale afforded to the academies with  competitive athletic departments and the recruitment benefit of the  soldier athletes' exposure with professional sports teams and their  fans.   If section 541 is retained, we will be sending a message that if you  are a highly talented high school athlete and you also want to go to  the Naval Academy, West Point, or the Air Force Academy, you need to  give up any possibility of athletic aspirations after school.   We will be doing ourselves a disservice by not recruiting the  absolute best and brightest individuals who could be so versatile  enough to be professional athletes and also serve their Nation  honorably.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
