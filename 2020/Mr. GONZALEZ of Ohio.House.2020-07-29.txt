 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman  DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves for the opportunity to briefly speak  on the bipartisan 2020 Water Resources Development Act.   I am pleased that this bill includes my legislation, the Tuscarawas  River Flooding Study Act, which authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers to conduct a comprehensive feasibility study on the  Tuscarawas River watershed.   Northeast Ohio is justifiably proud of our historical heritage  regarding the Ohio and Erie Canal. From the Portage Lakes to Canal  Fulton, this heritage is embedded throughout my district. However, this  legacy also means that cities and villages often encounter recurring  flooding events because of the historical building patterns from the  19th century.   Just last summer, southwest Summit County saw significant flooding  throughout the Tuscarawas River basin. This study will serve as a first  step toward beginning to find solutions to address these challenges.   I would like to thank the Huntington District of the Army Corps for  their extensive work with my office on this issue and Muskingum  Watershed Conservancy District for their knowledge and guidance.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
