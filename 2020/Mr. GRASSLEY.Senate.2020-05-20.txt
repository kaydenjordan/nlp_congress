 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Journalists, as we all know, serve as the watchdog for  accountability, particularly to keep government responsible. These  journalists inform and investigate issues important to their readers,  from human interests to public interests. Right now, a lot of focus is  upon the COVID-19 pandemic.   The University of Iowa's independent newspaper, the Daily Iowan, has  been named the ``Best All-Around Daily Student Newspaper'' by the  Society of Professional Journalists. This prestigious honor follows its  recognition as the 2020 ``Newspaper of the Year'' by the Iowa Newspaper  Association.   I come to the floor to commend the team of collegiate journalists in  the student-run newsroom at the Daily Iowan. These awards show that the  staff's hard work and commitment to their craft rise above the rest.   You are the cream of the crop. Congratulations and keep up the good  work.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise for two reasons: one, for a  very short comment on political prisoners in foreign lands, and the  other one on how the CARES Act is developing and the reaction to it.   First of all, our country is now hopefully recovering from COVID-19,  so I want to take this opportunity to address the plight of an  extremely vulnerable population--political prisoners abroad.   In Turkey, Syria, China, and a lot of other countries, political  prisoners remain locked away in crowded prisons without adequate  medical care. The spread of COVID-19 among this population dramatically  increases the risk of serious medical consequences or even death.   Authoritarian regimes only risk further destabilization of their  countries by jailing the innocent. Political prisoners ought to be  released, and they ought to be released now.
