 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Nebraska's Thedford High School National Science Bowl Team on winning  their regional competition and securing a position in next week's  tournament in our Nation's capital.   The National Science Bowl is one of the largest and most prestigious  academic competitions, having been created in 1991 by the Office of  Science within the U.S. Department of Energy.   Our team from Thedford High School, comprised of students David  Gordon, Andrew Gordon, Rhiannon Painter, Kalee Jepsen, and Ariel  Bryant, and led by Coach Geri Smith, brings pride to Nebraska's Third  District.   I know the constituents I represent join me in wishing them well as  they begin the tournament on Sunday, April 29, 2018. On behalf of the  people of Nebraska's Third District, I commend the Thedford High School  National Science Bowl Team for this noteworthy accomplishment, and wish  them well in the competition.   Go Knights.                            ____________________
