 Mr. President, today I am proud to honor in the  Record a dedicated Georgian who has elevated media political coverage  and served as a true ambassador of the First Amendment.   It is not every day that a politician honors a journalist on the  floor of the Senate, but when one who is as accomplished as Denis  O'Hayer of Georgia announces his upcoming retirement, it is only right  to recognize his 40 years of radio and TV work and achievements.   Denis O'Hayer will retire next month from Atlanta's National Public  Radio affiliate, WABE, where he has hosted of a number of programs  since he joined the station 2009. Since 2015, Denis has gotten the day  started for countless Atlantans who tune in for his news updates on  ``Morning Edition.'' The listenership for his program has more than  doubled since he took the helm as host. His podcast, ``Political  Breakfast,'' is a more recent hit and shows Denis's adaptability and  one of the many reasons for his success in the field of broadcast  journalism.   Denis began his work in the Atlanta media market in 1978 in radio  with WGST and as a host with Public Broadcasting Atlanta after moving  to the city from his radio career in Connecticut.   During his distinguished career, Denis has also worked in television  as a freelance reporter with CNN and as a political reporter at Atlanta  NBC affiliate WXIA-TV for 11 years.   The Atlanta Press Club, which is one of the largest and most active  professional journalism associations in the country, has benefitted  from Denis's leadership as president.   Denis, his distinguished WABE colleague Rose Scott, and their team  earned an Edward R. Murrow award in 2012 for their television broadcast  special focused on the fight against child sex trafficking in Atlanta  called ``How to Stop the Candy Shop.''   The Georgia Association of Broadcasters named Denis Broadcaster of  the Year in 2014, and in 2015, he was named to the Atlanta Press Club  Hall of Fame.   Denis is respected by colleagues across the spectrum for the quality  of his work, his professionalism, and the fact that he is a consummate  gentleman. My staff has always praised Denis, and we have looked for  ways to work together whenever possible.   Over the years, in addition to politics both local and national,  Denis and I forged a friendship and respect for each other that went  beyond work, regularly sharing reports about our families and  discussing our shared enjoyment of travel.   I wish Denis the very best of luck in his retirement, and I am  thankful that he will continue to contribute to Georgia politics as a  commentator in the future. Our political discourse will be better for  it.  [[Page S2723]]                                ____________________
