 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank,  celebrate, and congratulate my friend and colleague, Mike Conaway, who  will be leaving us to enjoy his much-deserved retirement.   Mr. Speaker, it has been a tremendous privilege and honor to serve  under Mike's leadership throughout my time on the Committee on  Agriculture, and I am grateful to have worked with such a tireless  advocate for rural America.   Mike's leadership on the 2018 farm bill was particularly impressive,  which marked the first time in nearly 30 years that a farm bill was  enacted in the same year that it was introduced. I continue to be  inspired by Mike's principles in leadership outside of committee work  as well. I have been lucky enough to share many Wednesday mornings with  him as a brother of faith during Bible study.   Mr. Speaker, I send my very best wishes to Mike and his wife,  Suzanne, who has been kind enough to share him with us for over the  last 16 years.   I thank Mike for his friendship and guidance over the years. He will  be sincerely missed.                            ____________________
