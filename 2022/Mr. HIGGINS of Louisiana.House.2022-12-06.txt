 Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to speak on  behalf of the people of the country that we serve, the oath that we  have sworn, and bid some words of adoration and respect for our brother  and friend, Louie Gohmert.   I have described Louie as a living Founding Father. To those that  have inquired as to whether I have known him, which from sea to shining  sea, it is a common question as we travel in service to ``we the  people,'' we are asked: ``Do you know this fellow? Do you know that  lady?'' It is quite common to be asked: ``Do you know Louie Gohmert?''  I am honored to say yes.   Louie has represented not just the people of his district, and by  extension the Nation that we love and have sworn to serve, but he has  represented the foundational core principles that gave birth to our  Nation.   In Matthew, the words of the Lord stated: ``Blessed are those who  hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.''   You, my brother Louie, should feel satisfied within your soul, good  sir, because you have brought the very essence of pure principle and  spirit to this great body. This Chamber shall forever resonate with  your words and your love for God and country. I am honored to have  worked with you, to call you brother and friend.                                time  1800
