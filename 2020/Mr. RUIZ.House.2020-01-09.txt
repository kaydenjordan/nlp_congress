 Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that on National Law  Enforcement Appreciation Day, I rise to recognize California Highway  Patrol Assistant Division Chief Laura Quattlebaum for her years with  the California Highway Patrol and congratulate her on her retirement.   Assistant Chief Quattlebaum is a shining example of the selflessness  and courage our Nation's law enforcement possesses. She is truly an  amazing woman, full of passion, character, and integrity. I am humbled  to have worked alongside her in our community, and I am honored to call  her my friend.   For more than 30 years, Assistant Chief Quattlebaum has served as a  dedicated public officer for my constituents, as well as countless  other Californians. After graduating from the CHP academy she went on  to act as public information officer for the city of Indio.   From this critical position to her current role as California Highway  Patrol assistant chief, she has answered the call to defend our public  safety many times. Throughout her career, Assistant Chief Quattlebaum  has been recognized on numerous occasions for her outstanding work. As  lieutenant in the Indio area, she received the Commissioner's  Commendation for Leadership and Cultural Awareness and Racial Profile  training.   Six years later, Assemblyman Brian Nestande awarded her the 2013  Women of Distinction award, and in 2014, Assemblyman Manuel Perez  presented her with the Woman of the Year award in recognition of her  service to the people of California.   Assistant Chief Quattlebaum is known to her colleagues as a  hardworking and selfless leader. Her commitment to bettering the lives  of others is reflected in her tireless advocacy for those she served  alongside and for peace officers throughout the country.   I have witnessed this commitment firsthand on multiple occasions,  notably, when we worked together to more than double our Nation's  funding for mental health services for our local law enforcement  agencies just last year.   Assistant Chief Quattlebaum's career in public service is a true  testament to her devotion to community, country, and public safety. Her  unwavering dedication to the people of California is admirable.   On behalf of California's 36th Congressional District, I thank  Assistant Chief Quattlebaum for her years of service and thank all of  our law enforcement agents who work tirelessly to uphold the safety of  our communities.   I congratulate Assistant Chief Quattlebaum on her retirement. We must  carry the spirit of National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day with us  every day by showing our gratitude for our public safety officers year- round.                              Conflict with Iran     Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of Americans in my district  and across the country who are anxious that the events of this past  week are sending us down a path to war with Iran.   Over the past week, I have been thinking most about our  servicemembers and their families, the people whose lives will be  immediately and irreversibly affected by the decision to go to war:  sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, siblings, our neighbors and our  friends, who will put at risk their lives; families worried about their  loved ones put in harm's way; servicemembers who have seen multiple  deployments and are now faced with the prospect of being sent overseas  yet again.   Our veterans and their families have dealt with the human toll of war  for nearly 20 years. It is time for a new approach. Americans don't  want another endless war in the Middle East. After 19 years of  conflict, America doesn't need another war. We do not want reckless,  high-risk provocations of war that make Americans less safe for years  to come.   That is why I urge President Trump to deescalate the situation and  pursue a diplomatic path forward. In the meantime, I hope everyone will  join me in continuing to pray for the servicemembers overseas defending  our Nation and for a strategic, peaceful solution to avoid another  costly war in the Middle East.  [[Page H70]]                                ____________________     Mr. Chair, there was an excellent question posed by a  nonphysician as to why it would be safe for a medical device to exist  within the baby and approved by the FDA, and I think it is important to  understand the physiology of what is the pathophysiology of these  chemicals in the human body.    The danger with these chemicals is when they actually cross either  the air-blood barrier or are deposited into tissue, whether they are  ingested, inhaled in a specific form, that then gets deposited and  accumulates over time.   When they are packaged in a specific device, they don't necessarily  start to get absorbed or within a certain amount to prevent certain  illnesses. But when you break them down into  [[Page H121]]  chemical reactions to actually get deposited, then that is when you  come up with illnesses.   That is why it is so dangerous, because in terms of the tissue, in  terms of the route of ingestion, in terms of the different forms of the  way it is accumulated, it can have dire effects.   Ninety-seven percent of Americans have or have had harmful PFAS  chemicals in their bloodstream. They are known as forever chemicals  because, once consumed, they take years and years and years to leave  your body.   We eat these chemicals when our foods are stored in PFAS-containing  packages. And, like I said, there is some leakage there. We drink them  when they accumulate in our drinking water in their most basic form.  And PFAS can also be passed along during pregnancy and breastfeeding  when they are in their smallest form as well.   Even small levels of exposure to PFAS have been shown to harm  people's immune systems.   Again, this is through the medical-scientific literature. The  medical-scientific literature has shown that small levels of exposure  to PFAS have shown harm to people's immune systems, increase their risk  of certain types of cancer, and affect thyroid function.    Even small levels of PFAS can be harmful to the public's  health.   The PFAS Action Act of 2019 will help address this public health  issue by establishing a maximum contaminant level for PFAS in drinking  water, provide funds to help communities remove PFAS from their  drinking water, and require continuing monitoring of PFAS. It also  provides millions specifically for disadvantaged communities harmed by  PFAS-affected water systems.   Having clean water to drink is a common good for everyone, not a  privilege for the few.   I urge everybody to vote ``yes.''    I do not know the answer.    What I can answer is that PFAS can be harmful to one's  health even though they may have a utility for a medical device.
