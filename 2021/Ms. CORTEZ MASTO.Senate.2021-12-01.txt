 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this morning, the Supreme Court  heard arguments about whether it is constitutional for Mississippi to  ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. This is by far the biggest  threat to Roe v. Wade in almost three decades.   I am here today to sound the alarm and call on my colleagues to stand  with me to protect the health of America's women.   There is every reason to think that extreme Justices on the Supreme  Court are poised to either overturn Roe or fatally undermine it. If the  Supreme Court gets rid of Roe, which has been the law of the land for  five decades, each individual State will decide whether to let women  control their own bodies and their own lives.   Without Roe, abortion will be immediately illegal in about 12 States,  and more than a dozen others will likely put severe abortion  restrictions in place. It is even possible that a future Republican  Congress would try to restrict abortion nationally.   Now, you know reproductive rights have been protected for so long in  the United States that it has been easy for us to forget what happens  when we don't safeguard them. But when women cannot control what  reproductive care they receive, their health suffers--their physical,  emotional, and economic health--and the health and welfare of their  entire families.   We can see that now in Texas, where a new law creates incentives for  vigilantes to pry into their neighbors' lives by letting anyone sue who  would aid and abet abortions and get a $10,000 reward for doing so.   Texas doctors have reported that they are afraid to give essential  medical advice to women at risk of life-threatening complications in  their pregnancies. One woman in Texas was even refused care for an  ectopic pregnancy, which cannot be carried to term and must be  terminated to save the patient's life.   Women seek access to reproductive care for all kinds of reasons-- reasons  [[Page S8846]]  that are personal and intimate and sometimes heartbreaking. And  Americans understand this. They get it. Three out of every four of us,  including the vast majority of Nevadans, agree that the people who  should be making decisions about pregnancies are women and their  doctors.   It is unthinkable to me, then, that the Court is on the verge of  taking that decision away from women and medical professionals and  giving it to politicians instead.   If Roe v. Wade is overturned, nearly half of women nationwide will  see the nearest clinic close. The average distance to the nearest  reproductive healthcare clinic will go up by more than 10 times, from  25 miles to 279 miles.   Now, if you have ever worked for minimum wage, you know that taking  days to travel across State lines for healthcare is a luxury that many  Americans can't afford. That is reality for many low-income women,  including women of color.   We have to stop treating women's healthcare as optional.   In Nevada--and I say to the Presiding Officer, you know this better  than anyone in the Senate--we have worked hard to protect reproductive  health. In the nineties, we passed a ballot initiative to enshrine  choice into law.   More recently, in Nevada, we have done away with the kind of  restrictions on abortion that are popping up in State after State. But  make no mistake, as long as there are active efforts to eliminate the  right to choose, whether in the courts or in Congress, the reproductive  freedom of women everywhere is in jeopardy.   We must do everything we can to protect a woman's right to choose.  That is why it is so vital that Congress pass the Women's Health  Protection Act. This bill would outlaw bans and other medically  unnecessary restrictions on abortion across the country. It would mean  that States could not impose medically unnecessary ultrasounds,  excessive waiting periods, and other extreme burdens on healthcare  providers intended to limit abortion access. It would guarantee women  control over their reproductive decisions, in consultation with medical  professionals.   Now, that is what three-quarters of us think is right. I will do  everything I can in the Senate to protect women in Nevada and across  this country, and I would hope that our colleagues would join us.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 9 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
