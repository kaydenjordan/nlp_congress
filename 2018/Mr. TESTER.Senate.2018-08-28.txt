 Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the 152,000 Montanans  whose healthcare coverage is currently in jeopardy.   Next week, a Texas courthouse will become the newest battlefield in  the war against our healthcare. The latest attack is a lawsuit  attempting to get rid of legal protections for folks with preexisting  conditions. These are protections that make it illegal for insurance  companies to deny healthcare coverage or charge absurd rates because of  common conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes or heart disease  or cancer or even pregnancy.   These protections were signed into law almost 10 years ago, passed by  majorities in both the House and in the Senate. Despite many attempts  to undermine them, they have been upheld by the Supreme Court and  continue to be supported by Members of both parties in Congress. That  is because an overwhelming majority--more than three-fourths--of  Americans support these protections. In fact, the Kaiser Family  Foundation recently reported  [[Page S5999]]  that 88 percent of Democrats, 77 percent of Independents, and 58  percent of Republicans think it is very important to maintain  protections for folks with preexisting conditions.   So why are we even here?   Well, in June, the Department of Justice announced it would stop  defending these critical protections in court. That is correct. You  heard it right. A bunch of unelected bureaucrats have decided to stop  defending the law of the land that protects folks with preexisting  conditions. This decision not only harms millions of Americans, it  threatens to create chaos in the marketplace and could drive up  healthcare costs, not to mention it is a dereliction of duty.   Now, I know we all wake up some days, and we would just rather go  fishing, but a job is a job, and you just can't decide it is not worth  doing, especially when your job is to defend protections for millions  of Americans and thousands of Montanans with preexisting conditions.   Montanans like Christina, from Missoula, who told me last week about  how the Justice Department's decision could impact her husband who  suffers from a chronic type of leukemia that can be managed but not  cured. Christina wrote:         Six years ago, we started the cancer journey when my       husband was diagnosed with CLL, a type of lymphoma/leukemia.       Thankfully, he found work and is receiving the care he needs       to manage his chronic disease that has no cure. But if he       could be denied health insurance because of a preexisting       condition, my husband probably would not have received the       care he needs.    Karen, from Belgrade, MT, wrote something similar, saying:         I am very concerned about the DOJ's decision to no longer       defend Americans against insurance companies who want to       disallow people with preexisting conditions. I am a cancer       survivor, as is my 22-year-old son. It is frightening to       think that both of us may be uninsurable in the future if       this trend continues.    Kim, from Helena, wrote me and said:         I have been a Type 1 diabetic for 35 years--and the burden       is heavy. The cost of insulin continues to soar to the point       that some people have to choose between their insulin or       their rent, food, or other medication. I have good health       insurance through my employer, which makes the financial cost       of my diabetes manageable. But if preexisting conditions       weren't covered, my next health insurer could simply choose       not to cover my diabetes.    I am here to tell you, there are thousands of others in Montana like  Karen, Kim, and Christina. In fact, a new report released today, also  by the Kaiser Family Foundation, found that without current  protections--without current protections--52 million Americans could be  denied healthcare coverage because of a preexisting condition.   The report broke this number down even further and found that in  Billings, MT--our State's largest city--one out of every four adults  between the ages of 18 and 64 have a preexisting condition that could  prevent them from getting healthcare coverage if our current  protections were repealed. That is not to mention the thousands of  others who could be charged higher rates or denied reimbursement for  care if these protections disappear.   Instead of doing their job and protecting folks like Kim and Karen  and Christina, a bunch of unelected bureaucrats in the Department of  Justice have decided to help repeal a law that it is their job to  defend.   Well, if they will not protect Montanans, then we will. That is why I  have helped introduce legislation that will authorize the Senate to  intervene in next week's lawsuit and defend protections for people with  preexisting conditions.   I would be the first to say that our healthcare system isn't perfect,  but folks are no longer denied coverage or forced to pay higher  premiums because of common ailments like high blood pressure, diabetes,  or cancer, and the vast majority of Americans, on both sides of the  aisle, want to keep it that way.   That is why a group of my colleagues from across the aisle introduced  a bill last week to try and preserve some of these protections. That  might sound good in theory, but in reality it will still threaten  people with preexisting conditions.   That is why I am calling on my colleagues to pass our resolution,  which will ensure folks with preexisting conditions get the coverage  they need. The thousands of Montanans and millions of Americans who  rely on these protections deserve nothing less.   With that, I yield the floor.
