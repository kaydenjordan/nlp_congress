 Mr. President, I appreciate what my colleague from Ohio  said. I appreciate his comments about Senator McCain and Cindy McCain.  I made remarks on the floor earlier about Senator McCain in my tribute  to him, as my colleagues are all doing, as we should, and as people  have done so well.   I appreciate particularly Senator Portman's comments about the sex  trafficking issue that Senator McCain was so interested in, and Cindy  really led the way. I saw Cindy at a conference in Cincinnati, Senator  Portman's hometown. I live at the other end of the State. Her passion  about that issue clearly infected John and his passion about that issue  especially. North of Cincinnati, along the 75 corridor and especially  in Toledo, we see how troubling that is. He took on so many issues that  matter. I thank Rob for mentioning that.
