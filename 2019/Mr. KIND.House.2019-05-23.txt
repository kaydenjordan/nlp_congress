 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong support of the SECURE Act. This legislation is meant  to address one of the great gaps we have in retirement savings:  employees in small businesses, primarily affecting women, minorities,  and young adults.  [[Page H4141]]    I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their  leadership on the issue. I want to thank my good friend   Mike Kelly  for partnering with me throughout this process, along with former  colleagues Dave Reichert and Pat Tiberi, with whom I had a chance to  work on this issue in particular.   I also want to thank the Representative in the chair today,  Representative Elaine Luria, our commander. She is the one who  introduced the Gold Star fix. It was a mistake that was made in the Tax  Code that adversely affects survivor benefits for children of our  fallen soldiers.   It also fixes distributions to Native American children and to  students who receive scholarships and grants. I thank her for her  leadership on it.   This is a good, bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation. I  encourage my colleagues to support it.
