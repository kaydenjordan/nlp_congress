 Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  speak about the very important role that emergency medical services  play in our communities. Moreover, in rural areas like my State of  Vermont, many of these ambulance drivers, paramedics,  [[Page S4842]]  and emergency medical technicians are volunteers, making significant  personal and financial sacrifices to keep the rest of us safe. We owe  them all a very deep debt of gratitude.   In particular, I would like to mention one individual from my State  of Vermont: Chris ``Jake'' Jakubiak. This year, the American Ambulance  Association honored Chris as a ``Star of Life,'' for his exceptional  skills and commitment to his patients and community. In addition to his  full-time job, for the past 14 years, Chris has served as a part-time  emergency medical technician. Chris has also been a volunteer  firefighter for the past 31 years. To my mind, this kind of selfless  service to his community makes Chris a true hero.   Of course, Chris is not alone in this regard. Emergency medical  services are a critical component of a robust primary care system in  the health infrastructure in Vermont and all across the country; yet it  is clear they face significant challenges in terms of recruiting and  retaining volunteers, stocking enough medication, and accessing  essential equipment. To my mind, if a person is willing to risk their  life to protect others, then we in Congress should be able to provide  them with the resources they need to do the job. That should include  incentives for young people to become paramedics and emergency medical  technicians and funding for these providers to purchase enough naloxone  and EpiPens and maintain emergency vehicles, among other solutions.   At a time when we are relying more and more on our first responders  to protect our communities from crises like the opioid epidemic and  natural disasters, we must do everything we can to support these hard- working and dedicated neighbors.                            ____________________
