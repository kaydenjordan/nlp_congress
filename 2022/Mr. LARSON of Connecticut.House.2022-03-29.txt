 Mr. Speaker, clearly, the COVID pandemic  has struck America extraordinarily hard. Nearly a million Americans  have died from COVID-19, but it has been especially hurtful to our  elderly. More than 720,000 of the people who have perished were over  the age of 65.   This underscores all the more reason why the United States Congress  needs to fix Social Security. Congress has not addressed the issue of  extending Social Security for more than 50 years. It is long overdue  that the United States Congress live up to its responsibility and make  sure it enhances the benefits.   A gallon of milk cost 72 cents in 1971. You-all know what it costs  today, as well as the price of gas, prescription drugs, and the cost of  rent, et cetera. Yet, Social Security has not been enhanced in more  than 50 years.   Mr. Speaker, this is exactly why the United States Congress needs to  act. I am proud of the proposal of President Biden and the fact that  Social Security 2100: A Sacred Trust will be brought to the floor.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal and  Leader Brady--what an outstanding example of bipartisan cooperation.  But especially as it relates to what has amounted to a financial  retirement crisis, this clearly will help aid in the work that has  already been done by Chairman Neal with regard to both the SECURES Act  and the Butch Lewis Act, but this even adds more flexibility and also  provides an automatic opportunity for people to put money forward.    I went to the Aetna School of Insurance and they said there are three  legs on this table: personal savings, pension, and Social Security.  This helps address the pension issue as no one can. Again, I want to  commend Mr. Neal and Mr. Brady for their efforts, and point out that we  have another leg on that stool that is called Social Security that  Congress hasn't addressed in more than 50 years. I commend the chairman  as we go through the process of markup on that as well.
