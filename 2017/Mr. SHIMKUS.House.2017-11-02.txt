 Mr. Speaker, today is a big day. I want to congratulate  my colleague and friend, Mr. Brady, the chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee, and the committee for the rollout of our tax reform  proposal, the first time in over 30 years.   For the individual, what do we get?   We get a fairer, flatter, simpler Tax Code. We are lowering the  rates. We are doubling personal exemptions. And guess what. Most  Americans will be able to file their tax returns on a postcard.   For corporate America, we get a reduction from 35 percent to 20  percent, which will make us competitive across the world. Most  countries in the major industrialized nations tax their corporations at  a 20 percent rate.   We will eliminate most every loophole that will deprive special  interests of being able to interrupt and intercede in that Tax Code.   For what purpose?   A simple purpose: more money in individuals' pockets, and a growing,  thriving economy for all Americans.   Again, I congratulate Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means  Committee. I look forward to seeing quick passage on the floor.                            ____________________
