 Madam Speaker, I rise today to give thanks for the service  of David M. Friedman, recently our Ambassador from the United States to  Israel.   As Ambassador, Mr. Friedman strengthened our bond with Israel, took  our partnership to new heights, secured peaceful relationships for  Israel in the Middle East, and was influential in moving the U.S.  Embassy to Jerusalem.   Through his diligent work, Mr. Friedman set in motion the peaceful  resolution of Israel-Arab conflicts. His hard work and service set the  standard for building U.S. diplomatic relationships, and earned him a  well-deserved nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.   I would like to thank Ambassador Friedman for his service, and wish  him success in his future endeavors.                            ____________________
