 Madam Speaker, following   Jim Jordan is like why  nobody wanted to follow Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. It is going to be  tough.   But you never reduce burdens or inflation by increasing taxes $740  billion. It is estimated that there is a $4,500 increase on the average  family under this proposal. Instead, you simply create more government  that never goes away.   This is not an inflation reduction act. It is a woke climate bill  that will increase inflation, Madam Speaker.   Madam Speaker, my Democrat friends seem to have forgotten that  capitalism is not the enemy; we are.   I would also remind my colleagues across the aisle that, in  Tennessee, we reduced taxes and regulations, and now we have record  surpluses. Individuals and businesses are moving from your district to  mine as fast as they can get there.   Madam Speaker, the ranking member, who I call chairman, will be  incredibly missed here in these Halls, but also more so out on the  baseball field.
