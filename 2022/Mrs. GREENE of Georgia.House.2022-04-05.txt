 Mr. Speaker, right now, the American people  are over $30 trillion in debt because Congress is incapable of being  responsible with the American people's hard-earned tax dollars.   Over $30 trillion in debt and counting is a sum total that we will  never be able to pay back in our lifetimes, our children's lifetimes,  our grandchildren's lifetimes, our great-grandchildren's lifetimes, and  so forth.   Our dollar is on the verge of crashing. We are also on the verge of  being the competitive currency with another foreign country's currency,  possibly China. We are not in good shape financially.   We also are looking at 7.9 percent inflation and rising, with nothing  to stop it. We are looking at gas prices that are getting so expensive  that people can hardly afford to fill up their gas tanks.   Crime is out of control, and there is no reason for that. But coming  up, on May 23, the Biden administration is going to suspend title 42,  which is going to allow approximately an estimated 18,000 illegal  aliens to come across our border.   If you total this up, in over 5 months, we are looking at potentially  over 2.7 million people coming in throughout the summer and into the  fall. This is unsustainable. This is also against our Constitution and  is completely irresponsible.   Now, we have something coming up that Congress is going to be voting  on, a 41-page COVID-19 supplemental bill because, for some reason, we  are supposed to be spending more money that we don't have on future  COVID and future COVID variants and future COVID vaccines because,  really, that makes a lot of sense.   Why is that an emergency? It is in the future.   This bill, at $10 billion, of which up to $9 billion is for the  Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority--what is the  purpose of that? It is in the future. Is this gain of function  research? We have a lot of questions, but we don't have answers.   This is also--for future COVID, by the way--supposed to provide $750  million in efforts to fight future variants to build future vaccine  manufacturing capacity.   Haven't our vaccine manufacturers made enough money when COVID  vaccines were mandated across the country? They are still making a lot  of money.    We have already spent $4.6 trillion in resources on COVID, $4.16  trillion in obligations, $3.63 trillion in outlays across 44 government  agencies.   The U.S. has made $825 billion in direct payments. The U.S. has  issued $845 billion in loans. The U.S. has given $540 billion in  grants, $50 billion in contracts, mostly through HHS and Defense, and  so forth and on and more spending and more spending. Again, we are over  $30 trillion in debt.   Currently, the death rate for COVID is 1.22 percent. By the way, this  death rate has continued to go down, thankfully. We are all thankful  for that. Yet, Congress wants to spend more money for future COVID, for  future vaccines, and for future variants when there is no need to do  so.   What we should be doing is we should be helping Americans get back to  work. We should be helping small businesses.   Most of all, we should be securing our southern border to protect our  country and our national security interests, and to protect our people,  instead of being completely concerned and wrapped up in another  country's border and their people.   While we are failing Americans here at home, we are too concerned  about countries abroad.                                time  1030    Now, we have other serious problems. We have things that more  Americans have been ignored on. There have been approximately 11,943  deaths reported on VAERS, but no investigation. There have also been  1,676 miscarriages reported on VAERS; 5,592 heart attacks reported on  VAERS; 5,164 cases of myocarditis reported on VAERS; 13,230 permanently  disabled cases reported on VAERS, yet no investigation. But we are  supposed to spend $10 billion on future COVID, future variants, future  vaccines?   If we are going to spend some money, why don't we spend some money  looking into these cases reported on VAERS?   This is why I introduced the Justice for Vaccine Victims Act of 2022  because there needs to be an investigation.                            ____________________
