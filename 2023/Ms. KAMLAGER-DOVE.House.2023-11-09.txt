 Madam Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of  Ruth Lavine, who passed away at the age of 103.   Ruth was born in Hamburg, Germany, but emigrated to Los Angeles as  the Nazi Party was rising to power in the 1930s.   Ruth became a lifelong Trojan, receiving both her undergraduate and  law degrees from the University of Southern California. She was one of  only five female students in her USC Law School class.   Ruth and her husband, Dick, married in 1944, spending 50 wonderful  years together.   Ruth enjoyed an active role in her children's lives and maintained  involvement in the Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the L.A.  County Bar Association, and Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles.   Ruth established a scholarship in her husband's memory to help  students at USC Law School, just one of her many philanthropic efforts  for her alma mater in the heart of our district, the 37th.   She is survived by her children, Cathy and Raymond, and her three  grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.   Madam Speaker, I hope everyone will join me in mourning the loss of  Ruth Lavine and celebrating her life of full love and learning.                            ____________________
