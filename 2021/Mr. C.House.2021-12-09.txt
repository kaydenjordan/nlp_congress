 SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today in  honor of the passing of Carol Jenkins Barnett.   Carol was the daughter of Publix Super Markets founder George  Jenkins. She carried the mantle of generosity and philanthropy on  behalf of the Jenkins family and Publix Super Market Charities,  benefiting the residents of Lakeland, Polk County, the State of  Florida, and beyond.   Carol had a remarkable love for her family and for the families of  our community, advocating especially for children and early childhood  education with her time and talent as well as her treasure.   She impacted so many people and so many communities in ways both seen  and unseen. Quite simply, I have never known a more generous person  than Carol Jenkins Barnett.   We will be praying for Carol's husband, Barney; their sons, Wesley  and Nicholas; and their families as they mourn the loss of this  exceptional woman.   Carol will be missed, but her legacy endures in the generations she  has touched.  [[Page H7560]]                                ____________________     Scott Franklin).    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Comer for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this legislation and the  en bloc package, particularly amendment No. 29. This amendment would  continue Democratic attempts to federalize elections.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to call us  Republicans seditionists, yet here they are again attempting to violate  the Constitution and our democratic republic by injecting the Federal  Government into State elections.   I would like to remind the Democrats that Article I, Section 4 of the  Constitution reads: ``The times, places, and manner of holding  elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each  State by the legislature thereof''--not by Congress.   Our country is struggling with out-of-control inflation, supply chain  shortages, rampant crime, and a crisis on our southern border. Yet,  Democrats are focused on violating the Constitution for their own  political gain.   When H.R. 1 was passed earlier this Congress, we had assumed that the  Democrats were done trying to take election powers away from the  States. As it turns out, they were just getting started.   Mr. Speaker, at what point are we going to start focusing on the real  issues facing this country? At what point are the Democrats going to  realize that America doesn't want out-of-control spending, open  borders, and rampant crime?    The Founding Fathers were clear that the States are the primary  managers of elections. We must address the real problems facing the  American people and stop stripping States of their constitutional  authorities.                  Scott Franklin of Florida, Mr. Tiffany, Mr. Mann, and               Mr. Balderson):        H.R. 6212. A bill to analyze the impacts of establishing       U.S. Customs and Border Protection Preclearance facilities in       Taiwan and in other Indo-Pacific countries; to the Committee       on Homeland Security, and in addition to the Committee on       Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by       the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such       provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee       concerned.            By Mr. CICILLINE (for himself, Mr. Sires, Mr. McGovern,               Mr. Cohen, Ms. DeGette, Ms. Norton, and Mr.               Swalwell):        H.R. 6213. A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United       States Code, to restrict the ability of a person whose       Federal license to import, manufacture, or deal in firearms       has been revoked, whose application to renew such a license       has been denied, or who has received a license revocation or       renewal denial notice, to transfer business inventory       firearms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the       Judiciary.            By Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts (for herself, Mrs. Hayes,               Mr. Lieu, Ms. Sanchez, and Ms. Underwood):        H.R. 6214. A bill to effectively staff the high-need public       elementary schools and secondary schools of the United States       with school-based mental health services providers; to the       Committee on Education and Labor.            By Mr. COHEN (for himself, Mr. Garcia of Illinois, Ms.               Lee of California, Mr. Takano, Ms. Norton, Mr. Rush,               Mr. Khanna, Ms. Schakowsky, Mr. Grijalva, and Mr.               Carson):        H.R. 6215. A bill to prohibit air carriers from imposing       fees that are not reasonable and proportional to the costs       incurred by the air carriers, and for other purposes; to the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
