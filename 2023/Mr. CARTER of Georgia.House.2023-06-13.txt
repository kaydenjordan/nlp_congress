 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of Sister Lourdes Sheehan.   Sister Sheehan, a Savannah, Georgia, native and Sister of Mercy for  nearly 70 years, helped expand Catholic education throughout the  Southeast.   She earned both her master's and doctorate in education, quickly  applying her knowledge and skills not just to the classroom but also to  curriculum development.   Sister Sheehan oversaw religious education in Richmond, Virginia,  served as the executive director of the National Association of Boards  of Catholic Education, and was the first woman to ever serve as  secretary of education for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops  throughout her career.   For her dedicated work, she received a medal from Pope Benedict XVI,  and numerous other awards from universities and professional  organizations alike.   We mourn the loss of Sister Sheehan and thank her and God for the  thousands of lives she helped to educate.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding and for hosting us here today.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1640 because, yet again,  House Republicans are on the front lines of stopping President Biden's  executive overreaching. Last week, it was trucks, and this week, it is  gas stoves.   This bill will prevent the Department of Energy from telling the  American people which stoves they can use in their own homes. According  to the Department of Energy, these new rules would eliminate 50 percent  of the current stovetops on the market.   I am honestly astounded that we even need to pass a bill letting  people have the freedom to choose the surface they cook on for their  families. The President and his army of unelected bureaucrats will not  stop meddling in the personal lives of the American people.   I, along with 187 million Americans, use gas stoves every day because  it is more affordable and reliable than electric stovetops. My  constituents who use gas stoves in their homes save over $1,000 a year  compared to all-electric homes.   To justify this overreach, the Biden administration is using a study  from the Rocky Mountain Institute, which so happens to also be a  partner with the Chinese Government.   For an administration dead set on forcing a radical climate agenda on  the American people, I find it odd that they would take aim at an  appliance that emits 22 percent less carbon dioxide than a comparable  electric model.   This is bigger than just stoves, though. Since the beginning of his  administration, Joe Biden has had it out for natural gas, a cheap,  clean, American source of energy, not to mention that over 4 million  Americans are also connected to the natural gas industry in some way.   Today, we stand against the Biden administration and say, no, you  cannot govern unilaterally from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.   Mr. Chair, I look forward to voting ``yes'' on the bill, and I urge  my friends in the Senate to take up its consideration.
