 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my  support for the impeachment of Donald J. Trump.   Today's vote to impeach the President is sobering. While I have deep  disagreements with President Trump on immigration, health care, climate  change and other policy areas, I did not come to Washington to impeach  the President. I came to represent the voices of my constituents and I  take my duty very seriously.   The facts tell a disturbing yet highly consistent story. The  President's misdeeds have been verified by an immense body of evidence  and the testimony of dozens of witnesses--including civil servants and  constitutional scholars of the highest caliber. President Trump abused  his power to bribe another country for his own personal and political  gain. This is wrong.   I voted to impeach President Trump to do right by my constituents,  the future of our democracy, and to uphold the rule of law and my oath  to defend the Constitution. The facts are clear. The President  obstructed Congressional investigations by instructing his accomplices  to ignore compulsory calls to testify before Congress. No matter how he  tries to spin it, President Trump violated the Constitution and must be  held accountable. Regrettably, House and Senate Republicans are going  along with the President's lies and attempts to cover up his actions.  [[Page H12197]]    No one is above the law, not even the President.   Donald Trump indisputably violated the Constitution and is, without a  shadow of a doubt, no longer fit to discharge the duties of the  President of the United States of America.   I urge my colleagues to support these articles of impeachment.
