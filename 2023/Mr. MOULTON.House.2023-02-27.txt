 Mr. Speaker, our lives are dominated by smart devices,  not just smart cars, smartphones, and smartwatches, but dryers,  refrigerators, and even toasters. These technologies make our lives  easier, but most Americans don't know that their refrigerator has the  ability to listen or to watch.   Despite the fact that well over 60 million homes are actively using  smart home devices, our laws regulating this technology have lagged.  Big Tech has been able to move the privacy goalposts with impunity, so  it is past time for a new generation of digital privacy laws.   That is why I put forward the Informing Consumers about Smart Devices  Act along with my colleagues, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis) and  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).   This bill would require the Federal Trade Commission to establish  guidelines for properly disclosing the audio or visual recording  capabilities of smart devices. There is widespread support for this  legislation, from consumer advocacy groups to the tech companies  themselves.   Americans deserve the chance to make informed decisions about the  electronic eavesdroppers we allow into our homes. Let's pass this bill  so that our consumers know when Big Tech is listening.                                time  1745
