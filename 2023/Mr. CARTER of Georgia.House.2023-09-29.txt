 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  William ``Buck'' Crosby. He served as an educator of chemistry and  biology for 40 years at Risley High School and retired as the interim  superintendent of Glynn County Schools.   He was a member of the YWCA Foundation Board, where he held the  position as first vice president of the Golden Isles Arts and  Humanities Association.   He was the recipient of many awards in his community, including being  inducted into the Benedict College Class of 2023 Athletic Hall of Fame.  He was also the first and only African-American chairman of the  Hospital Authority, and he was the first African American to receive  the 10th Bishop of the Diocese of Georgia Bishop's Award.   He will be remembered as a teacher, an administrator, a friend to  all, and an example for all of us to live up to.   I extend my deepest sympathies to his family.                            ____________________
