 Madam Speaker, first of all, I would like to start out  with some housekeeping.   A lot has been said over the last few days about the huge number of  IRS employees that are intended to be added by the Biden  administration, and I just want to clarify some numbers.   There are new employees who are going to replace retired employees,  but there are still 25,000 new employees who are going to be added to  the Internal Revenue Service.   I should point out that, over time, you would expect--and this  apparently surprises some people--you would expect the number of IRS  employees to drop.   I used to do taxes. I haven't done those for over 25 years now. Even  at that time, as things became more computerized, if you got interest  income or dividend income or capital gain income, the IRS would match  up those numbers with what appeared on your tax return.   If you got from U.S. Bank $1,000, and you didn't put it on your  return, you could expect a letter in the mail: Where is the $1,000?  Please give us another $300 in taxes.    You do not need more employees to do that sort of thing. Again, when  you talk about 25,000 more employees than the past, for a State the  size of Wisconsin, that is really a small army of 500 new employees.   Sometimes, it is easier to bring down to the State level because we  deal with such big numbers. Whether you are talking about  Massachusetts, Maryland, Missouri, or Washington State, they all can  expect about 500 new employees. While there may be some people  cheating, an increase of that size is just inappropriate.                                 Immigration     Let's look one more time at the new numbers that were  released over Christmas break as far as the immigration situation in  this country.   We have a new all-time record for the number of people coming here in  November, over 200,000, 210,000 people. These numbers were released, by  the way, late on a Friday, Friday as always, so the mainstream press,  which already does a bad job of covering this issue, does not bring  them up.   A lot of the focus has been on title 42. While that didn't go into  effect, it didn't stop there from becoming an all-time high.   When I talk about 210,000 in November 2022, a year before that, we  were at 131,000 for November. The year before that, before President  Biden took office, we were around 20,000. We have gone from 20,000 to  210,000.   I am somebody who believes in intact families. Just as scary is the  callousness of the Biden administration to the degree to which the open  border situation tears apart families. In November, there were over  9,000 unaccompanied minors released to sponsors apart from their  parents. A year ago, instead of 9,000 people being broken away from  their parents, we had about 10,000, again, the Biden administration. A  year before that, the final year of another administration was 1,200.  There were months in which we had under 200 unaccompanied minors enter  the country. We are now over 9,000.   Please, I wish we remembered that when we have our open borders  policy, we are causing so many children to be raised apart from their  parents.   I also want to point out the number of got-aways, which is a  particularly dangerous subgroup of people coming here illegally.   So that you folks understand, there are two big groups of people  coming here illegally.   There are people who ask for asylum. They don't deserve it, but they  ask for asylum and turn themselves in to the Border Patrol. At least we  get to do a little medical checkup on them. We are allowed to get a  little bit of information on them. If we have the right name, which we  may or may not, we can do a little bit of criminal background check on  whether they have committed crimes in the United States or Canada.   There is another group of people called got-aways that race across  the border and take advantage of the fact that, right now, so many  Border Patrol agents are just doing paperwork. We have, as far as I can  see, the all-time high, 73,000 got-aways in November 2022.   So that you understand, if you are somebody who is sneaking fentanyl  across the border, if you are somebody who has a criminal record, how  would you come here? Would you turn yourself in to the Border Patrol?  Not likely. You would rather sneak across the border.   The fact that that subset is increasing even greater than the people  who turn themselves in to the Border Patrol should scare every American  to death.   It is time for President Biden to do a little bit more than a  perfunctory stop at the border. He has to look at 2 years ago, in  November 2020, when that 210,000 figure was under 20,000. It can be  done once; it can be done again.   The American people and the press corps in America ought to hold him  accountable and ask him to explain why we used to--as a matter of fact,  earlier in 2020, we were under 10,000 people a month--why we used to be  able to hold these numbers under 10,000 a month and now we are over  200,000, and why we used to be able to keep the unaccompanied minors  under 1,000 and now they are over 9,000.   When I talk about unaccompanied minors, I am not including minors  that were rented by other people because they felt it would be easier  to get here with a family. The Border Patrol knows that is happening,  as well. Maybe you rent little Johnny to somebody who says we want to  be a family. That is another thing that is not even showing in these  numbers. We don't know how often it happens. We just know that it  happens.   I realize that Black Lives Matter has been hostile to the traditional  nuclear family. I realize that is an important group for a lot of  Members on the other side of the aisle, but I will tell you, I don't  like it at all when I see over 9,000 unaccompanied minors coming into  this country.                                time  1300    I want to point out another number that doesn't appear on here, and I  wish we would keep track of it, and that is the degree to which we  separate the family. Maybe one parent comes here with the kids but not  two parents.   In America, our family court system--if people get divorced, we try  to keep both parents around the area for the children. It breaks the  heart of Border Patrol that they see no effort being done at the  border.   In other words, if one parent shows up with the kids, maybe dad,  maybe mom is left home in Guatemala, El Salvador, or wherever, we don't  care. It really bothers the Border Patrol because, of course, when it  comes to American children, we love them enough that we try to keep  both parents involved. But when it comes to the policy at the border,  we don't care.   I am also told, by the way, that this policy bothers governments of  the countries that these people came from because they themselves have  family  [[Page H230]]  courts and they would like to keep both parents involved in their  children's lives. They don't like the callousness of the United States,  how they don't care whether the family is apart or not.   There is another side to this story, as far as what is going on on  the southern border as well, and that is the number of deportations.  You know, people say, Oh, we all have such wonderful people crossing  the border, blah, blah, blah. Well, they are all not that wonderful.  They are people that commit crimes, people that we catch doing wrong  things.   And while our immigration system is relatively weak, our deportation  is weak compared to what it should be, at least some people  historically have been turned back south of the border. If you look,  that number was usually over 200,000 under President Trump, 250,000,  260,000. It slipped to 185,000 in President Trump's final year, in part  because of the COVID. We recently got the numbers for fiscal year 2022,  where it is 72,000.   The COVID crisis is not exclusively but largely over, so here we are  in a situation in which we have under a third of the number of  deportations which we used to have. So not only are we letting  everybody come here and not only are we encouraging the breakdown of  the families by having so many unaccompanied minors coming here, we are  not deporting people like we have in the past.   I have talked to a Federal attorney, and it disappointed him because  he knows the rules they could have operated under in which you are able  to now commit more crimes, do more bad things, and apparently the U.S.  Government doesn't care.   Of course, eventually, as we let more people commit crimes in this  country, there is going to be an increase in the crime rate. It is  going to be a less civil America.   I wish and I beg the Biden administration to find some of the  officials left over from the past administration and have them show  them how it is done so we don't continue to have so many people who  have criminal records wind up in the United States.   Now, speaking of things that have happened since the new year, we  finally have the murders in Milwaukee--the city which I was born in. I  love Milwaukee so much. When I was a child, Milwaukee had the lowest  murder rate of the 25 biggest cities in the country, depending on the  year, it was either them or San Diego.   This year, we exploded to a new record. We went up from 197 to 224 in  1 year. That is 27 more than the previous all-time high. I can remember  when Milwaukee had a much smaller population, but that number was under  40.   Well, what happened?   Part of it, of course, is the police hatred that goes on in our  society. I think that really began around Ferguson, Missouri, where it  was called the Ferguson effect, and police began to become afraid to  enforce the law. No matter how much they were in the right--and, of  course, the Justice Department did investigations in Ferguson, and they  found out the policeman was in the right in that tragic death--they  still were attacked by opportunistic politicians and opportunistic  clergy.   We had a situation in Ferguson, they called the policemen racists.  The Justice Department, even under Barack Obama, felt nothing had been  done wrong. The opportunistic and offensive Al Sharpton showed up and  attacked--or verbally attacked--the police in that area, rather than  becoming persona non grata. Rather than being pushed aside, we see  politicians still trying to ingratiate themselves to Al Sharpton, and  still trying to promote his divisive world view.   So it is not surprising, as the police back off, despite the  population falling, the number of murders continue to go up.   I beg the Members of this body to reject the Al Sharpton  divisiveness. Stop standing up on the dais with him. Stop attending  joint meetings with him and promoting that lying clergyman. It is an  embarrassment to Christianity. It is an embarrassment to America. I  can't believe there are Members of this body who think he is somebody  to promote his view to the world.   Then we have what I think is the root cause. We have a continued  break-down of the family in America. We know that Black Lives Matter,  that played such a big role in the 2020 elections, hates the nuclear  family. But I wish our social scientists would do a little more  investigation on the role of the break-down of the family and the  anger, particularly of the young men, the fact that so many men don't  have a family to take care of because the government takes care of all  the families. And we work our way back to what the murder rate was in  the 1960s before you had the huge war on the family initiated by Lyndon  Johnson.   I ask the social scientists and I ask the journalists to demand  information on the background of the murderers that are caught--not  enough are caught--who are committing the murders in Milwaukee, and  also the family backgrounds of those unfortunate souls who have died  because of the Ferguson effect and the police hatred that is fomented  by Members of this body.   My final comment here is with regard to another year gone, another  year we will wind up--we will get the numbers shortly--with over  100,000 people dying of illegal drug overdoses.   We all know two things that politicians should do immediately,  because almost all these drugs come across the border, we should shut  down that border and prevent any more Americans from dying.   Big numbers are kind of easy to gloss over, and it is important to  remember when we are talking about 107,000 or 108,000--I am old enough  to remember the Vietnam war--we are having twice as many people die of  illegal drug overdoses in this country than has died in the Vietnam  war. The Vietnam war went on for 12 years, there were protests, there  was so much commentary on the number of people who died, and they were  all heroes and we should talk about it.   But we have twice as many people dying in 1 year in this country as  died in 12 years in Vietnam.   Do you think any increased effort is made to close the border?   No. Politicians don't care about that 108,000.   Remember, they all had parents, some had children, some had siblings,  some had friends, but we are so callous, we don't care, another  107,000. What difference does it make?   The other thing you should do--because it is up to the police to find  these drug dealers--we, one more time, should have a little more  respect for the police.   I will shortly be introducing a bill to allow the Border Patrol to  hire more drug-sniffing dogs. Anybody who takes the tour down there--I  am sure Joe Biden didn't hang around long enough to find this out-- would find out how tremendous those dogs are. They are not cheap.   When I think of all the people who died because of the drug  overdoses, I really hope in the upcoming budget we maybe find more  money by getting rid of all the new lawyers we are hiring to represent  the people coming here illegally. Instead of hiring more lawyers, we  hire more drug-sniffing dogs. Maybe we can reduce the numbers of  Americans who are dying of drug overdoses as people come across the  border.   So those are a few things for the American people to digest, some  more things the mainstream media ought to be taking up. A little more  headlines, even if the administration releases the immigration numbers  on a Friday, publicize, you know, the huge numbers of people who are  coming across the border.   Do not get anesthetized and stop caring about the huge numbers of  ever-increasing Americans who are dying of illegal drug overdoses.  Please, take action.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 11 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Friday, January 13, 2023, at 11 a.m.  [[Page H231]]                                  ____________________
