 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 230, I call  up the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 34) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to  ``Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other  Telecommunications Services'', and ask for its immediate consideration  in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on S.J. Res. 34.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of S.J. Res. 34, which  disapproves of the rule submitted by the Federal Communications  Commission relating to protecting the privacy of customers of broadband  and other telecommunication services.   I applaud Senator Flake's work on this issue, as S.J. Res. 34 was  passed by the Senate last week. I also filed a companion resolution in  the House.   The FCC finalized its broadband privacy rules on October 27, 2016. At  that time, they assured us that the rules would provide broadband  customers meaningful choice, greater transparency, and stronger  security protections for their personal information collected by  internet service providers, but the reality is much different.   There are three specific problems with which the FCC has gone about  these rules. First, the FCC unilaterally swiped jurisdiction from the  Federal Trade Commission. The FTC has served as our Nation's sole  online privacy regulator for over 20 years.   Second, having two privacy cops on the beat will create confusion  within the internet ecosystem and will end up harming consumers.   Third, the FCC already has authority to enforce privacy obligations  of broadband service providers on a case-by-case basis. These broadband  privacy rules are unnecessary and are just another example of Big  Government overreach. The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates  that Federal regulations cost our economy $1.9 trillion in 2015.   Since President Trump took office, Republicans have been working  diligently to loosen the regulatory environment that is suffocating  hardworking taxpayers.   Here is what multiple House Democrats said in a letter to the FCC  last May regarding the FCC's privacy rules:         The rulemaking intends to go well beyond the traditional       framework that has guarded consumers from data practices of       internet service providers and ill-served consumers who seek       and expect consistency in how their personal data is       protected.    Further, FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright testified before Congress  that the FTC has unique experience in enforcing broadband service  providers' obligations to protect the privacy and security of consumer  data. He added that the rules will actually do less to protect  consumers by depriving the FTC of its longstanding jurisdiction in the  area. Once again, these rules hurt consumers.   Incredibly, former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler referred to the internet  as the most powerful and pervasive network in the history of the planet  before these rules were even created. I found this really odd because  it implied that the FTC regulation had indeed been successful and ought  to continue, ultimately undermining his own rationale for additional  FCC privacy regulation.   Now, there are a couple of myths that are going around that I want to  take the time to dispel. Our friends claim there will be a gap for ISPs  in the FCC privacy rules when they are overturned. This simply is  false, and let me tell you why. The FCC already has the authority to  enforce the privacy obligations of broadband service providers on a  case-by-case basis.   Pursuant to section 201 of the Communications Act, they can police  practices of the ISPs that are unjust or unreasonable. Sections 202 and  222 also protect consumers. It is already in statute. So I encourage my  friends to read title II of the Communications Act. Also, the State  attorneys general have the ability to go after companies for unfair and  deceptive practices.   Third, litigation is another avenue consumers can pursue against ISPs  for mishandling personal data. Service providers have privacy policies.  If they violate the policy, guess what? They can be sued. I know  Democrats will certainly understand that, as they have many trial  lawyer friends, and I urge them to speak to the trial bar.   Fourth, the free market is another great equalizer. Can you imagine  the embarrassment for an ISP that is caught unlawfully selling data? We  have all seen the economic fallout from something such as a data  breach. Companies have a financial incentive to handle your personal  data properly because to do otherwise would significantly impair their  financial standing.  [[Page H2490]]    To my Democrat friends across the aisle, the bottom line is this: the  only gap that exists is in these arguments that you have made.   Consumer privacy is something we all want to protect, and consumer  privacy will continue to be protected and will actually be enhanced by  removing the uncertainty and confusion these rules will create, as the  Democrats Rush, Schrader, and Green indicated in a letter to the FCC  last May.   I also want to speak, for just a moment, on the edge providers  because there has been some question about who has visibility into your  data. Clinton administration veteran privacy expert Peter Swire offered  a report in February 2016 titled ``Online Privacy in ISPs.''   ISP's access to consumer data is limited and often less than access  to others. Swire found that ISPs have less visibility into consumer  behavior online than search, social media, advertising, and big tech  companies.   Swire's study found that, as a result of advancing technologies, the  rise of encryption, and the various ways and locations individuals  access the internet, ISPs now have increasingly limited insight into  our activities and information online.   By contrast, however, so-called edge providers, like search engines,  social media, advertising, shopping, and other services online, often  have greater visibility into personal consumer data.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will remind my colleagues across the  aisle that, again, section 222 of the Communications Act covers the  authority that the FCC needs. Traditionally, online privacy has been  handled by the FTC. That is an authority that we have designated to  them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores), and I ask unanimous consent that he  may control that time.
