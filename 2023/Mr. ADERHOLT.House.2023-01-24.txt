 Mr. Speaker, I come to you tonight, as a lot of my  colleagues are doing, recognizing the 50-year anniversary of the very  flawed decision of Roe v. Wade.   Although the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, we  cannot forget the lives that were lost during those almost 50  devastating years. The lives lost during the Roe era must serve as a  reminder of why we continue to fight for life.   I have said before, and I will continue to say, that I am pro-life, I  am pro-family, and I am pro-child.   In the wake of the Dobbs decision, many States, like my home State of  Alabama, have taken steps to protect the unborn. However, there is more  work to be done when it comes to protecting the lives of the innocent.   Just last week, the annual March for Life took place here in  Washington, D.C., as has already been mentioned. Instead of marching on  the Supreme Court, thousands of pro-life advocates marched on Congress.  They know our work isn't finished, and they are calling on Congress to  do our job to protect life.   I am proud to see that pro-life measures have already passed the  House with bipartisan support in this new Congress. Also, I look  forward to continued bipartisan efforts to protect the most vulnerable  among us, and this should be, Mr. Speaker, a bipartisan issue.   This anniversary serves as a solemn reminder of the tragic losses as  a result of Roe v. Wade, but it also serves as a reminder that the  fight for life is not over.   I also thank Mrs. Fischbach for her leadership in organizing this  hour to uphold the sanctity of human life.
