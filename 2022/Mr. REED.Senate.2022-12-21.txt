 Madam President, I rise today in recognition of the 50th       anniversary of the arrival of the Ghazal Family to the United States, a       family whose legacy is inextricably intertwined with that of my State       of Rhode Island.        On December 11, 1972, as the threat of violence and conflict in       Lebanon festered, the Ghazal family set off for the United States.       Arriving at Logan Airport, four young boys and two intrepid parents       were immediately confronted with their first challenge: adapting from       Beirut's sunny and warm weather to the blistering cold of New England       in the winter. Driving south and settling in Rhode Island did little to       change the weather.        But as so many immigrants did before them, the family began to put       down roots in Rhode Island, settled down and made a name for themselves       in their newly adopted country. The Ghazals were sponsored and       primarily welcomed and hosted by their maternal uncle, the late Very       Reverend Abdulahad Gabriel Doumato, then the pastor of St. Ephraim's       Syriac Orthodox Church in Central Falls, RI, and his wife Victoria, as       well as many other Doumato uncles, aunts, and cousins, who had made       their own journeys to Rhode Island starting in 1952.        The Ghazal family swiftly became an active part of their communities       like so many before them and so many since. Four generations later, the       family has grown to 36 with 11 grandchildren, 9 great-grandchildren,       and perhaps there are more to come. They understand and emphasize the       importance of hard work, a good education, and service to other.        There is even a Senate wrinkle to the story of the Ghazals. One of       their sons, Jay, worked for my predecessor Senator Claiborne Pell for       12 years and met his wife Maria here in the Senate when she worked for       Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. They, like the other members of the       Ghazal family, have dedicated their lives to mission-driven work. Given       this family's history, I am confident that future generations of the       Ghazal family will equally cherish and treasure the American ideals       their predecessors have adopted and continue to believe in the American       dream.        And as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of this exceptional family's       arrival in America, it is a welcome reminder to honor the legacy of       those families who are celebrating their 75th, 100th, and even 1st such       anniversary. The story of America has always been and continues to be a       story of immigration. I am proud that so many immigrant families, like       the Ghazal family, call Rhode Island home. Their contributions enrich       our communities and broaden our experiences. Their influence has helped       define what it means to be a Rhode Islander and an American.        Finally, I extend my best wishes to the Ghazal family for the next 50       years of their journey in America and thank them all for their rich       contributions to Rhode Island and our country.                                      ____________________                Mr. President, today I am introducing the Preserving Homes       and Communities Act with Senator Brown, Senator Wyden, and Senator       Smith. This legislation would reform Federal Housing Administration,       FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac note sale programs to protect       homeowners from foreclosure and keep properties in the hands of owner-      occupants and local community members.        In the wake of the Great Recession, FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac       began selling nonperforming and reperforming loans to strengthen their       balance sheets. These transactions, known as note sales, transfer       mortgage ownership to bulk purchasers, which are often private equity       firms or institutional investors that can move homes to the single-      family rental market. While note sales reduce financial risk for FHA,       Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac and help purchasers earn a profit, they       often directly harm homeowners and communities.            [[Page S9781]]              Borrowers with loans insured by FHA or securitized by Fannie Mae or       Freddie Mac have strong foreclosure protections because mortgage       servicers must offer specific loss mitigation options to eligible       borrowers before they can begin foreclosure proceedings. These robust       protections help many delinquent homeowners catch up on mortgage       payments and avoid foreclosure, but they drastically shrink when a       mortgage is included in a note sale.        It is not surprising that over 80 percent of homeowners whose       nonperforming loans were sold by FHA ultimately lost their homes after       their new servicers reached a final loan resolution. Moreover, the U.S.       Government Accountability Office has found that nonperforming loans       sold by FHA are more likely to face foreclosure than comparable loans       that FHA keeps on its balance sheet. The majority of homeowners with       nonperforming loans sold by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have also lost       their homes after servicers reached a final resolution. The data is       overwhelming: note sales do not help most borrowers remain in their       homes.        Compounding matters, note sale purchasers, which again are       predominately private equity firms and institutional investors, often       move foreclosed properties out of the owner-occupied market. In fact,       Pretium, one of the Nation's largest owners of single-family rental       homes, is the third largest purchaser of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac       nonperforming loans in note sales. As a result, approximately one-third       of properties foreclosed upon after a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac       nonperforming loan note sale are sold to an investor, held by the       purchaser for rental, or become real estate owned--leaving fewer       affordable owner-occupied homes in the market and shifting property       ownership away from local control.        The Preserving Homes and Communities Act tackles these problems.       First, it would require mortgage servicers to complete FHA or Federal       Housing Finance Agency-required loss mitigation actions before FHA,       Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac includes a nonperforming mortgage in a note       sale. Second, it would extend protections to these mortgages after they       are acquired by purchasers in a note sale. Third, it would require FHA,       Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac to give local entities with public       missions, including States, municipalities, and nonprofits, the first       opportunity to purchase nonperforming mortgages--ahead of private       equity and institutional investors. Finally, it would require       purchasers that foreclose on nonperforming note sale properties to make       at least 75 percent these properties available to owner-occupants or       low- and moderate-income renters. In sum, our legislation seeks to keep       homeowners in their homes, keep home ownership within local       communities, and preserve the supply of available and affordable homes       for families.        I thank the National Consumer Law Center, on behalf of its low-income       client, and the National Community Stabilization Trust for their       support. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and support       its passage.                                      ____________________
