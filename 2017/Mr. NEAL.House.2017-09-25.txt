 Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of H.R. 1235, the Naismith  Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act, which I  introduced along with my colleague from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).   People in Kentucky think that they invented basketball. It was  actually invented in Massachusetts. But I want to thank him personally,  as well as professionally, for the good work that he has done in  helping to bring about this day.   As the Hall of Fame celebrates its 125th anniversary of the invention  of basketball, this commemorative coin symbolizes all the sport has  accomplished since its humble beginnings in a YMCA gymnasium in  Springfield, Massachusetts. This truly American game continues to be  played by men and women at every level and on every continent.   In December of 1891, a physical education professor named Dr. James  Naismith created a game with a simple objective: throw a round ball  into a peach basket that was suspended 10 feet above the ground. While  only one basket was made available during those first games, it would  soon become quite popular with students.   Thanks to the network of YMCAs throughout the country and the game's  success on various college campuses, the sport soon became a national  phenomenon. By 1894, basketball was being played around the Nation and  in dozens of countries around the world.   During the 1920s and 1930s, teams like the Original Celtics and the  New York Renaissance carried professional basketball to the national  conscience for the first time.                                time  1630    Internationally, popularity of the new sport from America led to the  formation of the International Basketball Federation, which was pivotal  in adding basketball to the Summer Olympic Games in 1936. Eventually,  the National Basketball Association was founded in 1946, and continues  to enjoy great success.   The Basketball Hall of Fame inducted its first class in 1959, despite  the lack of any physical structure. They would get their first home on  the campus of Springfield College in 1968, just a short way from the  game's first site.   Thousands of visitors came to the campus to see memorabilia and be  inspired by the stories of the sport's early days. As the game  skyrocketed in national popularity in the 1980s, with icons like Larry  Bird, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan, the Hall of Fame found the  need to expand. As the mayor of Springfield at the time, I helped to  ensure a location on the banks of the Connecticut River.   In 1985, the Hall reopened with a three-level museum with hundreds of  pieces of memorabilia and displays. The admiration for the sport forced  the Hall to expand once again, in 2002, with a state-of-the-art  structure just steps away from the old facility.   Today, the Hall welcomes 6 million visitors annually. They are  dazzled with its interactive displays and exhibits. As of this year,  the Hall has inducted 365 of the greatest players, coaches, and  referees. Players like Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill  Bradley, and coaches like John Wooden and Pat Summitt have been honored  for their contributions to the sport. The Basketball Hall of Fame  commemorative coin is the ideal way for the legacy of these great  athletes and coaches to be remembered for decades to come.   With no cost to the American taxpayer, the surcharges on these coins  will go to further the museum's curation efforts. The proceeds will  also go toward educational programs to promote good sportsmanship and  respect on and off the court.   Mr. Speaker, I have worked with the Hall of Fame on multiple projects  for more than 30 years. It is a terrific tax-exempt organization that  works tirelessly to preserve the history and educate people about this  truly American game.  [[Page H7455]]    I believe that basketball instills the virtues that this country was  built upon and gives Americans someone to aspire to be. As former NBA  player and United States Senator Bill Bradley put it: ``Sports is a  metaphor for overcoming obstacles and achieving against great odds.  Athletes, in times of difficulty, can be important role models.''   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1235, and a  special note of thanks to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez) for  keeping the debate open so that I could actually speak on this.   Again, as I close, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr). He  was terrific in his help on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to H.R. 3823, the Disaster Tax  Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act, for one simple reason.  This is an anemic response to these disasters, whether they occur on  the mainland of the United States or within American possessions.   This should have been done on Friday afternoon with the two parties  working together. Instead, once again, this was put together by one  party, with minimal input from our side. These are all  [[Page H7464]]  members of the American family that have been impacted by what has  happened with this terrible weather.   The chance here for us to work together to make this an expanded  package, where we could be talking about a host of opportunities for  these folks who have been put in such a precarious situation, is now  being missed. There are 90 Members of this Congress who actually voted  against direct aid in the past for relief for members of the American  family, where we should have taken the position here, clearly: Let's  try to figure out what we can do for a robust tax package, what we can  do for immediate aid, and highlight the role that FEMA plays. And I  certainly have expressed to Mr. Curbelo time and again I am there on  board. I just think this needs to be more, and I think that is the  position that we are offering today.   Furthermore, a partisan position had to be taken in terms of many  priorities that we should have been consulted on, and even those could  have been turned into bipartisan moments. I support the disaster relief  that is in this bill, but it is clear that the package is woefully  inadequate. I would hope that we could work together on these  provisions.   The disaster relief package included in this bill does not provide  the comprehensive package of incentives and relief that will drive  investment and speed up recovery in the American communities that  include Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.  Without the fix that we want on this side, the effect of lost revenue  is going to mean that money is lost that otherwise would be needed for  normal operations and the response effort. It is going to take years to  adequately respond to what has happened and the devastation that these  folks are up against. We need to be sitting here, both parties working  together, to say: They are all members of the American family. Let's  get it done.    I consider this a missed opportunity, and I hope that we can do more  in the next few days to get back on track to help them bounce back from  these, indeed, tragedies. We should be sitting down here in the next 48  hours and putting together a massive package of relief for these States  and for these possessions and making sure that they have what is  necessary, rather than doing a piecemeal fix on what is sure to be a  very tormented time for members of these communities and these States  and these possessions.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I think that there is a sufficient opportunity  here going forward, as the previous gentlemen has spoken, to discuss  the whole issue of flood insurance. I just don't think this is the  moment to be discussing the flood insurance initiatives. Instead, I  think that ought to be subject to a full-throttled debate in this  [[Page H7466]]  institution about getting those things done. This is not, I think, the  appropriate forum for accomplishing that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  DeFazio), the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me reassure the gentleman from California that when  you talk about graduate medical education, believe me, in  Massachusetts, we are for graduate medical education. Be assured of  that.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me say that we all support  reauthorization of the FAA. What has happened here again is a breakdown  in the conversation that used to meld this institution together.   There was a chance on Friday for Republicans to consult with us in  the minority, put together a bipartisan package of many very important  provisions that are important to Mr. Curbelo, important to certainly  Texas, important to the Virgin Islands. It is certainly important to  Puerto Rico.   Let me give you a quick example of how this institution used to work.  We used to call this the national principle. The national principle  essentially said if there was an earthquake in California, we all rose  to the support of California. If there were forest fires in Alabama,  which there were, we would all come to the aid of the people of  Alabama. If there was a horrific, torrential downpour in Texas, we  simply said: We don't ask if it is a red State or a blue State, or if  they are Libertarians or Socialists or Democrats or Republicans. We  said: They are members of the American family. We said: Do what has to  be done and then send us the bill. We believe that there will be ample  opportunity to debate and discuss the size of the portionality at that  moment.   Instead, where we had this opportunity right here to provide a robust  package to the people of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and  Texas, we decide to come back with an anemic proposal.   We are coming up short on our responsibility. We had a tornado in my  hometown 5 years ago. Those Federal employees did a spectacular job  everywhere in eight communities, and nobody said: Too much government.  They said: Let's fix this for, again, the American family to get this  straightened out.   I have said to Mr. Curbelo, and I will repeat it, we will put up 195  Democrats immediately for a bigger package for the people of Florida,  Texas, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, not to piecemeal this  together.   By the way, let me use this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, for those of us  from the Northeast, the idea that 90 Members of this institution voted  against direct relief just a couple of weeks ago looking for a pay-for,  I wonder if they are going to use that same application of consistency  when we get to the tax proposals that are about to consume our time.   We want to provide adequate relief to these families and the  communities that need it. We could do this in the next 48 hours without  any problem whatsoever.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, because this is not big enough and not  supportive enough of the American family, I am going to urge my  colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
