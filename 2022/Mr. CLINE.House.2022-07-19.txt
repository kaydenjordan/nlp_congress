 Mr. Chair, it is with sadness that I come to the floor to  speak against this measure.   We had opportunities in the Appropriations Committee to work across  the aisle to address the concerns of the minority and to fund the  priorities of this country and its people. Unfortunately, with a 40- year high in inflation, CPI rising to 9.1 percent in June, $30 trillion  in debt, and the CBO recently predicting $1.6 trillion in deficits over  the next decade, business as usual can no longer be contemplated.   We must take action to secure the financial stability of this country  for the future, for our children, for their children, and for future  generations. We have to return to fiscal sanity through these  appropriations bills to rein in inflation and rescue this economy.   Transportation-Housing and Urban Development has an increase of more  than 12 percent; Agriculture an increase of 8 percent; Financial  Services and General Government an increase of 17 percent over FY22;  Interior, 18 percent increase; MILCON, more than 10 percent above 2022.   All of these bills contain important priorities, but they also  contain excessive amounts of waste and liberal priorities that are not  in keeping with the priorities of the American people, so I urge their  defeat.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for her hard work in  trying to get our priorities considered.   I look forward to continuing to work to ensure that fiscal  responsibility is the watchword of the day and that the American people  have their tax dollars looked after by the Appropriations Committee.                                time  1430
