 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Bearden  High School Lady Bulldogs basketball team for winning their first  Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association title in program  history. Bearden won the Class 4A State championship game on March 12,  defeating the Farragut Lady Admirals 52-34.   Both teams reached the State tournament after a season's worth of  perseverance and teamwork. The Lady Bulldogs compiled 36 wins during  the regular season while the Lady Admirals won 39 games. In the State  tournament, Bearden and Farragut sailed through the quarterfinals and  semifinals to set up a clash with each other in the championship game.  It was the fifth time these two teams met during the season.   This was a historic matchup, Madam Speaker. Neither Bearden nor  Farragut had appeared in a girls' State championship game before that.  It also marked the first time two Knox County schools competed against  each other in the State championship game. Regardless of the winner of  this game, Knox County would have its first girls' basketball State  championship team since the Austin-East Roadrunners won it all in 2007.   As a Bearden High School alumnus, I am excited that my Lady Bulldogs  were victorious in the championship, but I represent both these  communities in Congress. The Lady Admirals should be proud of what they  achieved this year, and I am happy to recognize Farragut for an  incredibly successful season. Both squads did an excellent job  representing east Tennessee in the State tournament. Congratulations to  the girls and their coaches. Go, Bulldogs.         Congratulating University of Tennessee's Basketball Programs     Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the University of  Tennessee's basketball programs on making their respective 2022 NCAA  tournaments. By punching their tickets to the big dance, both the men's  and women's teams built on UT athletics' long history of college  basketball success.   The University of Tennessee is the only school to qualify for every  women's NCAA tournament. The women's program is making its 40th  straight--40th straight, Madam Speaker--NCAA tournament appearance  after winning 23 contests during the regular season. Competing as the  number four seed in the Wichita region, the Lady Volunteers won't need  to travel far for their first game of the tournament. Thompson-Boling  Arena will host it in Knoxville. This venue will be the first for this  year's competition, which is where the Lady Volunteers will take on the  Buffalo Bulls on March 19.   On the men's side, the Volunteers defeated the Texas A&M Aggies last  Saturday to win the 2022 Southeastern Conference tournament  championship. It is not in my notes, but I do want to note, since  Representative Barr might be watching this, we also defeated Kentucky  very handily also. This is the fifth tournament championship in program  history and the first since 1979. The team earned the number three seed  in the South Region for its regular season performance and faces the  Longwood Lancers in the first round this afternoon in Indianapolis,  Indiana.   I wish the best of luck to the Lady Volunteers head coach Kellie  Harper and the Volunteers men's head coach Rick Barnes, all their  players, coaches, and support staff as they compete in this year's  NCAA's basketball tournament. I was also an alumnus of the University  of Tennessee, and I still have 4 years of eligibility left in  basketball. Go Vols.                     Buddy's Bar-B-Q Celebrates 50 Years     Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 50th anniversary  of Buddy's Bar-b-q, a local favorite in east Tennessee, and one of my  local favorites as well. My mama and daddy and I always used to eat  there after church on Sundays. It was always delicious. I ate there  with my best friend Chris Heagerty last week, and it was still  delicious, and it was very price conscious, I will say. It is not too  expensive.   Buddy and LaMuriel Smothers dreamed of opening a restaurant that  served quality, homestyle barbecue with classic southern hospitality.  In 1972, they made that dream a reality by opening the first Buddy's  Bar-b-q in Knoxville. It quickly became a hit. Crowds packed into the  restaurant to enjoy LaMuriel's delicious recipes, which are still on  the menu today, and listen to the wonderful bluegrass bands that played  on Friday nights. I remember a band called Knoxville Grass used to play  there, and I would sing a little bit of the tunes here, but I don't  want to run everybody off or be called out.   Ten years later, of course, Buddy's Bar-b-q was featured at the 1982  World's Fair in Knoxville, where I worked at the always very loud and  impressive video expo. After appearing at the fair, though, the word  spread far and wide that Buddy's Bar-b-q was outstanding. The  restaurant became a barbecue staple in Tennessee, a reputation that it  has maintained for the past 40 years.    Complementing the outstanding food at Buddy's Bar-b-q are the  restaurant's charitable efforts in our community. The restaurant  launched Buddy's Race for the Cure to honor Buddy after he died of  cancer in 1992 and supports Alzheimer's Tennessee in honor of LaMuriel.  It also hosts Mission Mondays and supports local schools, regional  nonprofits, and the University of Tennessee. Additionally, Buddy's Bar- b-q will provide catering and support for the Congressional Medal of  Honor Society's annual gathering to honor all the living Medal of Honor  recipients. This event is again being held in Knoxville this year for  the second time, and Buddy's will provide classic southern hospitality.   I congratulate the entire Smothers family; my good friends Anthony  and Lisa Edwards, Mark and Jaime Lemoncelli; and everyone involved in  making Buddy's Bar-b-q a wonderful success these past 50 years. It is  good. If you all ever get to Knoxville, please stop in.  [[Page H3785]]                                ____________________
