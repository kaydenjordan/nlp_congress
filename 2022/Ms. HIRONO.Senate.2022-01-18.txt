 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, we celebrated Martin Luther  King, Jr., Day and honored civil rights leaders who fought against  inequality and sacrificed so much to move our country closer towards  justice for all. But this year, on a day when we should be coming  together to commemorate these civil rights achievements and recommit to  the road ahead, we are instead fighting a battle we thought was won  decades ago.   In 1957, Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his ``Give Us the  Ballot'' address, where he said:         The denial of this sacred right is a tragic betrayal of the       highest mandates of our democratic tradition.    But here we are in 2022 fighting back against hundreds of bills  introduced in States across the Nation clearly intended to make it so  much harder for certain people to vote.   Twenty-two States have already enacted 47 new laws that make it more  difficult to vote by mail, that make it harder to stay on voting lists,  that limit the availability of drop boxes for ballots, that limit the  number of polling locations, that impose stricter or newer voter ID  requirements, and the list goes on. But one of the most insidious is  Georgia's law which allows any person to challenge the rights of an  unlimited number of voters to cast their ballots.   If someone decides for whatever reason to challenge another person's  right to vote, the voter then has to show up to their election office  to defend themselves. Imagine being a single mom working two jobs and  unable to afford childcare, and now she has to defend her  constitutional right just because someone thought she shouldn't be  voting at all.   Volunteers are already being recruited to pose these challenges. This  isn't voter protection; this is vigilantism. These laws are clearly  intended to target communities of color and make it harder for them to  vote, period.   Our country's legacy of racial discrimination in voting is  undeniable, and it is undeniable that we are witnessing history repeat  itself.    In 1890, the House passed historic legislation that would have  increased voting protections, particularly for Black voters, but the  Senate failed to take up this legislation, failed to act at a critical  time when it had the chance, and the results were devastating for  decades to come. The Senate's failure to take up this legislation  allowed Jim Crow and the plummeting of voter  [[Page S233]]  turnout among Black voters to continue for more than half a century,  until the Senate passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 over 70 years later.   A recent Washington Post analysis said that this current wave of  voter suppression bills potentially amounts to ``the most sweeping  contraction of ballot access in the United States since the end of  Reconstruction.''   Today, these attacks on our freedom to vote are taking us back to the  time of Reconstruction.   We cannot wait another 70 years for this so-called deliberative body  to act, which is why we need to pass comprehensive voter protection  legislation. But not a single Republican supports the Freedom to Vote:  John Lewis Act. Many of my Republican colleagues have joined  Congressman John Lewis to commemorate the March from Selma to  Montgomery, but today they won't even allow the Senate to consider  legislation named in his honor and have called this bill radical. There  is nothing radical about protecting a person's freedom to vote. What is  radical is sending us back to the days of Reconstruction.   This legislation would restore and strengthen the Voting Rights Act,  which Congress reauthorized with broad bipartisan support five times-- 1970, 1975, 1982, 1992--and it passed 98 to 0 in 2006, which included  10 currently sitting Senate Republicans.   This bill would also expand opportunities to vote, prevent voter  suppression, and improve election security. We are talking about  provisions that would require States to offer early voting and no- excuse vote-by-mail, make election day a public holiday, crack down on  voter intimidation, and require postelection audits. Again, I ask, how  is any of this radical? What is radical is justifying overt attacks on  our democracy by perpetuating the Big Lie of mass voter fraud.   For Republicans, this fight isn't about election security; it is  about securing their power, because Republicans have decided that  spreading misinformation and rigging elections by preventing people  from voting is the only way they will retain their power.   Republicans should come to the Senate floor and tell the American  people why they won't protect our freedom to vote. Instead, the  Republican leader came to the floor to attack Democrats for fighting to  change Senate rules to pass this critical legislation, calling it a  power grab.   The Republican leader said that Democrats want to ``permanently  damage this institution.'' He went on to say the filibuster is ``about  compromise and moderation''--this from the Republican leader who refers  to himself as the grim reaper as he prevents dozens of House-passed  bills from being considered on the Senate floor; the same person who  singlehandedly prevented President Obama from filling a vacancy on the  Supreme Court for over a year, denying the will of nearly 66 million  Americans who voted to give President Obama a second term in office;  the same person who pushed through President Trump's Supreme Court  nominee as over 159 million Americans were in the process of voting. So  much for compromise and moderation.   Let's not pretend this is about the sanctity of this institution. We  cannot sit back and let one political party continue to unravel the  threads of our democracy one voter suppression bill at a time. While  Republicans do nothing to protect our freedom to vote in the face of  mass voter suppression bills enacted across the country, we Democrats  cannot sit back and let 2020 be the last free and fair election in our  country.   If we don't protect the right to vote, we won't have a democracy. It  is that simple. That is the reality. Since the Republicans will not  lift a finger to protect voting rights, we have no option but to change  the Senate rules in order to pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis  Act. This is something that every single Democratic Senator needs to  get on board with.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
