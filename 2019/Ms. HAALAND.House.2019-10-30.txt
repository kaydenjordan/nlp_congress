 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H8623]]  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2181.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, Du hino-meh. Idza dyu-qe-dza. Svwimi Hanu. My name is  Debra Haaland. I am from the Turquoise Clan and an enrolled member of  the Laguna Pueblo.   I wish to acknowledge that we are on Indian land, and I humbly ask to  speak on this important bill.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2181, the Chaco  Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act.   First, Mr. Chair, I would like to thank my colleagues, Assistant  Speaker Ben Ray Lujan, Senator Tom Udall, and Senator Martin Heinrich  for their years of hard work on this important legislation.   This proposal, sponsored by my good friend and fellow New Mexico  Representative, Mr. Lujan, would protect the cultural resources at  Chaco Culture National Historical Park, as well as New Mexico's clean  air, from the impact of oil and gas extraction.   This bill would withdraw land in a 10-mile buffer zone around Chaco  Culture National Historical Park to protect that site and the region's  undiscovered resources from the impacts of further oil and gas  extraction.   Chaco Canyon and the greater Chaco region have been home to my people  for centuries. As a 35th generation New Mexican and a descendant of the  indigenous inhabitants of what is now the Southwest United States, I  can say that there are few places more exceptional than the Chaco  region. Over hundreds of years, my ancestors engineered and constructed  massive multistory structures at Chaco Canyon that became the  ceremonial, administrative, and economic center of the region.   It is a certified International Dark Sky Park, where visitors can  gaze at the same dark sky with myriad stars that my ancestors did over  1,000 years ago.   These sites and the objects they contain tell the history of my  people and connect us to our past.   The Indian Pueblos and the Navajo Nation still have intimate  connections with the greater Chaco region, recognizing the area as a  spiritual place to be honored and respected.   This Congress, the Natural Resources Committee has heard from the  leaders of four Pueblo nations, the All Pueblo Council of Governors,  elected leaders of the Navajo Nation, the National Congress of American  Indians, senior officials in Tribal and Pueblo governments, and a  plethora of Americans, all of whom support H.R. 2181.   The entire New Mexico Congressional Delegation and the Governor of  our State support H.R. 2181.   This bill enjoys broad support on the ground and bipartisan support  here in this Chamber because protecting indigenous cultural resources,  protecting Chaco Canyon, should not be a partisan issue.   This proposal is about respecting our history and protecting our  culture. We owe it to Tribal communities, to the people of New Mexico,  and to people the world over to permanently protect the Chaco region.   Earlier this year, I traveled to the Chaco Culture National  Historical Park with several of my colleagues. While in New Mexico, we  had the opportunity to use infrared cameras to watch plumes of methane  and pollution spewing from oil and gas operations, creating a toxic  cloud the size of Delaware that hangs over the skies of northwestern  New Mexico.   Ninety percent of the Federal lands in this region are already open  to oil and gas extraction, and New Mexicans are all too familiar with  the toxic impacts it has on clean air, clean water, their health, and  the health of their children.                                time  1445    When you are out there watching the methane plumes and experiencing  the dust, the noise, the light pollution and their impacts, it is easy  to see why oil and gas extraction does not belong next to a sacred  ancestral site of the Pueblo people.   If you don't believe me, you can ask Interior Secretary Bernhardt.  When he visited Chaco Canyon earlier this year with Senator Martin  Heinrich, he definitely was struck by the significance of the park  because he committed to a  1-year moratorium on drilling around Chaco Canyon to allow Congress to  act on proposals like the one before us today.   I thank the Secretary for his efforts, but 1 year is not enough  protection for a site that holds centuries of history and culture. That  is why I ask you all to support Chaco Canyon today, to support the  Pueblo people, the Navajo Nation, and the people of New Mexico by  voting in favor of H.R. 2181.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New Mexico (Mr. Lujan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  New Mexico (Mr. Lujan).    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman from New Mexico an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Ms. DeGette).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, H.R. 2181 is a broadly supported proposal to protect the  cultural resources of Chaco Canyon. This bill has the support of the  All Pueblo Council of Governors, the Navajo Nation, the entire New  Mexico delegation, and the New Mexico Governor, not to mention any  number of elected officials across our beautiful State.   This proposal has been worked on for a very long time. Over many  hours, weeks, and years, many voices have been heard. If we are serious  about lifting up Tribal voices and responding to the priorities of  Native American communities, we need to listen to the Tribal leaders  who are asking us to protect Chaco Canyon. The people of New Mexico  know the impacts oil and gas development can have on clean air, clean  water, and the health of our children.   Mr. Chair, 90 percent of the San Juan Basin is already available for  oil and gas leasing. We can protect this sacred land because gas and  oil doesn't need to take up every single inch of our State. This  proposal is about protecting a small sacred area for Tribal communities  that have a connection to this special place and still use this area  for ceremonies to pray and to worship.   There may be dissenting voices, as there always are when we make  changes to land management policy, but we must listen to the elected  leaders who represent these places. Quite frankly, the majority of New  Mexicans support this legislation on this issue.   The delegation, the Governor, and the elected Tribal leaders have  spoken in a unified voice and asked us to protect Chaco Canyon. I thank  Representative Lujan for his hard work.   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2181, and I invite  anyone to come to New Mexico and visit this beautiful place and know  for certain why it is that we are fighting so hard to protect it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment because it  would allow Secretary Bernhardt to kill this bill, preventing  protections for the important cultural sites at Chaco Canyon.   In response to this amendment, I would point you to the text of H.R.  2181. The bill text states: ``Nothing in this act affects the mineral  rights of an Indian Tribe or member of an Indian Tribe or trust land or  allotment land.''   It could not be any clearer than that; yet we have had this debate in  hearings, in markups, and even moments ago during debate and in  amendments.   I understand and appreciate the concerns of the Navajo allottees, and  I appreciated when Ms. Hesuse came before our committee to share her  concerns with us. It is important that we take these perspectives into  consideration, which is why I appreciate Representative Lujan's effort  to make explicitly clear that this bill will have no impact on the  rights of allotted owners.   But, at the same time, we need to listen to the voices of Native  communities and their elected leaders, who are calling on us to protect  Chaco Canyon.   We have heard it already today, but this bill receives the complete  support of the Navajo Nation and the All Pueblo Council of Governors,  which represents 19 pueblos in New Mexico and 1 in Texas.   These Tribal leaders want to see the Chaco landscape protected from  oil and gas drilling. They don't want to see cultural sites damaged by  pump jacks or to have the pollution of extraction intrude on these  sacred sites.   The restrictions in this proposal are not new. They have been  informally in place for years under the Obama administration without  any clear impact on any allottees.   We need to act now to formalize these protections because the Trump  administration and their energy dominance agenda threaten these  important resources. Lease sales have been offered around Chaco Canyon  three times since March of 2018.   We must listen to the voices of Tribal communities and protect Chaco  Canyon.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we have heard this argument. We have hashed  and rehashed it over and over again. Not only that, but my colleague,  Mr. Lujan, said it very plainly: The allottees will not be hampered by  H.R. 2181.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I strongly oppose this amendment because it would negate the  withdrawal. It would prevent us from protecting Chaco Canyon. The  gentleman's amendment would allow for new drilling to occur on lands  within the withdrawal area, so long as certain standards are met.  Essentially, this amendment would protect the status quo, a status quo  opposed by the All Pueblo Council of Governors, the Navajo Nation, the  entire New Mexico delegation, the governor, and even the  administration.   When Secretary Bernhardt visited Chaco last spring, he agreed to a 1- year moratorium because he knew that new drilling posed a threat to  these sacred resources. Now this amendment seeks to overturn those  temporary protections offered by the Trump administration and to  prevent permanent protections from being enacted. That cannot stand.   Furthermore, this amendment contains numerous drafting edits that  would make it impossible to enact. It names the park site incorrectly.  It refers to undefined terms. And its unclear wording would essentially  allow anyone to drill in the withdrawal area.   This is clearly not a good faith amendment, and it is clearly not an  amendment intended to improve this proposal. It is simply an attempt to  open these sacred lands with resources that extend beyond the park to  extraction, because some of our colleagues cannot be satisfied until  every acre of land in this country has an oil rig or an open pit mine.   Ninety percent of this region is already open to leasing. Oil and gas  are not under attack in New Mexico. This bill simply attempts to  protect an area important to the Tribal communities who have  connections to this land that go back thousands of years before this  country even existed.   We have to believe, as a House, that some places have value beyond  what can be drilled from a hole in the ground. And believe it or not,  some things in this world are more important than money. Is there  nothing that matters more than industry profits? These are sacred  lands, lands that connect us to the past and lands that native  communities are asking us to protect. The bones of my ancestors are  buried there in its hallowed ground.   We need to listen to the voices of the people whose land it belongs  to and who have had it since time immemorial. We need to lift up those  voices and we need to protect Chaco Canyon.   I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  New Mexico (Mr. Lujan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This legislation, H.R. 2181, is absolutely necessary to protect the  land of my ancestors and the land of New Mexico. We oppose this  amendment.   I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to this  motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment is just another attempt to  distract from the importance of this proposal, which is listening to  Tribal voices by protecting the sacred sites of Chaco Canyon from oil  and gas extraction.   The bill would not impact New Mexico revenue streams in the  slightest. The State has already withdrawn State lands in Chaco and  opted to protect our indigenous lands, because they also recognize the  value of our outdoor economy which requires a clean environment.  [[Page H8639]]    The bill would not impact the New Mexico revenue streams in the  slightest. This country is the largest producer of oil and gas in the  world. We produce over 12 million barrels of crude oil a day, sending 3  million of those to other countries.   Lack of access to oil and gas is not an issue in New Mexico, and this  bill will in no way hinder the tremendous amount of energy extraction  in the State. Between 2010 and 2018, oil production in New Mexico  increased by nearly 400 percent, and the State is now the third largest  producer in the Nation after Texas and North Dakota.   In the San Juan Basin where Chaco Canyon is located, 90 percent of  public land is already open to development.   Must every inch of land be swallowed by oil and gas-sucking  machinery?   Thousands of sacred ancestral sites to the Pueblo people are sites  where Indians are under threat unless we act. Tribes across New Mexico  and this country have asked this body to protect Chaco Canyon. We  shouldn't put the sacred sites of Chaco Canyon and our environment at  risk on the impossible theory that we can become energy dominant or  that we need to open every single acre to oil and gas development  regardless of how special that land is.   If we really want to lead in energy, we should take a larger role in  renewable energy and low-carbon energy sources, and New Mexico can lead  the way with our 300 days of sun per year and our abundance of wind.   Unfortunately, the Trump administration prioritizes fossil fuels and  believes the future lies in coal, oil, and gas. But the President is  wrong, and Republicans are wrong. The world's power sources are  changing, and no one stands to benefit more from U.S. leadership during  this transition than American consumers.   The only question that remains is whether this body will help lead  our Nation in implementing a modern, clean energy agenda or whether we  will remain stuck in the past, holding on to the 1950s like there is no  future to believe in.   Now is not the time to open our protected public lands up to  unnecessary oil and gas extraction. Now is the time to protect these  important places and to lift up the voices of communities on the  ground.   Some things are more important than money, and my ancestral homeland  most definitely is.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this motion to recommit and support  this bill that would protect the sacred lands in New Mexico and that is  Chaco Canyon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
