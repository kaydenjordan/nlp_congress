 Mr. Speaker, it is time to discuss the steps we must  take to end child labor in the cocoa and chocolate industry.   This issue was brought to my attention by the students at Bell  Elementary School in Chicago. Through the guidance of their teacher,  Mr. Barash, these students learned the disturbing relationship between  child labor and chocolate production.                                time  1015    During my visit with their class, they shared with me their concern  for children who are forced into child labor in this industry. Some of  these children are sold to traffickers or farm owners or are abducted  only to be taken to cocoa farms for work. Some do not see their  families again for years--some never again.   Most children in the industry begin their days before the sun rises  and end it long after the sun sets. They are forced to wield dangerous  machetes while climbing up and down trees to cut down bean pods. Then  they must carry the pods in sacks weighing more than 100 pounds through  the forest. If the children don't work fast enough, the farm owners  beat them. When they are finally able to rest, they must sleep on  wooden planks in small, windowless buildings with little or no access  to clean water.   Many of these children will never attend school or receive an  education. The passionate elementary schoolers who told me about this  made the compelling case that we must eradicate child labor from this  industry and make sure these children are no longer forced into  dangerous, unlawful working conditions.   How can we justify all of this for the sake of chocolate?   I am not the first Member of this body to be concerned about these  practices. This fight was first taken up in Congress by former  Representative Eliot Engel of New York who worked to establish a  labeling standard to indicate on chocolate products that no child labor  had been used in its production.   While this effort did not succeed, he was joined by former Senator  Tom Harkin to establish what we call the Harkin-Engel Protocol. This  protocol was an agreement between governments, chocolate companies, and  cocoa producers to eliminate the worst forms of child labor within  cocoa production.   While the protocol has been effective, this problem persists. In  2015, 14 years after the protocol's signing, the Department of Labor  reported that more than 2 million children were engaged in child labor  in cocoa growing regions of West Africa. Although the chocolate  industry made a promise to end child labor almost 20 years ago, today,  no company can guarantee their products are free of child labor. While  chocolate producers have shown some concern for the lives of these  children through dedicated funding to eradicate child labor in their  industry, it has simply not been enough.   The three largest chocolate suppliers in the world are not even able  to identify the farms where their cocoa is being produced. As  Americans, we must recognize that much of the chocolate we enjoy is  harvested and produced at the expense of these young children.   We cannot let this continue. Kids should be in schools. Kids should  be playing. Kids should be with friends. Kids should be kids.   After speaking with the children at Bell Elementary, I was proud to  take the first step in the Labor-HHS and Education appropriations bill  by including language to reinvigorate the Department of Labor's role in  the international Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group and to hold the  companies in countries involved accountable for the promises they made  almost 20 years ago under the Harkin-Engel Protocol. But there is still  much to do.   I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and  Secretary Walsh to bring an end to child labor in the cocoa industry. I  also want to acknowledge the amazing 12 and 13 year olds who brought  this to my attention and are fighting for children they don't know  halfway across the world. Standing with these students and working to  further their mission is why I am proud to be a Member of this body: to  ensure that students like this have their voices heard by Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to going back to Chicago and the Bell  Elementary students to tell them that Congress is listening.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, first, I want to thank staff on both  sides for putting this together. On the majority side: Laura, Marybeth,  Elliot, Aalok, Parker, and Matt. On the minority side, John Martens;  and from my own staff, Charlie and Max.   I do want to thank Mr. Womack, the ranking member, who is a friend, a  gentleman, and very easy to work with at a complicated time and his  apparent insistence on being a Cardinals fan, as he just raised. He  doesn't seem to mind when I bring up the St. Louis professional  football and basketball teams, but we will leave that to another day.   As to the bill, the bill recommends $29 billion. This is an increase  of $4.8 billion over the comparable year of 2021.   It includes $13.6 billion for the IRS, an increase of $1.7 billion  above fiscal 2021, a first step toward restoring the cuts this agency  has suffered. The increase will improve enforcement activities and  support better customer service.   Notably, the bill includes $330 million for Community Development  Financial Institutions, which is $60 million above the fiscal year 2021  level to provide critical resources to underserved communities.   The bill provides $324 million for the Small Business  Administration's Entrepreneurial Development Programs, which is $52  million above fiscal year 2021.   It also includes significant funding for the General Services  Administration, including $300 million for a new Electric Vehicles  Fund, $100 million for the GSA to manage climate change risks, and over  $1 billion to modernize and improve the GSA real property portfolio by  reducing their climate impact and improving resiliency.   The bill also includes $300 million for the High Intensity Drug  Trafficking Areas Program, an increase of $10 million, and the Drug- Free Communities Program is funded at $110 million.   In the lead-up to our country's 250th anniversary, the bill includes  much-needed funding for the modernization of the National Archives  building, which houses the Declaration of Independence, the  Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.   The bill includes $8.15 billion in discretionary appropriations for  the judicial branch, an increase to fund protective services and  physical security needed in courthouses and ensure the continued  operations of the judiciary.   The bill also increases funding for agencies to protect everyday  consumers and retail investors, including the Consumer Product Safety  Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and  Exchange Commission.   I am proud this bill removes several longstanding policy riders,  including many that dictate to the District of Columbia how to manage  its own affairs or spend its own money or that harm and limit  transparency in political spending.   Finally, I would like to take a moment to highlight an issue that is  a priority of mine, election security.   This bill today includes $500 million for payments to States to help  them meet the challenge of ensuring the real security and integrity of  American elections. This represents our continued commitment to long- term funding for election security.
