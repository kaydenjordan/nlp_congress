 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Police  Week, which serves as a reminder to remember and memorialize law  enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty.   Tragically, this includes two Oklahomans, Sergeant C.J. Nelson and  Sergeant Bobby Swartz. These officers have 32 years of combined service  for their respective forces, and both leave behind loved ones.   I offer my deepest condolences and prayers to their families. We will  always remember the sacrifice of these two heroes, and we cannot thank  them enough for protecting and serving our communities.   From Isaiah 40:31, ``But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew  their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall  run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.''                            ____________________
