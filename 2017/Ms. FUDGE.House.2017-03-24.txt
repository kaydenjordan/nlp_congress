 Mr. Speaker, what is a life worth? What does it cost to  save the life of a sick child or a senior citizen?   For all of the rhetoric about freedom and choices, this bill sends a  clear message to every American as to where Republican priorities lie.  Tax breaks to the wealthy have been deemed more valuable than  lifesaving care.   They are telling hardworking families that insurance that only  benefits the wealthy, the healthy, and the young is more important than  access to nursing homes, to pediatric care, mental health services,  substance abuse treatment, and the overall peace of mind that, if you  get sick, you can afford care.   Speaker Ryan calls this ``an act of mercy.'' This is by no means  merciful, Mr. Speaker. Mercy is caring for the sick, the poor, for our  elders. Mercy is extending a hand to those in need. This is heartless.   Human decency demands a ``no'' vote on TrumpCare. Vote ``no.''
