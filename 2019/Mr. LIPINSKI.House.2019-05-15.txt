 Madam Speaker, all Americans deserve equal treatment  under the law and should have these rights protected, including  individuals in the LGBT community.   They should be able to compete equally for jobs, be assured equal  opportunity in education, housing, financial, and judicial settings.   At the same time, the free exercise of religious beliefs is a core  ideal of our country, protected in the Constitution and through Federal  law.   The Equality Act explicitly prevents application of the Religious  Freedom Restoration Act, RFRA. This law was passed nearly unanimously  in 1993 by a Democratic House, Senate, and White House.   Congress has never passed a law that shrinks or exempts itself from  RFRA. It is critical to ensuring that religious freedom stands a chance  of being fully lived out and fairly treated in court.   This week, I will vote for the Equality Act for the broader goals.  But before it becomes law, we must do more to ensure religious liberty.                            ____________________
