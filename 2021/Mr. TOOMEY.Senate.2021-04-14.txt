 Continuing the reading of a letter from a Birmingham  jail.         Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up       with America's destiny. Before the pilgrims landed at       Plymouth, we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched       the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence across       the pages of history, we were here. For more than two       centuries, our forebears labored in this country without       wages; they made cotton king; they built the homes of their       masters while suffering gross injustice and shameful       humiliation--and yet out of a bottomless vitality they       continued to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible       cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now       face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the       sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are       embodied in our echoing demands. Before closing I feel       impelled to mention one other point in your statement that       has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the       Birmingham police force for keeping ``order'' and       ``preventing violence.'' I doubt that you would have so       warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs       sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt       that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were       to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here       in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse       old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see       them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were       to observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give       us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I       cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police       department.        It is true that the police have exercised a degree of       discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they       have conducted themselves rather ``nonviolently'' in public.       But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of       segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently       preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must       be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make it clear       that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends.       But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps       even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends.       Perhaps, Mr. Connor and his policemen had been rather       nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany,       Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to       maintain the immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. Elliot       has said: ``The last temptation is the greatest treason: To       do the right deed for the wrong reason.'' I wish you had       commended the Negro sit inners and demonstrators of       Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to       suffer, and their amazing discipline in the midst of great       provocation. One day the South will recognize its real       heroes. They will be the James Merediths, with the noble       sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering and       hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that       characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old,       oppressed battered Negro women symbolized in a seventy two       year old woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a       sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride       segregated buses, and who responded with ungrammatical       profundity to one who inquired about her weariness: ``My       feets is tired, but my soul is at rest.'' They will be the       young high school and college students, the young ministers       of the gospel and a host of their elders, courageously and       nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going       to jail for conscience' sake. One day the South will know       that when these disinherited children of God sat down at       lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is       best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in       our Judeo Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation       back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by       the founding founders in their formulation of the       Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.   Never before have I written so long a letter. I'm afraid it is much  too long to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would  have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk,  but what else can one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell, other  than write long letters, think long thoughts, and pray long prayers?        If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the       truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to       forgive me. If I have said anything that understates the       truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to       settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to       forgive me. I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith.       I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for       me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-      rights leader but as a fellow clergymen and a Christian       brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial       prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of       misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched       communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow, the       radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our       great nation with all their scintillating beauty.        Yours for the cause of Peace and Brotherhood,    Mr. President, I rise today to join my Sikh friends,  Pennsylvania's Sikh community, and Sikhs around the world in  recognizing two important Sikh celebrations taking place this week:  (the holiday of Vaisakhi and the 400th anniversary of the birth of Guru  Teg Bahadur.   Sikhism traces its origins to the Punjab region of India and has  flourished around the world for nearly 600 years. The Sikh tradition is  built upon ideals of peace, respect, and equality. Further, Sikhs are  dedicated to the principle that every person is created equal before  God, no matter their race, gender, religion, or creed. Today, Sikhs  number 30 million globally, making Sikhism one of the world's major  religions. Nearly 700,000 Sikhs live in the United States, and many of  them have made Pennsylvania their home.   Sikhs share a strong sense of community, family, and selfless  service, as evidenced by their commitment to welcoming and serving  individuals from all religious, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Sikh communities across the country,  including in Pennsylvania, mobilized to deliver meals, groceries,  masks, and other supplies to tens of thousands of families in need. In  my own travels across the Commonwealth, I have witnessed firsthand the  spirit of this community when meeting with Sikh constituents. It is  clear they have enriched their neighborhoods and contributed in  numerous ways to the growth and vitality of Pennsylvania and the United  States.   As a proud member of the American Sikh Congressional Caucus, each  year, I join many voices across Congress and the United States in  commemorating the holiday of Vaisakhi, which took place on April 13  this year. Vaisakhi marks the spring harvest and serves as a day of  reflection of Sikhism's origins. During Vaisakhi, Sikhs commemorate the  founding in 1699 of the Khalsa Panth, an order of devout Sikhs who  played a fundamental role in cultivating the religion's history and  identity.   Traditionally, Sikhs recognize Vaisakhi with parades, dancing,  singing, and other festivities. Sikhs also commemorate this special day  with community service, both organizing and volunteering in various  community projects. In years past, Sikhs from around the country have  organized a parade here in Washington, DC to commemorate Vaisakhi as  National Sikh Day. While the pandemic has prevented such largescale,  public celebrations both last year and this year, I look forward to  welcoming Pennsylvania's Sikh community back to D.C. in the years to  come.   In addition to celebrating Vaisakhi, Sikhs will also mark the 400th  anniversary of the birth of spiritual leader Guru Teg Bahadur on April  18. The Ninth Guru of Sikhism, Guru Teg Bahadur is remembered as a  champion of religious liberty for all. In 1675, Guru Teg Bahadur  confronted Moghul Emperor Aurangzeb against the forced religious  conversation of Hindus, an act for which he was publicly beheaded in  Delhi. In giving his life to protect a religion that was not his own,  he is fondly remembered by Sikhs as Dhram Di Chadar, or Shield of the  Religions.   I extend my best wishes to the Sikh community for the joyous  celebrations of Vaisakhi and the 400th anniversary of the birth of Guru  Teg Bahadur.                            ____________________
