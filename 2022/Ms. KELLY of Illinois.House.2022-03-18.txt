 Madam Speaker, during the COVID-19 pandemic,  vulnerabilities that have existed in our domestic supply chains for  years were put to the test.   The vulnerabilities of our supply chain resulted in consumers being  faced with empty shelves at stores and small businesses struggling to  reach consumers.   We must act now to restore our supply chain and ensure that our  economy is prepared for the next crisis.   The House took the first step in passing the America COMPETES Act. As  the House and Senate resolve differences, we must include the supply  chain provisions in the final House bill so we can repair these supply  chain vulnerabilities.   The supply chain provisions included the Supply CHAIN Act, which I  led with Representatives Bordeaux and Kinzinger.   We need an office of supply chain resilience and crisis response at  the Department of Commerce to monitor critical supply chains and  encourage partnerships between the Federal Government and industry.   It is time to repair our supply chains and protect our economy.                            ____________________
