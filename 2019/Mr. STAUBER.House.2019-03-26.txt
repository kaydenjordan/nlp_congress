 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of World Down Syndrome  Awareness Day, which was Thursday, March 21.   One of the greatest blessings in my life is my 16-year-old son,  Isaac, who has Down syndrome. Each day, he brings joy to our lives, and  I am so proud of everything he has accomplished.   World Down Syndrome Awareness Day is an excellent opportunity to  raise awareness about the challenges that Down syndrome brings, but it  is also a chance to celebrate just how incredible people with Down  syndrome truly are. It absolutely breaks my heart--just breaks my  heart--when I hear some people say that they would rather get an  abortion than have a child with Down syndrome.   The sheer ignorance of those individuals is disheartening to me. They  do not see what a blessing all of God's children are, even if they are  different, and that is unfortunate for them. If they met my son Isaac,  I know they would have a change of heart.   When we talk about disabilities, I want us to talk about the  abilities of those like my son Isaac. Instead of focusing on what they  can't do, let's focus on what they can do.   The limit to what people like Isaac can accomplish is not determined  by their condition but by how much we love them and give them the  empowerment so they can navigate the world of work, education, and  public life.   As Isaac's dad and now as a Member of Congress, I am committed to  strongly advocating for the inclusiveness of those who live with  disabilities and the protection of their lives, always.
