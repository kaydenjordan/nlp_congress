 Madam President, I came to the floor to speak on another  topic, but I want to join in the comments of the Republican leader  about Richard Shelby of Alabama.   We became friends under different political circumstances when he  served in the House of Representatives. It has been my honor to count  him as a friend and to have the occasion to travel with him and  Annette, his wife, in the past. I am going to miss my friend.   I wish you well, and I am sure you have got some football to watch in  Alabama when you get home.    I announce that the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Cardin),  the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Hickenlooper), the Senator from Virginia  (Mr. Kaine), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Manchin), the Senator  from Washington (Mrs. Murray), the Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs.  Shaheen), and the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) are  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize  an important person who is critical to the functioning of the U.S.  Senate and, more importantly, who has been an important part of the  lives of many young Senate families for over three decades.   Janet Green-Tucker, affectionately known as Ms. Janet, will be  retiring at the end of this month after 36 years of service as a  teacher at the Senate Employees Child Care Center. Having joined the  center just a few short years after its opening on February 27, 1984,  Janet personified the sense of warmth, skill, patience, and community  that are well known to the Senate families.   We have all had teachers who touched our lives, providing guidance  during difficult times or sparking our imaginations. Janet has done so  for hundreds of children over the years, nourishing young minds at a  critical time in their development. She was a walking encyclopedia of  wisdom for all families. In fact, at least one of Janet's former  students is now a parent herself, making her a ``grand-teacher!'' For  many years she was one-half of the ``Green Team'' alongside fellow  teacher, Phyllis Green, who also retired earlier this year after an  impactful decades long career at the center.   Janet is especially beloved by many families on my staff whose  children had the privilege of being taught by her: Rayn, Leo, Alex,  William, Avery, and Harry. Even children who weren't in her class could  always count on a comforting hug in the hallway from Janet. Janet is  also adored by her colleagues. She was always willing to go above and  beyond, to support fellow teachers new and old, take care of monthly  playground inspections, and lend a hand throughout the center no matter  the task. And as an avid baker, Janet's colleagues were more than happy  to taste her latest treats and would fight for the last crumb.   During the past 36 years, Janet also raised twin boys of her own,  Jarard and Jarron,    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S7306, December 19, 2022, in the third column, the  following appears: During the past 36 years, Janet also raised  twin boys of her own, Jarrod and Jaron,      The online Record has been corrected to read: During the past 36  years, Janet also raised twin boys of her own, Jarard and Jarron,    ========================= END NOTE =========================   alongside her husband Marvin, and is now looking forward to spending      time with her grandchildren. In 2014, Senator Tom Harkin aptly  described the teachers and administrators at the Senate Employees Child  Care Center as the ``unsung heroes'' of the Senate. It is my privilege        to sing the praises of Janet as one of those unsung heroes.   I wish her all the best as she embarks on a well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
