 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for her  leadership, for yielding, and for her tireless work day and night on  behalf of the American people.   As a member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am really pleased to see such a  comprehensive bill that strongly invests in our communities.   For example, there is a $150 million increase for HIV research at NIH  and an $8 million increase to the Office of Minority Health to ensure  decreases in health disparities for our communities of color. We have a  $92 million increase to Historically Black Colleges and Universities'  and Hispanic-Serving Institutions' undergraduate programs to help  improve higher education access for our students of color.   Also, it is important to recognize the $65 million increase to the  Education Innovation Research grants for computer science for young  girls and students of color, and the $9 million increase for teen  pregnancy prevention and the $114 million increase to Title X Family  Planning, both programs providing evidence-based, comprehensive sex  education.   Also, as the proud vice chair of the State, Foreign Operations, and  Related Programs Subcommittee, we increased the Global Fund. It  remains, of course, at 33 percent, sending an important signal, in  terms of our leadership to international partners, that we intend for  the United States to stay in the leadership to address the HIV/AIDS  pandemic.                                time  1515    Let me just say, with regard to defense, yes, we did, and I want to  thank those who have supported this effort to repeal the 2001 AUMF,  Authorization to Use Military Force.   It was passed 3 days after the horrific tragedy of 9/11. It was 60  words. It has now allowed for the use of force over 41 times in 17  countries, unrelated to the terrible events of 9/11.   So, we need to do our job. We need to allow Congress to debate and  make some decisions on a new AUMF.    Mr. Chair, the point is we will have 8 months  to debate a new authorization, depending on what this Congress  determines should move forward as the Authorization to Use Military  Force.   The 2001 was passed in 3 days. Certainly, 8 months gives us enough  time to do our job. The Constitution requires us not to be missing in  action.   We have the power of the purse, and we should use that because we  have sent our young men and women into harm's way. They have done their  job. They need to know now that, in the wars in which they are engaged,  Congress has their back.   We should make some decisions on this, and it doesn't make any sense  to  [[Page H4459]]  continue using this authorization on wars 18 years later.   Twenty percent of Members of Congress serving today were here in  2001. Members deserve to represent their constituents and to debate and  to make sure their voices are heard also.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   First of all, this dangerous and discriminatory rule attempts to  enshrine discrimination in virtually all facets of healthcare by  granting new rights to those who believe that their personal and  religious beliefs should determine the care that a patient receives.   Under this rule, nearly anyone or any entity involved in a patient's  care, from a pharmacist, to a receptionist who schedules procedures, to  hospital room schedulers, can put their personal and religious beliefs  ahead of a patient's health.   This rule could mean that rape survivors, same-sex couples, women  with unintended pregnancies, those seeking life-saving abortions, and  transgender patients could all be refused medical care.   Mr. Chair, I have to tell a story. This reminds me of my late mother.  When my mother was pregnant and about to deliver me, she needed a  cesarean section. She was refused admittance into the hospital because  she was Black. She nearly died. I almost didn't make it here into this  world because of religious beliefs that it was okay to deny healthcare  to African Americans.   Mr. Chair, let's not go back there.   One's personal religious beliefs should never determine the care a  patient receives. Instead, hospitals, doctors, nurses, and other  individuals should be making decisions based on what is best for the  patient.   Mr. Chair, yes, we know that it is those who need care the most that  will be disproportionally impacted, like patients of color, low-income  patients, and the LGBTQ community.   Mr. Chair, I urge defeat of this amendment. It is discriminatory, it  is dangerous. Let's not go back to the days of discrimination. It is  un-American.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of my  friend from Florida's amendment to increase funding for legal services,  child advocates, and post-release services in the Office of Refugee  Resettlement Unaccompanied Alien Children's Program, and I thank the  Congresswoman so much for introducing this amendment. That is why the  underlying bill under consideration today set aside a minimum of $190  million for these activities. Legal services need to be a priority for  these children.   Studies have demonstrated that when a child has access to legal  representation, the in absentia rate drops to 5 percent. Released  children with attorneys show up to court and continue to show up to  court until case completion in 95 percent of the cases.   Child advocates support the most vulnerable of children who are in  ORR's care. There were 15,000 tender-age children, children under the  age of 12, in ORR's care last year. This year, more than 11,000  children have been transferred to HHS care, through April, and again,  that is only for children ages zero to 12.   Legal services, child advocates, and post-release services cannot be  considered optional, and we should not fund them as if they are. So I  thank the gentlewoman, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.    Mr. Chairman, let me thank my colleague and  friend from northern California, next door to my district, for offering  this amendment and for his tremendous leadership on so many issues  relating to our working men and women.   Mr. Chairman, I am concerned that a decade of flat funding has left  BLS in critical condition, which is why the underlying bill increases  funding for BLS by $61 million over the 2019 enacted level. This  investment will make up for the loss of purchasing power and help BLS  take full advantage of advances in statistical methods to promote the  high-quality statistics required for a thriving 21st century economy.  Expanded capacity will allow BLS to better examine critical issues such  as job loss due to automation, job loss due to contracting, and mass  layoffs.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate this amendment. It has drawn more  attention to the importance of BLS, and I am happy to support it.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment.   Lack of communication can lead to barriers, it can prevent survivors  from restoring their quality of life, and really prevents patients,  survivors, from understanding all of their options and  [[Page H4535]]  their course of treatment so that they, too, can stand here with us.   I thank my colleague for sharing his personal story to make sure that  others understand what is necessary and using his experiences to help  others.   The committee recognizes the leadership of the National Cancer  Institute's Office of Cancer Survivorship. The report encourages the  office to expand its focus, in particular, on the needs of childhood  cancer survivors.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' This is so  important to reduce the barriers to care.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this  amendment and Statewide Family Engagement Centers. I thank the  gentleman for offering it.   This vital program helps States and school districts implement  evidence-based family engagement strategies that promote student  success, including programs that engage diverse families and  interventions that address specific parent needs. To expand these  proven practices, the underlying bill increases the program by $5  million over the 2019 enacted level.   However, I am aware of and concerned by reports that a processing  error by the Department of Education will cause reduced awards for  existing grantees, and I hope to work with my colleagues in the Senate  to address this problem.   So I appreciate that the amendment is drawing attention to the  importance of this program and this issue, and I am very happy to  support it.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding  and say, once again, that I rise in strong support of this amendment.   In any given year, the percentage of young people with mental,  emotional, and behavioral disorders is estimated to be between 14 and  20 percent.   These disorders among young people interfere with their ability to  accomplish developmental tasks, such as healthy interpersonal  relationships, succeeding in school, and, ultimately, transitioning  into the workforce. Also, early signs of difficulties can help prevent  violent outbreaks at school.   Now, as a clinical social worker by profession and chair of the  Social Work Caucus here in the House of Representatives, I know the  importance of addressing the mental health needs of our children where  they are, and that is at school.   I am proud that the underlying bill that we are considering includes  an increase of $13 million for Project AWARE, which supports mental  health strategies in schools.   School-based mental health needs, including training for school  personnel to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental health issues,  are critically important to identifying and referring children to  services.   Mr. Chair, I again thank Congressman DeSaulnier and urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise in strong support of this bipartisan amendment. Recent  research has found that food allergies are far more common in the  United States than previously thought, and the prevalence has been  increasing in the last two decades.   Food allergies can cause severe reactions and can even be deadly.  Allergic reactions to food lead to more than 200,000 emergency room  visits each year.   The Consortium of Food Allergy Research at the National Institute of  Allergy and Infectious Diseases is supporting research to identify the  causes of and treatments for food allergies. The proposed funding  increase will allow this critical research to continue and to  accelerate.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I thank the  gentleman from California again for offering it.    Madam Chair, first, let me thank the gentleman  for yielding and for this amendment.   I rise in strong support of this amendment. More women die from  pregnancy-related complications in the United States than any other  developed country.   There are major disparities. For example, Black women are 3 to 4  times more likely than White women to die during pregnancy or  childbirth.   I was proud to support a new initiative to address maternal mortality  in the fiscal year 2019 appropriations act. This amendment will enable  the bureau to expand support for State Maternal Health Innovation  Grants, which fund evidence-based, State-led demonstrations to improve  maternal care service delivery and, ultimately, reduce maternal  mortality.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I thank the  gentleman for offering this tonight.                                time  2145     Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment would cut funding  for important programs and services that provide opportunities for  working families. Many of these programs are already underfunded and  fail to meet the existing need.   For instance, the amendment would cut Head Start by more than $1.6  billion, denying slots to 80,000 children we are trying to provide with  access to high quality, early learning programs, as well as rejecting  our proposal to increase funding for trauma-informed care, which is  critical for children affected by the opioid crisis.   This amendment would cut after-school programs by $185 million,  taking away enrichment opportunities for roughly 222,000 students.   It would cut Title I funding by $2.4 billion, reducing resources for  an estimated 25 million students in high-poverty schools.   It would cut the number of new and competing research grants at NIH  by approximately 87 percent, which is over 10,000 fewer new research  grants.   It cuts tens of millions of nutritious meals for more than 2 million  low-income seniors.   Also, this amendment would close Social Security field offices in  every district, while worsening wait times for in-person services,  phone services, and exacerbating the disability hearings backlog.   It would also cut Federal Work Study programs by $200 million,  resulting in 114,000 fewer awards to students.   The sponsor of the amendment cites the national debt as a reason to  cut funding to programs that benefit working families, but I note that  he did vote for the Republican tax scam, which added more than $2  trillion to the national debt by cutting taxes for big corporations and  the wealthiest families.   My Republican colleagues don't object to adding to the debt when it  benefits corporations and the wealthy. They only object to it if it  means providing opportunities for hardworking families.   Madam Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, this amendment would cut $25.6  billion from programs that fund schools, Pell Grants, community health  centers, substance abuse prevention and treatment, biomedical research,  the CDC, childcare, and early childhood learning programs, also job  training, as well as agencies that protect workers and workplaces,  among so many other programs that provide opportunities to low and  middle-income families.   The amendment is totally misguided, and it will harm tens of millions  of Americans.   Madam Chair, I strongly oppose it. I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, first let me thank the gentleman  from Massachusetts for offering this extremely important amendment, and  I fully support it.   Social factors such as poverty, substandard housing, and unsafe  neighborhoods are critical drivers of health outcomes. I share the  gentleman's concern and agree that we need to better understand how  environmental conditions such as these play a role in human health.   Let me just say to the gentleman, we work very closely with the  Black, Hispanic, and Asian Pacific American Caucus in terms of our  health strategies with regard to communities of color to close health  disparities. This amendment is so important in those efforts.   I would note, also, that the committee report accompanying the Labor- HHS appropriations bill encourages the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services to clarify and disseminate strategies to States to  address social  [[Page H4579]]  determinants of health in the Medicaid and CHIP programs.   I thank the gentleman once again for offering this amendment and urge  my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Chairman, first let me thank my colleague  for raising the importance of the American history and civics national  activities program, and I support this amendment.   These competitive grants reflect one of two dedicated funding streams  for civic and American history in the Labor-HHS bill helping to spur  innovation and assist underserved students.  [[Page H4580]]  The underlying bill rejects the Trump administration's harmful budget  request to eliminate these programs.   I appreciate that the amendment draws attention to the importance of  the American History and Civics National Activities program, and I am  happy to support it, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.   I thank the gentleman, again, for the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me thank the  gentleman for this very important amendment, and I rise in strong  support of it.   Civilian first responders in the disciplines of law enforcement, fire  services, and emergency medical services routinely face highly  stressful situations. They are the ones we call upon when we are in  need. This amendment raises attention to the importance of the mental  health needs of our first responders.   Peer-to-peer mental health programs for our first responders  acknowledge that those who are committed to the same type of work may  be the ones best suited to support their own colleagues' mental health.   For so long mental health issues were relegated to the shadows,  approached with the shame and misunderstanding that only exacerbates  pain for people and their families.   Now, as a clinical social worker myself by profession and the chair  of the Social Work Caucus here in the House, we know how widespread  these issues are. It is up to all of us to work to erase the stigma  around mental health.   I thank my colleague for offering this amendment, and I urge its  adoption.
