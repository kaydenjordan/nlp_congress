 Mr. President, over the years, I have heard President  Biden share a favorite expression of his father's. He said his dad  would tell you:         Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget and I'll       tell you what you value.    Well, there is a lot of wisdom in that statement. A person's budget  shows what they truly value, whether that is supporting those who are  less fortunate, saving for the future, or achieving a certain type of  lifestyle. The same is true for the Federal Government. It is easy for  leaders to say they value a strong military or fiscal responsibility,  but a budget shows whether they really mean it.   Last week, of course, President Biden released his budget for the  next fiscal year, which gave us an unvarnished view of what he truly  values. In countless ways, it stands in stark contrast to what he has  told the American people.   The President spoke about the need to rein in out-of-control  spending, but he proposed more than $2 trillion in new spending.   Given the growing threats from China and Russia, he says he cares  about a strong national defense, but he proposed a mere 3.2-percent  increase in defense spending--far below the level of inflation. So it  actually is a cut.   He has spoken about the importance of growing our economy, but he  proposed additional job-killing tax hikes on Main Street businesses and  other job creators.   He says he is concerned about energy costs but proposed $37 billion  in new energy taxes--taxes that will be paid ultimately by the consumer  in increased costs.   Despite saying he cares about the border, President Biden made it  absolutely clear he isn't serious about addressing the crisis at our  southern border. For 2 years, law enforcement and border communities  have struggled to keep up with the overwhelming number of migrants who  are crossing every day. During President Biden's first 2 years in  office, Customs and Border Protection encountered 4.7 million--4.7  million--migrants at the southern border. That is astonishing, a  breathtaking figure.   Well, there is a clear need, an obvious need to strengthen our border  security, and the President's budget request includes $535 million for  border security technology at and between the ports of entry. At ports,  this could include advanced equipment to efficiently scan cargo and  passenger vehicles.   Mexico is our second largest trading partner, and that binational  trade is important to both of our economies. But this same technology  could be key to stopping illicit drugs, weapons, and currency from  coming across the border.   Between the ports of entry, this funding could go toward sensors,  cameras, and other surveillance tools that allow Border Patrol agents  to monitor unpatrolled portions of the border and to spring into action  when necessary.    Given the ongoing migration crisis and fentanyl epidemic which is  killing 70,000 Americans every year, there could not be a more  important time to invest in border security. While the President's  request for $535 million may sound like a lot of money--and it is a lot  of money--when you compare it to other line items in his budget, it  starts to look a whole lot smaller. For example, the White House wants  to spend $1 billion trying to address the ``root causes'' of migration  in Central America and Haiti. That is nearly double the amount he wants  to spend on border security technology.   Over the last few years, we have seen failed attempts to alleviate  what are called the push factors--violence and poverty--that cause  people to leave their home countries and come to the United States. But  don't forget that these migrants are not just coming from Central  America and Haiti; they are literally coming from all over the world.  Best case scenario, it would take years, if ever, before these efforts  would translate to even 1 inch of progress at the border.   I have said before what I learned at the Yuma Border Patrol Sector in  southwestern Arizona when the Border Patrol chief said that in this  sector alone, a sleepy little agricultural community, we have people  coming across the border from 176 countries, speaking 200 languages.  This is a global phenomenon not just isolated to Central America and  Haiti.   Well, worst case scenario, the administration flushes $1 billion down  the drain while the border remains in a state of crisis.   The White House wants to spend even more money on the Department of  Homeland Security's climate resilience program--climate resilience. A  whopping $4 billion is what they want for that. That is more than seven  times higher than what the President has proposed for border security  technology. Now, the mission of the Department of Homeland Security  isn't to fight climate change; it is to safeguard the American people.  It cannot achieve that mission with the meager budget proposed by  President Biden and the lack of priorities.   You may think that climate resilience is an important matter, but it  certainly doesn't rise to the level of the crisis we are experiencing  today on the border, with an overwhelming number of migrants and  illegal drugs that killed 108,000 Americans last year alone.  [[Page S764]]    Of course, the funding level requested for technology is only part of  the problem. The question isn't just how much do you want to spend but  what do you need to spend it on?   As I mentioned, this is one pot of funding that would support two  purposes: security at the border and security between the ports of  entry. Both of those functions are essential to our security and our  economy, but the White House didn't delineate how it would split that  funding. Would it be divided 50-50? Would it be distributed based on  need? How would the administration ensure that it was closing the  highest priority security gaps first?   We have a responsibility to taxpayers to ensure that every dollar is  maximized and serves the greatest purpose possible. A few years ago,  Senator Sinema, the Senator from Arizona, and I introduced something  called the Southwest Border Security Technology Improvement Act to help  understand the best way to do that.   It required the administration to assess technology needs at the  border and issue a report within a year. Our bill was signed into law  at the end of 2020, and the deadline for that final report was December  27, 2021. Well, 15 months has passed, and we still have no report. I  have repeatedly asked for updates from the administration but received  zero response.   In short, the administration has failed to provide an assessment that  is necessary for Congress to determine what the technology gaps are at  the border and what the priority should be. Instead, they just ask  Congress for a $535 million blank check. They have offered zero  assurance that they plan to use those funds to increase operational  control over the border. They haven't even assured us they know what  those needs are. Once again, the administration isn't trying to solve  the problem--just to create an illusion of effort.   But technology funding isn't the only problem with the President's  budget; it also falls short when it comes to personnel.   I have been to the southern border more times than I can count--but I  do count 10 times--since President Biden took office, and I have spoken  with every law enforcement officer and local elected official,  nonprofit, and small business owner I could find. When I ask them what  is needed the most to combat this crisis, there is a recurring answer:  We need more boots on the ground. We desperately need more Border  Patrol agents on the frontline.   The administration wants to hire an additional 350 Border Patrol  agents, which would be a great start, but the White House isn't taking  any action to address underlying barriers to hiring those agents.   For years, the Agency struggled to meet its staffing goals, and one  of the biggest obstacles is the polygraph requirement. Roughly half of  new applicants fail the polygraph, which one officer described as  ``high-tech voodoo.'' Applicants have shared stories of aggressive and  condescending examiners. They talk about being stereotyped based on  their background and traveling to other States in hopes of having a  different experience.   Still, failing a polygraph or receiving an ``inconclusive'' result  disqualifies a potential agent. So it wouldn't matter if the White  House called for 10,000 new Border Patrol agents in its budget; the  Agency would not be able to fill those spots until the administration  fixes the broken application process, and we have seen no indication of  their plans to do so.   The White House is also calling for 460 processing assistants at  Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  These would be the men and women who would help process the migrants.  Based on my conversations with folks at the border, I can tell you  these additions are desperately needed, but that is only one piece of  the solution.   A huge part of the solution lies in deterrence. If people with  frivolous asylum claims see they will quickly be removed from the  United States, they aren't likely to attempt the journey to our border  in the first place. That is why we just can't staff up on processing  coordinators; we need more personnel to actually enforce the law and  deliver consequences to those who break it.   The Biden administration has refused to do so time and time again,  and the Biden budget only makes insignificant changes to staffing for  Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations, as well as  Fugitive Operations team members. These are the dedicated men and women  who do the difficult but important job of removing people who have no  legal right to enter the country. But right now, the system is so  overwhelmed with migrants who will not be ultimately granted asylum. So  what happens when their claim is denied? It is an important question to  ask because I can assure you, ICE does not have the sufficient manpower  to enforce the law given the scale of this crisis.   In short, the White House has proposed adding more personnel to  process migrants and then release them, but it doesn't want to hire  more people who will actually remove people who break our laws. Based  on his own assessment strategy, President Biden does not value border  security because his budget certainly does not reflect it. His budget  is not a serious proposal to gain operational control of the border. It  is more talk with no action.   Our country is experiencing an absolutely unprecedented migration  crisis. The southern border has become an open highway instead of a  secured checkpoint. The administration is essentially waving everyone  through--from migrants with frivolous asylum claims to the drug runners  who are carrying fentanyl that kills our fellow Americans. Based on  President Biden's budget, he appears content for it to stay that way.   I yield the floor.
