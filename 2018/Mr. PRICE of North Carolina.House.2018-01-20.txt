 Mr. Speaker, we are 3\1/2\ months into  the fiscal year without a budget. Republicans are proposing to lurch  along another month with no resolution in sight and no commitment to  address critical investments. Democrats will not be a party to further  delay.   It is not a great mystery how to deal with this. We have done it each  of the last 4 years. We must have a year-long budget in place with a  bipartisan agreement to adjust the defense and nondefense caps so that  we can pass our 12 appropriations bills. Democrats have been willing to  enter into such agreement for at least 6 months.   Republican leaders need to reject their Tea Party extremists and  conclude a budget agreement across the aisle.   We also must be assured of progress toward resolving the status of  DREAMers, the 800,000 young people who were brought here as children  and have known no other country. President Trump created a crisis in  removing the DREAMers' protection. He asked Congress to devise a long- term solution; he then blew up the solution. They are dangerously  exposed. We must address their dilemma.
