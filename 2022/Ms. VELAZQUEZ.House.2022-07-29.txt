 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   There are at least 40 States and two territories with ongoing  disaster declarations for drought. The Small Business Administration is  currently serving the millions of small businesses and residents in  those States to provide relief against economic loss.   The SBA has also provided almost $1 billion in wildfire disaster  relief since 2016.   The amendment I am offering, along with my colleague, Congressman  Garret Graves of Louisiana, would permanently set the unsecured credit  threshold for SBA's disaster loans at $25,000. Doing so gives the  millions of borrowers affected by any natural disaster, including  wildfires and droughts, the peace of mind during a stressful and  traumatic time.   In 2015, Congress enacted the RISE Act, legislation I championed that  temporarily raised the collateral threshold on SBA disaster loans to  make it easier for victims to obtain capital to rebuild their homes and  businesses. Unfortunately, that provision is scheduled to expire in  November unless it is extended or made permanent.   My amendment will make the provision permanent, allowing disaster  victims to continue to receive a $25,000 loan, rather than just  $14,000, without requiring them to provide collateral within 5 days of  closing.   A recent report issued by the Government Accountability Office found  that disaster loans with collateral performed comparably to those  without collateral. Given this finding, it makes sense to help victims  of disaster to rebuild quickly, particularly when they have lost  everything to hurricane, flood, or fire.   As we continue to experience stronger and more frequent disasters, it  is imperative that Congress enact policies to help communities get back  on their feet and maximize support when they need it most.   Finally, this amendment is supported by the Small Business  Administration. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana, for his support  of this effort and his overall support of SBA's disaster loan program.   I thank Chairmen Grijalva and McGovern for working with me on this  amendment.   I am proud to leave the Small Businesses Committee's bipartisan work  to make disaster loans more affordable and accessible for disaster  victims, while also addressing fraud in the SBA's pandemic relief  programs.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time  [[Page H7491]]         Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, as the designee of Chair Grijalva, I move  that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. Lee  of California) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Watson Coleman, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 5118) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to prioritize the  completion of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 5118.
