 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy) for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the  schedule for the week to come.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   I would ask him, Mr. Speaker, will the supplemental that the  gentleman mentioned--which is, as I understand, approximately $29  billion, which will take care of forest fires in the West; $16 billion,  as I understand it, in debt relief, which will raise the borrowing  level for FEMA; and then, of course, money directly for the victims of  the hurricanes. Can the gentleman tell me whether or not there will be  any, what I will call, extraneous matters that might be controversial,  or will this be a straight supplemental without controversy? We all  want to make sure that we have the resources to help.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his thought that  there will not be anything in there that would make it a partisan bill.  I think, as the President sent it down, it is, obviously, something  that we need to do quickly and in a bipartisan way.   Mr. Speaker, the majority leader and I have talked about the Dream  Act. Another week has gone by and, therefore, the 6-month deadline is  closer, and the President has urged us to pass legislation.   Can the gentleman tell me what the expectations are to address the  Dream Act?   As you know, Michelle Lujan Grisham, the chair of the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus, has filed a discharge petition on the bill sponsored  by Lucille Roybal-Allard and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Can the gentleman  tell me what progress we are making on that?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his answer.   Let me, if I might, Mr. Speaker, simply suggest to the gentleman, we  certainly understand, and this side agrees, we want to have secure  borders. There is, obviously, a disagreement on the President's  proposal of a wall, I think, frankly, on your side as well as on my  side of the aisle. I would hope that we would not, in effect, hold  hostage the 800,000 students, workers, and young people brought here as  children who know no other country.   In my discussions with Mr. Ryan, and his public comments have  indicated, he is sympathetic to making sure that we address that issue.  He urged, as you know, President Trump not to rescind DACA. The  President did anyway.   I am hopeful that we can deal with the DREAMers, which I think  certainly has very robust support on both sides of the aisle, in my  view, Mr. Leader. I hope we can deal with that without clouding it with  an issue, i.e., the wall. Not security; security I think we can reach  agreement on. But I am hopeful that we can do that.   The DREAMers are extraordinarily anxious. I presume you have met with  some of the DREAMers. They are really very impressive people and are  enhancing our communities and our country.   So I would hope that we could do that. I look forward to talking to  you personally about how we move forward and, hopefully, move quickly.  I would like to have done it by next week.   As you know, I said that it would be nice to do it in this work  period, to lay to rest the anxiety of the 800,000-plus people who will  be affected. But, if we can't do that, certainly I would hope that we  could do it shortly after we get back after the next district work  period.  [[Page H7883]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
