 Mr. Speaker, since before taking office, President Biden  and his far-left base have openly expressed their interest in expanding  the Supreme Court to create a super-legislature filled with unelected,  liberal Justices determined to do the job of Congress and legislate  from the bench.   After watching the nomination proceedings, I have no doubt that Judge  Jackson will be exactly that, a rubber stamp for President Biden's  agenda, not an impartial Justice who interprets the Constitution how it  is written.   I believe Judge Jackson's repeated leniency in Federal sentencing  cases toward prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, child sex offenders, and  convicted criminal drug traffickers gives us a window into her activist  judicial philosophy and renders her unsuitable to serve on the highest  court.   On behalf of my neighbors in middle Tennessee, I urge both of our  Tennessee Senators to vote ``no'' on confirming Judge Jackson.                            ____________________
