 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Teresa  Shymansky of Solon, Iowa, for her incredible work with her nonprofit  foundation, Something Beautiful.   Teresa operates a floral design and art studio in her home in Johnson  [[Page H2795]]  County with a mission to restore hope and dignity to women and children  who have fallen victim to trafficking and sexual abuse.   With the proceeds raised, Teresa funds scholarships for victims of  abuse and supports global initiatives such as Operation Underground  Railroad. Operation Underground Railroad works to save children around  the globe from sexual exploitation.   Teresa offers a space for healing and creativity for those who  desperately need it, using the wonders of Iowa's landscape as a space  for renewal and rebirth.   Mother Teresa once said: ``Be kind and merciful. Let no one ever come  to you without coming away better and happier.''   Through her work, Teresa not only believes this statement to be true,  but she also practices its teachings daily.   I commend Teresa on all her dedication and hard work in helping  vulnerable members of our community while donating her time and  resources to help turn traumatic experiences into something beautiful.                            ____________________
