 Mr. Speaker, the cost of health insurance is on the minds  of many Americans this summer, and it should be.   Nearly half a million people in North Carolina buy their health  insurance on the ObamaCare marketplace. The average price for these  plans continues to go up each and every year.   This wouldn't be as much of an issue if there were many options to  choose from, but, unfortunately, there are not. Blue Cross, the only  insurer that is still in all 100 counties in our State, announced that  they were raising rates by an average of nearly 19 percent going into  2017. Then they raised them again this year by over 14 percent. I  expect them to do the same next year, the year after that, and in  coming years after that.   It is clear to me that the individual mandate didn't actually lower  the cost of health insurance, and bailing out big insurance companies  certainly didn't help either.   Mr. Speaker, as you know very well, we need an off-ramp from  ObamaCare. We need a solution that allows for more competition, because  competition drives down prices and allows people to purchase health  insurance without going bankrupt.   While we continue to work toward getting a full repeal and replace on  the President's desk, I believe we should also pass a simple bill right  now that would provide millions of Americans a way to buy more  affordable health insurance   Short-term, limited-duration medical plans are designed to provide  coverage for a limited time when someone is between health insurance  policies--individuals who are between jobs, for example--but these  plans are also exempt from having to abide by ObamaCare's regulatory  regime.   The Obama administration was concerned with these plans becoming  attractive alternatives to ObamaCare. So before they left office in  2016, they issued a regulation that defined these short-term policies  as those that are less than 3 months long.   I believe strengthening these types of plans would be a huge step in  the right direction. That is why, last month, I introduced a simple  bill called the Improving Choices in Health Care Coverage Act.   This bill would do two simple things. It would allow people to stay  on these less expensive, short-term medical plans for as long as 364  days, and it would allow them to renew these plans for multiple years.   According to the American Action Forum, which looked at different  findings from the Congressional Budget Office, the Urban Institute, and  the Commonwealth Fund, there seems to be a consensus that these plans  would be attractive to consumers because of their low premiums, and,  thus, enrollment would likely be into the millions.   I hear from constituents every time I go back home that their monthly  premiums are way too high. Mr. Speaker, this bill is one way we can  relieve some of their financial stress. With looming announcements by  big insurance companies that they are again going to be increasing  premiums, the time to act is now.                            ____________________
