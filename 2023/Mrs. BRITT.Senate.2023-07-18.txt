 Mr. President, I wish to recognize and congratulate Jody  Singer on her retirement as the Director of the Marshall Space Flight  Center and to express my gratitude for her countless contributions to  our Nation and to the State of Alabama.   Singer, a native of Hartselle, AL, earned a bachelor's degree in  industrial engineering from the University of Alabama in 1983. She has  completed two NASA fellowships, one at Pennsylvania State University in  State College and another at the Simmons College Graduate School of  Management in Boston.   Singer began her trailblazing 38-year National Aeronautics and Space  Administration career in 1985 through the professional intern program  in the mission planning and development office. In 1986, she joined the  Space Shuttle Program Office, where she was an engineer in the Space  Shuttle Maine engine office. In this role, she was able to aid in  Return to Flight activities after the Challenger accident.   From 1990 to 2002, Singer served in various roles in the External  Tank project office. These roles included business manager, technical  assistant, and deputy manager. From 2002 to 2007, Singer served as the  first female project manager for the Reusable Solid Rocket Booster  Project, leading the team during the Columbia Return to Flight  activities. Additionally, Singer served as the deputy manager in the  Space Shuttle Propulsion Office from 2008 until the shuttle's  successful retirement in 2011.   From 2010 to 2012, she held deputy positions for three concurrent  major programs: the Space Shuttle, Ares, and the start-up of the Space  Launch System. As deputy for the Shuttle Propulsion Office, she guided  successful fly-out and retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 as the  deputy of the Ares Project Office.   From 2013 to 2016, Singer served as manager of the Flight Programs  and Partnerships Office at Marshall, where she held primary  responsibility for the center's work with human advanced exploration  projects, science flight mission programs, technology demonstration  missions, commercial crew, and International Space Station life support  systems, research facilities and payload operations. Singer also was  responsible for identifying opportunities to develop and maintain  partnerships with government agencies, academia, and international and  commercial partners to help achieve NASA's vision.   Additionally, Singer was integral to the startup of the Space Launch  System, SLS. As the deputy program manager of SLS at Marshall, she  helped  [[Page S2980]]  oversee nearly 3,000 civil servants and contractors involved in  developing and testing of the vehicle, the most powerful rocket ever  built. In November 2022, as Marshall's center director, Singer led the  team through the successful launch of SLS. The historic Artemis I  mission restored America's capability to send humans to the Moon, a  feat we have not undertaken since 1972.   Singer was appointed in September 2018 as the 14th Director of  Marshall Space Flight Center and first female Director. She manages one  of NASA's largest field installations, with nearly 7,000 on- and near- site civil service and contractor employees. Prior to being named to  the position, Singer served as Marshall's Acting Director starting in  July 2018 and was Deputy Director from February 2016 to July 2018,  assisting the Director with the daily management of the Center's  workforce and operations.   Her awards and commendations throughout her service to NASA are a  testament to her dedication to this Nation. She has received multiple  NASA Outstanding Leadership Medals and two Presidential Rank of  Meritorious Executive Awards, the highest honor for career Federal  employees. She received the Space Flight Awareness Leadership Award in  2005 for inspiring the Shuttle Propulsion Office to strive for  excellence and continuous improvement; and the NASA Exceptional Service  Medal in 1993 while managing the External Tank Project's business  office. For her unwavering commitment to excellence and achievement in  support of the human space program, she received the Silver Snoopy  Award from the NASA astronaut corps and was named a Space Flight  Awareness Launch Honoree.   Singer has also received numerous external awards and recognitions.  This includes the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement, Stellar  Award; Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame; Distinguished Fellow by the  University of Alabama College of Engineering; Federal Asian Pacific  American Council--FAPAC--Outstanding SES Leadership Award; Women in  Leadership, and Morgan County Hall of Fame; Gardner Award (2020); 2022  AIAA Associate Fellow and 2022 Engineer of the Year. Singer was named  in Alabama Magazine's ``Top 40 Over 40!'' and Business Alabama's ``20  Who Make Alabama Business Tick.'' She serves as a board member for  Leadership Alabama and is a member of the University of Alabama  President's Cabinet.   On behalf of the people of Alabama and our Nation, I offer Director  Singer my heartfelt thanks and a long and happy retirement with her  husband Chris, their three children, and five grandchildren. Her career  is defined by remarkable innovation and unwavering devotion to the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration. We owe her a debt of  gratitude for her exemplary service to her community, the Marshall  Space Flight Center, and her country.                            ____________________
