 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Frank Pallone for this  opportunity to bring the culmination of over 2 years of working on both  sides of the aisle to bring this bill to fruition.   It is unfortunate that we weren't able to negotiate more into this  bill and make it bipartisan, but there will be other opportunities, as  we are a two-Chamber legislature, and I am sure that the Senate has  some ideas about how to make this bill better, and we are all open to  that opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank Subcommittee Chairwoman  Schakowsky for doing an extraordinary job, making sure that we shepherd  this bill through the process and making sure that we keep open lines  of communication on both sides of the aisle so that we can get to this  point.   It is important for us to understand that this bill is about the  Federal Trade Commission's ability to protect consumers from fraudsters  and scammers. This means that right now scammers remain free to steal  money from hardworking Americans, seniors who are falling prey every  minute of the day to scams on the Internet, to veterans who people  knock on their door and appeal to them and rip them off and give them  nothing for their hard-earned money after defending our honor in the  military, to single moms who sign up to get a higher education so they  can provide for their children, and then end up empty-handed, with  nothing to show for their hard-earned money. Those are the people that  13(b), through the FTC, is going to go after and restore those funds.                                time  1700    For example, since 2016, they have restored over $11 billion to  American families from fraudsters and scammers. Yes, it is happening  every single day. And it is only getting worse. And today the United  States people stand naked with the ability to be able to defend  themselves.   The average American family cannot afford to hire a lawyer. What the  FTC does is they appeal to a Federal court and they say we have found a  bad actor. We are ready to take them to task. We are ready to restore  the American families that they are trying to destroy and get them  their money back. That is what 13(b) is.   We have a balance of power in this country. The FTC is part of the  administration. That is one balance of power. The United States Supreme  Court said through a technicality, well, 13(b) should not be made  available right now for the FTC to protect the American people.   And they pointed to Congress and said, well, as long as Congress will  pass the law then they can do their job and protect the American  people. That is what this bill is.   This bill is simply an opportunity to restore the faith of the  American people in our system that when they get ripped off, whether it  is in person, or on the internet or in whatever manner that some  scammer is taking advantage of our American people, the FTC is going to  be there to speak up for them, to defend them, and take that money back  and put it in the pockets of those individuals who have been ripped  off. That is what 13(b) is.   Today, I am very proud, as an American-born citizen, the son of  immigrants, to be a Member of Congress, to be able to do the work that  we are doing today to get this bill out of the House of  Representatives. I urge every Member of this House to please help  restore the faith of the American people in us and our system and make  sure that they understand that we speak for them, we hear them, and we  know how they feel when they get ripped off. And the FTC is going to be  there through 13(b) to restore the American people and give them the  money that was stolen from them.    Mr. Speaker, today is a very emotional day for me. I am  so proud to be a Member of the House of Representatives, equally proud  to be an American-born citizen, and equally proud to be raised by my  two immigrant parents, who always believed that in this country, the  United States of America, you can be the best that you can be, and you  can do the kinds of things that in many parts of the world a child of  parents with a first- and second-grade education doesn't have the  opportunity to do.   Today we passed a bill, with the support of our staff and colleagues  in the House of Representatives, to help protect consumers, to put  billions of dollars back in the pockets of individuals who have been  and unfortunately will be ripped off by bad actors across this country,  but they will be protected.   The faith of our government to work for our people is being restored  by restoring section 13(b) to the Federal Trade Commission.   Again, this is a very emotional day for me because my parents came to  this country, working in the fields, harvesting fruits and vegetables  to help Americans eat, and I get to be a Member of this House,  harvesting votes to help restore the confidence and faith of the  American people in our system.                            ____________________
