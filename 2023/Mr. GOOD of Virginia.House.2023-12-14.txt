 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Liberty  Christian Academy Bulldogs for their monumental victory in the VHSL 3A  State championship football game.   On December 9, the Lynchburg-based LCA Bulldogs defeated the  Lafayette Rams 28-14 to finish their season with a perfect 14-0 record  and earn their first VHSL State football title.   This was a history-making moment, coming 9 years after LCA filed an  antitrust complaint against the VHSL, seeking to permit themselves and  other private schools to join the league. The VHSL ultimately settled  and agreed to allow any private school to apply for membership,  providing a major victory for all student athletes in private schools  across the Commonwealth.   Now, just 8 years after they began competing in the predominantly  public school league, LCA reached the pinnacle with their State  championship.   The LCA Bulldogs and Coach Frank Rocco have made their school, the  Lynchburg community, and Virginia's Fifth District exceptionally proud.    I am honored to represent such a phenomenal group of student athletes  in Congress, and I congratulate them on this incredible achievement.                            ____________________
