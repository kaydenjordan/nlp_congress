 Madam Speaker, today the Durham report finally came out.  As suspected, the FBI and the DOJ acted vastly improperly with raw and  uncorroborated so-called evidence that they used to hound President  Trump for well over 2 years and try to influence the 2016 election as  well as make the administration untenable following that.   So who is going to go to jail for this?   It is hard to tell. It is pretty difficult to prosecute these sorts  of things when the insiders at the Department of Justice and FBI are  going to be trying to make sure it doesn't happen.   So what do we do to put, at least, the confidence of the American  people back into the upper echelons of the Department of Justice and  the FBI so that we don't have to think that they are going to be doing  this sort of thing to anybody they disagree with politically on top of  what we just saw?   Indeed, how do we regain trust?   It has been blown up in the name of influencing an election in 2016  and harming the Trump administration.                            ____________________
