 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rules and  the rules package.   In particular, I support the Women's Health Protection Act so women  seeking reproductive rights will not be hunted down by bounty hunters.   As well, I am opposed to this rule because of the creation of a  potential committee that, in fact, threatens our safety, security, and  freedom. It is an unprecedented attack on our Nation's law enforcement  agencies, our justice system, and our intelligence community, all for  the extreme MAGA Republican political activities.   This does nothing to solve the actual problems facing the American  people and even includes a possibility of defunding police.   Finally, I am glad that the last Congress indicated that when a  million Americans died, for continuity of government, we had proxy  voting. They wanted to save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the underlying rules and the rules package. I  ask my colleagues to join me in voting ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 5, Adopting the  Rules of the 118th Congress. Instead of building on the extraordinary  work done by House Democrats in the 117th Congress, Republicans are  choosing to lead off this term with legislation that attacks women's  health freedoms, make it easier for companies to pollute without  consequence, and hand out tax breaks to the wealthy and well connected.   This problematic Rules package is the product of non-transparent  negotiations, backroom deals and promises that were made to appease the  demands made by extremist members of the Republican Party to get them  to vote or in some cases vote present for Speaker of the House.   Last week's catastrophic Speaker's election showed Americans how  disorganized, chaotic, and inefficient the Republican leadership and  Caucus can be.   Last week's chaos showed the American people how Republicans plan to  govern for the next two years. This body will be ill managed, less  transparent, slow moving, and will put forth legislation that will  attack our freedoms and undermine our Nation's values.   Concessions made by Republican leadership last week will have  devastating effects on this institution. The passage of this Rules  package will pave the way for:   Any member to file a ``motion to vacate the chair,'' effectively  holding the Speaker hostage;   Extreme right-wing members on key committees;   Putting an end to the possibility of Congressional staff  unionization;   Reinstating the Holman Rules so Republicans can target civil servants  who challenge them; and   Shut down criminal investigations into the previous president.   This problematic rule is creating more turmoil in the Republican  ranks as members wrestle with the image of witnessing the Speaker being  coerced into agreeing to give a small faction of the Republican  Conference treats to appease them--including concessions to individual  members for votes he needed to become Speaker.  [[Page H69]]    It is not inconceivable that Republican members of the conference  must show they are not being bullied into voting for this Rules bill.   The most problematic aspect of the rule is that it does not spell out  what the Speaker agreed to give to his opponents so that the Congress  and the American people know what the Speakership actually cost them.   This is the People's House--not the Republican or Democratic House-- any bargaining should be focused on the needs of the American people-- they must come first.   Throughout the last election cycle, Republicans campaigned on  addressing inflation and lowering the cost of living for millions of  Americans.   Ironically, the first bill they are introducing repays the wealthy  donors that got them their majority through dark money contributions by  making it easier for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to cheat on  their taxes.   We all may have varying beliefs about taxes, but we as Americans know  that nothing in this life is free and that in order for our Nation to  be a beacon of freedom we must have a strong defense, public assistance  programs to help those in need, an education system that prepares young  minds to lead, retirement programs that provided for our elder and  disabled, and a healthcare system that cares for all in need of  healthcare.   Passage of the rule will pave the way for Republicans to continue  their assault on a woman's bodily autonomy and impede on medical  decisions that should remain between medical professionals and their  patient.   Although the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act does not  criminalize abortion nationwide, make no mistake, that is their end  goal, and the passage of this bill will get them one step closer to  their sick idea of stripping all women of their rights.   There are concerns that language in the House Rules package would  eliminate rules requiring spending offsets for bills that sell or  transfer federal public lands and waters.   This will result in a loss of public access enjoyed by the 70 million  American hunters and anglers that help support the $862 billion outdoor  recreation economy in the United States. Additionally, giving away  public assets with no return would be a loss for American taxpayers.   As a result, hunters and anglers are strongly opposed to this rule  change, which would eliminate the necessity of spending offsets to sell  or transfer public lands.   I urge all my colleagues to oppose this bill and see it for what it  truly is:   An effort by Republicans to give tax breaks to the ultra-rich and the  corporations who fund their campaigns, and   An effort to continue carrying out their distorted notion of America  by decimating the programs set in place to help the Americans who  depend on government assistance the most.

The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as  follows:        At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:       SEC.__. WOMEN'S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT.         Not later than January 12, 2023, the Speaker shall,       pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House       resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the State       of the Union for consideration of a bill consisting of the       text of H.R. 8296 of the One Hundred Seventeenth Congress, as       passed by the House on July 15, 2022, to protect a person's       ability to determine whether to continue or end a pregnancy,       and to protect a health care provider's ability to provide       abortion services. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not ceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader or       their respective designees. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. No amendment shall       be in order except: (1) those amendments to the bill received       for printing in the portion of the Congressional Record       designated for that purpose in clause 8 of rule XVIII dated       at least one day before the day of consideration of the       amendment; and (2) up to 20 pro forma amendments for the       purpose of debate, 10 of which may be offered by the Majority       Leader or a designee and 10 of which may be offered by the       Minority Leader or a designee. Each amendment so received may       be offered only by the Member who caused it to be printed or       a designee and shall be considered as read if printed. At the       conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, let me rename this legislation to the  billionaire tax cheats happy days are here again because that is simply  what this bill is about.  [[Page H92]]    I know my constituents are in one of the difficult districts in the  Nation, and I realize that small businesses in my district, those who  are getting earned income tax credit, they want refunds. They can't get  them if the phones are not being answered and there are not enough  staff to help them get the refunds that will help them propel their  small business into the next year.   Then, of course, Mr. Speaker, what about the lady who was trying to  close a real estate deal, and there was no one at the office? That  created a $68,000 tax burden because the tax office was not available  to assist.   We need to provide those workers to help Americans, not to create tax  cheats.   This legislation is deserving of opposition because we as Democrats  are trying to make the IRS work for working families, get their  refunds, get their dollars, help them propel into the next year, and be  better for the moneys that they deserve to get back.   Vote ``no'' on the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 23, the Family and  Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act. This bill would rescind $72  billion of the $79.6 billion appropriated to the Internal Revenue  Service to refine its services and technology and reform its  enforcement practices of the federal tax code. The passage of H.R. 23  would widen the already massive tax gap and unfairly relieve the  wealthiest 1% of Americans from paying their fair share of taxes.   The historic passage of the Inflation Reeducation Act under the  leadership of Speaker Pelosi and signed by President Biden authorized  $79.6 billion to allow the Internal Revenue Service to bolster taxpayer  services while firmly and fairly enforcing the federal tax code.   Through the implementation of the IRA, we continue to help the  millions of Americans who most depend on federal government assistance  and who contribute disproportionately to the federal revenues that pay  for our government to operate.   $45.6 billion of the authorized funds included in the Inflation  Reduction Act were allocated for tax enforcement activities, including  hiring more enforcement agents, providing legal support, and investing  in investigating technologies.   These funds are necessary to bridge the unjust tax gap that Americans  have been subject to for generations and will continue to endure under  Republican leadership.   The entirety of the $79.6 billion is critical to cracking down on  ultra-rich and corporate tax evaders who have avoided paying their fair  share of taxes for years.   The passage of this bill would dismantle key components of the  Inflation Reduction Act that have injected fairness into the  enforcement of our tax system.   The IRA reduced rising costs for hardworking middle-class and working  class families and ensured that taxpayers are not left to foot the bill  for ealthy tax cheats--both of which would be erased with the passage  of this bill.   These unfair tax practices have gone on for far too long.   I urge all my colleagues to oppose this bill and see it for what it  truly is:   an effort by Republicans to give tax breaks to the ultra-rich and the  corporations who fund their campaigns, and   an effort to continue carrying out their distorted notion of America  by decimating the programs set in place to help the Americans who  depend on government assistance the most.

Simply put, Americans who have the least should not be burdened with  the responsibility to contribute the most. Every American--most  importantly, the wealthiest among us--must pay what they rightfully owe  to enable our government to function.   $45.6 billion of the authorized funds included in the Inflation  Reduction Act were allocated for tax enforcement activities, including  hiring more enforcement agents, providing legal support, and investing  in investigating technologies.

Mr. Speaker, it has been 38 years, and I rise with  enthusiasm on reintroducing H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and  Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act.   I am pleased to reintroduce this legislation and to acknowledge to my  friends and colleagues that it was first introduced in 1989 after the  implementation of the American Civil Liberties Act that provided  compensation to Japanese Americans.   H.R. 40 does not focus on all of that only. It focuses on the study  of slavery and the understanding of what would be the next steps to end  the vast disparities in the African-American community even today in  2023. And so this introduction allows for a study, an analysis, and  action.   I am pleased with the more than 350 organizations, CEOs, scholars,  State and local officials, and Members of Congress who have been  supportive in understanding the era of slavery in this country.   The 13th amendment may have ended slavery, but the disparities exist.   Let us pass H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation  Proposals for African Americans Act.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to re-introduce H.R. 40, the Commission to  Study and Develop Reparations Proposals for African Americans Act. This  legislation was first introduced by retired Member of Congress John  Conyers of Michigan in 1989 and was intended to examine the institution  of slavery in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to the  present, and further recommend appropriate remedies.   Since the initial introduction of this legislation, its proponents  have made substantial progress in elevating the discussion of  reparations and reparatory justice at the national level and joining  the mainstream international debate on the issues. Though some have  tried to deflect the importance of these conversations by focusing on  individual monetary compensation, the real issue is whether and how  this nation can come to grips with the legacy of slavery that still  infects current society. Through legislation, resolutions, news, and  litigation, we are moving closer to making more strides in the movement  toward reparations.   Today there are more people at the table--more activists, more  scholars, more CEOs, more state and local officials, and more Members  of Congress. However, despite this progress and the election of the  first American President of African descent, the legacy of slavery  lingers heavily in this nation. While we have focused on the societal  effects of slavery and segregation, its continuing economic  implications remain largely ignored by mainstream analysis. These  economic issues are the root cause of many critical issues in the  African American community today, such as education, healthcare and  criminal justice policy, including policing practices. The call for  reparations represents a commitment to entering a constructive dialogue  on the role of slavery and racism in shaping present-day conditions in  our community and American society.   Over the last several years, we have had a distinguished academic and  activist panel from the National African American Reparations  Commission dive into some of the most salient points in the discussion  of reparations. I am supporting this effort by continuing to hold the  annual reparations retrospective at the Annual Legislative Conference  of the Congressional Black Caucus.   I believe that H.R. 40 is a crucial piece of legislation because it  goes beyond exploring the economic implications of slavery and  segregation. It is a holistic bill in the sense that it seeks to  establish a commission to also examine the moral and social  implications of slavery. In short, the Commission aims to study the  impact of slavery and continuing discrimination against African  Americans, resulting directly and indirectly from slavery to  segregation to the desegregation process and the present day. The  commission would also make recommendations concerning any form of  apology and compensation to begin the long-delayed process of atonement  for slavery.   With the over criminalization and policing of black bodies, a  reoccurring issue in African American communities, I believe this  conversation is both relevant and crucial to restoring trust in  governmental institutions in many communities. As in years past, I  welcome open and constructive discourse on H.R. 40 and the creation of  this commission in the 118th Congress. Though the times and  circumstance may change, the principal problem of slavery continues to  weigh heavily on this country. A federal commission can help us reach  into this dark past and bring us into a brighter future.                            ____________________
