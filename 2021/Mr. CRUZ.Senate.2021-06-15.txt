 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to recognize the 156th  anniversary of Juneteenth. On Saturday, we mark 156 years since June  19, 1865, when MG Gordon Granger announced in Galveston, TX, that the  Civil War was over and that enslaved people were now free.   In his announcement, General Granger said:         The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a       proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all       slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of       personal rights and rights of property.    In commemoration of this momentous day, June 19 became known as  Juneteenth. In the years following the Civil War and in the early 20th  century, Juneteenth has been celebrated as a holiday of independence.   While Juneteenth has been celebrated in States across the country, it  carries a special significance in Texas, where Juneteenth celebrations  began. In 1872, four men in Houston, my hometown, purchased the land  for Emancipation Park, the oldest park in Texas, as the site for  Juneteenth celebrations. In 1980, the State of Texas became the first  State to make Juneteenth a State holiday. Today, 47 States recognize  Juneteenth.   I am proud to cosponsor the Senate resolution designating June 19,  2021, as Juneteenth Independence Day to honor the historical  significance this day has in the United States.   Juneteenth is an important day. It is a somber reminder of the  original sin of slavery that our Nation inherited from colonial powers.  Still, it is also a celebration of the fact that our country strives  each and every day to make good on its promise to protect the  inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for  all men and all women, who are created equal. Our country was founded  on that revolutionary idea, that revolutionary belief that all men are  created equal, and that means no matter where we come from or what we  started with, any one of us can live freely and achieve great things.   The story of America and the story of Juneteenth is a story of  freedom, and while we have had many troubled chapters along the way, I,  for one, agree with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that the arc of  history is long and that it bends towards justice, and we have made  significant progress on that arc.   On Saturday, as we commemorate the long-overdue announcement of  emancipation made in Texas 156 years ago, let us together remember the  God-given freedoms we all cherish as Americans.                            ____________________     Madam President, on Sunday, June 20, Joe Biden will have  been President for exactly 5 months. In these 5 months, we have seen  crisis after crisis after crisis. We have experienced a gas crisis,  where we had gas lines and skyrocketing energy prices. We are on the  verge of an inflation crisis, where everywhere we look, prices are  rising on food, on housing, and on lumber. We have already had a war in  the Middle East, and we have a border crisis that has been raging so  intensely that we are on pace to see 2 million illegal immigrants come  through our unsecured border this year.   Just last month, 180,034 illegal immigrants crossed the border. To  put that in perspective, that number is a 674-percent increase over the  number of illegal immigrants that crossed the border last May--a 674- percent increase--and that number is a 21-year high. The reason for  this is simple: The crisis that has unfolded is the direct result of  political decisions made by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   No. 1, the first week in office, President Biden immediately halted  construction of the border wall.   No. 2, that same week, President Biden reinstated the failed catch  and release policy.   No. 3, most inexplicably, the Biden administration ended the ``Remain  in Mexico'' international agreement, a historic agreement negotiated by  President Trump with the Government of Mexico whereby the Government of  Mexico agreed that those who crossed illegally into Mexico would remain  in Mexico while their asylum proceedings were pending in the United  States.   That agreement was a tremendous success. It produced last year the  lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years. Let me repeat that.  Just 6 months ago, our country had achieved the lowest rate of illegal  immigration in 45 years. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris come into office,  they rip to pieces the international agreement that produced that  success, and today we have the highest rate of illegal immigration in  20 years.   Meanwhile, as the crisis rages, Joe Biden is nowhere to be found, and  Kamala Harris is nowhere to be found. In 5 months in office, Joe Biden  couldn't be bothered to go down to the border and see the humanitarian  disaster his policies have created. Kamala Harris, who was designated  ``in charge of the border,'' seems determined to go anywhere she can  but the border.   In the 84 days since she has been tasked with handling the border  crisis, do you know how many press conferences she has given? Not even  one--not a single press conference in 84 days.   She can't be honest about what is causing the crisis so she hides  from questions. The one time she sought questions was with NBC's Lester  Holt, where he asked her about going to the border. She responded with  that now characteristic and, quite honestly, creepy laugh, where she  said: ``We've been to the border.'' I am not sure who the royal ``we''  was, but that ``we'' doesn't include Joe Biden, who hasn't been to the  border as President. That ``we'' doesn't include Kamala Harris, who  hasn't been to the border as Vice President.   And Lester Holt--to NBC's credit, Lester Holt actually asked a  followup question, and it was a very simple question: ``You haven't  been to the border?'' To which she responded, oddly: ``Well, I haven't  been to Europe either.''   (Mr. VAN HOLLEN assumed the Chair.)   Mr. President, we are not facing a humanitarian crisis, a border  crisis, a public crisis, a national security crisis in Europe. We are  facing it at our southern border. We are facing it in my home State of  Texas. And the Vice President, it seems, cannot be bothered to go and  see firsthand the failures that President Biden's policies are causing.   I also want to touch on one issue that greatly affects border  communities, and that is our land ports of entry.   While Joe Biden has repeatedly encouraged this crisis of illegal  immigration, he is at the same time preventing lawful border crossing.   Border communities are suffering immensely right now because  important land ports of entry in El Paso, in Del Rio, in Eagle Pass, in  Laredo, in Rio Grande City, in McAllen, in Pharr, in Brownsville remain  closed to everyone except those deemed ``essential'' traffic.   Basically, Mexicans who have a visa to enter the United States  legally cannot do so through these land ports of entry unless they are  going to school, working, or somehow considered essential. Nonessential  travel from the United States--into the United States from Mexico for  shopping, for visiting family and friends, for casual visits are not  allowed by the Biden administration.   Instead, the Biden administration has decided to keep our land ports  of entries closed for nonessential travel until at least June 21,  ostensibly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This  [[Page S4532]]  decision makes no sense, when Americans have access now to effective  vaccines and the Biden administration is just fine with allowing  hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens to stream across the border and  be released in our communities.   Despite testing positive at a COVID positivity rate of 10 percent,  the Biden administration has no problem with that, and they perpetuate  the policies that continue that disaster. And yet, at the same time,  they shut down trade and legal tourism through our land ports of entry.   For a long time, I have summed up my immigration views very simply in  four words: ``legal, good; illegal, bad.'' I think the overwhelming  majority of Americans agree with that proposition. And yet, as we look  at the first 5 months of the Biden-Harris administration, it seems for  President Biden and Vice President Harris, their immigration policy is  legal, bad; illegal, good. That makes no sense. It is exactly backward.   We should open up our land ports of entry to legal tourism, which  would greatly benefit the border communities, especially in my home  State of Texas.   And we need to end this heartless, inhumane policy that is resulting  in tens of thousands of children being trafficked in by human  traffickers, which is resulting in thousands of children being  physically abused and sexually abused, being thrown into the Biden  cages, packed in larger and larger numbers.   Ignoring this problem won't go away. Behaving like an ostrich, Joe  Biden and Kamala Harris cannot plunge their heads into the sand and  hope the disaster at the border will magically disappear. They don't  want to go to the border because they know the TV cameras will follow  them to the border, and their only hope is people don't notice the  lives that are being destroyed, the crime that is coming in, the  vandalism that is coming in, the public health threat that we are  seeing.   This is not compassionate. It is not humane. This chaos is wrong, and  it is time to end.   I yield the floor.
