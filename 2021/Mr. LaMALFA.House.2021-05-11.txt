 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week to  recognize the law enforcement officers serving on the front lines.  Without them our streets would erupt into chaos, and the law and order  our society relies on would crumble. We have seen this happen already  too much in this country.   Our law enforcement officers have already incredibly difficult and  dangerous jobs. That is why recent attacks on law enforcement by  extreme elements wanting to upend our society deeply sadden millions of  Americans, myself included, who support the police. Instead of  providing the resources to assist our police, these radicals want to  defund our police departments altogether.   This is insanity. We should ask ourselves how we can help police do  their jobs more safely and effectively, not vilify them.   I am proud to back the blue. The majority of Americans who recognize  their security and well-being depend upon the police to back the blue  too.   All our law enforcement officers who serve us so faithfully should  know that they have our sincere thanks and appreciation, not only  during Police Appreciation Week, but always.                            ____________________
