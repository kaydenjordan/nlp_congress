 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1076) to require the Comptroller General of the United  States to carry out a study on the trafficking into the United States  of synthetic drugs, and related illicit finance, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1076         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing the Financing of       Illegal Synthetic Drugs Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) According to the Center for Disease Control and       Prevention, over 107,000 people in the United States died       from drug overdoses or drug poisonings in the 12-month period       ending January 2022, with 67 percent of those deaths       involving synthetic opioids like fentanyl.        (2) According to the United National Office of Drugs and       Crime (UNODC) in its ``Synthetic Drug Strategy 2021-2025'',       the number of synthetic drugs, also called New Psychoactive       Substances, has increased 631 percent since 2009, with       traffickers introducing an average of 80 new substances to       the illicit drug market each year from 2009-2019.        (3) In October 2022, F. Michael McDaniel, director of the       Houston High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HITDA) program       testified in Congress that one kilogram of fentanyl can       produce one million counterfeit pills containing one       milligram of fentanyl, saying, ``Currently in Houston, Texas,       you can buy a kilogram of fentanyl for an average price of       $25,000 to $30,000. This same kilogram of fentanyl in       Culiacan (Mexico) could be purchased at an average price of       $13,500. Currently, the price of a fentanyl pill in Houston       ranges from $6 to $65. Therefore, an illicit investment of       $30,000 or less could result in a return of $6 to $32.5       million.''.        (4) According to Celina B. Realuyo, Adjunct Professor, The       George Washington University Elliott School of International       Affairs, in March 2022 Congressional testimony, ``Financing       is essential to support and sustain the command and control,       personnel, arms, communications, logistics and operations of       organized crime groups. For this reason, following the money       trail and depriving criminals of illicit financial flows can       disrupt and disable these networks.''.       SEC. 3. GAO STUDY ON SYNTHETIC DRUGS TRAFFICKING.         (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States       shall carry out a study on illicit financing in connection       with the trafficking of synthetic drugs, including fentanyl       and methamphetamine, fentanyl- and methamphetamine-related       substances, Captagon, and fentanyl and methamphetamine       precursors, including--        (1) the business of the trafficking of synthetic drugs and       related illicit finance, such as the participation of       transnational criminal organizations and terror syndicates       and their notable trafficking corridors, including source and       transit countries;        (2) the business models used by these transnational       criminal organizations, including U.S. domestic and foreign       activities for precursor purchase or production, movement       along the supply chain, manufacture of the completed product,       marketing, distribution, sales, and return of proceeds;        (3) the overlap of the business model of human trafficking       and the trafficking of synthetic drugs and related illicit       finance;        (4) the use of online illicit drug markets and the use of       social media for the marketing, sale, and payment for       synthetic drugs;        (5) financial methods used by such transnational criminal       organizations, including--        (A) payment;        (B) money laundering; and        (C) repatriation of proceeds;        (6) the use of social media applications like Snap Chat,       Discord, and Facebook and payment applications like CashApp       to facilitate financial transactions for synthetic drug       trafficking, especially among young people; and        (7) U.S. Government activities to combat illicit finance       related to the trafficking of synthetic drugs, including--        (A) interagency collaboration, including personnel detailed       to other agencies to support the effort to combat synthetic       drugs trafficking and related illicit finance;        (B) intergovernmental collaboration;        (C) intersectoral collaboration with the private sector,       including the business and non-governmental communities; and        (D) identified gaps or resource deficiencies in combating       the trafficking of synthetic drugs and related illicit       finance in the coordination and collaboration activities       described in subparagraphs (A) through (C).        (b) Report Required.--Not later than the end of the 1-year       period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the       Comptroller General shall issue a report to the Congress       containing all findings and determinations made in carrying       out the study required under subsection (a).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1076, the Preventing the  Financing of Illegal Synthetic Drugs Act.   As we are all painfully aware, fentanyl is a poison that is  afflicting every community across America. This poison is a synthetic  opioid 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than  morphine. Just 2 milligrams, equal to 10 to 15 grains of table salt, is  enough to be lethal.   That is why I am grateful that Members like Congresswoman De La Cruz  have hit the ground running on commonsense legislation like H.R. 1076  to sever the lifeblood that keeps the fentanyl business model going,  which is its financing.   As we heard in the Financial Services Committee hearing titled,  ``Follow the Money,'' ``Financing is essential to support and sustain  the command and control, personnel, arms, communications, logistics,  and operations of organized crime groups. For this reason, following  the money trail and depriving criminals of illicit financial flows can  disrupt and disable these networks.''   I recognize there are many challenges to attacking the fentanyl  crisis, including our unsecured border, but from a Financial Services  Committee perspective, we can only address what  [[Page H2470]]  is in our jurisdiction, and that is its financing.   Congresswoman De La Cruz's study will help inform Congress on the  next best step to disrupt and dismantle synthetic drug trafficking and  its financing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. De La Cruz), the sponsor of this bill,  a new and dynamic member of our committee.   Ms. De La CRUZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for  yielding and for his broader leadership of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International  Financial Institutions.   Mr. Speaker, according to the CDC, over 107,000 Americans died from  drug overdoses or drug poisonings in the 12-month period ending January  2022. Sixty-seven percent of those deaths involved synthetic opioids  like fentanyl, which is up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 100  times stronger than morphine.   Last year, Hidalgo County, which sits in my district, made news with  massive fentanyl seizures at the U.S.-Mexico border. These include $1.5  million in January 2022 and $330,000 in June. These numbers are  staggering. According to law enforcement, an illicit investment of  $30,000 or less could yield $6 to $32 million.   To end this crisis, we must tackle the financing. As the adage goes,  ``Follow the money.'' This money fuels the operations of the cartels  that are poisoning our families.   My bill, the Preventing the Financing of Illegal Synthetic Drugs Act,  will help law enforcement pinpoint the business model of the  traffickers, how they move and hide their profits, and what the U.S.  can do to stop fentanyl money laundering.   To end this carnage that is taking so many lives in south Texas and  all across America, we must track down the funds that fuel it.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I think the bill's sponsor, Ms. De La  Cruz, and cosponsor Mrs. Beatty, have both articulated very well the  need for this bill. It is a good idea.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues' support for the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  [[Page H2471]]     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1156) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to  conduct a study and report on the exposure of the United States to the  financial sector of the People's Republic of China, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1156         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``China Financial Threat       Mitigation Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. CHINA FINANCIAL THREAT MITIGATION.         (a) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in       consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of       the Federal Reserve System, the Chairman of the Securities       and Exchange Commission, the Chairman of the Commodity       Futures Trading Commission, and the Secretary of State, shall       conduct a study and issue a report on the exposure of the       United States to the financial sector of the People's       Republic of China that includes--        (1) an assessment of the effects of reforms to the       financial sector of the People's Republic of China on the       United States and global financial systems;        (2) a description of the policies the United States       Government is adopting to protect the interests of the United       States while the financial sector of the People's Republic of       China undergoes such reforms;        (3) a description and analysis of any risks to the       financial stability of the United States and the global       economy emanating from the People's Republic of China; and        (4) recommendations for additional actions the United       States Government, including United States representatives at       relevant international organizations, should take to       strengthen international cooperation to monitor and mitigate       such financial stability risks and protect United States       interests.        (b) Transmission of Report.--The Secretary of the Treasury       shall transmit the report required under subsection (a) not       later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act       to the Committees on Financial Services and Foreign Affairs       of the House of Representatives, the Committees on Banking,       Housing, and Urban Affairs and Foreign Relations of the       Senate, and to the United States representatives at relevant       international organizations, as appropriate.        (c) Classification of Report.--The report required under       subsection (a) shall be unclassified, but may contain a       classified annex.        (d) Publication of Report.--The Secretary of the Treasury       shall publish the report required under subsection (a) (other       than any classified annex) on the website of the Department       of the Treasury not later than one year after the date of       enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1156, the China Financial  Threat Mitigation Act. This is a measure that originated in the  Committee on Financial Services, where it was first introduced by our  former colleague, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio. I am pleased to see his  cosponsor, Ms. Spanberger, continue to champion the measure in this  Congress.   The China Financial Threat Mitigation Act is based on the notion that  China's financial system is so opaque that it may hide risks for the  global economy of which we aren't aware. The bill requires the Treasury  Secretary to study and report on these risks so we can take effective  countermeasures.   As we all know, China has been cracking down on Western firms and  executives due to fears that the private sector's information gathering  and due diligence efforts pose a threat to the Chinese Communist Party.  The CCP clearly views transparency as inconsistent with its self- interest. This should alarm us all.   Due to the state-owned nature of many Chinese financial institutions,  there are already fewer market signals that can alert us to problems in  time, and the central government may be on the hook for liabilities of  unknown scope.   The Financial Stability Oversight Council has touched on the  possibility of risks in the country, including those arising from  China's housing sector, but these have been broad-brush efforts. We  need to dig deeper, and that is what the reporting in this legislation  will require.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), our baseball coach who has  distinguished himself not only here in Congress but also on the  baseball field.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank the sponsors of the bill, Mr. Williams, Mrs. Beatty, and Ms.  Spanberger for their hard work on this good piece of legislation. I  think it is something that is very important. They have already  expressed the need for it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
