 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Hawaii  County Police Officer Bronson Kaliloa, who died yesterday after being  fatally shot Tuesday night during a traffic stop in Mountain View.   Bronson was just 46 years old, a father of three, a graduate of  Waimea High School on Kauai, a 10-year veteran of the police force and  a public servant recognized by his community, fellow officers, and  family and friends as one-of-a-kind because of his dedication to  service, his kindness, and heart of aloha.   He was part of the Puna Patrol Division, who, over the last few  months, have been working around the clock to support their community  in crisis, due to the ongoing volcanic activity and lava flow, helping  residents who have been displaced from their homes, businesses, and  farms.   We mourn with the community of Puna, the Hawaii Police Department,  and Bron's ohana he left behind: Casey, Samson, Grace, and Nathan. We  can never forget the sacrifices our law enforcement officers and their  families make every single day to serve and protect.                            ____________________
