 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last night President Trump tried to  convince Congress and the American people that there is a crisis at our  southern border. It was little more than a rehash of spurious arguments  and misleading statistics the President has been using for weeks.  President Trump once again tried to claim there was a crisis at the  border. The fact is, migrant border crossings have been declining for  nearly two decades.   The President inveighed against drugs pouring over the border, but  the vast majority of heroin enters the United States through legal  ports of entry in trucks and on airplanes.   The President and his allies have been claiming that nearly 4,000  known or suspected terrorists have been stopped from entering the  United States. They say that is a reason for the border wall. But  nearly every single one of those apprehensions occurred in airports,  not on our southern border.   In a recent report, Donald Trump's State Department concluded that  there is no credible evidence that terrorist groups were trying to  enter the United States through the southern border. In a report on the  President's strategy to combat terrorist travel, sent to Congress by  President Trump on December 21--the day the shutdown began--the  National Security Council, appointed by President Trump, did not even  mention a wall or a barrier to stop terrorists from entering the  country.   The President continues to fearmonger, and he makes up the facts.  This is a Presidency that is in crisis. It has so many problems, and it  is the old trick--fearmonger, distort, try to scare people, and maybe  they will not pay attention to the real problems in this  administration.   In no way, however--the President is not getting his way. His  fearmongering just isn't working. In no way did the President's speech  last night make a persuasive or even a new case for an exorbitantly  expensive border wall--a wall that the President guaranteed would be  paid by Mexico. He said: I ran on this. Yes, he ran on it, saying  Mexico would pay for it. At his rallies, he chanted: Who will pay for  the wall? The people screamed back: Mexico.   The President's speech did nothing--nothing--to convince us here in  Congress, and I believe it did nothing--nothing--to convince a  skeptical public that this government shutdown is anything but a  manufactured crisis of the President's own making. The President's  speech, if anything, moved the American people even further away from  his view that he should keep the government shut down until he gets his  way. Reports say that the President didn't want to give this speech.  Well, he was right. I don't think it helped his cause, and he probably  hurt himself.   It is time for the President and our Republican colleagues to stop  this fearmongering and to stop this diversion away from the problems  that the President really has and end the shutdown. The shutdown is  hurting millions of Americans, and it is going to get worse, all  because of President Trump's temper tantrum. We should not--we should  not--treat hundreds of thousands of Americans--millions of Americans-- as leverage to try and get something by pounding the table. That is not  how our government works.   What is happening? Hundreds of thousands of Federal workers--innocent  Federal workers who do their jobs, who work hard, and sometimes they  get up on Monday morning with a 100-  [[Page S79]]  degree fever, but they go to work because they know their job is  important--have been furloughed because of what Trump has done. Four  hundred thousand continue to work without pay. TSA agents, food safety  inspectors, border agents--those hard-working, dedicated public  servants--are about to miss a paycheck.   Last night, many of my colleagues--including Senators Warner, Kaine,  King, Cardin, Casey, Van Hollen, and others--held the floor to give  voice to these Federal employees who live and work in their States,  many of whom are living paycheck to paycheck.   President Trump's government shutdown--his choosing, he is the only  one who did it--is forcing a personal crisis on those public servants  and their families. How unfair, how mean-spirited, and how wrong.   These families are owed a paycheck, but they are left to wonder how  they are going to pay the mortgage or the rent and all of their other  bills. They are wondering what will happen to the good credit they have  worked so hard to maintain over the years. They are innocent victims of  the Trump shutdown--a shutdown he said 25 times he would cause, a  shutdown he said he would be proud to own.   President Trump, are you proud to own a shutdown that is hurting so  many innocent people? Did you realize that when you caused this?   As government agencies remain shut down, American farmers and small  businesses can't get the loans they desperately need. Tourism suffers  as our national parks go neglected. Some families can't get a mortgage  to buy a new home. The American people are suffering needlessly-- needlessly--because President Trump selfishly refuses to retreat from  an intransigent, indefensible, and increasingly unpopular position.   The Democratic House has passed legislation that received support  from many of my Republican colleagues to reopen the government. In no  way does that legislation preclude us from having a debate and hashing  out compromise solutions on border security. We have done that before.   We can continue to debate because, indeed, Democrats, Republicans,  and the President all want stronger border security; we just sharply  disagree about the best way of achieving it.   Why not open the government while we continue to hash out our  differences? I have asked that of President Trump. I said: Give me one  good reason why the shutdown should continue as we debate our  differences on border security, which we all want. He could not give a  single reason. We know the reason: He is leveraging--mercilessly  leveraging--millions of Americans who are caught in his irresponsible  action and who are hurt by it.   Let us open the government and continue to hash out our differences.  That would be the responsible thing to do, and I believe Republican  Senators, many of them, know that.   I urge my friend Leader McConnell to act now, convince the President  to accept legislation to reopen the government, and let's pass it here  on the floor of the Senate. The vast majority of the Republican caucus  has already supported it. What are we waiting for?                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, this morning it was  reported that Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein intends to step down  from his post at the Justice Department if the nominee for Attorney  General, William Barr, is confirmed. It is a timely reminder of the  swirling conflicts of interest and bias that surround nearly every  Trump nominee to lead the Justice Department.   Acting Attorney General Whitaker publicly and forcefully advocated  for defunding and imposing severe limits on the special counsel's  investigation, calling it ``a mere witch hunt.'' He has troubling  conflicts of interest, including with a grand jury witness in the  investigation, not to mention the fact that he appears to have been  involved in fraudulent business dealings before joining the Justice  Department.   The nominee to take his place, William Barr, is just as fatally  conflicted a nominee when it comes to the special counsel. Last month,  we learned that Mr. Barr sent the Justice Department an unsolicited  memo, criticizing the special counsel's investigation.   Mr. Rosenstein's potential departure only heightens the stakes for  Mr. Barr's nomination. From all accounts, Mr. Rosenstein has been an  impartial actor at the head of the special counsel's investigation.  President Trump is trying to replace folks like Mr. Rosenstein with  conflicted loyalists like Matthew Whitaker and William Barr. The  Senate, starting with the Judiciary Committee, should subject Mr.  Barr's views to the strictest of scrutiny next week. I still believe,  after the revelations about Mr. Barr's unsolicited memo, President  Trump ought to withdraw this nomination.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
