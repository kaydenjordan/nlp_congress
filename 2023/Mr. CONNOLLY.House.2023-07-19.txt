 Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose this amendment, which would  risk flight safety and increase delays at National Airport, in the  strongest terms possible. I will not, cannot support this bill if this  amendment is adopted.   This amendment violates every Congressional courtesy we try to extend  to one another as colleagues who know our districts best. One of my  first local government appointments was to the Fairfax County Airports  Advisory Committee. I subsequently spent 14 years in local government  helping maintain the delicate regional balance between the 2 major  airports in Northern Virginia, National Airport and Dulles  International Airport. I also led the effort to connect our nation's  capital to Dulles via rail with the recently completed Silver Line  extension of the DC Metro.   So let me introduce my colleagues to National Airport. It has the  busiest runway in America. The busiest in America. The airport is  designed to serve 15 million passengers annually. Last year, it served  24 million. That is 9 million passengers or 60 percent over capacity.  The airport has the 3rd highest flight cancellation rate in the  country, and 1 in every 5 flights is delayed by more than an hour.   The FAA has certified that more flights would make those delays  worse. This amendment, which would force even more flights out of  National Airport, is reckless.   The amendment, if adopted, would increase delays, exacerbate pilot  and flight crew exhaustion, and risk the safety of flights in and out  of National Airport.   I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.
