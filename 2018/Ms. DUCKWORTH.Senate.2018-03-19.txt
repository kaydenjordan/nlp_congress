 Mr. President, thank you. I thank the chairman and my  colleagues from Wisconsin for their support of this bipartisan  legislation, which I introduced in January and filed as an amendment to  S. 2155. As the chairman stated, as a result of the 2016 regulation,  many of the FHLB system's captive insurance members have had or will  soon have their membership terminated. Our legislation seeks to ensure  that captive insurer affiliates of institutions that are active  providers of private capital in the mortgage market are eligible to  restore or continue their membership.   Their membership is crucial to reliable access to low-cost funding  for home mortgages and affordable housing initiatives in Illinois. For  the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, these members serve as an  important source of private capital in the mortgage market. Their  membership broadens access  [[Page S1786]]  to credit to financial institutions that would otherwise not be able to  access credit through their local markets and creates a reliable source  of liquidity for affordable housing initiatives.   Our bipartisan bill only seeks to redress those captives that were  previously granted FHLB membership prior to February 19, 2016. By  allowing captive insurers to continue to invest in mortgages and  mortgage-related securities through the FHLB system, they can continue  to provide both credit and liquidity to the market. Such sources of  private capital are critical to the long-term financing of the FHLB  system, and therefore, eligibility in the system should be preserved.  Our legislation will achieve this purpose. I wish to turn to my friend  from Wisconsin, Senator Johnson.
