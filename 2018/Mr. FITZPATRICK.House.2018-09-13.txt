 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak of a solemn  topic, one of utmost importance for sure, and I want to thank my  colleague and my friend, Kyrsten Sinema from Arizona, and for all the  work that she is doing for the veterans' community and for hosting this  Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's veterans are our finest citizens, to whom  we owe the most. Their sacrifice in defense of freedom allows us to  stand here today in this chamber, a testament to our values and a  symbol of hope.   All too often, we see our Nation's veterans struggle upon their  return home. Issues with depression, substance abuse, and post- traumatic stress disorder serve as constant reminders of the price they  paid to protect our way of life.                                time  1630    Tragically, we have seen a rising percentage of these heroes  resorting to taking their own lives. This is beyond unacceptable and  statistics paint a grim picture of this epidemic.   Between 2005 and 2015, Mr. Speaker, suicide rates for all veterans  increased by 25 percent--25 percent between 2005 and 2015.  Additionally, veterans account for nearly 15 percent of suicides in  U.S. adults.   Mr. Speaker, we can do better, and we must do better. I am proud to  stand here today with my colleagues in solidarity against veteran  suicide. I am thankful for the establishment of the third Veterans  Crisis Line call center to provide guidance, support, and critical  resources to those in need. While steps are being taken to prevent  veteran suicide, we still have a long way to go because one hero's  death is one too many.   As Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema had pointed out, Mr. Speaker,  September is National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, but this  issue will continue to transcend any time frame. For those who  sacrificed for us, we owe them and will continue to fight to eradicate  this public health crisis of veteran suicide.   Mr. Speaker, I want to, once again, thank Congresswoman Sinema for  hosting this Special Order.
