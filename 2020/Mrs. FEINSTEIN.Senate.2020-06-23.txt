 Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the  nomination of Cory Wilson to a Mississippi seat on the Fifth Circuit.  Judge Wilson has a troubling record on a number of critically important  issues. That record makes clear Judge Wilson is far outside of the  judicial mainstream. I believe that record is and should be  disqualifying.   First, Judge Wilson has a long record of working to undermine voting  rights. He has been a longtime proponent of voter ID laws--which  disproportionately harm communities of color, students, voters with  disabilities, and the elderly--and has made false claims about the  prevalence of voter fraud.   He has likewise expressed opposition to enforcement of the Voting  Rights Act and has made unsubstantiated claims that voter suppression  is nonexistent. As I have noted before, Judge Wilson's troubling record  on voting  [[Page S3155]]  rights is highly relevant to his nomination. The Fifth Circuit is a  majority-minority circuit; 55 percent of those who live in the circuit  are people of color. The Senate should not confirm a nominee who would  work to further restrict the right to vote from the bench.   Second, Judge Wilson has been a staunch opponent of the Affordable  Care Act. He referred to the ACA's passage as ``perverse'' and  ``illegitimate.'' He called upon the Supreme Court to strike down the  law, writing: ``For the sake of the Constitution, I hope the Court  strikes down the law and reinvigorates some semblance of the limited  government the Founders intended.''   As of June 22, more than 120,000 Americans have died from COVID-19,  and nearly 2.3 million have been infected. Now is not the time to  advance a judicial nominee whose opposition to the ACA would strip tens  of millions of Americans of healthcare, including those with  preexisting conditions.   Third, Judge Wilson has made extreme partisan comments that call into  question his ability to rule fairly and impartially. In op-eds in a  Mississippi newspaper, he likened President Obama to ``a fit-throwing  teenager'' and called him ``King Barack'' and ``President Make- Believe.'' In tweets that he has kept public even while serving as a  State court judge, Judge Wilson called Hillary Clinton ``Crooked  Clinton'' and said she was ``criminal and clueless.'' He also called  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a ``claptrap.'' The Senate  should not confirm a nominee who cannot be trusted to put aside extreme  partisanship to rule in an unbiased and impartial manner.   Fourth, Judge Wilson has sought to undermine the rights of LGBT  Americans. In 2016, while serving in the Mississippi legislature, Judge  Wilson supported HB 1523, a bill providing legal cover for businesses  to deny services to individuals on the basis of their sexual  orientation. In a 2012 op-ed, Judge Wilson argued that ``gay marriage  is a pander to liberal interest groups and an attempt to cast  Republicans as intolerant, uncaring and even bigoted.'' Judge Wilson's  past support for anti-LGBT legislation and his comments demeaning the  fight for marriage equality raise questions about his ability to rule  objectively on any case implicating LGBT rights.   Finally, Judge Wilson has been an ardent opponent of women's  reproductive rights, making it abundantly clear that he supports ``the  complete and immediate reversal of the Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton  decisions.''   Judge Wilson will be the 200th Article III judge appointed by this  President and confirmed by this Senate. Unfortunately, Judge Wilson's  record of hostility to voting rights, the ACA, the rights of LGBT  Americans, and women's reproductive rights is not unique to him. In  fact, it is clear that so many of this administration's judicial  nominees have been selected precisely because of those viewpoints. This  is not something to celebrate. After all, those who have gained  healthcare because of the ACA deserve the security of knowing their  coverage is not at risk from the Federal judiciary.   And those who seek to vindicate their rights--to vote, to make their  own reproductive healthcare decisions, and to be free from  discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity-- deserve a judiciary that will rule fairly and impartially.   I will vote against Judge Wilson's nomination, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same. Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Military Aviators Cancer Incidence Study Act,'' which I introduced  today.   This legislation would require the Department of Defense to conduct a  study to determine if there is a higher incidence of cancers occurring  in military aviators as compared to similar age groups in the general  population.   It has been reported that the prevalence of cancer is particularly  high among military aviators, particularly among fighter pilots in the  United States Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps.   There have been several alarming clusters of cancer diagnoses at  military installations, including at Naval Air Weapons Station China  Lake in California and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North  Carolina.   Four commanding officers who served at Naval Air Weapons Station  China Lake have died of cancer. Each officer had completed thousands of  flight hours in advanced jets.   According to a study by the U.S. Air Force in 2008 titled ``Cancer in  Fighters,'' six pilots and weapons systems officers for the F-15E  Strike Eagle at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, aged 33 to 43, were  diagnosed with cancer between 2002 and 2005. Each officer had completed  at least 2,100 flight hours.   A study by the U.S. Air Force in 2010 reported on a cluster of seven  members of the Air Force Special Operations Command diagnosed with  brain cancer among crew members of the C-130 between 2006 and 2009. The  individuals affected were three C-130 pilots, two flight engineers, one  loadmaster, and one navigator assigned to different installations  around the world.   And yet, there has been no comprehensive study conducted of cancer  rates among military aviators.   One challenge of extracting findings from previous studies by the  Navy or the Air Force on cancer rates is that each study focused on  pilots who are active duty members of the Armed Forces and did not  include the medical records of former pilots who are veterans, which is  the population in which cancer most often appears.   Members of the Armed Forces who serve full military careers are not  likely to be counted in data captured by the Department of Veterans  Affairs. Members who served 20 years or more are eligible for health  care under the TRICARE program, which is managed by the Department of  Defense.   Also, many members pursue private sector jobs after separating from  the Armed Forces and receive health care outside of the Federal  Government. Those factors have made it difficult to see if the health  issues that families of military aviators are experiencing are part of  larger trend.                           How the bill would help    Our bill would require the Department of Defense in conjunction with  the National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute, and  the Department of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study across the United  States Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps to determine whether there is  a higher incidence of cancers occurring among military aviators as  compared to similar age groups in the general population.   If the study determines a higher rate of cancer among military  aviators, the Department of Defense would then move into a second phase  of the study and report to Congress on the following:   Carcinogens associated with military flight operations;   The operating environments where aviators might have been exposed to  increased radiation;   Duty stations, dates of service, aircraft flown, and additional  duties that could have increased the risk of cancer for each affected  military aviator;   Locations where a military aviator served or additional duties of a  military aviator associated with higher incidences of cancer;   Potential exposures due to service in the Armed Forces that are not  related to aviation, such as exposure to burn pits or toxins in  contaminated water; and   The appropriate age to begin screening military aviators for cancer  based on several variables.                                  Conclusion    Military aviators take enough risks while serving our country without  also having to worry about contracting cancer from radiation exposure.   The high prevalence of cancer among these pilots is deeply  concerning, particularly the clusters of cases at China Lake.   We must determine why these aviators are getting cancer and if their  jobs are exposing them to dangerous carcinogens.   The study is an important step to help us understand what is  happening and how we can better protect our military men and women. I  hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.   Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Military Aviators Cancer Incidence Study Act,'' which I introduced  today.
