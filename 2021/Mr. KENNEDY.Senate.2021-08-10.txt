 Mr. President, I call up my amendment 3758 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, after 20 weeks of gestation, medical  science has determined that children in their mother's womb feel pain.  To channel my good friend and the distinguished Senator from Rhode  Island, you can go to the appropriate professor at any of the  universities in your State, and they will tell you that is so.   This amendment will allow for penalties for those who perform  elective--elective--abortions on unborn children who are at least 20  weeks in gestation. This amendment would not apply to abortions in the  case of rape, of incest, or when the life of the mother is in danger.    Mr. President.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3758     Do I have additional time, Mr. President?    I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3753 and ask  that it be reported by number and, while they are doing that, for  someone to check on Senator Tillis.   (Laughter.)    Madam President, this amendment will prohibit any  changes to the tax treatment of like-kind exchanges.
