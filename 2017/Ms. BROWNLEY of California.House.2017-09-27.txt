 I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona for  yielding to me and for organizing this Special Order hour and bringing  attention to this very, very important topic.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today, both Republicans and Democrats,  because addressing this epidemic of veteran suicide is the highest  priority for Members of both parties.   Congressman Suozzi talked about the fact that Dr. Shulkin, the VA  Secretary, has made this his top clinical priority; and by shining a  clear light on this topic, I hope we can finally reduce the stigma  around mental health issues and be clear about the significant  work that still needs to be done to address this devastating epidemic.    We need to do more because 20 veterans commit suicide each day,  veterans like Sara Leatherman and Linda Raney and Katie Lynn Cesena. As  Congressman Murphy already pointed out, it is also estimated that only  6 of those 20 veterans were receiving VA services.   The VA provides some of the most comprehensive mental healthcare and  resources in the Nation, and we need to encourage more veterans to seek  care that is available, and we must be ready for them.   We do need more providers, and I support Congressman Murphy and  Congressman Scott and others who are advocating for more providers  within the VA.   But, unfortunately, whether it is a lack of providers, long wait  times, or not enough resources devoted to outreach, we face a serious  issue with getting veterans set up with the care that they need. The VA  took an important step forward earlier this year by expanding access to  its mental healthcare for veterans with other than honorable  discharges. That was the right thing to do and the right step, but much  more must be done.   One important component of reducing veteran suicide is to better  understand which programs have been most successful. The Clay Hunt Act  and my bill, the Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act, required an  independent analysis of the VA's suicide prevention and mental health  programs to find out what works.   It is critical to break this data up based on gender because,  tragically, recent VA data indicates that women veterans are 2\1/2\  times more likely to take their own lives than civilian women.  Actually, that is a better statistic than last year, because last year  it was 6 times more than civilian women. But the reason why that has  been reduced, tragically, is because the number of suicides amongst  civilian women has increased.   As the population of female veterans continues to grow, the VA needs  to recognize their unique experiences and provide the quality  healthcare that will address this suicide epidemic. It is clear that  women on the battlefield experience the same kind of trauma that men  experience on the battlefield, and that may be a very similar  experience, but we know that women's experience in the military serving  our country can be very, very different, and we need to understand how  best to treat both women and men.                                time  1945    In closing, please let me remind veterans and those who love them  that the VA operates a confidential call line that is open 24 hours a  day, 7 days a week.
