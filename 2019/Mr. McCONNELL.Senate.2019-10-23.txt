 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first, I want to acknowledge two  notable events taking place in the Capitol today.   As we speak, the First Lady of the United States is just down the  hall for a special event related to our Nation's opioid epidemic,  marking the progress that Congress and the administration have made in  recent years and focusing our efforts on the work still ahead.   I will have more to say on the subject tomorrow, which will mark the  1-year anniversary of President Trump signing our landmark opioid  legislation into law.   I want to warmly welcome the First Lady to the Senate this morning  and thank her for her continued focus on this crisis, which affects so  many of our States. I offer these thanks not only as the majority  leader but as the senior Senator from Kentucky, which has been hit hard  by this epidemic.                            ____________________     Mr. President, later today, in the old Senate Chamber,  family, friends, and former colleagues of our late colleague, Senator  Ted Stevens, will gather for the unveiling of the Senator's leadership  portrait.   Senator Stevens' likeness will join the storied ranks of the  leadership portrait collection--images of majority leaders, minority  leaders, and Presidents pro tem, which are proudly displayed around the  building.   Our distinguished predecessors watch over the corridors they walked,  the rooms in which they debated, and the body they served.   It is fitting that Senator Stevens is being recognized for his  service as President pro tem. As we all know, unlike the elected party  leaders, that is not a job which you can campaign or persuade your way  into. The only way to become President pro tem is to persuade your home  State, over and over, to rehire you, and Ted Stevens was about the most  dogged advocate for his home State that anybody could possibly imagine.  He was Alaska's son and Alaska's champion 24 hours a day and then some.   I look forward to honoring our former colleague's memory this  afternoon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, later today, I  understand the House of Representatives will vote on H.R. 4617. This is  the latest installment in Speaker Pelosi's campaign to expand  government's control over America's political speech.   It is a transparent attack on the First Amendment that has united an  [[Page S6052]]  unlikely band of opponents across the political spectrum. Everybody  from hardcore conservatives to the ACLU is speaking out against this  effort to erode Americans' constitutional rights.   The proposal would give the Federal Election Commission unprecedented  license to track and regulate Americans' political speech on the  internet and decide what speech qualifies as political in the first  place.   If it were not bad enough on principle to fill more Washington, DC,  filing cabinets with which citizens hold what beliefs, their bill would  also deputize media companies into this effort. They would force  publications to keep excessive records for any advertisement they  accept not only for political campaigns but on any issue of national  importance.    When this regulatory burden has been tried on a smaller scale, it has  frightened media platforms into rejecting political ads altogether. It  is a textbook example of policy designed to reduce the amount of free  speech in our country. Press organizations such as the Washington Post  and the Baltimore Sun have already sued over similar regulations on  First Amendment grounds and won in court.   House Democrats want to violate the First Amendment and harm  journalists in order to give more control to the FEC. That would be the  same FEC that Democrats have recently tried to shift from a bipartisan  body to a partisan body for the first time in its history.   A different part of the House bill refers to ``legitimate  journalistic activities.'' I look forward to hearing what Orwellian  commission or process House Democrats may have in mind for determining  whether Washington, DC, deems a particular journalist legitimate.   These are just a few examples. Even the ACLU--widely viewed as a  left-leaning organization that is not known for siding with  Republicans--is publicly opposing the Democrats' bill. Here is what the  ACLU said:         ``The SHIELD Act . . . strikes the wrong balance, sweeping       too broadly and encompassing more speech than necessary. . .       . The SHIELD Act goes too far . . . to the detriment of the       public and the First Amendment.''    That is the ACLU.   Congress has real business to attend to. House Democrats need to stop  blocking the USMCA. Senate Democrats need to stop blocking defense  funding. Yet, rather than working on these issues, we instead see  Democrats continue to fixate--fixate--on chipping away at the First  Amendment. It is a pet project they return to time and again. It is  disturbing, especially in light of recent blatant attempts to  intimidate Americans into silence.   Just a few months ago, a sitting House Democrat earned national  criticism when he publicly tweeted out a list of his own constituents  in San Antonio, TX, who had donated to President Trump's campaign. He  listed these private citizens' names along with their employers or  businesses. In this era of political harassment and online mobs, the  implication was clear as day.   From Twitter posts to partisan messaging bills, House Democrats'  mission is the same: Chill the exercise of free speech. Send a message  to Americans with inconvenient views that speaking up is more trouble  than it is worth.   This proposal will not do anything to stop maligned foreign actors-- something that every Member of this body cares deeply about. As three  former FEC Chairmen recently pointed out, foreign adversaries like  Russia are not going to stop their malign operations for fear of an FEC  fine. Let me say that again. Adversaries like Russia are not going to  stop their malign operations for fear of an FEC fine.   ``Campaign-finance law isn't the tool to prevent foreign meddling. .  . . Adversaries won't be scared off by civil penalties. . . . This is a  job for diplomatic, national security, and counterintelligence  agencies. [This legislation] is a needless sacrifice to First Amendment  rights, not a serious effort to secure elections.''   That is three former Chairmen of the Federal Election Commission. I  certainly agree. It was focusing on defense and counterintelligence,  not attacking the First Amendment, that made the 2018 elections go more  smoothly than the 2016 elections. That is why the hundreds of millions  of dollars Congress has set aside for State grants have made a big  difference. That needs to remain our focus as we continue our efforts  to avoid repeating the mistakes of 2016.   House Democrats have achieved something remarkable here. They have  drafted legislation that is so anti-First Amendment that it has united  everybody from former FEC Commissioners, to the ACLU, to yours truly in  opposition.   I am sorry that Speaker Pelosi deems go-nowhere messaging bills a  better use of the House's time than the USMCA and the 176,000 new  American jobs that experts tell us it would create. The American people  deserve a House of Representatives that works with the Senate and the  President to actually make law and make progress for the families we  represent.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today Senate Democrats will push  forward their own resolution that seeks to undermine part of the  historic tax reform we passed in 2017.   Remember, back then, Washington Democrats were downright hysterical  about our plan to let working Americans send less of their paycheck to  the IRS. Speaker Pelosi called the tax cuts ``Armageddon.'' She said it  was ``the worst bill in the history of the United States Congress.''  That is the Speaker on the 2017 tax reform bill. I guess that shows how  much Democrats hate to cut taxes. But tax reform passed, and the  results are clear. It has increased Americans' take-home pay and helped  generate one of the best economic moments for working families in a  generation.   Since tax reform, 22 States, including my State of Kentucky, have set  new record-low unemployment rates. The national unemployment rate has  set a 50-year low. But, alas, rather than acknowledge that the sky  hasn't fallen, our Democratic friends still want to undermine tax  reform--and listen to where they have elected to start. Listen to this.  Democrats' first target is changing the Tax Code so that working  families across the country have to subsidize wealthy people in States  like New York, New Jersey, and California.   Here is the background. As part of tax reform, in order to maximize  middle-class relief, the deductibility of State and local tax payments  was capped. Most middle-class taxpayers were more than compensated for  this through other tax cuts, but for some wealthy people who elect to  live in high-tax States, this represented a partial increase.   Republicans didn't think it was fair that middle-class working  families in States the Obama economy left behind had to subsidize the  tax bills of rich people in high-tax States without limit. We didn't  eliminate the State and local tax deduction; we just capped it for high  earners. That cap is what Democrats want to undermine. Their resolution  would help high-tax States--typically governed by Democrats--create  workarounds for their high-earners.   Let's be clear about what would happen if Democrats got their real  objective and repealed the SALT cap altogether. According to data from  the Joint Committee on Taxation, 94 percent of the benefit would flow  to taxpayers who earn more than $200,000 a year. That is what they are  advocating. Ninety-four percent of the benefit would flow to taxpayers  who earn more than $200,000 a year. More than half of it would actually  go to people who make more than $1 million a year--cutting taxes for  the rich. Repealing the SALT cap would give millionaires an average tax  cut of $60,000. Meanwhile, the average tax cut for taxpayers earning  between $50,000 and $100,000 would be less than $10. There would be  $60,000 tax cuts for wealthy people and $10 tax cuts for the middle  class. Apparently that sounds like a good trade to our Democratic  colleagues. It doesn't sound like good trade to me.   I am sorry to break it to my Democratic colleagues, but the middle- class Kentuckians I represent have zero interest--zero interest--in  cross-subsidizing the tax bills of millionaires who live in Brooklyn  and the Bay Area.   It is bad enough that my Democratic colleagues want to unwind tax  reform, but it is downright comical that their top priority--a top  priority--is helping wealthy people in blue States find loopholes to  pay even less. They won't even  [[Page S6053]]  propose to repeal the SALT cap outright because they know it is bad  policy and negates all of their talking points about tax fairness. They  just want to bless a backdoor workaround.   I urge Members on both sides to use common sense and reject  Democrats' resolution when we vote on it later today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a joint  resolution at the desk that is due a second reading.    In order to place the joint resolution on the calendar  under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.
