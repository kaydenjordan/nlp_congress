 Mr. President, I thank the chairman, Chairman Reed, that  this important issue deserves a robust debate as we consider this  year's National Defense Authorization Act. I would also like to thank  Senator Gillibrand for her leadership and her tenacity on this issue.   As Senator Reed referenced, I am one of those who do not support  removing the commanders from the decision-making process. Nevertheless,  I appreciate Chairman Reed's commitment to ensuring this issue is  debated and voted on during the full committee markup of the NDAA.   The NDAA markup process is unique in the Senate. We debate and  resolve contentious issues every year. But the regular-order process is  important and has served us well for many, many years--actually 60  years.   When it comes to important issues like this, we should not rush  anything without making sure it is going to do the right thing by our  servicemembers, and so I thank Chairman Reed for his action
