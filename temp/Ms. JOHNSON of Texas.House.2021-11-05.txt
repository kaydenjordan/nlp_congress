 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of the underlying bill, the Build Back Better Act, and in favor of this  rule.   As chairperson of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and  a Member of this body, I am steadfastly committed to ensuring that our  country has a bright future. This bill provides the resources to help  accomplish just that.   The underlying bill we will pass, hopefully tonight, will make  critical investments that ensure that we are able to address the  challenges we face. These resources will help us address the climate  crisis, rebuild after the pandemic, and renew and repair our research  infrastructure. This bill and funding will strengthen our  competitiveness and bolster our position as a global leader in science  and technology.   I thank my colleagues for their work on this bill. Investments in  research and development now will pay untold dividends for the future  health and prosperity of our country.   I am proud to stand in support of the Build Back Better plan, and I  urge that we pass this bill swiftly, as soon as we can pass this rule,  and thoughtfully for the good of the American people today as well as  future generations who will benefit from these investments.
