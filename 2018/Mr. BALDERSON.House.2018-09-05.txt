 Speaker Ryan, Representative Kaptur, Chairman Chabot,  and my new colleagues, thank you for that very warm welcome. To the  people of the 12th District of Ohio, thank you for this remarkable  opportunity to serve you. It is an honor to stand in this Chamber and  take the oath of office.   Joining me today in the gallery are a number of my great friends,  including my son, Joshua, and my girlfriend, Melanie. Thank you both  for your love and support and for being here by my side today.   My parents, Bill and Kathie, could not be here with me today, but  they are watching back home in Zanesville. I also want to thank them  for their love and support. I would not be here without them.   Most importantly, I would also like to thank the good Lord for  getting me here today.   I am humbled to serve in the people's House and look forward to  fulfilling my duties representing the 12th District of Ohio.   God bless you all. Thank you very much.
