 Mr. President, as we work to pass this bipartisan  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to upgrade and modernize our  country's infrastructure, I am glad to be here joining Senator Lummis  to introduce this amendment to include our Highway Cost Allocation Act.   As a former engineer and astronaut, my career has taught me about the  importance of having the data to tackle a complex issue.   This bipartisan amendment would require the Secretary of  Transportation to conduct the first comprehensive study of vehicle  highway usage in nearly 25 years. This information would inform  decisions to address the Highway Trust Fund's revenue shortfalls during  its next reauthorization cycle.   That is important for growing States, like Arizona and other Western  States, and for our entire country, so I urge my colleagues to support  our bipartisan amendment.   I yield back.
