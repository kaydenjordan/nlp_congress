 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 708, I call up  the bill (H.R. 3055) making appropriations for the Departments of  Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, with the Senate  amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the House amendment to the Senate  amendment to H.R. 3055.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   While the House did its work and passed 12 appropriations bills  through committee and 10 appropriations bills off the floor, delays in  the Senate mean the appropriations process is behind.   With just days until current stopgap funding expires, we must pass a  continuing resolution to keep the government open and fund key  priorities as we negotiate subcommittee allocations and then finalize  individual appropriation bills.   This legislation avoids controversial policies and instead contains  provisions that reflect shared priorities, including bipartisan  language to fully fund a fair and accurate 2020 decennial Census, a 3.1  percent pay raise for our military, and language to prevent a  rescission of $7.6 billion in highway funding.   In addition to these provisions, the CR includes a package of  extenders that will keep health programs critical to American families  up and running. By extending these programs and government funding  through December 20, this CR will allow additional time to negotiate  and enact responsible long-term funding for priorities that make our  country safer and stronger and give working families a better chance at  a better life.   Mr. Speaker, even as we pass this CR today, American families,  businesses, and communities need the certainty of full-year funding. To  complete the appropriations process, we must first settle allocations  with the Senate Republicans. Only by coming together in good faith can  we enact responsible full-year spending bills that invest for the  people and give every American a better chance at a better life.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H9038]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) and I ask unanimous consent that she  be allowed to control that time.    Madam Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent resolution  and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.
