 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an  amendment to protect the coastlines of Florida from the scourge of  offshore oil drilling.   I am proud to say that this amendment, as we will see this morning  from my colleagues' comments, has strong bipartisan support from our  colleagues in the Florida delegation.   When it comes to the idea of turning our beaches into a fossil fuel  industrial zone, there is no divergence between Democrats and  Republicans in Florida. We stand united to prevent drilling off of our  cherished coasts. Florida's famous beaches are central to our $65  billion a year tourism industry. Our hotels, fishermen, and recreation  industries depend on clean coastal waters, and the still recovering  Florida Bay cannot afford an oil spill.   Every time I speak about this issue, I make sure to mention the  Deepwater Horizon disaster. Apparently, the current administration has  already forgotten what happened to us 9 years ago. At its worst, the  spill leaked more than 60,000 barrels of oil a day. Eighty-seven days  went by while crude gushed into the ocean nearly unchecked. By its end,  millions of barrels of crude oil were released into the Gulf of Mexico.   This devastated the entire Gulf ecosystem. Thousands of protected  species were harmed by oil slicks and dead zones. Coral reefs between  Alabama and Florida were decimated and suffocated by oil, and  hydrocarbons were found on hundreds of miles of beaches around the  Gulf.   This environmental impact also left a human toll. The accident caused  the deaths of 11 rig workers. The spill left 12,000 people unemployed  and decimated local economies which rely on fishing and marine  recreation.                                time  1315    Now is not the time to expand more areas to fossil fuel extraction.  We must be doing everything possible to transition to a clean energy  economy.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Crist), my friend and the former Governor of our great State.    Mr. Chairman, if I might inquire how much time  I have remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from southwest Florida (Mr. Rooney), who represents the great  counties of Collier and Lee.    Mr. Chair, before I yield the remaining time  to Mr. Rutherford from Jacksonville, I include in the Record this  letter from the Florida delegation opposing offshore oil drilling that  was sent to Secretary Bernhardt.                                  Congress of the United States,                                  Washington, DC, February 28, 2019.      Re Protect Florida's Coasts from Oil and Gas Drilling.       David Bernhardt,      Acting Secretary, U.S. Department of the Interior,           Washington, DC.        Dear Acting Interior Secretary Bernhardt: We write to urge       you to protect the coasts of Florida from oil and gas       development. As you know, last year, former Interior       Secretary Zinke announced that Florida would be exempt from       any offshore drilling plans. However, we remain concerned       that no formal action has been taken to prohibit drilling off       Florida's coasts. Florida's natural resources and economy, as       well as the military mission as expressed by the Department       of Defense, cannot bear the risk and devastating impacts of       offshore drilling. We urge you to take formal action to       exempt drilling off Florida's coast from the five year plan       for oil and gas lease sales.        Florida's economic well-being is dependent upon our state's       fragile and treasured coasts. Clean coasts and healthy oceans       are the fundamental underpinning of jobs and revenue in our       communities. Florida's coastal communities thrive in concert       with a healthy marine environment. Views littered with       drilling platforms, industrialization of coastline and oil on       our beaches spell disaster for Florida's economy and our       neighbors who rely on tourism, fishing and related business.        We saw, firsthand, the destruction offshore drilling can       have on ocean health, coastlines, and tourism in 2010 during       the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Tourism dropped across the       state, including areas that were unaffected by the rig       explosion. Even without a blowout, offshore oil rigs dump       tons of drilling muds, fluids, and metal cuttings--including       toxic metals and carcinogens--into the ocean, and pose a       threat to human health, marine ecosystems, and wildlife.        While there are ample environmental and economic reasons to       prohibit drilling off Florida's coasts, our national security       and military readiness also require keeping the rigs away       from Florida. The eastern Gulf of Mexico is a critical       training area for our military and the Department of Defense       has  [[Page H4952]]       stated clearly that the area is an ``irreplaceable national       asset'' for combat force readiness. Any oil and gas       development would be an obstacle to military preparedness and       national security.        Finally, the people of Florida are also clearly opposed to       oil and gas development off our coast. A constitutional       amendment on Florida's November 2018 ballot to ban offshore       drilling in state waters passed overwhelmingly. Here is       objective proof that Floridians recognize that the state's       economy depends on a pristine environment, and that offshore       drilling threatens Florida's future.        Florida relies on coastlines unencumbered by oil and gas       drilling to sustain its economy, preserve its natural       resources, and protect our nation's military. We urge you to       exempt Florida's coasts from any offshore drilling plans. We       must preserve and protect Florida's future.
