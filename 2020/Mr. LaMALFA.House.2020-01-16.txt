 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed some light on how slow  this urgent impeachment process really unfolded.   The missile crawler-transporter used to transfer the NASA spacecraft  to the launch pad travels at a rate of about 5,000 feet per hour. The  slowest animal on Earth, the three-toed sloth, can travel at a speed of  792 feet per hour. The California banana slug can travel at 240 feet  per hour, amazingly enough.   It is approximately 610 feet from the House desk to the Senate desk.  It took 28 days for Speaker Pelosi to send the articles to the Senate  at a rate of about 11 inches per hour.   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats never thought this was an urgent matter  of national security, as was stated. Urgent matters don't move at 11  inches per hour. Indeed, there was time to use about a dozen different  souvenir pens to sign the document one letter at a time yesterday.   The dishonesty, the misdirection of House Democrats surrounding this  impeachment process--well, the American public has had 28-plus days to  figure this out.  [[Page H305]]    Thankfully, the Senate is going to take up the USMCA today before  they get balled up for the next several weeks dealing with this  impeachment disaster.   Mr. Speaker, I hope they have a fair trial and treat the President  correctly in this process.                            ____________________
