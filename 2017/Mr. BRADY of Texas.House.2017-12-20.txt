 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 668, I  call up the bill (H.R. 1) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to  titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal  year 2018, with the Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, both the House and now the Senate have taken action on  legislation to reform America's Tax Code for the first time in 31  years. Unfortunately, two targeted provisions did not meet Senate rules  and had to be removed.   Today, the process continues to move forward, and, with this vote, it  will be the House, the people's House, that officially sends this  historic legislation to President Trump's desk.   I know the American people are excited. More than that, I know they  are feeling a sense of relief. They are relieved that, for the first  time in years, they are going to see more money in their paychecks that  they can keep.   Think about that middle-income family of four, earning $70,000 a  year. These are working families, and the tax cut of more than $2,000  they will see under this bill, that $2,000 is real money. It is real  money these families worked hard to earn, but, until now, they have had  to send it to Washington instead of being able to use it for their own  needs, whether that is paying bills, saving for the future, or putting  new tires on a car.   Think about the relief our job creators and our workers will feel.  For so long, Americans have barely seen any growth in their paychecks,  yet they are going to their jobs every day, and they are working harder  than ever.                                time  1200    With this bill, that hard work is finally going to be rewarded, and  we are going to see the growth of jobs and paychecks like we haven't  seen in years.   For our businesses, large and small, no matter if they are a small  startup with just three workers or a large company with 3,000, they are  finally going to have a Tax Code that works with them as they grow,  innovate, and invest in our communities. They are going to see relief  from complexity and high rates and the feeling they are always having  to compete with one hand tied behind their back.   For all these Americans, all the hardworking men, women, and families  who bring life to our communities and to our economy, I think the major  source of relief is knowing that, starting in the new year, none of us  has to accept this broken Tax Code and this slow-growth status in  America any longer.   With the new tax system we will deliver today, things will change for  the better, and they will change immediately. This new Tax Code will be  simple, it will be fair, and it will be focused on the needs of the  American people, not on Washington's special interests.   This new Tax Code will be modern. It will be competitive. It will  create more good-paying jobs right here in our communities, not drive  them overseas. Above all, this new Tax Code, America's Tax Code, will  not belong to the special interests anymore. It will belong to the  American people. It will help more Americans realize their own American  Dream, whatever that may be. For all the Americans who struggle and who  have been left behind under today's broken Tax Code, that has to be the  biggest relief of all.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we hear a lot of false claims these days by opponents of  tax reform. We hear that this isn't relief for the middle class, that  people will see their taxes increase. But the Tax Policy Center, the  most liberal economic group there is, just grudgingly admitted  yesterday that 90 percent of Americans will see real tax cuts in this  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In fact, the only ones who won't are the one- tenth of 1 percent who could.   We hear today about betrayal. Well, let's talk about that.   This tax reform bill doubles the child tax credit and expands it to  nearly four times as many Americans, helping them with the expensive  costs of childcare. Democrats oppose helping our parents raise their  children. That is betrayal.                                time  1215    In this tax reform bill, we increase the amount of medical expenses  Americans can write off--medical expenses driven up by ObamaCare.  Democrats oppose helping families write off these costs. That is  betrayal.   Now we are expanding the number of Americans who can, and how much,  give in charity to our churches and to their causes. Democrats oppose  helping people give to the community and to the causes they believe in.  That is betrayal.   In this bill, we, for the first time, allow families who are saving  for their kids' future to be able to use that and transfer it to the  new ABLE accounts because their child has special needs and may need  help throughout their life. Democrats oppose letting families save for  their disabled children's future. That is betrayal.   Then we hear over and over again how some stand for small business,  our Main Street businesses. Republicans, for the first time ever,  provide a 20 percent deduction for our Main Street and small businesses  across America. Democrats oppose helping our Main Street businesses.  That is betrayal.   For too long, we have watched our jobs move overseas. This changes.  This tax cut bill brings those jobs back and, more importantly, allows  our companies, when they compete and win around the world, to bring  those dollars back to be reinvested in our communities, in jobs, in  manufacturing, and in research. Democrats oppose bringing jobs back to  America and bringing those dollars back to reinvest in our community.  Mr. Speaker, that is betrayal.   At the end of the day, we have a choice. Do we give back to families,  parents, small businesses, and to America the hope and opportunity of a  new economy driven by what is important to them, not what is important  to special interests in Washington, D.C.?   That is what this bill is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, let's talk deficits. Our Democrat opponents just hate  the thought that we would give Americans back what they earned.   In 2009, when President Obama lifted the national debt by $1.6  trillion--more than this tax bill--they cheered. In the next year, when  President Obama raised the national debt by almost $2 trillion in 1  year, they cheered. Three more times, President Obama and Democrats  raised our national debt more than $1 trillion every year. And now-- now--they oppose it.   Why?   Because that was about Washington spending your money. This is about  giving it back to the American people, and now, suddenly, you object.   Two trillion dollars of deficit in 1 year.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Barr for his leadership. The gentleman is  correct, Senate Democrats stripped this out. I am committed to working  with the gentleman to find a permanent solution to this problem as soon  as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I say to my Democratic colleagues: The worst bill in 29  years? With ObamaCare, don't sell yourselves short.   Today, we have a choice to make. We can either stick with the status  quo--we just heard it--or we can take bold action to overhaul this  broken Tax Code and restore hope, opportunity, and prosperity to  Americans.   Our choice is clear, and I have made mine. I will vote to send this  bill to President Trump's desk to get real tax reform done for the  American people for the first time in 31 years. We will deliver for the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
