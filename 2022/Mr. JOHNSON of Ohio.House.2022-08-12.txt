 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight my  amendment that the minority refuses to even bring to a vote. My  amendment is simple. It would amend this so-called Inflation Reduction  Act by striking from the bill the Methane Emissions Reduction Program,  which is a fancy term for what could be more accurately described as  attacks on American natural gas.   In my district in eastern and southeastern Ohio, oil and gas workers  get up every day to produce our valuable natural resources that are  used to generate electricity, power manufacturing, heat and cool our  homes, cook our food, and more recently, to use our American natural  gas to rescue our European allies who now find themselves under  Vladimir Putin's tyrannical thumb.   This methane tax jeopardizes all of this, and it represents yet  another attack by the majority on American fossil fuels that have  brought more people out of poverty around the world than any other  energy source around the planet.   When I talk to producers in my district, I give them a lot of credit.  These companies, without being asked, are quite literally innovating  every day. They use state-of-the-art technology to capture as much of  their methane  [[Page H7687]]  emissions as possible, and they are proud to do it.   And what is their reward? Well, they get a new tax anyway. It is also  worth noting that the EPA is already working on rulemaking for  regulating methane emissions, and the authors of this bill knew that-- all to appease the radical environmentalist left.   Madam Speaker, I want to be clear that this isn't, ``a methane  reduction program.'' It is a massive tax on American producers,  American businesses, and American workers. It is a tax on job creators  in Ohio. It is a tax on hardworking Americans trying to heat and cool  our homes, and a tax on feeding our families, and a tax on the American  way of life.   We should strike this provision from the bill.
