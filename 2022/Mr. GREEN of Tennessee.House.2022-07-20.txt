 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to  amendment No. 137.   Unlimited quantities of food and medicine are already permitted in  Cuba, yet this egregious amendment would allow the financing of  agricultural exports to the island. The Cuban regime controls 100  percent--a single company controls all agricultural imports. It is  owned by the military. It is controlled by the enforcers of the  Communist regime.   Tens of thousands of Cubans tried to protest just 1 year ago, and  thousands of them are in prison. Children are imprisoned by this  Communist regime.    The current regime controls all the imports.  If you give money to the regime, Mr. Chair, they keep the money. They  don't trickle it down to the people.   They are a current state sponsor of terrorism and a close ally of  Putin's Russia, the Maduro regime in Venezuela, the terrorist state of  Iran, and  [[Page H6895]]  terrorist groups such as FARC and ELN. They are currently participating  in a military exercise in Venezuela led by the Russians.   Again, just 1 year ago, thousands of Cubans protested in the streets  in every province in Cuba demanding libertad--freedom. Hundreds of them  remain in prison, including children, as I said, for daring to speak  freely. Yet, today, Congress is debating whether to provide financing  to their captors.   A vote against this amendment is a pro-freedom, pro-America, and pro- human rights vote, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  amendment.
