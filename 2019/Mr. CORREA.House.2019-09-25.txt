 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  commonsense legislation, the SAFE Banking Act.   When I was a State senator in California, I was visited by Dr.  Moynihan, who came to visit my office to ask that I do some legislation  to help his daughter. In her short lifetime, she had been tormented by  epileptic seizures. The only drug that worked for her without severe  side effects was cannabis.    It breaks my heart to know that these legit businesses can pay their  taxes with cash, yet customers like Dr. Moynihan can't use a credit  card. He also has to pay with cash to get legitimate products. It  doesn't make sense.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please support commonsense  legislation. Please vote ``aye'' on this legislation.
