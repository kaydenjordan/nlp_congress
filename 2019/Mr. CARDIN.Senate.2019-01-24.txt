 Mr. President, reserving the right to object because we  had floor time immediately after my friend from Texas, could you give  us an idea of how much time you will be using on the floor before we  have the time--we were supposed to come immediately after you. That is  my reason for raising that issue.    There are about 15 Senators who are waiting for the time.  We were originally supposed to start at 3:30. Now we are starting  later. I know Senators are going to be inconvenienced. Some have  commitments.   I will remove my objection. I really want it understood that we  thought we would be starting our time before that.    Mr. President, I had previously noted on the floor the  group of Senators who want to join together to send a clear message  that we are committed to working together to end this shutdown and  responsibly deal with border security in a truly bipartisan manner.  This is a group of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.  Senator Murkowski is leading this on the Republican side of the floor  today.   I ask unanimous consent that for the next hour, the two of us control  30 minutes of time; that I control 30 minutes and Senator Murkowski  will control the other 30 minutes of time.    Mr. President, during this floor time, I think you are  going to see clear messages coming from Democratic Senators and  Republican Senators that this shutdown needs to end, that we need to  pass a short-term, 3-week clean CR so we can have time to consider the  President's request and work together on a bipartisan border security  package.   I want my colleagues to know we have been meeting regularly in an  effort to try to see where we can find common ground. We feel pretty  confident that we can find common ground if we can get government open  and get to work in a responsible manner to deal with border security in  the best interest of the people of this Nation.   Mr. President, I will first yield to my friend from Virginia, Senator  Warner, then I will yield time and give up the floor to Senator  Murkowski.    I couldn't agree more with my friend from Alaska and the  way she worded it. We are going to work together to open the government  as quickly as possible.   I yield to my friend from Delaware, Senator Coons.    At this time, I yield to my colleague from Arizona,  Senator Sinema.    Mr. President, I am now pleased to yield to my colleague  from Maryland, Senator Van Hollen, who has been a real partner during  his stay here in the Senate. We have traveled the State of Maryland  together, and we know firsthand the hardships of this shutdown. We have  seen the faces, and we have seen the consequences.    Mr. President, I have joined Senator Isakson on many  bills since I have been in the Senate, and I look forward to working  with him to find the solution with regard to border security issues. I  thank him for his comments.   I yield to my colleague from Maine, Senator King, who has been so  instrumental in trying to come up with concrete ways to end this  shutdown.    Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the words from  Senator Portman. The two of us have been working together since we were  in the House of Representatives, and we are proud that we have a record  of concrete accomplishments, working together across party lines.  Sometimes we had to take on the leadership of both of our parties, but  we got things done. So I am encouraged by his comments, and I really do  believe we can work together to resolve this issue.   With that, I would like to yield to my colleague from West Virginia,  Senator Manchin, who has been a real leader on the practical impact  that this shutdown has. The story about what is happening in the  prisons located in West Virginia I think really frighten all of us.    Mr. President, I am pleased to yield to my colleague from  New Hampshire, Ms. Hassan.    Mr. President, over the last hour, many of our colleagues  have come to the floor--Democrats and Republicans--with different views  about how we should deal with border security issues and how we should  deal with the problems at hand but with a common willingness and  commitment to reach a bipartisan agreement.   In order for that to be accomplished, we need time. Therefore, we are  filing this afternoon a bipartisan amendment to the underlying bill  that would provide 3 weeks for a continuing resolution for government  to be opened so that we can work together to deal with the border  security issues.   I agree with Senator King in his optimism that we will be able to  reach an agreement. It is interesting that Senator King is an  Independent. This should not be a partisan problem on border security.  We should be able to resolve the issues.   I thank Senator Murkowski for her help in organizing this event. We  tried to work in a truly bipartisan manner in order to give optimism,  and I think, rightfully so, that we can solve this issue if we have the  time to do it.   I urge all of our colleagues to join us in this effort. Let's open  government, let's have 3 weeks, and let's all be committed to deal with  border security in the manner in which this institution in the past has  been able to deal with tough issues.   I again thank my colleague from Alaska, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor Lainy LeBow- Sachs, a Baltimore icon whose name has rightly become synonymous with  public service and philanthropy. After 23 years at the Kennedy Krieger  Institute and 16 years before that as one of then-Governor William  Donald Schaefer's key special assistants, Lainy has announced she is  retiring. My wife Myrna and I are proud to have Lainy as one of our  dearest friends and closest advisers. So today, I would like to pause  to reflect on the remarkable legacy she has created.   Lainy was born in Newton, MA, but moved to Baltimore in 1970, where  she spotted a flyer for someone who was running to be the city's next  mayor. Intrigued and looking for a way to engage in the community, she  began volunteering on the campaign. The candidate in question was  William Donald Schaefer, who, with Lainy's help and knack for  connecting with people, went on to win that election and several others  after it until becoming the Governor of Maryland in 1987. Lainy was by  his side throughout it all, serving as one of his closest advisers and  confidants. She became known around Maryland for her strength of  character, work ethic, and uncanny ability to facilitate meaningful  connections between State and local officials with shared goals and  ideas for making Maryland a better place in which to live and work.   After Governor Schaefer's retirement, Lainy's talents were widely  sought-after. She was approached regularly by public officials,  businesses, and nonprofits, all of them eager to have one of Maryland's  most influential and effective public servants on their team. None of  the opportunities resonated, until she was approached by Dr. Gary  Goldstein, the president and chief executive officer of the Kennedy  Krieger Institute. For those outside of Maryland who may be unfamiliar  with Kennedy Krieger, the institute is, as its website states, ``an  internationally recognized institution dedicated to improving the lives  of children and young adults with pediatric developmental disabilities  and disorders of the brain, spinal cord and musculoskeletal system,  through patient care, special education, research, and professional  training.''   The chance to work on behalf of children with developmental  disabilities, to raise their profile, to put their needs and care in  the spotlight and devote her time to something so worthwhile and  meaningful, the opportunity called to Lainy. She began directing  Kennedy Krieger's external relations, leading the institute's  philanthropy, public relations, and government relations efforts into a  new and prosperous era. Her penchant for inspiring others to care as  deeply as she did, combined  [[Page S584]]  with her famous Rolodexes full of contacts and friends from across the  State, made her an indomitable force of good will. Kennedy Krieger's  fundraising skyrocketed under her leadership, as did the institute's  profile, allowing it to invest in groundbreaking medical research and,  above all, to care for more children. Over the course of her tenure,  she led three capital projects that raised a combined total of more  than $117 million, all in the name of improving and expanding  healthcare for our children and grandchildren. She built the  institute's new external relations department from the ground up; it  started with only her; today, it employs a staff of 34 like-minded  philanthropists dedicated to keeping Kennedy Krieger growing. Dr.  Goldstein, the man who convinced Lainy to join Kennedy Krieger, says it  best: ``She has been phenomenally successful. We are quiet, nerdy  academics around here. She took us up a step by a factor of ten.''   Lainy has been so successful throughout her career both because she  works hard and because her compassion and empathy shine through in all  that she does. When she asks someone for help or for resources, it is  always clear that the ``ask'' comes from a place of deep, heartfelt  sincerity. When she uses her influence to connect people, it is because  she genuinely believes in them and in the work they are trying to do.  Everyone has always understood Lainy to be extraordinarily thoughtful,  earnest, effective, and empathetic, and that character has inspired  immediate trust from everyone she meets. That trust has been her  currency, and she has spent it on helping others.   What makes Lainy so remarkable isn't just that she is so talented;  many people are. Rather, it is that she has always used her talents to  improve other people's lives. In his book ``Wishful Thinking,''  Frederick Buechner wrote, ``The place God calls you to is the place  where your deep gladness and the world's deep hunger meet.'' From the  day Lainy first arrived in Baltimore nearly 50 years ago, she has found  that place in her life, and all of our lives have been enriched.   When I say that Lainy is retiring, I need to add some caveats. She  currently serves on the boards of Beth Am Synagogue, the Associated:  Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore, the Baltimore Jewish Council,  the BB&T advisory board, and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Serving  for Lainy comes as naturally and, apparently, as necessarily as  breathing.   Lainy has come to define the best of Maryland, and her legacy is now  and forever woven into our State's history. She has channeled her  considerable skills and connections into work that has changed lives  and facilitated incredible progress in caring for some of our most  vulnerable children. On behalf of those children, their families, and  the entire State of Maryland, I extend to her my sincere and eternal  gratitude.                            ____________________
