 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1235, the Naismith Memorial  Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act.   First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to read into the Record a letter  written by president and CEO of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall  of Fame, John L. Doleva, in support of what we are doing here today. He  says:         To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Naismith Memorial       Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019, the House of Representatives       has introduced a bill to mint an exclusive commemorative       coin. The bill is sponsored by Congressman Richard E. Neal       and Thomas Rooney. Senators Elizabeth Warren and John McCain       support the venture by sponsoring the same legislation in the       Senate, S. 2598. I am respectfully requesting your support       and cosponsorship of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of       Fame Commemorative Coin Act.        This endeavor and legislation is of deep interest to me       because of my professional career--primarily the last 16       years--has been fully embedded in promoting basketball       through my passion for the game as president and CEO of the       Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.        It has been an honor to help the Naismith Memorial       Basketball Hall of Fame provide a home for the greatness of       the game's past, its exciting present day and brilliant       future that continues to touch all parts of the globe. The       game's immortals, through their stories and achievements, are       contained here through their legacy as players, coaches,       teams, officials, and legendary contributors to the game.       More than 6 million visitors have educated themselves through       the enjoyment of exploring the rich history.        My passion for this sport is not solely rooted in the game       itself or its traditions, but, rather, my love for basketball       centers on its ability to develop character. One example is       the outreach of the Hall of Fame's MVP's of Character       program, an initiative that has involved thousands of youth       in the cities across the country, like New York City;       Washington, D.C.; and Lawrence, Kansas. The program centers       on the belief that ``teaching youth about good character--      both on and off the court--helps them understand the impact       of it and their lives . . . character traits like honesty,       respect, responsibility, integrity and cooperation create a       foundation for success.''        Support of Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame       Commemorative Coin bill has no taxpayer cost, is your       opportunity to help grow the game of basketball and the       educational and outreach programs provided by the Basketball       Hall of Fame.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1235, the Naismith  Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act, a bill to  require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue a commemorative  coin in honor of the 60th anniversary of the Naismith  [[Page H7452]]  Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, located in the birthplace of  basketball.                                time  1615    Located in the ``birthplace of basketball,'' the Naismith Memorial  Basketball Hall of Fame is entrusted with recording and disseminating  the history of this great American pastime and recognizing and honoring  the achievements of the sport's greatest players, coaches, and  contributors.   With the ability to reach millions of Americans through its  educational programs, events, exhibits, and online presence, the  Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame plays an important role in  celebrating and promoting the positive core values demonstrated by  basketball's heroes, who have inspired Americans from all quarters.   Passage of the legislation also provides an opportunity to highlight  the creative ways in which the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of  Fame has leveraged America's love of the game and to develop  basketball-related educational programs that teach our youth about a  wide range of topics, such as financial literacy, math, civil rights,  leadership of character, women's and men's history, and geography.   In addition to raising awareness of its important work and honoring  its 60th anniversary, surcharges associated with the sale of the unique  basketball-themed coins provided for in the bill will also enable the  Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to increase its operations  and educational programming, all at no cost to taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, basketball is one of the games that unites all Americans  across party lines, across racial lines, and across geographic lines.  That is who we are. The bipartisan legislation before us already has  the support of more than two-thirds of the House, and I hope all  Members will join me in supporting this bill to honor and support the  important work of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.   Mr. Speaker, I will read into the Record a letter from Kareem Abdul- Jabbar to the House of Representatives:   ``After 20 years as a player in the National Basketball Association  with the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers, which included  winning six NBA Championships as well as an equal number of Most  Valuable Player awards, I had the honor to be inducted in 1995 into the  Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.   ``To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Naismith Memorial  Basketball Hall of Fame, Congressmen Richard E. Neal, Andy Barr, and  Mike Kelly have sponsored legislation to authorize the U.S. Mint to  issue limited-edition commemorative coins for sale to the public in  2019. Proceeds from the coins' sale will go to help continue the  impressive archival and educational efforts of the Basketball Hall of  Fame for years to come, all at no cost to the taxpayer.   ``The Basketball Hall of Fame preserves the history of the game and  celebrates the very best of the sport at all the levels it is played.  The museum in Springfield, Massachusetts, honors women and men players  who have achieved greatness, exemplary coaches, referees, and other  major contributors to the sport. It attracts 6 million visitors a year,  who see hundreds of thousands of historic artifacts and memorabilia  spanning the past 125 years of basketball.   ``As a Hall of Famer, I am very passionate about the work they do to  not only preserve and honor, but also grow the game of basketball. It  is because of this I am respectfully requesting your support and  cosponsorship of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame  Commemorative Coin Act, H.R. 1235.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 2519, legislation that calls for the  issuance of a commemorative coin in honor of the 100th anniversary of  The American Legion, a distinguished organization that works tirelessly  in communities across the Nation to serve our veterans and those still  in the Armed Forces.   Since being chartered by Congress following the First World War, The  American Legion has played a pivotal role in the lives of so many  servicemembers and their families, always stepping up and lending a  hand to those who need it most. For example, The American Legion  provides key services, such as healthcare claims assistance for  veterans and job fairs. They support targeted efforts to meet the needs  of homeless veterans.   The American Legion also supports military personnel and their  families through the provision of financial assistance and comfort  items for hospitalized veterans and, also, dedicated funds to support  the needs of youth at risk.   Over its history, The American Legion has also advocated and played a  leading role in securing the passage of key laws that better the lives  of our servicemembers, such as the landmark GI Bill, as well as the  Veterans' Reassurance Act and the Post-911 Veteran Education Assistance  Act.   In addition to honoring and raising awareness of the important work  of The American Legion, the legislation before us will also help raise  small sums that will help it carry out its tremendous work and advance  American values. Specifically, surcharge proceeds raised through the  sale of the coin provided in this bill will allow The American Legion  to advance the interests of those who have served in uniform and ensure  they receive the proper healthcare and disability benefits earned  through military service; promote the importance of and caring for  those who are still serving in the Armed Forces; promote the patriotic  values, morals, culture, and citizenship of the United States; and  provide support for at-risk children and activities that nurture their  development.   This overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation has the support of more  than 350 Members of the House and has already received the unanimous  support of the United States Senate, where the legislation passed by  voice vote.   For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in the passage  of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal).     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).
