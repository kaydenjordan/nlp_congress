 Mr. Speaker, in times like this, it is  easy to understand why we have a social safety net.   Today, 6 million more Americans are on food stamps than were in  February. Now, SNAP encourages work and education. Those are the  critical ingredients in upward mobility. And by design, those  requirements are flexible enough to account for difficult economic  times.   Despite that flexibility, the majority is using this appropriations  process to prohibit future administrations from more effectively  encouraging work and education.   Now, yes, we are in difficult economic times, but as our economy  recovers, work and education will be even more important. By setting  aside that emphasis, we are not improving our country. We are not  reducing dependence. We are not improving economic opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to reconsider.
