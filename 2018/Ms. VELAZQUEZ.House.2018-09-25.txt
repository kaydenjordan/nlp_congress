 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6348, the Small  Business ACE Act.   This important legislation updates SBA's outdated real estate  appraisal threshold for the 504 loan program. It is vital for our  country's small businesses that we keep current laws in sync with what  is going on in the commercial market.   More importantly, this commonsense fix ensures as many small business  borrowers as possible can affordably access the capital they need to  grow their businesses and create jobs.   Finally, I would like to take a moment to recognize the chairman for  his continued willingness to work across the aisle. He and his staff  have set a bipartisan tone that I think all of us on this committee can  be proud of. As a result, we are carrying out our responsibilities in a  timely manner with input from both Republican and Democratic Members.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this piece of legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), who is the ranking member on the Subcommittee  of Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access.     Mr. Speaker, in closing, with this legislation, we are  only responding to the reality of the situation in the commercial  lending market.   This is a commonsense fix with bipartisan support that will ensure  small businesses are not unfairly burdened with appraisal requirements.  Doing so allows small firms to allocate their working capital as wisely  and efficiently as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6347, the 7(a) Real Estate  Harmonization Act, which updates SBA's outdated real estate appraisal  threshold for the 7(a) loan guarantee program.   The 7(a) loan program, the SBA's flagship lending product, is a vital  source of capital for thousands of small businesses unable to secure  financing through traditional lending. Today's bill brings the 7(a)  program's real estate appraisal threshold in line with other Federal  banking regulators, namely the Fed, OCC, and FDIC. In doing so, it  eliminates the burden lenders currently face in having to meet two  different standards. I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans) for his leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bipartisan piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), who is the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This past spring, Federal banking regulators updated their threshold  level for when a State licensed or certified appraisal is required,  raising it to $500,000. In order to remain consistent with the rest of  the market, SBA's levels should match the market. This bill does this  by harmonizing the real estate appraisal threshold for the SBA's 7(a)  program with the rest of the marketplace.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6316, the Small Business  Advocacy Improvements Act.   There are nearly 30 million small businesses in the United States,  representing more than 99 percent of all businesses. These small firms  employ nearly 50 percent of all private sector employees in the U.S.  The SBA's Office of Advocacy represents an important tool for these  businesses because it is their voice that the office embodies in all  matters of government.   Clarifying the authority of advocacy to examine international  economic data and represent small business interests in international  discussions, particularly in trade negotiations, raises the ability of  small American firms to participate in a global market.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   There is no question that we need to support our small businesses  across the country, no matter their location or industry, when they are  attempting to break into international commerce. Today's bill leverages  the unique position and knowledge of the SBA's Office of Advocacy to  amplify the voice of small firms in international settings.   I commend Congressman Comer and Congresswoman Adams in taking the  important step to break down international barriers for small  entrepreneurs entering into the world of trade.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6330, the Small Business  Runway Extension Act of 2018.   Over the years, Congress has created numerous Federal programs, set- asides, tax preferences, and SBA loan programs to help small businesses  succeed. However, the advantages conferred by this program have led to  heated debate over who is truly a small business and what an acceptable  small business size standard is.   The answer is an important one, as it can be underinclusive, thereby  pushing a firm outside the standard, or it can be overinclusive,  allowing large firms to compete in these programs. The end result is  the same: small firms deprived of Federal contracting opportunities.   This bill addresses the pressure placed on those businesses not able  to compete against large entities from being prematurely placed outside  their size standard by providing a more inclusive review of 5 years of  their gross receipts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this very important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6367, the Incentivizing  Fairness in Subcontracting Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, in fiscal year 2017, the Federal Government purchased  goods and services worth over $508 billion through over 22 million  contract actions. Yet, not all this money stayed with the original  prime contractor and, instead, trickles down to subcontractors.   Subcontracts are growing in importance as an avenue for small  businesses to work with the government, so it is important that  barriers to entry are reduced. By improving the tools that exist for  small businesses to become subcontractors, today's measures will draw  in more small businesses that are not regular government contractors.   This is a critical step to expanding the industrial base and  including more small firms. Most importantly, it ensures more small  contractors have just recourse through the Office of Small and  Disadvantaged Business Utilization if payment is not received within 90  days of completion. Timely payment protects small contractors who do  not have the overhead margins to continue operating without being paid.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Lawson), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health  and Technology and sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Lawson) and his  cosponsor, Mr. Kelly, for introducing this important legislation. H.R.  6367 protects our small contractors by updating the subcontracting  goaling regime through increased flexibility and accountability.   Establishing incentives to count low-tier subcontracting awards and a  dispute process for subcontractors to utilize in the event of  nonpayment ensures a healthy Federal procurement marketplace.   Today's legislation spreads the economic power of Federal procurement  to more companies and the communities they are located.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6368, Encouraging Small  Business Innovators.   For almost 40 years, our Nation has experienced increased innovation  and job creation through the Small Business Innovation Research  program, or SBIR, and the Small Business Technology Transfer program,  or STTR. Research conducted by SBIR and STTR awardees has helped  address our country's most technological and research-based challenges  while generating tremendous economic growth and employment  opportunities.   By incentivizing more experienced SBIR/STTR companies to mentor newer  companies and rewarding mentors through a past-performance rating  increase, Congressman Espaillat's legislation positively promotes  integrating these program participants into the larger Federal  marketplace. That is why I urge Members to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Espaillat), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Espaillat) for introducing today's bill to spur increased contracting  activities in the SBIR/STTR programs, and I ask all my colleagues to  support this important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 6369, the Expanding Contracting  Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2018.   The Small Business Act sets forth a government-wide 23 percent goal  of Federal contracts that should be awarded to small businesses. Each  Federal agency is charged with setting its own small business goals  which are to reflect the maximum possible opportunity for small  businesses within that agency.   By promoting the use of sole-source contracts to small businesses,  this bill adds to the government's pool of suppliers. This results in  higher-quality goods and increased job creation for the economy as  these direct awards require the small businesses to do the majority of  the work and not subcontract out.   I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance  of my time.  [[Page H8812]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Kansas for  introducing this important legislation to provide flexibility to  contracting officers when awarding sole-source contracts.   H.R. 6369 promotes the use of sole-source contracts to small business  concerns through the SBA contracting programs by raising the dollar  threshold of these contract types to account for inflation. This bill  will make valuable strides to a more equitable playing field for small  contractors. I urge Members to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 6382, the Clarity on Small Business  Participation in Category Management Act of 2018.   Our committee has long acknowledged small businesses' critical role  in  [[Page H8813]]  the $500 billion a year Federal marketplace. When small firms are  awarded Federal contracts, the result is a win-win.   While category management is billed as the strategy to get agencies  the lowest price, we have heard the contrary in our committee, in that  more contracts are being consolidated out of the reach of small  businesses.   By requiring that contracting activity under this new regime be  reported in the annual goaling report from agencies to Congress,  today's bill protects the industrial base by creating a mechanism for  much needed accountability.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 6382, and commend Congresswoman  Adams for her work to provide accountability to the category management  regime.   I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Adams), who is the sponsor of the bill and ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight and  Regulations.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Adams) for introducing this important piece of  legislation to provide much needed oversight of small business  participation in the streamlined acquisition strategy known as category  management.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all the Members to support this important piece  of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 791, the Small Business  Innovation Protection Act of 2017.   Innovation is an indispensable element driving economic growth and  ensuring America's competitive edge in the global marketplace. In fact,  it is so important that studies show the IP industry supports an  estimated 30 percent of all jobs and contributes over $6 trillion to  U.S. GDP.   While many entrepreneurs understand the benefits of holding IP  rights, just as many do not know where to start or how to protect their  ideas overseas. The USPTO reported that just 15 percent of small  businesses that conduct overseas business understand they need to file  for IP protection abroad.   This bill addresses the problem by creating a partnership between the  two agencies best suited to take on this mission: the SBA and USPTO.   By leveraging existing IP education and training programs, and  utilizing the immense network of SBDCs, small firms will have all the  resources to better protect their interests both domestically and  internationally.  [[Page H8815]]    I applaud Senator Peters and Representative Evans for recognizing the  problem and working to advance the interests of our Nation's small  businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in line with the bills we are debating  today, this recognizes the special place small firms have in America's  economy and provides them a simple tool to protect themselves and their  ideas.   Today's bill leverages the current role of the USPTO and SBA to  educate and protect innovative entrepreneurs at home and abroad. Doing  so is paramount to remaining the global leader in innovation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the  ranking member--the chairman, Mr. Chabot, and the staff of both the  minority and the majority side. It has been a great pleasure working on  these nine bills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
