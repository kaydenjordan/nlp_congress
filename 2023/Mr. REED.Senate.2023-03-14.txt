 Madam President, service is a core American value. We take  inspiration from those who have answered the call to serve, whether in  defense of our Nation abroad or in strengthening our communities at  home. Finding common cause through service is how we will overcome the  major challenges of our time--addressing inequality, strengthening  civil society and democratic institutions, and leaving a healthy,  resilient planet to future generations. That is why I am proud to join  Congressman John Larson of Connecticut in introducing the America's  Call to Improving Opportunities Now, ACTION for National Service Act.  Our legislation calls for a historic expansion of the number of service  opportunities and an increased investment in those who serve.   The ACTION for National Service Act will honor our national value of  service, while addressing the barriers that limit citizens'  opportunities to serve. Our legislation will set us on a path to 1  million national service positions within 10 years. It will increase  the educational award so that an individual completing 2 full years of  service will earn the equivalent of 4 years of the average instate  tuition at a public college or university. Indeed, those who are  willing to serve should not be left to carry a heavy financial burden  of student loan debt. The ACTION for National Service Act will also  ease other financial barriers to service by increasing the living  allowance and eliminating the tax liability for the education awards  and living stipends. The bill calls for a robust outreach effort to  ensure that all young people will know about the many opportunities to  serve their country and their communities. It will mobilize a Civilian  Climate Corps to address the urgent needs of hardest hit communities.  Finally, the ACTION for National Service Act calls for elevating the  Corporation for National and Community Service to a Cabinet-level  Agency and establishes a National Service Foundation to leverage  private sector resources to support national service activities.   Madam President, it is time that we reinvigorate the social contract  we have with each other by elevating service as a national value. We  must also make the commitment to invest in the education and  professional development of those who are willing to sacrifice for our  Nation. Developing the talents of our most committed citizens pays  lifelong dividends. Our investment in the GI Bill not only honors our  servicemembers but also enriches our Nation. Similarly, the education  awards for those who have served through our national programs have  economic impacts beyond the individuals who earn them. That is the new  deal that the ACTION for National Service Act offers.   All AmeriCorps members take a pledge to get things done for  Americans, to make communities safer, smarter and healthier, and to  bring us together. It is a pledge we all should commit ourselves to.   I would like to thank Senators Coons, Baldwin, Brown, Blumenthal,  Duckworth, and Klobuchar for joining me as original cosponsors of the  ACTION for National Service Act and the over 40 organizations,  including Voices for National Service, States for Service Coalition,  Habitat for Humanity International, YouthBuild, Service Year, City  Year, and With Honor Action, that have endorsed this legislation. We  urge our colleagues to join us in working for its passage so we can  ensure that all who aspire to serve have the opportunity to do so.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Cramer, Mr. Tillis,          Mr. Marshall, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Scott of South          Carolina, Ms. Baldwin, Ms. Sinema, and Mr. King):   S. 786. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat  certain amounts paid for physical activity, fitness, and exercise as  amounts paid for medical care; to the Committee on Finance.
