 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise as a proud member of the Democratic  Blue Dog Coalition.   For a quarter century, the Blue Dogs in Congress have focused on  three missions: fiscal responsibility for our country, a strong  national defense, and commonsense solutions to practical problems.   We are 27 proud Democrats with democratic values. Our individual  views and votes on the broad range of issues that come before this  Congress run the gamut from progressive to moderate, centrist, and  beyond; but together, we believe that the best way forward for our  country on all of these issues is an underlying focus on fiscal  responsibility, a strong national defense, and commonsense solutions  wherever they may be found to practical problems.   Today, I wish to focus on fiscal responsibility. I do so as co-chair  with my colleague from Utah, Mr. McAdams, of the Blue Dog Task Force on  Fiscal Responsibility and Government Reform.   Let me start by saying, unfortunately, and very directly that it is  very arguable that at no point in our entire history have we operated  our Federal Government in as fiscally irresponsible a manner as we are  operating it today.   There are lots of indicia of this out there, but nowhere does this  show up more directly and stare us straight in the face than our  national debt. Let me say what that is.   Our national debt is exactly what it sounds like. It is the amount  that our Federal Government--you--owe to everyone who has loaned us  money to pay for government.   Why do we have to do that? Because we are not bringing into  government the revenues that are sufficient to match and pay for what  we are paying for out of expenses.    We are now operating with a chronic and exploding deficit, and we are  borrowing with abandon to make up the difference.   This particular chart is taken from the Congressional Budget Office.  You will not find a more nonpartisan, objective, and professional group  anywhere studying our fiscal responsibilities, our fiscal status, and  our budgets than the Congressional Budget Office. I encourage everybody  to take a look at their materials at cbo.org. This is just one of their  many publications, and it is a wealth of information:   [[Page H7141]]              CBO The Budget and Economic Outlook Fiscal Years 2019 to       2049.    They are not only responsible for what has happened today; they are  responsible for taking a look at the long-term, as any one of us would  want to do with our own budgets.   What this chart shows is outlays, or spending, on the top line and  revenues on the bottom line. In this particular chart, we are matching  outlays over time, and the timeframe here is about 15 years, against  gross domestic product, the percentage of gross domestic product.   Why is that important? It is important because one could have outlays  and revenues coming in, but the only way to match it up is, how much is  the strength of your economy overall? It is kind of like asking  yourself: Well, in my own household budget, what is my level of  spending, what is my level of borrowing, what is my level of income as  opposed to my overall financial situation?   So here we have the percentage of gross domestic product over on the  left in the vertical axis, and down here, time.   We can clearly see here that as we look out over a long, long period  of time, that if we continued on the way we are today, we would see  massive continuing spread of the two lines between expenses on the top  and revenues at the bottom.   To amplify the situation, when we take a look at where we are  currently, 2019, that dotted line right over here, that is about $1  trillion, that gap, $1 trillion in 1 year of a deficit.   So as we can see very obviously, not only are we in a very difficult  situation today, but if we do nothing about it, it will spread over  time.   Now, what actually finances that difference? Debt. We go out and  borrow it. It doesn't just arrive in the middle of the night in an  unmarked bag. It didn't just grow on the tree outside. We are operating  at a chronic and exploding deficit and borrowing to make up this  difference.   I am a returnee to Congress. I served in Congress from 2002 to 2007,  so I tend to match up my experiences then versus now. I had a 12-year  absence in between, half a generation if you want to think about it.   When I left Congress in early 2007, our national debt stood at $9  trillion. Today, our national debt stands at $22 trillion.   By the way, if you want to have a harrowing view of something, take a  look at usdebtclock.org and watch the numbers turn over about as  rapidly as anything you can see.   What you can see from studying the debt over time is an incredible  increase over here on the right side of this chart.   But $22.5 trillion today. Let's just think about that. That is  $68,300 for each and every citizen of this country, $183,000 for each  and every taxpayer. Really? 230 years in our country's history to get  to a national debt of $9 trillion, but just 12 years later, increasing  by 250 percent to $22.5 trillion?   Again, we can't just look at the absolute numbers, because they don't  tell the full story. After all, if we had a thriving economy that was  producing an incredible amount of money, some of these figures wouldn't  make as much sense.   So let's, again, take the total debt against the total gross domestic  product, again, just like any house or business would do. We can see  here that if we chart total debt against GDP--again, on the far left  side on the vertical axis, we have GDP--as a percent of GDP, and down  here, we have a period that starts at the origins of our country and  concludes in 2049, from the start of our country to 2049, you can see  the peaks right here.   Obviously, our country was in bad shape at the beginning in the  Revolutionary War and thereafter. We were just starting out as a  country. And you can see, for example, the Civil War, this peak.   Wars are times when we have to borrow money. Wars are times that are  very, very difficult for economies, and obviously our expenses are up  and people have needs, and during that period, we borrow money. We  always try, or have always tried, to pay it back down because we don't  know when the next emergency will come along.   We can see another peak here, World War I. We see the Great  Depression right here, the Great Depression and Franklin Roosevelt's  New Deal, which was financed with borrowing. And then, of course, the  tragedy of World War II, the absolute peak of our debt versus our gross  domestic product, right there.   And why not? Our world was at war. Our economy was in a shambles. We  had to finance that war.   Not only did we finance that war, we financed the entire recovery of  the world, the Marshall Plan, in so many ways. We rebuilt our cities.  We rebuilt the national highway system. We incurred that largely  through debt. This was the highest point of our debt to date.   We see, again, some peaks that were related to great recessions and  downturns in our economy where we had to borrow for a little while,  then we came back down. And then we came to the last 15 to 20 years.                                time  1415    Up until this point, we operated fairly responsibly. By 15 to 20  years, we abandoned fiscal responsibility and started down a road of  accelerating debt, for the most part unrelated to wars, other than for  Iraq and Afghanistan, which definitely had a consequence for our  national debt, but mostly a result of a failure in this body and the  administration to balance budgets as we went along.   Here we are in 2017, 2018, and 2019. What is scarier than anything  else is the CBO's projection of where it is going over time: out the  roof, straight up.   We can see that this is not a partisan issue. In this particular  graph, the percent of GDP is over on the left axis, and the bottom  vertical axis is over time. In more recent history, the postwar period  by Presidencies, we have Democrats in blue and Republicans in red.   We see over here President Truman in the late 1940s had a high  threshold of debt-to-GDP, a little over 100 percent. Then, of course,  it came down after that as we recovered. It went up in the era of some  of our Great Recessions and, of course, our wars.   Then, we had the period when we did the best, which was an evolution  from President Clinton into President Bush, which was the last time we  balanced our budget.   Then, there is that spike starting with President Bush through the  last Presidency and, especially, off the current Presidency into an  ascending column, which is a projection from the Congressional Budget  Office.   These are scary projections because the CBO projects that if we do  nothing, we will see our debt climb to around 144 percent of GDP within  a couple of decades.   Where does that rank us in the world? After all, we have had other  governments that have had high debt. We have had other governments that  have collapsed. We have had other governments for which their budget  problems have caught up with them. Let's take a look at that.   This chart shows the period projected from the current year out only  5 years. It asks the question: What is the growth in our debt-to-GDP as  compared to the rest of the world? How fast are we growing in our debt  versus the rest of the world?   Unfortunately, the line on the right is us. We project that our debt- to-GDP will grow 11 percent over the next couple of years.   The next line is Italy. We have Korea and Japan, but the rest of the  world seems to be getting their growth under control. Some of these  countries are recovering from recessions, but some of these countries  just have sound economic practices.   The embarrassing thing about this chart, the scary thing about this  chart, is that we are not the world's leader. We are the world's loser,  in terms of controlling our national debt.   Why should we care about all of this? One of the questions asked  sometimes is: Why does debt matter?   I think the first and foremost obvious answer is that debt costs  something. It is not free. If we borrow money, we pay interest. That is  what everybody who loans us money expects. They expect to be paid some  interest. These interest payments accelerate rapidly in times of  accelerating debt.   We see here a projection, again based on figures from the  Congressional  [[Page H7142]]  Budget Office, of interest spending over time, the next 10 years, in  this particular case. We see that, today, we have interest of somewhere  around $400 billion a year but accelerating at a very rapid rate over  the next decade, up to close to $1 trillion a year.   The red line is a scenario that is very likely if we do not make some  tough decisions. That gets us even higher.   This is the actual trend that we are looking at. That is a lot of  money to be paying just for interest.   To make matters worse, try to compare that level of interest spending  against some of our other spending.   In this particular chart, we see this line is our interest spending,  kept relatively modest until recently but then accelerating very  rapidly, as was indicated in my prior chart, to the levels out to 2029  that are truly scary. That is not the scary part, if that is not scary  enough.   This line is our total spending on our children. What do we do to  take care of the children of our country? That is our spending line.  Interest is just crossing it right now. This is our total defense  spending projected out over time with interest crossing over.   What this shows is that we are about to pay, in a very short period  of time, if we don't do anything, far more money in basic interest on  our national debt than we are spending on our children and our defense.  That is an inexcusable situation for us to be in.   The first basic problem is that we crowd out spending for other  Federal purposes, which forces us, by the way, to borrow more, which  forces us to have higher debt, which forces us to pay more interest.  Everybody who has been in a business or a personal situation knows  this.   The second basic problem with that is why should we care about debt-- national security. Where does this money come from? Who is lending us  this money?   Two-fifths of our interest payments go overseas, two-fifths of the  people in this world who are loaning us money. Two-fifths of our total  debt is loaned to us, basically, by other countries. Other countries,  26 percent.   This is the line that is scary: China, up to 7 percent now and  growing. Japan, okay, fine, we welcome Japan loaning money to us. But  on balance, I would rather the blue be the blue rather than owing the  money to other countries because who knows what is going to happen over  the next 10 or 20 years or generations.   This is, obviously, not just an issue of our own fiscal stability,  but it is a question of national security.   Another question of national security is that we need this money in  case we get into other situations in the world, hopefully not, but  prepare for the situation where we may have to have massive increases  in defense spending over the next generation.    These are areas where we have traditionally tried to pay down our  debt so that we can borrow back up to finance these additional  expenditures without destroying our economy. Yet, when we borrow in  good times to finance even larger Federal spending, then we have very  little safety net to be able to borrow in bad times.   That is not just a matter of budgetary stability. That is a matter of  national security.   Finally, why should it matter? Economic damage. There is a school out  there that is trying to justify more debt, which is largely not agreed  to by most economists. Most economists agree that, over time, large  levels of debt, large levels of interest payments, drive up basic  interest rates. They drive up basic interest rates, and that is bad for  the economy. They drive up inflation, and that is bad for the economy.   They lead to a situation where the markets out there--the people who  are loaning us money, the people who are relying on the United States  for its full faith and credit--start to doubt our basic fiscal  solvency. They start to not only loan us money, but they start to  charge us more interest, and that causes an economic problem.   Finally, it is just bad budgetary practice to skate too closely on  thin ice.   This is why we should care: because our interest payments are  crowding out spending; because it is a national security issue; and  because, over time, it is an economic issue.   How did we get into this mess? Well, obviously, we are spending more  than we are taking in. Our long-term deficit buildup and short-term tax  reduction and spending increases are really the issue.   This chart is an illustration, again based on CBO information, of  where our deficits are coming from today. When we are talking about the  total amount of deficits closing in on $1 trillion, we see that absent  recent legislation--we are talking about just the last 5 years or so-- we had a chronic deficit of close to $400 billion a year. That is  pretty bad since, if we take $400 billion and times it by 5 years, all  of a sudden, we are at $2 trillion of debt.   But, then, we made major mistakes from a fiscal responsibility  perspective in the last few years.   First of all, we had tax extenders that were not paid for. We will  get into that. We had tax credits, tax reductions, and tax rates that  were extended without accounting on the other side for the spending.   We had a major tax bill, which is still debated in this Chamber as to  whether it was the right idea or not. What is indisputable about that  tax bill was that it drove incredibly increasing deficits and  incredibly and rapidly increasing debt.   Then, finally, we had a budget agreement, last year, to raise the  amount of spending. There is nothing wrong with raising the amount of  spending, per se, if it is a public judgment and a policy judgment that  that is the best thing for our country. What is wrong is to pretend  that there is no consequence to our deficit, debt, and national fiscal  policy.   What do we do about it?   By the way, I want to go back to that point for a second. We are not  debating here whether our government should be bigger or smaller. We  are not debating here whether taxes should be higher or lower. We can  have that debate. It has been going on, after all, for 250 years and  even before that back to the Colonies. We have always talked about how  big government should or shouldn't be, how much we should or shouldn't  spend through government. We just had that debate here on this floor  today.   We have always talked about the overall level of taxes. Should they  be higher? Should they be lower? Should we have high taxes to pay for  spending? Should they be lower to generate economic growth? Those are  good, solid policy decisions to be made.   That is not what we are talking about here. What we are talking about  here is the fiscal result when we don't balance spending and revenues,  the result when we don't balance spending and revenues.   We can choose to have high spending, but if we don't generate the  revenue for that, then we are going to end up with incredible deficits  and debt. We can choose to have lower taxes, but if we don't adjust the  spending at the same time, we are going to end up with high deficits  and debt. It just makes perfect sense.   That is all that we are talking about here. We are willing and able  to have the debate over the size of government and taxes.   Again, within our Blue Dog Caucus, we have disagreements on that. But  where we have centralization of agreement is in managing the  consequence of that debate and having it be an honest debate, not a  debate that pulls the wool over our fellow citizens' eyes on the  consequences.   What do we do about it? Well, I think, first of all, we start talking  about it again. It is really hard. Twenty years ago, in the great times  when we actually did balance the budget in the late 1990s and the early  2000s, public sentiment was high on deficits and debt. People cared  about this. People understood the risk.   Then, all of a sudden, politicians stopped talking about it. They  did, on both sides of the aisle, what many of us do when faced with a  major issue: We deny it. We don't want to acknowledge it. It is too  much trouble. We don't want to say that when we cut taxes and don't  adjust spending, there is a consequence for our deficit and the debt.  We don't want to say the reverse of that. We want to tell everybody  that everything is okay. After all, we can have our cake and eat it,  too.   I don't want to go back to my district and say, well, I can't vote  for a tax reduction because it is going to blow our deficit and debt.  [[Page H7143]]    This is an insidious situation. The consequences of deficits and debt  are not apparent right up front. They don't catch up with us for a long  time. But I think we all know, deep down, that we have a problem and  that is not true.                                time  1430    And the second thing we have to do, at some point, is simply make a  plan and implement it. And that is what our Democratic Blue Dog  Coalition has done and will try to do going forward.   We have tried to come up with a blueprint for fiscal responsibility,  which today, we endorsed and released. And these are a series of points  that we believe need to be pursued in order to have some chance at  fiscal responsibility and sustainability over time.   From that perspective, I am very pleased that I am joined today by my  colleague from Utah (Mr. McAdams), my co-chair of the Blue Dog Task  Force on Fiscal Responsibility and Government Reform, to share his  views and to outline some of our agenda items.   I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. McAdams).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much, and I am  privileged to be his co-chair.   Would the gentleman engage me in a colloquy on a few of the issues  that he touched on?    I yield to the gentleman from Utah.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Let's talk about his  proposed balanced budget amendment, by the way, of which I am a proud  cosponsor.   Some people criticized the balanced budget amendment which would have  to be ratified throughout our country, as an overly restrictive  mechanism, especially in times of national emergency.   As the gentleman's balanced budget amendment is crafted, is there  flexibility to borrow money and to deficit spend in times of genuine  national need?   I yield to the gentleman from Utah.    So we always have the ability to override the basic  provisions with that balanced budget amendment in Congress, or where we  believe that we do have to borrow that money. This is just a mechanism  to introduce the same fiscal discipline that a well-run business or  household has to follow?   I yield to the gentleman.    As, by the way, is the case with 49 out of 50 of our  States, who either have a similar balanced budget amendment in their  constitution or by statute.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman made reference to the fact  that he was a mayor, and I made the comment to the gentleman once, and  I believe it, that of all of the public officials I have ever worked  with throughout the country, I think mayors understand fiscal  responsibility the best.   The gentleman made reference to the fact that he functioned under a  balanced budget as a mayor. Was there any magic to that? How did the  gentleman do that? He had a requirement to do that, so what did he do?   I yield to the gentleman from Utah.    Madam Speaker, so to that point, my experience in Hawaii,  where we have had a balanced budget for a long time--and I was a State  legislator--so I had knock-down, drag-out fights over all this kind of  stuff, whether it be to increase spending, or tax reductions, or tax  increases. But it was always against the backdrop that it had to  balance.   My sense was always that the folks that we represented understood  that that presented us with a series of tough choices, and they  understood that in the big picture, the tough choices that we had to  make as a result of a balanced budget, were for the better, the  overall, long-term, big picture fiscal health, economic health and  social health of Hawaii.   Did the gentleman have that experience in Utah?   I yield to the gentleman from Utah.    I think what the gentleman is saying in a very gracious  Utah way is that the lack of a balanced budget where we always have the  recourse to just borrow money and kick some cans down the road  disincentivizes the efficient and effective expenditure of government  funds, of taxpayer funds. After all, if there is waste in that  expenditure, there is a safety valve there, whereas a balanced budget  drives a certain discipline.    One other point that the gentleman made that I think bears  further discussion is the gentleman's reference to paygo. Of course, we  throw  [[Page H7145]]  ``paygo'' around here all the time. Sometimes, people's eyes kind of  blank out when we talk about paygo.   Can the gentleman talk a little bit more about the simplistic and  basic approach of paygo? What does it mean? What is its effect on the  work that we do?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah.    In other words, not financed by additional debt, which  would have the result of driving up the deficit, the debt, and interest  payments?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah.    Let's take a pretty straightforward example. Let's say that  we wanted to reduce taxes.   By the way, we can acknowledge there is a debate about whether  reducing taxes does, in fact, generate revenue or not. But for these  purposes and especially the recent large tax cut, we simply did not see  a return on revenues from those tax cuts.   But let's just stick with the fact that if we reduce taxes, then we  have to either increase another tax and/or reduce government spending  somewhere to be able to have a budget-neutral, a deficit-neutral  outcome.   Is that correct?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah.    Conversely, if we want to increase Federal spending, we  have to either reduce some other Federal spending or increase taxes,  correct?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah.    The gentleman said that the House rules already provided  for paygo. So why are we here so concerned about it?    Essentially, we have a rule that is honored in the breach?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah.    Of course. One of the elements of our Blue Dog fiscal  responsibility blueprint is to tighten up the rules on paygo so that we  stop the bleeding on debt and deficit spending.    Again, I am honored to be the gentleman's co-chair, and I  thank the gentleman for adding to our debate today.   Madam Speaker, I want to make one other point before I close on this  subject. I want to emphasize one of the points made by my colleague  from Utah. He talked about restoring the budget and appropriations  process. This starts to be real inside baseball.   Congress goes through a process establishing a budget, which is the  overall outline of Federal spending for the next year--because we do  everything on a yearly basis, for the most part--and then passing  appropriations bills that are consistent with that budget. In other  words, we make the big picture decision upfront in a budget, and then  we have our appropriations bills that must match that budget.   In what we refer to here as regular order, what we would do is first  have a budget resolution that passes the House, passes the Senate, and  is agreed to by both the House and the Senate so that we know what our  roadmap is. Then, we would take each of the areas of government that  needs appropriations every year.   The way we do it is, there are 12 separate appropriations bills, and  we would individually pass each of those bills consistent with the  budget. We would do all of that by October 1, which is when our fiscal  year starts.   We would call that regular order. That would be quite regular order  for any business and any personal budget.   The last time we followed regular order was 1995. The last time we  went through a full budget process, an individual appropriations bill  process, was 1995. And that has simply thrown our Federal fiscal house  into disarray. We saw that with an incredibly tragic and unnecessary  Federal Government shutdown just late last year and earlier this year.  That was in part to be laid at the feet of our failure to follow basic  budgetary, fiscal, and appropriations procedures.   We have tried, on a bipartisan basis, to fix this. In fact, just last  year, we had a bicameral, bipartisan committee set up to reform the  rules of the House and the Senate as to the budget and the  appropriations process.   I want to read a passage from that committee's report. This was the  Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform,  Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate.   Here is a quote from the committee's report in late 2018: ``There  have been numerous breakdowns in the budget process in recent decades.  Fiscal year 1995 was the last time Congress passed a conference report  on the budget resolution followed by passage of 13 separate  appropriations bills before the beginning of the new fiscal year.''   We now do 12.   ``Continuing resolutions, CRs, have become the status quo for funding  the Federal Government, demonstrating Congress' failure to complete its  work on time. CRs create uncertainty for agencies and the American  people.''   By the way, I stop to describe a CR as a resolution that says: Sorry,  we can't figure out what to do in this next fiscal year. So while we  are trying to figure it out, all we are going to do is continue the  spending the way it was in the last fiscal year, no adjustment of  spending levels, no adjustment of priorities, and no update for current  situations. Let's just kick this can down the road.   That is a CR.   Back to the report.   ``In many years, there has been concern that parts of the government  would have to shut down due to the failure to enact even stopgap  appropriations, and shutdowns of various durations have actually  occurred. In the 115th Congress alone,'' the most recent Congress,  ``there have been two government shutdowns. Whether it is Federal  employees being furloughed, national parks shutting down, adverse  effects on defense and law enforcement, shutdowns inflict severe damage  and uncertainty on the Nation's fiscal state. Additionally, multiple  JSCBAPR members expressed frustration regarding the lack of legislative  tools available for Congress to address national needs or the national  debt in a bipartisan manner.''   The committee's report was submitted very, very late in the last  Congress, so there was really not enough time to debate it fully and to  proceed, but the report certainly remains highly relevant together with  recommended legislation. Our Blue Dog Caucus believes that reform along  those lines is necessary.   Finally--and I don't speak now for the Blue Dogs, but I do speak for  myself and, I believe, many individual Blue Dogs and perhaps others--we  have another mechanism available to us, a mechanism that we shouldn't  have to follow but that sometimes may be the only way to cut through  the political dialogue and the fears of people to make tough decisions.  That is to develop independent commissions outside Congress of experts,  hopefully on a neutral basis and hopefully on a nonpartisan or  bipartisan basis, who are charged with reviewing and making decisions  on revenue and spending matters and reporting their results back to  Congress, hopefully for an up-or-down vote. If Congress gets the  opportunity to pick at a balanced report once it comes back, then it  defeats the purpose of the commission to start with. Simpson-Bowles was  one very well-known commission that failed, and there have been others.   It is certainly conceivable that if we can't get our act in order in  Congress--  [[Page H7146]]  as we should be able to do, and as I believe the American people want  and think we should do--then we need to resort to some other mechanism  to get this House in order.   Finally, we need public support. We need to get people involved again  in this issue.   As I said earlier, the late 1990s and early 2000s were the height of  public concern over deficits and debt, and it resulted in external  pressure to Congress to balance our budget.   A succession of two Presidents with bipartisan Congresses, by the  way, got it balanced. The public demanded it; we delivered.   Now, it is almost a forgotten issue. It doesn't even rank in the top  10 of major issues. We have many, many major issues. But, Madam  Speaker, I will tell you one thing, the issues that are in the top 10,  our solutions to those issues will be crippled if we don't get our  basic fiscal house in order.   In conclusion, the Blue Dogs believe that we are, in fact, in a  national crisis. We stand ready to work with anyone and everyone toward  commonsense, mainstream solutions.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 2 o'clock and 55 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Friday, July 19, 2019, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
