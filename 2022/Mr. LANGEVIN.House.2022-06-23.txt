 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the Pell grant, a Federal program named after my mentor,  role model, and friend, the late Senator Claiborne Pell, who proudly  served Rhode Island for 40 years in the United States Senate.   Senator Pell was one of Rhode Island's finest statesmen who embodied  the highest ideals of public service. He was also a fierce advocate of  education and deeply believed in supporting the next generation of  American leaders. In fact, one of the reasons I am here today is  because of Senator Pell.   When I interned in his office as a 19-year-old college student,  Senator Pell placed his faith in me, and it was one of the things that  inspired me to run for office myself.   It is only fitting that the grant program which bears Senator Pell's  name is now the single largest source of Federal grant aid for  undergraduate students.   Last year, over 6 million students received $27 billion in Pell  grants to help them complete a college degree. Pell grants have made  higher education accessible and affordable for tens of millions of  Americans, which I know made Senator Pell enormously proud.   Mr. Speaker, it has been 13 years since we lost Senator Pell, but his  remarkable legacy lives on.                            ____________________
