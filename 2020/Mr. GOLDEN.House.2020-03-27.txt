 Mr. Speaker, this morning, thousands of Mainers are  staying home and doing their part to bend the curve in the fight  against the coronavirus.   But thousands of healthcare professionals, shipbuilders, grocery  store employees, and many others deemed essential got up this morning  and went to work. They will do their jobs in this difficult time,  despite the risk, because people depend on them. Congress shouldn't be  any different.   We are about to vote on a bill in response to the pandemic sweeping  through our Nation and the growing economic crisis that follows it.   Nearly 900 pages long, my office received the text a little over 24  hours ago. I will be honest, many of us are still working to understand  this bill in full, portions drafted by lobbyists with loopholes you  might drive a Mack truck through.   Only time will tell whether this behemoth will fully deliver on its  economic promises. It won't fully stop the deepening recession. Only  the loosening of the tourniquet will let the blood flow back into our  economy, but that is not yet an option.   I will, however, support this relief act. It is not a stimulus. It is  an emergency relief act providing $100 billion to hospitals.
