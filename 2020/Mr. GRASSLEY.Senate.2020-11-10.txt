 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business, please.    Tomorrow is Veterans Day. Since the end of World War I,  Americans have taken this day to recognize the sacrifices made by our  veterans, and they did that in service to our country.   For the third consecutive year, my office recorded the oral histories  of Iowa's veterans for the Library of Congress's Veterans History  Project. I would urge some of my colleagues to take a look at that and  see if they can help add a lot of their veterans from their respective  States to the history project at the Library of Congress.   We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude for their patriotism, and it  is vitally important to record the stories of veterans so that future  generations will always remember their service and the sacrifice that  it takes to preserve our freedom.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
