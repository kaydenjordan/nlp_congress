There was no objection.   The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is modified.   Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Griffith) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the consideration of what  was two amendments that we just merged into one because they went hand- in-glove.   My amendment restores critical funding to three additional  Appalachian States, the same number of States currently funded by the  Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, for the reclamation of abandoned mine  lands in conjunction with economic and community development and reuse  goals.   Now, let me explain the program quickly.   This was the brainchild of Chairman Rogers a couple of years back,  and what the idea was, originally, when they did the Abandoned Mine  Land program, you could just restore the land. They came up with the  concept in the hard-hit devastated areas of central Appalachia that we  should not only allow it to be a restoration of the land, but that that  land could be used and looked at as an economic purpose, a reuse the  community could use for community development or economic development,  and that was important.   Funding for these reclamation grants was first established in fiscal  year 2016, but it was originally provided only to the three Appalachian  States with the greatest amount of unfunded reclamation needs.   Unfortunately, that didn't, of course, reach all the States, and so  last year, an additional three States were added, those States being  Virginia, Ohio, Alabama, the original three being Pennsylvania, West  Virginia, and Kentucky.   This year, as things were working through, Virginia, Ohio, and  Alabama were not currently included. My amendment basically makes sure  they are included. We have worked with the team on the Appropriations  Committee to word it correctly. We think we have got it worded  correctly so that we now have the ability to add in all three States.   I think this is important. Folks often say to us: Those of you in  coal country, in central Appalachia, need to transition your economy.  Well, we can't transition our economy if we have huge blocks of land  which we can't use because they are unusable due to prior acts that  left them in a condition where we know they need to be reclaimed, but  you can't reclaim them looking at economic development.   So this is a way to retool. Chairman Rogers came up with it. We would  like to extend it to the other States that would be greatly helped by  this, the three that I mentioned previously, Ohio, Alabama, and  Virginia, and that is what my amendments do.   I would ask all to support this amendment to help those areas that  are economically devastated in central Appalachia and expand on a  program which is already showing signs of success.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1800    Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose an amendment that takes  more money away from the EPA.  [[Page H7142]]    As I mentioned before, this bill already severely cuts the EPA's main  operating account by $240 million. The air we breathe and the water we  drink are endangered by the policy decisions that are being made in  this bill. The consequences will be felt in communities across the  Nation. I understand, for many, cutting the EPA is an easy target, but  I want my colleagues to understand what this amendment would actually  be cutting, if adopted.   This account funds programs that are important to both sides of the  aisle, including permitting for construction projects across the  country, toxic risk prevention, parts of the successful Brownfields  Program, and pesticide licensing.   So I understand that the money would direct more funding to States in  Appalachia. Appalachia is suffering. They are suffering from the raging  environmental harm caused by coal mining. But, unfortunately, I cannot  support any deeper cuts to the EPA.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to help us transition  the economy in central Appalachian support to the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified,  offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith).   The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.
