 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it was very exciting to have Maile Pearl  with us on the floor just moments ago. It was certainly the first time  I have seen a little baby on the floor of the Senate and may be a good  symbol for the work the Senate will be doing in the future for the  children of the United States of America.   Congratulations to Senator Tammy Duckworth and her husband, Bryan  Bowlsbey, for this miraculous addition to American citizenry. We are  looking forward to seeing little Maile as she grows and prospers in all  of the chapters of her life ahead.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Quinn  Nouguier, an intern on my team, be granted privileges of the floor for  the remainder of the day.
