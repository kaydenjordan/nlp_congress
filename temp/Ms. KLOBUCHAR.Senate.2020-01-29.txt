 Mr. Chief Justice, I submit a question to the desk  directed to the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question is from Senator Klobuchar  to the House managers:         I was on the trial committee for the last impeachment trial       in the Senate, which involved Judge Thomas Porteous, who was       ultimately removed. During that time, the Senate trial       committee heard from 26 witnesses, 17 of whom had not       previously testified in the House. What possible reason could       there be for allowing 26 witnesses in a judicial impeachment       trial and hearing none for a President's trial?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, as you know, I am  quite familiar with the Porteous impeachment. Someone asked me the last  time I tried a case. The answer is probably 30 years ago except for the  impeachment of Thomas Porteous, when I last spent some quality time  with you.   There is no difference in terms of the Constitution. I would say that  the need for witnesses in the impeachment trial of a President of the  United States is a far more compelling circumstance than the  impeachment of a judge. Now, you might say, well, in the impeachment of  a judge, how is it possible that the time of the Senate could be  occupied by calling witnesses; that, as precious as your time is, we  would occupy your time calling dozens of witnesses, but in the  impeachment of a President, it is not worth the time; it is too much of  an imposition.   Again, I would argue that the imperative of calling judges and having  a fair trial when we are adjudicating the guilt of a President of the  United States is paramount.   Now, we have always argued that the trial should be fair to the  President and the American people. And, yes, it is a big deal to  impeach a President and remove that President from office. It is also a  big deal if you leave in place a President when the House has proven  that President has committed impeachable misconduct and is likely to  [[Page S685]]  continue committing it--because there is no doubt, I think, from the  record that not only did the President solicit Russian interference in  2016 but solicited Ukraine's interference in the upcoming election,  solicited China's interference--as my colleague just said, had Rudy  Giuliani, his personal agent, in Ukraine doing the same kind of thing  just last month.   And Senator, in response to that question, isn't it dispositive that  Giuliani, the personal agent of the President, is running this Biden  operation rather than any department of government? Isn't that really  dispositive of whether this was policy or politics? And I think the  answer is yes.   Giuliani has made it abundantly clear: I am not here doing foreign  policy. That is the President's own lawyer. I am not here to do foreign  policy.   Now, Professor Dershowitz just made a rather astounding argument that  an investigation of Joe Biden that is unwarranted, unmerited, suddenly  becomes warranted if he runs for President. Now, he posited that in the  President's second term, but it doesn't matter whether he is in his  first term or his second term. An illegitimate investigation of Joe  Biden doesn't somehow become legitimate because he is running for  President unless you view your interests as synonymous with the  Nation's interests.   I think it is the most profound conflict for a President of one  party, whether he is running for reelection or not, to suggest that all  of a sudden an investigation of a leading candidate in the opposite  party is justified because now they are running for President. I mean,  you really have to step aside from what is going on to imagine that  anyone could make that argument; that running for office, running for  President now, means that you are a more justified target of  investigation than when you weren't. That cannot be. That cannot be.  But that is essentially what is being argued here.   To get to conclude, Senator, the case for witnesses in a Presidential  impeachment where either, on the one side, you remove a President or,  on the other side, you leave in place a President who may pose a  continuing risk to the country is far more compelling to take the time  to hear from witnesses than a corrupt Louisiana judge who only impacts  those who come before his court.   All of us come before the court of the American people.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Montana.
