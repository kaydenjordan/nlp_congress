 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his stalwart support for justice in policing. Thank you  so much for bringing this legislation to the floor, to you, Mr. Nadler,  members of the Judiciary Committee, and the Congressional Black Caucus.   Madam Speaker, exactly one month ago, George Floyd spoke his final  words, ``I can't breathe,'' and changed the course of history in our  Nation. I will never forget that, nor will many others. I will also  never forget his calling out for his mama right there at the end.   Since that horrific day in Minneapolis, Americans from every walk of  life and corner of the country have been marching, protesting, and  demanding that this moment of national agony become a moment of  national action.   Today, by passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, the House  is honoring his life and the lives of all killed by police brutality by  saying never again and taking action.   The Congress and the country are well served by the leadership of the  Congressional Black Caucus, the conscience of the Congress, as we call  it, with   John Lewis and so many other leaders, which has been  developing these reforms contained in this legislation for decades, 49  years to be exact.   We are blessed to be led by CBC Chair Karen Bass, who brings 47 years  of leadership advocating for an end to police brutality. She brings  extraordinary gentility, grace, and strength to this fight.   As you know, Madam Speaker, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act  will fundamentally transform the culture of policing to address  systemic racism, curb police brutality, and save lives, as it puts an  end to shielding police from accountability.   We don't paint all police with the same brush. But for those who need  to be painted with that brush, we need to take the action contained in  this bill.   This legislation contains bold, unprecedented reforms, including  banning chokeholds. People say, ``Well, why can't you compromise with  the other side?'' Well, they don't ban chokeholds. We ban chokeholds.  So are we supposed to come up with a number of chokeholds we will agree  with? No. We ban chokeholds. Stopping no-knock warrants on drug  offenses. Ending the court-created qualified immunity doctrine that is  a barrier to holding police officers accountable for wrongful conduct.   Our distinguished chairman enumerated all of these things just now.  Combatting racial profiling, mandating data collection, including body  and dashboard cameras, strengthening independent investigations of  police departments, creating a publicly accessible national police  misconduct registry.   Publicly accessible, that is what the Senate bill does not do. We  will take the data and keep it to ourselves? Well, what is the use?   And establishing strong new standards for policing.   This week, a coalition of more than 135 leading civil and human  rights groups sent a letter stating their opposition to the Senate  bill. We have our bill; they have their bill.   And this is what 135 leading civil rights groups had to say:         The Senate act is an inadequate response to the decades of       pain, hardship, and devastation that Black people have and       continue to endure as a result of systemic racism and lax       policies that fail to hold police accountable for misconduct.        This bill falls woefully short of the comprehensive reform       needed to address the current policing crisis and achieve       meaningful law enforcement accountability.        It is deeply problematic to meet this moment with a menial       incremental approach that offers more funding to police and       few policies to effectively address the constant loss of       Black lives at the hands of police.        Passing watered-down legislation that fails to remedy the       actual harms resulting in the loss of life is a moral       statement that is inconsistent with a genuine belief that       Black lives matter.        Further, any attempt to amend or salvage the Senate act       will only serve to check the box and claim reform, when in       actuality no reform has occurred to combat police misconduct       and to protect Black lives.    135 leading civil and human rights organizations said that.   House Democrats hoped to work in a bipartisan way to create  meaningful change to end the epidemic of racial injustice and police  brutality. However, it is disappointing that the Senate GOP has ignored  the voices of hundreds of thousands of people peacefully calling out  for justice and progress, day in and day out, week in and week out, for  the past month.    The Senate proposal mimics words of real reform but takes no action  to make any difference. It is inadequate and unworthy of support.   During this moment of anguish, which we want to turn into action, it  would be a moral failure to accept anything less than transformational  change.   But it is clear that the White House has zero interest in real  change. Yesterday, the White House went so far as to issue a veto  threat, stating that the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act would  deter good people from pursuing careers in law enforcement.   No, Mr. President, good people are pursuing careers in law  enforcement. Banning chokeholds is not going to deter good people from  pursuing careers in law enforcement. That is a White House concern.   Hundreds of people are dying. Vetoing this will make the White House  what? Ignoring of this epidemic?   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is a bill that American  people are insisting on, that this moment in history demands. And what  a shameful, bad-faith act to dismiss the will of the public out of  hand.   Two weeks ago, Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd,  testified so beautifully and powerfully before Mr. Nadler's committee,  the Judiciary Committee, on this legislation. He said that day: ``The  people marching in the streets are telling you enough is enough. Be the  leaders that this country, this world, needs.'' That was his challenge  to us.                                time  1415    Then, he said: ``George's name means something. . . . If his death  ends up changing the world for the better, and I think it will''--I  think it has--``then he died as he lived. It is on you to make sure his  death is not in vain.''   Today, with this bill, we have the opportunity and the obligation to  ensure that George Floyd's death and the death of so many are not in  vain. Their lives matter, Black lives matter.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote on the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act. Justice is for George by passing this bill.   Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for all of his  leadership and work on these issues, not only today and this past month  but over time. I urge an ``aye'' vote.
