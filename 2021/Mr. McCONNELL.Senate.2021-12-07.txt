 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the last time Washington Democrats  pushed through a huge change that disrupted families' arrangements, it  earned President Obama the ``Lie of the Year'' award.   Democrats insisted that if you liked your healthcare plan, you could  keep your healthcare plan. It turned out that was totally false. Their  reckless government takeover threw many families into chaos.   This year, many of the same Democrats want to write a sequel. They  want to ram through a radical, reckless, multitrillion-dollar taxing- and-spending spree between now and Christmas. And a huge part of their  bill would completely upend childcare and pre-K as they exist for  families all across our country.   If you like your childcare, you can keep your childcare. Well, buckle  up, parents. What could possibly go wrong?   The Democrats have written their toddler takeover in ways that would  turn families' finances literally upside down and make already  expensive childcare even costlier. So let's walk through how they did  it.   First, their reckless taxing-and-spending spree would make childcare  dramatically more expensive through an avalanche of new mandates,  regulations, and micromanagement--the usual Washington, DC, routine.   State and local governments are panicking about the childcare  inflation this would cause. Here in the District, as one liberal  analyst uncovered, local officials have formally estimated--listen to  this--that the per-child daycare cost for a toddler or an infant would  jump up $12,000 a year--increase the cost of childcare $12,000 a year;  $12,000 more per child per year. President Biden's inflation is coming  for daycare.   That is why the other half of their clumsy scheme is to dump  subsidies onto some families. They want to borrow and print even more  so they can  [[Page S8939]]  throw money at the same thing they have just made more expensive.   But here is where the bad idea turns literally into a terrible one.  The Democrats wouldn't help families directly. This isn't some simple  voucher that families can use as they please. My colleagues have  produced an insanely tangled scheme where the truckloads of money go  from Washington to State governments, to the childcare centers, one  leaky bucket after another.   The problems run deeper than that. Democrats want States to sign up  for badly underfunded mandates. That is the effect, because the  retirement programs would surely last forever; but, for accounting  purposes, Democrats are pretending the money stops after a decade. Many  States will not be keen to be socialist guinea pigs.   Then there is the fact that the assistance is doled out in incredibly  confusing and uneven ways. The subsidies start and stop with no rhyme  or reason.   Listen to what a left-leaning organization, the People's Policy  Project, has uncovered. They have found that, in year one, a family  that earns $1 over their State median income ``will be eligible for  zero subsidies, meaning that they will be on the hook for the entire  unsubsidized price,'' which they estimate will now cost ``at least  $13,000 per year higher than'' it does right now.   The researcher repeats himself because it is so unbelievable. Here is  the quote:         Having a family income just $1 higher than [your State's       median income] would result in you being ineligible for child       care subsidies in 2022 even as the unsubsidized price of       child care skyrockets due to the wage and other mandates in       the Democratic proposal.        This is obviously a perverse outcome and it's not clear       whether lawmakers even realize what they are about to do.    This isn't just one technical glitch. It is emblematic of how ill- conceived their whole experiment is. There are 10 problems like this on  every single page.   I should add, the families who even get to participate in the mess  I've just laid out, they are actually the lucky ones because Democrats  want Big Government to pick winners and losers among different families  who make different choices.   Many American families make one set of sacrifices so that both  parents can work full time. These are the people the Democrats are  trying to reward, although their plan fails in practice.   But Americans are allowed to have different aspirations. Some  families make different sacrifices to have a parent at home full time.  Others prefer flexible middle grounds that involve part-time work plus  in-home childcare. The Democrats' toddler takeover wouldn't give any of  them a dime--no diversity, no flexibility. Institutional daycare or  nothing. In fact, it is worse than nothing, because a family who wants  a provider to come to their house part time or wants to participate in  a neighborhood nanny share will now be stuck in an inflated market.  They will have to bid against the employers the Democrats have blessed  and subsidized.    This is the essence of what the Democratic plan would do: Big  Government and Big Labor work together to reward some family  arrangements and punish others.   Our all-Democrat government is already botching the things that  actually are government's job--projecting strength abroad, maintaining  energy independence--but they can't even do that right. Just look at  the poll numbers. The last thing families need are for Democrats to  appoint themselves national daycare czars and then botch that, too.   I haven't even touched on one of the most sinister parts of this  whole proposal.   For parents who do use childcare outside the home, faith-based  options are incredibly popular. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates  that 53 percent of parents who use center-based care use ones that are  linked to faith-based organizations, but the same Democrats who are  letting far-left propaganda trickle down from the universities into K- 12 schools are now declaring war on faith-based childcare. Washington  Democrats want to unleash the woke mob on church daycare. There are at  least two parts of their bill that are direct attacks.   First, liberals are trying to chase faith-based providers out of the  daycare industry by denying funds to any facility they deem  discriminatory. Of course, today's radical left tosses around these  kinds of accusations at any remotely traditional institution. Faith- based childcare centers could potentially get their subsidies ripped  away if they don't hire who secular bureaucrats want them to hire, set  up their facilities the way secular bureaucrats want them set up, or  even--listen to this--if they give preference to kids of their own  faith. Orthodox Jewish daycare centers could get kicked out if they say  Orthodox Jewish families get first dibs. Evangelical centers could get  punished by bureaucrats if the families who belong to the church are  accommodated first.   This is a joke. The left is trying to weaponize the word  ``discrimination'' to push faith-based childcare out of business.   Another part of their bill goes out of its way to deny money for  facility upgrades to buildings that are used for ``sectarian  instruction or religious worship.'' If a faith-based center leads kids  in prayer or teaches them their families' faiths, they don't get the  funding that everybody else gets? We see this over and over from the  culture warriors. They pretend they are happy to have religious groups  in the public square but only if they check their beliefs at the door.   Now, a few years ago, the Supreme Court had to strike down a similar  policy that penalized faith-based organizations. A State had tried to  deny a church a widely available grant to fix up its playground. The  Court took a look at it and struck down the law 7 to 2.   But the political left is right back at it. Just look at which  Federal bureaucrat would oversee this giant mess. Well, of course, it  is none other than Secretary Becerra, the hard-left culture warrior who  got famous by suing the Little Sisters of the Poor for being too  Catholic and by suing crisis pregnancy centers for being pro-life. This  is the person whom Democrats want to give sweeping new powers over  families' private choices? Secretary Becerra gets a giant slush fund to  bring President Biden's inflation into childcare and discriminate  against people of faith--just one more way Democrats' reckless taxing- and-spending spree would hurt working families.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, earlier this year, a disastrous retreat  from Afghanistan gave our allies and partners reason to doubt that the  United States could be counted on. Today, some of our colleagues want  to double down on that mistake by blocking defensive support to yet  another important partner.   Saudi Arabia is literally surrounded by violent threats conceived,  funded, and orchestrated by Iran. To the north, they have got Iran- backed terrorists sowing violence in Iraq and Syria. To the east, they  have a gulf filled with the flags of Iran's own increasingly  belligerent navy. To the south, the Saudis have Iran-backed Houthi  terrorists strangling Yemen and lobbying rockets, missiles, and armed  drones over their border.   To be sure, this violence and the plight of the Yemeni people have  only worsened since the Biden administration removed the Houthis from  the terrorist list and imposed new restrictions on our support to the  Saudi-led coalition.   Around the world, from time to time, we all have legitimate concerns  about the behavior of our partners, but we are in a better position to  influence their conduct if they trust in our partnership. So our  colleagues don't get to vent their moral outrage in a vacuum without  accounting for what comes next.   A vote to block the sale of defensive military systems to Saudi  Arabia would undermine one of our most important regional partners, but  there is even more at stake. Whether we help or not, our Arab partners  will still be under siege tomorrow. They still need military  capabilities to defend themselves. And we know that Russia and China  will happily sell them advanced weapons systems. The importance of so- called great power competition is a matter of general consensus. So we  should be wary of turning our backs on longtime partners and of pushing  them into the arms of our adversaries.   So here is what our colleagues' resolution would actually do. It  would give the world yet another reason to doubt the resolve of the  United States, and it would give our biggest adversaries a new foothold  to exert their influence over a rapidly changing and important region.
