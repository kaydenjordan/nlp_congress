 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, a vote earlier this month on the  administration's decision to ease sanctions on a Russian oligarch puts  the Senate on record on where its Members stand in terms of holding  Russia accountable for its continued actions against the United States.   We need to be clear about what we are facing. Not only did Russia  conduct what I believe to be a cyber act of war against the United  States during the 2016 election cycle, it continues to do so with the  President and his administration, apparently, indifferent.   Make no mistake. Russia tried to interfere in the recent midterm  elections, and it continues to do so against our democratic allies in  Europe. What has been the response of this body--the U.S. Senate--sworn  to uphold the Constitution, to protect against enemies, foreign and  domestic? Other than the belated passage of a Russia sanctions bill in  the last Congress--a bill whose sanction provisions this administration  has been slow or unwilling to enforce--we have done almost nothing.   Let's start in 2016 when top officials from the administration's  national security and intelligence community came and warned  congressional leadership of Russia's ongoing and serious attack on our  election--this was during the election campaign--rightly asking for a  bipartisan statement to tell Russian dictator Putin to stop.   What was Senate Majority Leader McConnell's response to this request  to protect our Nation?   No thanks; not going to do it.   History will no doubt look back with amazement at that decision.   What about the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--a historically  celebrated body with jurisdiction over this Russian attack on the  United States? It did not even conduct an investigation into Russia's  actions in the last Congress. To date, I have heard no plans to do so  in this Congress. That is incredible.   We have stunning reports--reports that normally would bring this city  to a halt--of an FBI counterintelligence investigation opened on  President Trump--whether the President called for the destruction of  notes after meetings with Russian leaders . . . something unheard of in  the history of that office . . . and that Trump has been asking about  how the United States could possibly withdraw from the NATO alliance.   These are stunning developments, and they are not alone. For anyone  paying attention, they shouldn't be surprised that our President is, in  fact, pursuing policies the Russians could only dream of. They include  the weakening of our democratic institutions; the weakening of our  Western security alliance; the withdrawing of U.S. leadership on the  global stage and ceding influence to Russia, Iran, and China; silence  when Russia attacked Ukrainian naval ships; entertaining the idea of  turning over an American ambassador to Russia for an absurd line of  questioning; cozying up to global dictators and ignoring American  values of democracy of human rights; and, of course, the President  saying publicly and privately to Putin that he believes him instead of  our intelligence experts when it comes to denying any attacks on  democracy.   We also know that President Trump was incredibly suggesting such  Russia-friendly policies during his campaign while at the same time  pursuing business interests in that country.   I end with a question I have asked before on this floor. How can the  party of Ronald Reagan continue to sit by while this President pursues  policies aligned with a former KGB agent? Why are the first bills in  this new Senate under Republican control not dealing with the serious  threats to our Nation? Why isn't the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  holding urgent hearings on these stunning developments between an  American President and a Russian dictator, not to mention moving  bipartisan legislation to protect U.S. membership in NATO?   Quite simply, with the government finally back open we need deal with  these serious threats to our nation and democracy that we have heard  involving our White House. When we are elected to office in Congress,  we take an oath. In it, we swear to uphold and defend the Constitution  of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. The  President similarly swears to preserve, protect, and defend our  Constitution. As such, it is time for all of us--Democrats and  Republicans--to speak up and fulfill our constitutional responsibility.                             For-Profit Colleges    Madam President, for anyone who thought the upheaval in the for- profit college industry was over or it was driven by an overzealous  Obama administration determined to kill the industry, as some accused  just a few short months ago, it is time to think again.   Just last month, amid the loving regulatory embrace of the for-profit  college industry by President Trump's DeVos-led Department of  Education, two major for-profit college chains have collapsed. It  proves true the recent warning by the Department of Education inspector  general, Kathleen Tighe, that for-profit colleges represent a  disproportionate risk to both students and American taxpayers.   The rot in the for-profit college industry runs much deeper than just  the failures of Corinthian and ITT Tech. On December 17, for-profit  college company Vatterott Colleges announced the immediate closure of  its campuses nationwide, leaving 2,300 students stranded, including 200  at its campus in Fairview Heights, IL. The company had been in  financial trouble for some time. It had already closed a number of  campuses, including one in Quincy, IL.   The Department of Education must now provide Illinois and other  Vatterott students with clear information about their options,  including their eligibility to receive a closed school discharge of  their Federal student loans and option to file a claim for a borrower  defense discharge if they believe they were defrauded by the  university.   In addition, the Department must make sure these students are not put  at risk a second time by assuring that they have affordable, quality  options to continue their education, such as community colleges. It  would be adding insult to injury to allow these students to be lured by  other predatory or financially shaky for-profit colleges, especially  those facing State and Federal investigations.   Early in December, Education Corporation of America closed 75  campuses nationwide, affecting some 20,000 students. I am pleased, in  this case, that the Department of Education developed a page on its  website to inform ECA students about closed school discharges. It must  do more to communicate with affected students and ensure they are able  to continue their studies at quality, affordable institutions.   The vultures are already circling these students.   In a recent letter, Steve Gunderson, a former Member of the U.S.  House of Representatives and lead lobbyist for the for-profit colleges  and universities, announced that for-profit colleges are working to  assist the students who were victims of these collapsed for-profit  schools and that 20 for-profit colleges had already expressed interest  in taking on these ECA students. It is simply double jeopardy to ask  students, once defrauded by this industry, to be somehow rescued and  lured into another contractual obligation by another school in the for- profit college industry.   Over the holiday season, around 30 campuses owned by Dream Center  Education Holdings closed. They include the Argosy campus in  Schaumburg, IL, and the Illinois Institute of Art--not to be confused  with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, a reputable  organization.   In August, I led several of my colleagues in writing to Secretary  DeVos,  [[Page S732]]  asking her to provide immediate assistance to these students who had  borrowed money to go to these worthless schools. We were concerned that  Dream Center was not providing students with information about closed  school discharges and was pushing them into other bad options, like  enrolling in another for-profit school. Among other things, we asked  the Department to post an information page on its website to inform the  students. Even weeks after the closure, we have yet to receive a  response to this letter from the Department of Education.   Adding to the confusion for students in Illinois is the fact that for  months Dream Center misrepresented that the Illinois Institute of Art  campuses were accredited, even when its accreditor had made clear that  was not the case. I have called on Secretary DeVos to investigate this  misrepresentation, especially as it relates to these students'  eligibility for borrower defense discharges. The National Student Loan  Defense Network has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Illinois  borrowers against the company for this misrepresentation, while the  Department of Education and Washington remain silent.   Now, reports have surfaced of a new restructuring of these schools,  with few details but major implications for students. The Department of  Education must immediately inform students and the public about these  changes.   Earlier this month, 48 State attorneys general, including our own  Illinois attorney general, now retired, Lisa Madigan, and the District  of Columbia reached a settlement with for-profit giant Career Education  Corporation over consumer violations by the company. Under the  settlement, Career Education Corporation agreed to forgo collecting  $493 million owed to it by 180,000 students nationally--$48 million in  relief for 17,000 students in Illinois who had been exploited by this  for-profit school. I have long spoken out about these abuses and the  misconduct of Career Education Corporation schools, especially their  infamous and now defunct Le Cordon Bleu, Harrington College of Design,  and Sanford-Brown brands. These fellows really dream up some wonderful  names for worthless schools.   Just last week, for-profit college operator National American  University Holdings announced ``substantial doubt'' that its finances  would allow it to remain in business over the next year. The company,  which has faced lawsuits related to deceptive practices, runs campuses  in about a dozen States and online. Its closure would affect thousands  of students.   How many more for-profit college collapses, closures, and State legal  actions will it take before we get serious at the Federal level, both  in Congress and at the Department of Education, about protecting  students and taxpayers from this industry?   It just amazes me that so many people in this body stand back and  watch the so-called for-profit colleges and universities exploit  students and their families, watch them run up debts they will never be  able to pay back, wait until they default, and then threaten them with  lawsuits and collection agencies, instead of realizing at the outset  that these schools are not reputable. These students are lured with  promises the schools can't keep, and they are also lured into debt they  will never be able to repay. They will never end up with a job that  allows them to pay back the debt.   Don't take my word for it; think of two simple numbers. Nine percent  of all postsecondary students go to for-profit colleges and  universities--9 percent. Thirty-four percent of all federal student  loan defaults are students from for-profit colleges and universities.  Nine percent of the students; 34 percent of the defaults. Why would  that be happening? Well, because they overcharge the students, and they  provide them with a worthless diploma if they stick it out and don't  drop out.   These schools are a blight on higher education and an exploitation of  innocent students and their families. Who are the ultimate losers when  their debts are discharged? American taxpayers who subsidize these  miserable, good-for-nothing schools and then watch as they are not  repaying their debts because the students can't, and the taxpayers end  up the losers again. If that is capitalism at work, save this country,  because it is a terrible outcome for the students, for their families,  and for American taxpayers.   I yield the floor.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
