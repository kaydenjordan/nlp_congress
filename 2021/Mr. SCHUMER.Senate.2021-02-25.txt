 Mr. President, now, the Senate is laser-focused on  confirming President Biden's impressive Cabinet while paving the way  for another round of urgent COVID relief. The two tasks will remain the  top Senate priorities over the next several weeks.   By the end of this week, the Senate will have confirmed three  Cabinet-level officials--the U.N. Ambassador and the Secretaries of  Agriculture and Energy--and will have set up confirmation votes early  next week for the Secretaries of Education and Commerce and the Chair  of the Council of Economic Advisers.   This week, Senate committees also held confirmation hearings on  scores of other nominations, including the President's candidates for  Attorney General, HHS Secretary, Interior Secretary, CIA Director,  Surgeon General, and U.S. Trade Representative   At the same time, Democrats are preparing to proceed with the  urgently needed President Biden American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion  lifeline that will lay the foundation for economic recovery and a  return to life as normal.   We have come a long way in our fight against COVID, but we still have  a long way to go. Over 60 million vaccinations have now been  administered across the country. Death rates are finally, finally  declining. But while the trends are headed in the right direction, more  Americans are still dying per day than at any point during the worst  weeks of last summer.   The same goes for our economy. While there are green shoots, our  country remains 10 million jobs short of where we were last February-- 10 million jobs short. That is nothing to trifle with or pass over.  Today's report on new jobless claims was the 49th week that the number  was higher than at any point during the great recession.   Let me repeat that. Today's report on the number of Americans filing  for unemployment benefits for the first time was the 49th week during  the COVID pandemic that new unemployment claims were higher than at any  point during the great recession. In the words of Fed Chairman Powell,  hardly a big liberal, ``The economic recovery remains uneven and far  from complete, and the path ahead is highly uncertain.''   That is from a very serious, staid man not prone to any hyperbole at  all. But what he is telling us is simple: We cannot take our foot off  the gas. We cannot slow down before the race is won. We must proceed  boldly and decisively.   Senate Democrats will move forward on the American Rescue Plan as  soon as possible. The bill will erase any doubt that the American  people, businesses, families, workers will have the resources that they  need until we can defeat the virus and our economy comes roaring back.  The American people should expect nothing less.   Just yesterday, over 150 executives from the Nation's business  community said that taking action on the American Rescue Plan is the  right thing to do. The business community is firmly lined up behind  this plan. Earlier this month, 400 mayors from both parties, Democratic  and Republican, sent a letter to Congress supporting the plan and the  help it provides to keep teachers and firefighters and other essential  public employees on the job.   In poll after poll, the American public overwhelmingly supports  congressional action on a bold COVID relief package, a majority of  Democrats and a majority of Republicans. As many as 7 in 10 Americans  support the American Rescue Plan. There is a clear, bipartisan,  nationwide mandate to act, and that is just what the Senate is going to  do--a clear, bipartisan, nationwide mandate to act, and that is what we  will do.   Now, from the start, we had hoped this effort would be bipartisan. As  I said before, there is nothing about the budget process that precludes  bipartisanship. The same process has been used no fewer than 17 times  to produce major bipartisan legislation. But it seems that despite the  historic nature of the crisis, despite the clear and pressing needs of  the country, despite the support of mayors and Governors and economists  and business leaders from across the political spectrum, and  [[Page S874]]  despite the popularity of the legislation with the American people, my  Republican colleagues are organizing to oppose the next round of COVID  relief.   A report in CNN suggested that Republican leaders were  ``maneuvering'' to keep every single Republican from supporting the  American Rescue Plan, an exercise in pure partisanship. We have started  to hear the same predictable objections in almost the same exact words  that Republicans use in response to nearly every piece of Democratic  legislation: ``a liberal wish list''; ``socialism.''   One Republican Member said that the American Rescue Plan was ``to the  left of Lenin.'' Seriously, to the left of Lenin? Money for schools,  vaccines, direct checks to struggling American families--checks that  nearly every Member of the Senate supported just a few months ago--now  it is to the left of Lenin?   This kind of reflexive partisan opposition is not going to wash with  the American people. It wouldn't wash at any time, but it especially  doesn't wash during this time of crisis. The American people have all  heard it before, and they know the country needs help.   All week our Republican colleagues have been raising concerns about  school closures. Well, I will tell you what, we all want to open  schools. We all want them to reopen. We are all concerned, though,  about the cost of remote learning on children and parents. So are the  teachers. So are the children. So are the parents.   But how about we actually give schools the funding they need to  reopen as quickly and safely as possible? That funding is in the  American Rescue Plan. While our Republican colleagues are cynically  attacking teachers--something they have done for decades--the school  districts in their States are telling them they need more funding.  Their school districts are telling them they need more funding to hire  extra teachers and reduce class size, to change the infrastructure of  their schools to increase social distancing, to hire tutors for summer  school and the fall to help our children make up for lost time.   The education commissioner for the State of Nebraska, hardly a  Democratic stronghold, put it simply: ``There's a lot of damage to  repair.'' Our Republican colleagues want schools to reopen. So do we.  But what about actually doing something to make that happen as safely  and as quickly as possible?   It seems my Republican colleagues have even taken issue with the tiny  amount of funding in the bill that goes to a bridge in New York. They  say: Look, a pork-barrel earmark from the Democratic leader, totally  non-COVID-related. The truth is, this is one of the only bridges  operated by the Federal Government. Its revenues for operating expenses  have collapsed because of COVID. No one is using the bridge.   Ironically, the bridge is located in a district represented in the  House by a Republican. And the request for this funding wasn't made by  me or any Democrat, for that matter. It came from the Trump  administration 5 months ago. I learned about it being in the bill when  I read about it in the newspaper.   That is how silly the talking points of the other side have gotten.  Republicans are not happy about a small provision in the bill requested  by the previous Republican administration, so they are going to oppose  direct checks to struggling families, another round of assistance for  small businesses, and money for schools and vaccinations. The argument  is absurd and, we know, a total excuse.   Look, we Democrats would prefer to work with our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle to pass this bill. We had an open, bipartisan  amendment process on the budget resolution. We have already included  many bipartisan amendments the Senate adopted into this new  reconciliation bill. The first amendment we put on the floor for the  restaurants was bipartisan, and that was the first amendment I put on  the floor as majority leader, showing my intent to be bipartisan.   But, at the end of the day, we cannot let obstructionism stop us. At  the end of the day, the American people sent us here with a job to do.   The bottom line is simple: We are still in a historic crisis of the  health of the economy. The American people know we are in a historic  crisis. And the Senate will soon take action on our plan to solve this  crisis, a plan with overwhelming public support. Our Republican  colleagues will have to decide whether they will work with us to  approve the legislation or obstruct it to the bitter end   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
