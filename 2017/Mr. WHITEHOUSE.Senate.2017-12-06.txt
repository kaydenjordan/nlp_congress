 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                Climate Change     Mr. President, Moody's Investors Service is one of  America's credit rating agencies. It is not an environmental  organization. It doesn't have any activity in the debate over climate  change. That is not what it does. What Moody's does is to analyze the  ability of companies and government agencies that issue debt to meet  those debt obligations. These Moody's ratings matter because they  determine the interest rates that States, counties, municipalities, and  companies must pay.   There was some interesting news last week. Moody's declared it is  time for cities, counties, and States along our coasts--Alaska is an  example of a State with a lot of coast--to wake up to the growing risk  of climate change. Moody's has adopted credit indicators ``to assess  the exposure and overall susceptibility of U.S. States to the physical  effects of climate change.''   The managing director said this:         What we want people to realize is: If you're exposed, we       know that. We're going to ask questions about what you're       doing to mitigate that exposure.    Moody's looked particularly at coasts and at the share of a State's  economic activity generated by its coasts and coastal communities. It  counts the amount of homes built on flood plains, and the risk of  extreme weather damage in that State or community as a share of the  State's economy. ``That is taken into your credit ratings,'' Moody's  said.   It makes sense, obviously. Communities that face rising seas that  face heavier storms, that face increased flood damage will bear greater  costs of mitigation and repair. If property values drop as a result, so  does revenue. Moody's realizes that investors need to take that  information into account in analyzing bonds. So it is going into the  Moody's ratings.   Think about that. The truth of climate science has gone beyond the  warnings of scientists, which we ought to have heeded a long time ago.  You have outstanding scientists at the University of Alaska who are  studying ocean acidification, sea level changes, all of that--and we  probably would have listened to those scientists but for the influence  of the fossil fuel industry here. The truth of climate science has gone  beyond the warnings of government agencies, national laboratories, and  our military services--warnings which have been there for a long time  and which we also ought to have heeded and probably would have but for  the political influence of the fossil fuel industry. It has even gone  beyond the warnings of our coastal States and communities and the  coastal regulators, even beyond the warnings of the insurance and  reinsurance industries--all of which we have refused to heed to placate  the fossil fuel lobbyists--but now the financial referees who score  credit risk are baking climate change risks into the assessment of  coastal communities' credit-worthiness.   Moody's is not going to assess this risk just in blue States. Coastal  communities in every corner of the country--in blue States and red  States, alike--are facing climate change risk to their citizens and  their economies. Let's take a look at North Carolina.   I visited North Carolina in 2014 to see the effects of climate change  along our southeast coast. The problems I saw there bore a striking  resemblance to what is happening in our shorefront towns in Rhode  Island. The coastal folks who I met in North Carolina were every bit as  concerned as coastal Rhode Islanders.    I visited the marine science facility at Pivers Island, where  scientists from Duke University, the University of North Carolina,  North Carolina State, East Carolina State, and NOAA are all studying  sea level rise and other effects of climate change. I met with the  North Carolina Coastal Federation at their coastal education center in  Wilmington, where a bipartisan group was united in concern over the  exposure of their coastal communities to rising seas and fiercer  storms. I flew out over the Outer Banks to see where sea level rise is  slowly swallowing and relocating them.   The Outer Banks were formed millennia ago by the interaction of seas  and sand. They are dynamic barriers that move with tides and storms.  According to the U.S. Geological Survey, ``the Outer Banks,  particularly the ocean side, have always been hazardous places for  man.'' Nevertheless, they have become permanent homes to over 30,000  people, and they attract over $1 billion of tourist spending in that  county.   According to a recent comprehensive article by InsideClimate News and  The Weather Channel, one beach near East Seagull Drive in Nags Head  ``has been eroding at about six feet per year''--six feet per year.  Rapid erosion threatens shorefront homes and brings the ocean ever  closer to major roads and infrastructure. State engineers scramble to  keep Outer Banks roads and bridges open and to rebuild them stronger  and higher. This isn't just a North Carolina issue. This is a story  familiar to many coastal communities.   A Union of Concerned Scientists study reports that sea level rise is  doubling the number of communities along the coast facing what the  study calls ``chronic inundations and possible retreat'' in the next 20  years.   GAO, which we depend on for a great many things here, recently  reported that coastal areas face particularly high financial risks-- hence the Moody's decision--and that annual coastal property losses  from sea level rise and increased storms would run into the billions of  dollars every year in the short run, reaching over $50 billion every  year by late century. Every year it will be over $50 billion in loss to  coastal properties if we don't pay attention.   GAO referenced a report that estimated a total of ``$5 trillion in  economic costs to coastal property from climate change through 2100``-- $5 trillion in economic costs to our coastal communities.   That is a story that Rhode Islanders see coming at us as well. Our  barrier beach communities like Matunuck Beach and Green Hill in South  Kingstown see rapid erosion.   The top photo here from North Carolina shows one of the two remaining  homes at East Seagull Drive in Nags Head, the site I talked about. You  can see that there is an exposed septic tank where all the sand has  been washed off of, and you can see that there is limited beach left.  At high tide, that house is over water.   On the bottom is a strikingly similar picture of houses in Green  Hill, RI.  [[Page S7864]]  This photo was taken after the April 2007 nor'easter that tore through  New England. This family's septic tank is also exposed from the sand  that has been removed all around it, and the pilings here are keeping  the home above the water. By 2009, this home got repaired, but it had  to be moved back from the seashore and up a dune bank. You can only  move back so far from rising seas before you start bumping into  people's property behind you.   My predecessor, Senator John Chafee, who was once the chairman of our  Environment and Public Works Committee, owned a family house in  Matunuck, RI, where I remember swimming as a young man. The Chafee  house is now completely gone, lost to rising seas.   Rhode Island's coast took a real lashing in 2012's Superstorm Sandy.  These images are from Matunuck, where Sandy's storm surge wiped away  beaches and exposed shorefront houses to the raw power of the sea.   The historic Browning Cottages up here were family homes for  generations. Two of those historic homes had to be demolished. The  third could be relocated inland. You can see from these shoreline maps  the retreat of the shore to sea level rise and what it has done to  these beachfront communities. Here in Nags Head, these little red  squares are all where houses used to be that the sea moved in on, and  they couldn't move backward. They had to be demolished and moved away.  Only two remain--these two.   As you can see by the old shorelines, not that long ago coastal homes  had yards of beach in front of them that is now lost. Storms, as well  as sea level rise, can change all of that.   If you look at this Rhode Island map, you can see the steady loss of  beach along this shore. But it tells two stories. Not only is it the  story of the gradual loss of beach to rising seas, but it is also the  story of the sudden devastation that a storm can wreak. This red line  is how far the beach got pushed back in the hurricane of 1938. One big  storm just scoured that beach clean. Now we are back behind that. Here  is the 2014 line in blue.   If you look at this site on Google right now, you can see that it has  gone even further back. Along Matunuck and the coastline, this is an  establishment called the Ocean Mist. You can have a great time in the  Ocean Mist. It is a great place.   Not very long ago, you could walk out the front of the Ocean Mist and  down onto the beach, and you could walk dozens of yards across beach  where people play volleyball and took the sun and hung out before they  got to the sea. This is the Ocean Mist today. It has had to be propped  up on pilings as the sea comes underneath it.   North Carolina and the Federal Government are having to spend  millions of dollar replenishing the Outer Banks' beaches. The State now  has to renourish more than 100 miles of beach compared to just a dozen  miles it worried about a few decades ago.   Western Carolina University has tallied up more than $300 million  spent by the State on beach nourishment from 2007 to 2016. Another $64  million is expected to be spent by local government near Nags Head this  year and $48 million more in 2018. Nationwide, we spend about $3.1  billion on beach nourishment.   EcoRI reports that Rhode Island lost about 90,000 cubic yards of  beach sand just from Superstorm Sandy. Over $3 million of Federal  funding had to be used to help rebuild those Matunuck beaches after the  storm.   Beach nourishment, seawalls, bulkheads, and rock armaments--you name  it--are all temporary stopgaps that must eventually yield to rising  seas. As this happens, there will be a constant drain out of local  treasuries as communities have to spend more and more to keep up with  the rising seas, and there will be a gradual loss of revenue into local  treasuries as valuable oceanfront properties that pay local property  taxes are lost. That is why Moody's is starting to score this issue in  coastal communities.   One solution that coastal communities can come up with is to ignore  this. In 2010, North Carolina's Coastal Resource Commission Science  Panel on coastal hazards recommended that a sea level rise of 1 meter-- 39 inches--be adopted as the amount of anticipated rise by 2100. That  was back in 2010. Since then, data compiled and analyzed by NOAA shows  that that number was way too low, that the worst case potential for sea  level rise on those shores is about twice that--2 meters of sea level  rise.   Here is what the Raleigh News & Observer reported: The State  ``adopted a 30-year forecast that figures the rise at 8 inches.'' The  odds of that coming true are virtually nil.   Ask Moody's how credible that estimate is in face of the evidence.  Moody's is going to be going there and looking at this stuff, and they  are not going to buy phony-baloney assertions that you are only going  to see 8 inches of sea level rise when NOAA is predicting 2 meters.  They are going to be rated on not being ready because they are not  responding to the obvious science.   Climate denial works in politics because of the massive political  influence of the fossil fuel industry, but it really is not going to  matter to Moody's assessors.   In Rhode Island, our Coastal Resources Management Council is now  planning for a worst case scenario of 9 to 12 vertical feet of sea  level rise along our shores by the end of the century--9 to 12 vertical  feet. Colleagues may want me to laugh that off and say: No, it is too  inconvenient to talk about that; it really ticks off our fossil fuel  friends. I will never, ever ignore this. I can't ignore this, and we as  a body should not ignore this. No amount of beach nourishment will  protect Rhode Island from that.   At 10 feet, we will lose 36 square miles of extremely valuable  shorefront land--people's homes, people's businesses, the marinas and  fishing piers that people depend on. That is 36 square miles lost  because we can't say no to the fossil fuel industry around here.   We must act on climate change now to give coastal States any chance  to avoid these worst case scenarios. We have to help coastal  communities plan for the changes we can't avoid.   A recent report from Texas A&M and Rice University researchers  highlights what they called--get this--the ``growing disconnect between  the 100-year FEMA floodplain and the location of actual flood losses''  and, again, the ``growing consensus over the inability of the FEMA- derived floodplains to capture actual loss.''   On average, about a quarter of insured flood losses occur outside the  map's flood plains, and in some cases, more than 50 percent of flood  losses occur outside of what the maps said would be flooded areas. With  bad mapping, we are leaving local communities at a terrible handicap.   We go back to that GAO report quantifying those coastal risks. It  notes: ``Given the potential magnitude of climate change and the lead  time needed to adapt, preparing for these impacts now may reduce the  need for more costly steps in the decades to come.'' But it also points  out that ``the Federal Government does not have governmentwide  strategic planning efforts in place to manage what it called  ``significant climate risks before they become Federal fiscal  exposures.'' The Federal Government does not have governmentwide  strategic planning efforts in place.   We have to give local communities better support. Bad maps and no  planning is not support. Our coastal homes, our coastal economies, and  our coastal heritage are all at stake, and bad maps and no planning  aren't meeting those responsibilities.   I yield the floor.
