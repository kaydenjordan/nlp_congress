 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res.  755.   As a CIA case officer, I used to meet with foreign nationals who were  providing vital intelligence to help inform our hardest national  security decisions and keep our country safe. These individuals, from  countries where leaders abused their power and defied the rule of law,  risked imprisonment and often their very lives in order to provide the  United States with information to help us, to inform us.   But why? It was their belief in the United States, their belief in  our country, the longest-standing democracy in the world; our country,  a beacon of hope in the world, a democratic republic founded on a  document and the belief in the rule of law and a belief in its people.   Today, I am proud to serve in the people's House, representing my  hometown and again serving our country, that beacon of hope in the  world.   And today, especially today, I reflect on the founding documents that  have set us apart in the world, leading people across generations and  across the  [[Page H12177]]  world to risk everything because of their belief in our great Nation.   Today, especially today, I affirm my commitment to upholding and  protecting the Constitution, the rule of law it defines, and the people  it governs.
