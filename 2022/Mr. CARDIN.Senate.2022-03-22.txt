 Mr. President, before I start my remarks in regard to the   2-year anniversary of the CARES Act, I just want to compliment my  colleague from Maryland on his statements in regard to Mr. Putin's  aggression in Ukraine.   Everything he said I totally concur in--the unity that President  Biden has been able to instill not only among our traditional allies  but the global community; the strength of our help to the Ukrainian  people, the help that we have given in regard to humanitarian relief;  and the sanctions that were led by the United States--but we now have  global support for many of these sanctions, which are making a  difference.   This is clearly a battle between good and evil, and I just really  wanted to compliment my colleague from Maryland on his statement, one  on which I hope all of us agree, and that we can move forward very  quickly on the legislation you refer to that passed the House of  Representatives that would make it clear that we will not do business  with Russia as normal; that we will revoke the favored nation status  and normal trade relations; and that we will do what Mr. Zelenskyy has  asked us to do, and that is to make it clear that the Magnitsky  sanctions, which are individual sanctions imposed against the  perpetrators, Mr. Putin and his enablers in Russia, will be maintained  with reauthorization of the global Magnitsky statute.   I hope we will get to that as early as this week because I agree with  my colleague that every day we delay it, in fact, is helping Mr. Putin.  We need to make it clear and enact that statute, which, by the way, the  Biden administration strongly encourages us to do.                                  CARES Act    Mr. President, 2 years ago, the United States declared COVID-19 a  national emergency. By then, it was clear that we were experiencing a  once-in-a-century pandemic and that preventing the spread of this  dangerous virus would require our Nation's greatest collective effort  since World War II. Here in the U.S. Congress, we knew that this era- defining challenge would require unprecedented action from the Federal  Government to confront the economic and public health crisis created by  COVID-19.   The pandemic has waxed and waned in the 2 years since then, so  opportunities for American families and small business owners to return  to their normal lives have come in fits and starts. But one lesson that  has remained true through these ups and downs and has been confirmed on  multiple occasions through the pandemic is that the U.S. Federal  Government can--it must--play a role in solving our Nation's  longstanding, difficult, and intractable problems.   Let us remember those first few weeks of the pandemic. The vast  majority of Americans did not know what to make of the Centers for  Disease Control's January report of a novel virus, the coronavirus  identified abroad. By mid-February, small business owners were already  feeling the effects of reduced revenues. By the end of February, the  U.S. economy was rapidly deepening into a recession. There were severe  disruptions in domestic and global supply chains, leading to shortages  in food and critical personal protective equipment, and the  unemployment rate was increasing rapidly.    Congress had to act and act fast, so that is exactly what we did. We  passed the CARES act--a bold, unprecedented, and comprehensive $2.2  trillion COVID relief package that met the scale of the crisis we  faced--and we did it without partisan rancor or political infighting.  The bill passed the Senate 97 to 0. It is one of the greatest acts of  bipartisanship I have witnessed during my career in politics.   The CARES Act provided funding to our public health infrastructure  for testing, tracing, and vaccine development. It directed funds to  State and local governments that were straining under the cost of the  pandemic. It also authorized the Treasury Department to get stimulus  payments to American families and increased unemployment payments  because we knew that millions of Americans would be unable to work as  we came together to slow the spread of the virus.   The bill also provided hundreds of billions of dollars to support our  Nation's small businesses. I was proud to lead bipartisan negotiations  on the small business provisions of this bill on the Small Business  Task Force, which included myself and Senators Jeanne Shaheen, Marco  Rubio, and Susan Collins.   As we negotiated these provisions, we had several key facts in mind.  First, small businesses have low profit margins and carry little in  cash reserves, so they could only survive a few weeks of a closure  without some form of support. Secondly, eventually, Americans unable to  work would return to work, and it is much easier and quicker for small  businesses to reopen with their existing staff instead of hiring new  staff. Third, keeping small businesses in operation would make our  eventual recovery come about more quickly and much more robustly. So we  wanted to keep small businesses afloat. We wanted to keep their  employees employed. We wanted to keep our economy moving forward.   The Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, which predates the  pandemic, had already been approved to provide loans to small  businesses harmed by COVID-19. So we knew that small businesses would  have access to the long-term capital they needed to adapt their  businesses and make other investments.   EIDL can meet small businesses' long-term capital needs, but we knew  that we had to move quickly to meet the immediate capital needs of  these businesses, so we created the EIDL Advance Grant Program to send  $10,000 grants to small businesses that applied for EIDL.   We knew how important it was to a recovery to keep employees on  payroll, so we created the Paycheck Protection Program to provide small  businesses with loans worth up to $10 million to cover the cost of up  to 8 weeks of payroll, and we made a promise to borrowers to forgive  the loans as long as they used the funds for payroll or other allowable  expenses.   We created a debt relief program to cover all costs associated with  new and existing SBA loans for 6 months. We invested in the SBA  entrepreneurship development programs to hire experts and increase  capacity to help small businesses navigate the ups and downs of the  pandemic.   In total, the CARES Act included more than $375 billion in aid to  small businesses. The aid could not have come soon enough. The initial  $349 billion in PPP funds were exhausted in less than 2 weeks. SBA  approved more than 1.6 million loans in that time.   SBA's laudable efforts to deliver relief to small businesses also  came with  [[Page S1285]]  disappointments and missed opportunities. Senator Shaheen and I fought  to include a provision in the CARES Act that required SBA to issue  guidance to the banks participating in PPP to prioritize loan  applications for small businesses in underserved communities. We knew  that those small businesses that had priority relationships with banks  would be first in line, but we wanted the SBA to make sure that those  that did not have those privileges would also be able to benefit by the  PPP program.   We insisted on the inclusion of this provision because we knew that a  program like PPP, which relied on financial institutions to make loans,  ran the risk of worsening the existing inequities in our private  capital market.   We simply could not allow small businesses in our most vulnerable  communities to fall further behind. SBA failed to issue the guidance.  So it was no surprise when organizations representing underserved small  businesses sounded the alarm that women, minorities, small businesses  in rural communities, and other underbanked borrowers were at risk of  being frozen out of the program.   The SBA's inspector general would eventually report that the Agency's  implementation of PPP did not fully align with the intent of Congress.  With funds exhausted after less than 2 weeks, the prior administration  requested additional funds for PPP--and only PPP--which would have  neglected the equally important EIDL Program, which had also exhausted  its funds by then.    It is important to keep in mind that since these programs were  designed to work together, funding one without the other would not meet  the needs of many small businesses.   Once again, Members of this Chamber worked with our colleagues across  the Capitol to create a comprehensive COVID-19 relief package that we  all could agree on, which passed the Senate, again, unanimously.   The bill provided an additional $370 billion of funds to the SBA  COVID-19 relief efforts, with $310 billion for PPP, $10 billion for the  EIDL Advance Grant Program.   The bill also provided $50 billion for the EIDL Program, which  allowed the Agency to make more than $350 billion in loans. And similar  to the ways in which the CARES Act implemented lessons learned during a  prior economic downturn, the second package implemented lessons learned  during the first round of PPP.   Since the SBA did not issue the guidance as required by the CARES  Act, Senate Democrats championed more prescriptive policies to make the  PPP fairer and more equitable.   I remain proud that we were able to set aside $60 billion of PPP  funds to be distributed by credit unions, community development  financial institutions, minority depository institutions, community  banks, and other small lenders that are better able to get funds to  underserved and underbanked communities.   We wanted to make sure that those who needed it could get it, and I  am proud that we were able to include that in that legislation.   Thanks to the set-aside, approximately 600 new, mostly nonbank,  lenders that did not participate in phase 1, participated in phase 2 of  the PPP program. We should take great pride in knowing that the set- aside worked.   According to the Government Accounting Office report issued in  September of last year, banks made the vast majority of PPP loans  during phase 1 of the program. As a result, the program favored larger  small businesses. During phase 2, however, the Agency found that the  share of loans to underserved businesses and communities ``was  proportionate to their representation in the overall small business  community.''   We succeeded in the second round. For example, 42 percent of the  loans approved during phase 1 of PPP went to businesses with between 10  and 499 employees, but those businesses only accounted for 4 percent of  all the businesses in the United States. We know that women-owned and  minority-owned small businesses are less likely to have employees at  all, and when they do, they have less employees, on average.   During phase 2, the share of loans to the larger of these businesses  with 10 or more employees dropped to 17 percent. We achieved our  objective.   And while only 9 percent of the PPP loans issued during phase 1 went  to businesses located in counties where women-owned businesses  accounted for a large share of all businesses, the number doubled to 18  percent during phase 2, which is in line with the share of small  businesses nationwide owned by women.   Similarly, 36 percent of phase 1 loans went to small businesses in  high-minority counties, and that number increased to 50 percent in  phase 2.   In every example in underserved communities--minority-owned small  businesses, women-owned small businesses--because we targeted the funds  to mission lenders, because we were able to get the entrepreneurial  services to small businesses that needed the help, we reached the  underserved community.   I would like to take a moment to highlight the significance of these  findings. The fact that women and minorities face historic and  pervasive barriers to entrepreneurship is not new, and the primary  barrier is their inability to access capital. But the GAO's report  confirms that through the policies, the capital access gap is  bridgeable. We can bridge this gap if we pass the right policies.   After the end of phase 2 of PPP on August 8, Congress negotiated the  next round of COVID-19 relief, which was not finalized until December  22.   Negotiations may have taken much longer than any of us would have  liked, but we once again found common ground to pass the bipartisan  Economic Aid Act, providing $900 billion in COVID-19 relief, including  an additional $325 billion for small businesses. In this bill, my  Democratic colleagues and I secured an additional $30 billion set-aside  for smaller lenders in addition to expanding eligibility to additional  industries and nonprofits. The Economic Aid Act also provided eligible  small businesses with an additional Second Draw PPP loan worth up to $2  million.   The bill created new programs as well. The Shuttered Venue Operators  Grant Program was created to provide grants of up to $10 million to  live venues, independent movie theaters, and other cultural  institutions that were shuttered as a result of COVID-19. And a new $20  billion Targeted EIDL Advance Program was created to provide additional  EIDL Advance grants to our Nation's most vulnerable small businesses  that couldn't afford to take out a loan. They needed grants.   I would like to take a moment to speak on why the Targeted EIDL  Advance Program was necessary.   Similar to how the Trump administration initially handled the PPP,  hindering the program's utility, the administration's implementation of  the EIDL Advance Program also made it less useful to small businesses.  The CARES Act directed SBA to provide $10,000 grants to all EIDL  applicants, but the Trump administration only provided $1,000 per  employee up to 10 employees.   The Targeted EIDL Advance Program addressed the problem directly by  targeting the program to the most vulnerable communities and providing  small businesses in those communities with the remainder of the $10,000  Congress intended them to receive. We corrected the mistake initially  made.   It remains frustrating to know that our Federal response to the  pandemic could have helped even more small businesses. So it was  welcome relief when President Biden was inaugurated because I knew that  America's underserved small businesses would have a champion  administering phase 3 of PPP, and we in Congress would have a partner  committed to ensuring that these programs helped as many small  businesses as possible.   The administration hit the ground running. In February of 2021,  President Biden instituted a 14-day priority period for PPP, during  which the SBA only processed applications for small businesses with  fewer than 20 employees.   The administration also changed the loan calculation formula for  small proprietors and eliminated an exclusionary restriction that  prevented small business owners with a prior nonfelony conviction from  obtaining a PPP loan for their businesses.   In addition to these administrative actions, President Biden also  proposed and Congress enacted the American  [[Page S1286]]  Rescue Plan. The bold relief package created the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund to provide grants to restaurants and bars that lost  revenue due to COVID-19, added additional funds to the Shuttered Venue  Operators Grant Program, added additional funds to the Targeted EIDL  Advance Program, and provided $350 billion to States and localities,  which helped spur new State programs and replenish existing ones, like  the RELIEF Act and the Maryland Strong Economic Recovery Initiative in  my own home State, and created a new Community Navigator Program to get  the SBA's entrepreneurial development resources in the communities that  would benefit from them the most.   We had the Federal programs. Then we had the navigators to help small  businesses get those funds. And we provided local funds through State  and local governments so they could help small businesses. We really  went through everything we could to help those that needed the help the  most.   The significance of these actions--the passage of the bipartisan  Economic Aid Act in December, the Biden administration's administrative  steps, and the American Rescue Plan--cannot be overstated. They helped  set our Nation on course for the most robust economic recovery in  American history.   Phase 3 of PPP--January to May 31, 2021--had the most equitable loan  approval shares, according to a report released in January of this year  by economists Robert Fairlie and Frank Fossen. Fairlie and Fossen, both  of whom have been following PPP and the pandemic's impact on small  businesses closely for the past 2 years, cited the extraordinary  increase in loan volume of Prestamos, a CDFI that targets Hispanic- owned small businesses, as an example of the success of the PPP under  the Biden administration.   These numbers are impressive. During phase 1 of PPP, Prestamos ranked  4,274 among PPP lenders by volume. That was phase 1, where you really  had to have an existing relationship if you were going to be able  to get a PPP loan. In phase 2, where we did a better job of targeting,  they ranked 325. In phase 3, they were among the top ranked PPP lenders  by volume.    They wrote that the 14-day priority period in particular ``helped to  bring the PPP loans to disadvantaged small businesses.''   Thank you to the Biden administration and the Democrats in Congress.   The program hasn't only been good for small businesses; it has also  supported small community banks. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis  wrote that small business lending was a ``key business line'' for small  community banks during the operation of the program and that the  program will help smaller banks regain some of the ground they have  lost through larger competitors in the small business loan market.   The Biden administration's implementation of the Shuttered Venue  Operators Grant Program has also been a resounding success. After  awarding more than 12,800 initial grants worth more than $11 billion at  an average of more than 1 million per institution, the administration  also awarded more than 8,700 supplemental grants worth more than $3  billion.   I mention all of that because we know our shuttered venues would be  out of business if it weren't for the shuttered loan program. It has  kept them in business.   And the administration successfully provided more than 100,000  restaurants with the Restaurant Revitalization Fund grants, worth more  than $28 billion in grants.   I have seen firsthand the benefit of these grants as I have traveled  in Maryland. On Small Business Friday, last year, I did a walking tour  down Main Street in Annapolis. Every single restaurant owner I visited  shared that they may not have survived without the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund grant. All of these restaurants are more than just  a place to grab a bite to eat. These are decades-old institutions owned  by small business operators, and their closures would have been deeply  felt by the community.   In the coming weeks, Congress must finish the job by replenishing the  Restaurant Revitalization Fund. There are still hundreds of thousands  of applicants waiting on funds. We have to finish the job for our  restaurants, because if there are any lessons learned from the past 2  years, it is that when Congress comes together to produce thoughtful  policies that address the system issues in our economy, it yields  results.   After enduring the deepest economic contraction since 1947, the  American economy grew at the fastest rate since 1984 with the first  year of Joe Biden's administration.   We are back, but we still have pockets that need help.   In an ironic twist of history, the lessons we have learned and the  expertise and capacity that we have built up within the SBA have now  prepared us for what can only be described as an entrepreneurial  renaissance underway in our communities. According to the Census  Bureau, Americans registered 4.4 million new businesses in 2020--4.4  million new businesses--the highest total on record and a 24-percent  increase over the prior year.   Remarkably, the surge is being driven by entrepreneurs in some of our  most underserved communities, and our policies helped make that a  reality. For example, data shows that between February 2020 and August  2021, the number of Black business owners increased by 38 percent.   Congress needs to take advantage of the entrepreneurial spirit that  is surging throughout our communities by continuing to invest in our  entrepreneurs, especially those in underserved communities. We have  demonstrated that the historic structural barriers that have inhibited  the growth of small businesses in underserved communities are far from  insurmountable.   Now is not the time to retreat. It is time for us to double down. In  implementing lessons learned during the implementation of PPP, we  should create a new direct loan program within SBA and further empower  small businesses. We must build on the inroads that the SBA has made  with underserved communities during the pandemic to get entrepreneurial  development, business mentorship, and technical training into  communities that would benefit from it the most. And we should continue  to work in a bipartisan way to ensure that American small businesses  have the tools they need to emerge from the COVID-19 stronger than  ever.   The bottom line is our policies made a difference. We saved America's  small businesses. We need to continue to work in the future to make  sure the climate for small businesses is healthy so that our economy  can continue to grow.   We know that small businesses are the growth engine of job growth in  America. We know that they are where most innovation takes place in our  economy.   Our policies during this pandemic helped save small businesses and  now expand the opportunity for small businesses, but we need to  continue to pay attention to these issues.   I hope we can do this in a bipartisan way. We need to replenish the  funds for those that have not been able to get it under the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund, and we need to pay attention to small businesses  in this country.    I yield the floor.
