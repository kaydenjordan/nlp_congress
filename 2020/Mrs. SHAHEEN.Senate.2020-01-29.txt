 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Shaheen asks the House managers:         The President's counsel has argued that the alleged conduct       set out in the articles does not violate a criminal statute       and thus may not constitute grounds for impeachment as ``high       Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Does this reasoning imply that if       the President does not violate a criminal statute he could       not be impeached for abuses of power such as ordering tax       audits of political opponents, suspending habeas corpus       rights, indiscriminately investigating political opponents or       asking foreign powers to investigate Members of Congress?    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, I  appreciate the question.   The simple answer is that a President can be impeached without a  statutory crime being committed. That was the position and the question  that was rejected in President Nixon's case and rejected again in  President Clinton's case. It should be rejected here in President  Trump's case.   The great preponderance of legal authority confirms that impeachable  offenses--of legal authority confirms that it is not defined in  criminal conduct. This authority includes nearly every legal scholar  who has studied the issue, multiple Supreme Court Justices who  addressed it in public remarks, and prior impeachments in the House.   This conclusion follows that constitutional history, text, and  structure and reflects the absurdities and practical difficulties that  would result were the impeachment power confined to indictable crimes.   As slide 35 shows, first, the plain text of the Constitution does not  require that an offense be a crime in order for it to be impeachable.   Alexander Hamilton explained that impeachable offenses, high crimes,  and misdemeanors are defined fundamentally by the abuse or violation of  some public trust--some public trust. They are political as they relate  chiefly to injuries done immediately to society itself.   Offenses against the Constitution are different than offenses against  the Criminal Code. Some crimes, like jaywalking, are not impeachable,  and some forms of misconduct often both offend the Constitution and the  criminal law.   Impeachment and criminality must, therefore, be assessed separately,  even though the President's commission of indictable crimes may further  support a case of impeachment and removal.   The American experience with impeachment confirms this. A strong  majority of impeachments voted by the House since 1789 have included  one or more allegations that did not charge a violation of criminal  law.   Although President Nixon resigned before the House could consider the  Articles of Impeachment against him, the Judiciary Committee's  allegations encompassed many, many noncriminal acts.   And in President Clinton's case, the Judiciary Committee report  accompanying the Articles of Impeachment to the House floor stated that  ``the actions of President Clinton do not have to rise to the level of  violating the Federal statute regarding obstruction of justice in order  to justify impeachment. . . . The Framers intended impeachment to reach  the full spectrum of Presidential misconduct that threatened the  Constitution. They also intended that our Constitution endure  throughout the ages.''   In other words, if it named one, two, and three, but new ones came up  and you had to keep up with the times, it was better to have the full  spectrum of Presidential misconduct. Because it could not anticipate  and specifically prohibit every single threat a President might someday  pose, the Framers adopted a standard sufficiently general and flexible  to meet unknown future circumstances. This standard was meant, as Mason  put it, to capture ``all manner of great and dangerous offences,'' and  compatible with the Constitution.    When the President uses the powers of his high office to benefit  himself while injuring or ignoring the very people he is duty-bound to  serve, he has committed an impeachable offense.   The records of the Constitutional Convention offer further clarity.  At the Constitutional Convention itself, no delegate--no delegate-- linked impeachment to the technicalities of criminal law. Instead, the  Framers principally intended impeachment for three forms of  Presidential wrongdoing, the ABCs of impeachment: A, abuse of power; B,  betrayal of the national interests through foreign entanglements; and  C, corruption of office and elections.   When the President uses his power to obtain illicit help in his  election from a foreign power, it undermines our national security and  election integrity. It is a trifecta.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Louisiana.
