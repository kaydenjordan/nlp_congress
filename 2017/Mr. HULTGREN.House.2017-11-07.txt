 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Jean Gaines for  her 40 years of service at the Geneva Chamber of Commerce, most  recently as their president. Under her leadership, the chamber has  grown substantially, to the benefit of our community and to the State  of Illinois.   To those who know Jean Gaines, she is described as intelligent,  alert, and fun-loving, a good mix of qualities to steer the board of  directors through many challenges.   Through hard work, she has developed multiple festivals and business  activities, including the Festival of the Vine and the opening of the  Geneva Visitor Center.   Her contributions have made the chamber of commerce a vibrant  organization and a model for many other chambers throughout the State  of Illinois and throughout the country.   Her family has also had a hand in the chamber's success. Her husband,  John; daughter, Kristine; son-in-law, Jerry Holtz; son, Mark; and  grandsons, Jack and Luke Holtz, have all worked in countless events in  their support of our local business community.   Jean, congratulations on 40 great years of service. Your hard work  helps  [[Page H8533]]  American business succeed, and we are grateful.                            ____________________
