 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California,  Ms. Chu, for bringing us to this point.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 275, condemning the  horrific shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 16, 2021, and  reaffirming this body's commitment to combating hate, combating  bigotry, and combating violence against the Asian-American community  and the Asia-Pacific Islander community.                                time  1845    It is consistent with this body's approach to racism that has  affected African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans.   Madam Speaker, I am a bit lost at some of the comments that I have  listened to because, on the other side of the House, someone mentioned  that this has everything to do with the trial. This has nothing to do  with the trial. This has to do with those innocent people who were  murdered. The trial never came up.   This has nothing to do with trying to point fingers. This is about  people who got up that day with families and all died because they  happened to be in a certain place at a certain time.   Sometimes when I listen to that, I say to myself: Well, you really  don't understand. You really don't understand. Maybe it is nice to be  born male and White when no one has ever attacked you because of your  skin color, because of your heritage, because you are male.   I just repudiate all of that. It sickens me to see the level of  violence being perpetrated against Asian Americans who represent our  friends. They are our neighbors. They are our fellow Americans, our  coworkers.   Over 600 cases have dotted the news throughout this Nation in just  the first few months of this year, with two-thirds of those cases being  against Asian-American women, where they were kicked, and they were  beaten, and they were stabbed, and they were hit with bricks.   Doesn't that sicken us to the point that we really want to just  condemn this, as we should?   In an era of smaller vision, rampant apathy, and celebrated  mediocrity, we desperately need those who will stand  [[Page H2523]]  up for that which is right and to fight like hell against that which is  wrong. I urge passage of this resolution.
