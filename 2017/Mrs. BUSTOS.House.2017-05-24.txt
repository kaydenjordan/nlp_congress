 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, President Trump released his  budget. And what he has shown is that rural America is just about at  the bottom of his list.   His budget is a killer for the Department of Agriculture. The cuts to  the rural development program would mean fewer jobs in small towns that  are already struggling.   While he promised to ``end the war on the family farmer,'' President  Trump slashes funding for the crop insurance program. And in Peoria,  his budget would even close the Nation's largest agricultural research  lab, a place for ag innovation that is part of the solution for renewed  ag economy.   Time and time again, President Trump made a great big promise spelled  out on his red ball cap. Now I am left wondering how a budget that  would devastate Main Street and our family farmers would make anything  great again.   Mr. President, middle America is not just flyover country. We value  those who look us in the eye, tell us the truth, and then do what they  say they are going to do.   So, President Trump, I ask you: Does your budget live up to what you  spelled out on your ball cap?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks  to the Chair.                            ____________________
