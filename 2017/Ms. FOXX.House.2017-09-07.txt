 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and say farewell to  a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce staff  who has dedicated more than 20 years of public service to the people's  House.   Ed Gilroy began his congressional career on the staff of former  Congressman Rod Chandler of Washington, but most of us know him for his  nearly 16 years of service as the committee's Director of Workforce  Policy.   Ed led our efforts to expand access to affordable healthcare for  small-business employees, provide moms and dads more flexibility in the  workplace, and protect the rights of workers and employers. When we  think about the passage of the bipartisan Pension Protection Act in  2006 and the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, we have to think  of Ed.   Ed Gilroy has been a trusted adviser, dedicated public servant,  distinguished colleague, and an invaluable member of our committee  family. We are deeply grateful for his many years of service to the  American people and the U.S. House of Representatives, and we wish him  all the best in the years ahead.                 25th Anniversary of the First Charter School     Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago, something monumental occurred  for students and families who were seeking a new way to pursue a high- quality education. Twenty-five years ago, our Nation's first charter  school, the City Academy, opened its doors in St. Paul, Minnesota. City  Academy began a new era for school choice and provided families with an  alternative option to the traditional public school system. Today, over  3 million students are enrolled in charter schools, and more than 6,800  have opened in over 40 States.   Charter schools are not only growing as an option for students, but  these schools are also getting results. Innovative charter schools are  providing thousands of students and families with the hope and  opportunity that they can receive a high-quality education and gain the  skills they need to succeed for the future.   I congratulate City Academy for being a true pioneer in school choice  25 years ago and support the expansion of school choice for American  students and families.                     Honoring Alexander Furniture Academy     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to honor a Catawba  County native.   Mr. Greg Brunt has won more than 100 medals in the Special Olympics  and serves as an inspiration to the wider Catawba community and, in my  opinion, the Nation.   Mr. Brunt's road cannot have been easy. He has overcome challenges  that many Americans don't have to face. Instead of giving in, Mr. Brunt  gives back. As a swimming instructor to younger students, Mr. Brunt  teaches children the value of practice and perseverance.   Mr. Brunt has earned many Special Olympic medals, and has aspirations  of being in the Catawba County Hall of Fame. Though I am not a voting  member of the board, Mr. Brunt would have my vote.   Additionally, I was thrilled to learn that Mr. Brunt is a man of  faith, who attends Corinth Reformed Church, and that his favorite song  is ``Amazing Grace.''   When I think of the amazing accomplishments Mr. Brunt has achieved, I  cannot help but think, how sweet the sound.   I wholeheartedly congratulate Mr. Brunt on all of his many wins, and  wish him continued success.                            ____________________
