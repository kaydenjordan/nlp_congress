 Madam Chair, today the House is taking long overdue  action in fulfilling our promise to the American people to lower the  cost of prescription drugs. Medical research has fueled lifesaving  advancements in medicine, but these innovations remain out of reach for  too many due to exorbitantly high costs.   Tragically, 3 in 10 adults reported not taking their medicines as  prescribed at some point because of the cost. Even those who can afford  their prescriptions are charged prices many times higher than in other  developed countries. This is simply unacceptable.   H.R. 3 puts us on a path towards a more equitable healthcare system  where cost is no barrier to getting the care patients need. In  particular, I want to highlight my legislation, the Protecting Medicare  Beneficiaries with Preexisting Conditions Act, now included in H.R. 3  as Section 801.   More than 13 million beneficiaries have a supplemental insurance  policy known as Medigap. Medigap helps lower out-of-pocket costs, but  some 30 million more Americans are unable to buy a Medigap plan without  being charged more for a preexisting condition. Specifically, disabled  Americans under 65 and Medicare Advantage enrollees are not afforded  the same coverage guarantees as nearly every other American.   The Affordable Care Act rightly eradicated discrimination for  preexisting conditions in the individual market. We need to finally  right this wrong for Medicare beneficiaries as well, and that is  exactly what this bill does.   I look forward to this Chamber passing H.R. 3 to give more Americans  peace of mind when buying their insurance and standing at the pharmacy  counter. I hope all my colleagues on  [[Page H10111]]  both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting this bill.
