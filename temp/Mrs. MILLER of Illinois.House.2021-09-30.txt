 Madam Speaker, I had the privilege of  visiting the border with President Trump in June to see our Border  Patrol agents doing one of the most dangerous jobs imaginable. They  face the threat of MS-13 and violent drug cartels who have been  empowered and enriched by the Biden administration.   Sadly, the left is vilifying the Border Patrol the same way they  vilified our police officers during the defund the police movement.   The American people want secure borders and safe communities. Even  President Obama this week said Biden's open border policies are  unsustainable because we are a nation with borders. I want to thank  President Obama for affirming that we are a nation of laws and a nation  with borders, and I hope the Biden administration will listen to him.                            ____________________
