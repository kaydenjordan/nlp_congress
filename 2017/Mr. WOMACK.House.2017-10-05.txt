 Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished chairwoman of the  Budget Committee for her outstanding work.   My friend from Tennessee talks about driving forward. I think we need  to pump the brakes. You are driving right off a cliff with this budget.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition. It is my strong belief that our  Nation has a debt crisis on its hand, and I am astonished by how many  people on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Chairman, just refuse to  acknowledge the problem. It is as if the problem doesn't exist.   Under their plan, taxes are going to be raised nearly $3 trillion. We  are going to continue to raise spending to the tune of over $6  trillion. We will have a meager $2.6 billion in deficit reduction, by  the way, compared to our budget that does well over $6 trillion in  deficit reduction.   Our Nation is $20 trillion in debt, and it is a complete absurdity to  think that we could begin to relinquish this process if we enacted such  a burdensome budgetary proposal that is being offered by our friends on  the other side of the aisle.   This budget would also diminish our national security apparatus. It  would end the global war on terrorism fund by 2019. Let's go ahead and  telegraph that we are going to end the global war on terrorism fund by  2019. The only people who I know who would support that would be our  adversaries.   It seeks to promote the collapsing Affordable Care Act by keeping  those burdensome mandates in place. This resolution before us right now  refuses to do anything about the runaway entitlement programs that are  the primary drivers of the deficit and debt in the country.   Mr. Chairman, their budget just will never balance. Never.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Simpson). The time of the gentleman has  expired.                                time  1030     It will give no reconciliation instruction so that we can  finally get control and protect for long-term sustainability the social  safety net program that many depend on.   The bottom line is, you either acknowledge we have a deficit and a  debt crisis, or you do not. And if you believe as I do, you will refuse  this budget, and you will support ours.
