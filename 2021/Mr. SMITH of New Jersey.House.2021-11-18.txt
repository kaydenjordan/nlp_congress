 Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Conference of Catholic  Bishops said it was completely unacceptable that the Build Back Better  Act expands taxpayer funding of abortion in many new and expanding  programs.   The National Right to Life Committee has pointed out that even  ObamaCare contained a provision that specifically permitted States to  ban elective abortions in their exchanges. The BBB, starting in 2024,  would explicitly override the laws of those States.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Biden once said that those of us who are opposed to  abortion should not be compelled to pay for them. This bill coerces us  to pay for abortion on demand.   Mr. Speaker, unborn babies need the President of the United States  and Members of Congress to be their friends and advocates, not powerful  adversaries subsidizing their violent destruction.                                time  1215
