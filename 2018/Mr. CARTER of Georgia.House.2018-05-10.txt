 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of  Chairman Shimkus' bill, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of  2018.   This legislation is important not only because of what it means to  the future of clean energy opportunities for this country, but also  what this means for our communities. Nuclear energy has become a safe  and effective way to generate energy, all while not producing  greenhouse gas emissions.   The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act would finally put in place a  permanent repository for the waste generated by nuclear energy  production that powers millions of homes and businesses across the  country. We began this process nearly 30 years ago, and today we move  it forward.   My good friend's legislation authorizes the disposal of spent nuclear  fuel in a safe, permanent place. Right now, spent fuel is sitting on  nuclear energy sites around the country, leaving our communities open  to larger vulnerabilities and possible attacks or accidents.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Nuclear Waste  Policy Amendments Act, and I thank the gentleman for his leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. James F. Fuller, Sr., the longtime mayor of Ludowici in the  First Congressional District of Georgia.   Mayor Fuller worked in every area possible to serve the people of  Ludowici. He began working for Ludowici as a police officer, then  police chief, then finally water superintendent. Forty-two years ago,  Mayor Fuller was elected to his first term on city council. When he  passed, he was completing his second term as the city's mayor. Not only  did he lend his hand to Ludowici but also to our Nation as a whole,  serving in the Navy during the Korean war.   A true public servant, Mayor Fuller was fulfilling his pledge as the  city's leading official up until the very last moments before his  passing. Even in the hospital, he said he would never get tired of  talking about Ludowici and doing what he can for the people there.  Mayor Fuller passed away on April 27 at the age of 83. His family,  friends, and the city of Ludowici are in my thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________
