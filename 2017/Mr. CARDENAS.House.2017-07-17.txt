 Mr. Speaker, I have the honor and the privilege of  being a United States Congressman, and with that comes tremendous  responsibility. We have a country of over 320 million people--men,  women, and children. And right now, we may be days away or even a  couple of weeks away from watching the United States Senate possibly  change healthcare for America like we have never seen before.   I hope and pray that my colleagues in both Houses and the President  of the United States try their best to make sure that we enhance  healthcare access rather than divert more than 20 million people away  from being able to see a doctor.   Just last week I was visited by some young folks and I was given this  red band called ``Will Power'' for a little boy named Will, who has  gone through many operations. If these bills see the light of day and  the President's desk and gets into law, people like Will just might not  be around very much longer.   Mr. Speaker, let's hope and pray that we do the right thing                            ____________________
