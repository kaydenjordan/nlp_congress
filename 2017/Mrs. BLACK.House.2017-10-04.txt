 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 71, currently under consideration.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 71, our budget,  Building a Better America. Our budget takes real, tangible steps to  balance the budget, build a stronger military, unlock tax reform, and  support an economy that creates opportunity for all Americans.   In past years, our budget resolution was a vision document, but this  year it is different. With the election of President Trump, our budget  goes from being a vision document to being a governing document that  outlines how we build a better America for our children and our  grandchildren.   Today, we have the opportunity to fulfill our promises to the  American people. Balancing the budget by 2027 is our top priority. Our  national debt stands at $20 trillion, with $9 trillion added over just  the last 8 years. For too long, both parties in Washington have failed  to abide by a simple principle that all American families and small  businesses do, that we must live within our means.   Balancing the budget requires us to make some tough decisions, but  the consequences of inaction far outweigh any political risk we may  face.   Unless we take bold steps to bring our excessive spending and debt  under control, a sovereign debt crisis is the natural conclusion.  Failure to take swift and decisive action is not only inexcusable, it  is immoral.   The budget resolution before us takes real steps to put our country  on a sound fiscal path that balances in 10 years and will allow us to  start paying down our national debt.   Building a Better America also assumes bold reforms to strengthening  programs that our seniors and our most vulnerable citizens rely on and  ensure that these programs can continue to serve them for generations  to come.   While our budget includes reforms to discretionary spending, we also  strongly believe that mandatory spending must be addressed in this  budget resolution and in budget resolutions to come.   Mandatory spending is already more than two-thirds of all of our  Federal spending, and that number will only continue to grow, and that  is why our committee felt strongly about addressing mandatory spending  programs in this budget through reconciliation.   Our budget requires 11 authorizing committees to find a minimum of  $203 billion in savings and reforms over the 10-year budget window with  an expectation that the reforms will result in significantly higher  savings.   This package of mandatory reforms is the largest since the 1990s,  through reconciliation, and it is the first step to change the culture  of Washington in our spending.   Our budget also promotes tax reform and regulatory reform to get the  Federal Government out of the way and allow our free market economy to  thrive. The larger the government, the less freedom individuals and  businesses have to thrive, grow, hire, and innovate. The Obama economy  left millions of Americans behind with over 14 million people leaving  the labor workforce in just the last 8 years.  [[Page H7778]]    Through reconciliation, our budget specifically paves the way for  progrowth tax reform that will reduce taxes for the middle class  Americans and free up American businesses to grow and to hire. It will  also simplify the Tax Code, allowing about 9 out of 10 Americans to  file their taxes on a simple postcard.   Many of our friends across the aisle and in the media said that a 1.9  percent economic growth is the new normal and that we are doomed to  continue the economic stagnation of the Obama years.   They have a pessimistic view of our Nation's ability to create jobs  and to build our foundation of greater opportunity for all.   America has the greatest workers, the greatest innovators, and the  entrepreneurial ethos to far surpass the economic growth of the last 8  years, if only the Federal Government would get out of the way.    In this budget, we put our trust in the American people. But a  stronger economy is not enough; we must also strengthen our military.   The number one job of the Federal Government is to protect its  citizens. Over the last 8 years, the weak foreign policy of President  Obama has led to an increase in threats from all corners of the globe  while the funding for our men and women in uniform has failed to keep  pace. Building a Better America invests $621.5 billion in our military  and $75 billion specifically for the global war on terrorism for fiscal  year 2018. These resources will help our men and women in uniform  complete the mission with which they have been tasked.   Building a Better America presents us with an opportunity to change  the trajectory of our country forever. The election of President Trump  was a signal to all of us that the American people will no longer  accept the status quo.   This budget is also a very personal one for me. As I and my committee  have gone through the long and arduous process of getting this budget  to the floor, I have had to stop and think about not just what we are  doing but where we are going.   I have a picture of my six grandchildren taped to the back of my  voting card. I was a nurse for more than 40 years and still hold my  license today. Government and public service was never an ambition of  mine, but when I saw what was happening in my State and in this  country, I couldn't sit back and do nothing.   Every time I put my voting card into a slot, I am reminded of why I  left the career that I loved to join the political fray. It is for  them. It is for my children and grandchildren and for yours as well.   I grew up in an America where a poor girl, whose parents' only  ambition was for her to finish high school, could graduate from  college, become a nurse, and eventually become a Member of the House of  Representatives.   I grew up in an America that was a land of--that is a land of  opportunity and was a land of opportunity then of strength and of  compassion. But that America is slipping away from us. For too many  young people in this country, the opportunity to live the American  Dream is out of reach. A government that was supposed to be of, by, and  for the people has left them behind.   Building a Better America requires a government that spends within  its means, a military with the resources to complete the mission, an  economy that creates the opportunity for all, and a Federal bureaucracy  that respects the taxpayers.   It also requires an understanding that the greatness of America does  not lie in the grand buildings and the stone pillars of Washington,  D.C. The greatness of America lies in the spirit and the tenacity of  the people.   We designed Building a Better America to put this vision into  practice, to empower individuals to live their version of the American  Dream. Future generations of Americans are counting on us, and failure  is not an option.   I want to take this opportunity to thank the members of this  committee for their hard work that they have done, for the months that  we have worked tirelessly to come together and build a budget that  reflects our principles.   It hasn't been easy, but producing a budget that puts our vision for  fiscal sanity into practice will be worth it, and I thank each and  every one of you for your hard work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Rokita), the vice chair of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), who is also a member of our committee and  also of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), a member of the Budget Committee and also the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chair, I want to remind my colleagues from the other  side of the aisle that, during the time of the previous administration,  there was $9 trillion added to the debt, 1.9 percent economic growth,  and that was the high of that period of time, and there were 14 million  people who left the labor workforce. If their policies worked, we  wouldn't see these kinds of statistics.   Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock), a member of our Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), a member of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I want to remind my colleagues on the other side that  we are talking about the budget. We are not talking about tax reform.  We are going to have an opportunity to talk about that later.   Our budget does not assume that tax cuts pay for themselves, and our  budget does not reflect that claim. Our budget includes a host of pro- growth economic policies, including comprehensive tax reform, as one of  those, but regulatory reform; a reform in the improper payments;  restoration of incentives for people to work and save and invest.   Most economists believe that this bundle of pro-growth tax policies  will lead to a stronger economy than what we have under the current  law. But we are talking about the budget here. So I would like for my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to speak about the budget,  and we will talk about tax reform at another time.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas  (Mr. Westerman), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Sanford), a member of our Budget Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from South Carolina.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Roskam), who is the chairman of the Tax Policy  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington), a member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman), who is a member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Womack), my dear friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), a member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I tell you what is cruel. That is doing the  same thing over and over again and getting the same results. That is  cruel. Especially when we look in our grandchildren's eyes and say: We  are really sorry we didn't take 40-year-old programs and reform them so  they could be better, so we could reduce the spending, we could give  good services and reduce the spending. That is cruel when you don't do  that.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Lewis), a member of our Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Chairman, I do want to talk about common sense just  for a moment. Common sense is if our other OECD countries have an  average corporate rate of 18 to 20 percent and ours is between 35 and  39, and we have companies that now decide to go overseas. It seems to  me to be common sense to at least be equal to what other countries are  doing.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Smucker), a member of our Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).   (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Mexico (Mr. Pearce).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Alaska (Mr. Young).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time so we can  hear from the Joint Economic Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I do want to just begin this next section by making a  brief comment about my good friend from Kentucky, who has been using  some information off of Forbes as he responds to our speakers. I just  want to say, I went out to look at Forbes to see what was on Forbes  while we were on this brief intermission, and I found this article that  was in Forbes just the day before yesterday that does say that the GOP  tax framework is a pay raise for middle class families.                                time  1715    I encourage people to take a look at this. It actually does some  scenarios for what we know at this point in time. However, I do want to  say that what has been put out is a framework. It doesn't really have  enough details to give too much on these scenarios, because there are  some very important pieces that are missing.   Guessing on these key points really doesn't allow us to do a proper  analysis. Things like the brackets have not been definitively defined,  and neither have the income thresholds or the enhanced child credit.   I think it is a little bit disingenuous to think that is really where  we should be using those numbers right at this point in time to give a  definitive scenario. I did want to say that that would be a good thing  for people to look at if they would like to get a brief idea.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter that has been signed  by 242 agencies and think tanks supporting this budget.   Among those who have signed this letter are the American Bankers  Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, Americans for Tax Reform,  Business Roundtable, Financial Services Forum, Manufactured Housing  Institute, National Association of Manufacturers, the National Black  Chamber of Commerce, National Grocers Association, National Retail  Federation, Tennessee Chamber of Commerce & Industry, The Kentucky  Chamber, and U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among many others.                                                 September 28, 2017.      To The Members of the United States Congress: We urge       Congress to expeditiously pass a budget resolution with       reconciliation instructions so that the promise of tax reform       can be made a reality.        It has been 31 years since Congress last reformed the tax       code. Since then, the code has become an anchor weighing down       the economy, job creation, and wage growth for American       families.        This Congress has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix       the problem. Over the past several years, tremendous work has       been done to prepare for this moment. In the 113th Congress       the Ways and Means Committee conducted a comprehensive look       at tax reform. Last year House Republicans released a       Blueprint for reform. During the last Congress, the Senate       Finance Committee convened bi-partisan working groups that       tackled all the major aspects of reform.        President Trump has outlined his goals for reform, and the       ``Group of Six''--consisting of members from the House,       Senate, and Administration--has presented a framework to       guide the drafting and markup of legislation in the Ways and       Means and Finance Committees.        While much work remains to be done, we believe Congress is       well-positioned to move forward with comprehensive, pro-      growth tax reform.        The single-most important next step is for Congress to       adopt a budget resolution with reconciliation instructions       that will permit tax reform to move forward without the       threat of a filibuster.        Just like Members of Congress, each of our organizations       will continue to advocate for specific priorities within tax       reform as the relevant committees and ultimately the full       House and Senate consider tax reform legislation.        But failing to pass a budget resolution now may mean that       tax reform never moves forward. That outcome is unacceptable       to all of us and ought to be unacceptable to every Member of       Congress who has advocated for reform.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the  Compact for a Balanced Budget Commission, and I will read a portion of  this letter. They say: ``Dear Chairman Black: We have reviewed the text  of the budget resolution reported by your committee, H. Con. Res. 71,  and write to offer our support. That rarest of political outcomes-- sound policy that represents a win-win scenario for normally divergent  factions--is possible as the budget process moves forward.   ``Our Nation is facing a fiscal crisis. It is essential that the  Federal budget returns to balance within the 10-year budget period  because runaway Federal debt is not political or partisan--it is an  economic, generational, and civil rights issue. We commend you and your  committee for reporting a resolution that balances within the budget  period; its adoption is very much in the national interest.''   And again, this comes from The Compact Commission, Compact for a  Balanced Budget.           The Compact Commission, c/o Compact for America             Educational Foundation, Inc.,                                       Houston, TX, August 8, 2017.      Re 2018 House Budget Resolution and the Compact for a           Balanced Budget.       Hon. Diane Black,      Chairman, House Budget Committee, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Black: We have reviewed the text of the       budget resolution reported by your Committee (House       Concurrent Resolution 71) and write to offer our support.       That rarest of political outcomes--sound policy that       represents a win-win scenario for normally divergent       factions--is possible as the budget process moves forward.        Our nation is facing a fiscal crisis. It is essential that       the federal budget returns to balance within the ten-year       budget period because runaway federal debt is not political       or partisan--it is an economic, generational and civil-rights       issue. We commend you and your Committee for reporting a       resolution that balances within the budget period; its       adoption is very much in the national interest.        We also commend the Committee for including Section 501 in       the resolution, which endorses adding a balanced budget       requirement to the Constitution.        Section 501 identifies the Compact for a Balanced Budget,       which we represent on behalf of current and future member       states. We believe the most practical, prudent enforcement       mechanism is the state-of-the-art balanced budget amendment       (BBA) being proposed by the Compact. This state-of-the-art       BBA has been specifically designed to overcome concerns       expressed in 40 years of congressional hearings that have       considered how a BBA should be drafted. Such concerns may       have prevented prior BBAs from being proposed.        To advance the policy prescription in Section 501 of the       budget resolution in the House, we recommend: updating this       section to reflect that the concurrent resolution to       effectuate the Compact (House Concurrent Resolution 73) was       introduced on July 26, 2017; and incorporating the language       of House Concurrent Resolution 73 into Section 501. This       could be done as one of several amendments you are probably       already planning to bring up during floor consideration as       the manager's package, and requires only a majority vote as       opposed to the two-thirds required for balanced budget       amendment proposals made by members of Congress.        Taking these steps establishes a strong enforcement       mechanism, sustaining the budget resolution following its       adoption. It would also strengthen the appeal of the budget       resolution to fiscal conservatives in the House and taking       these steps prior to the consideration of legislation to       raise the debt ceiling should expedite approval of that       legislation.        Supermajorities of Americans have demanded a balanced       budget for decades. Our nation's debt threatens future       generations to default or austerity, but we believe there's a       chance here for a third option: principled leadership on the       matter of debt and spending.        We hope you and your Committee members will agree that       there is a path here which acknowledges the need for long-      term fiscal  [[Page H7803]]       sanity while also meeting shorter-term political and policy       needs.            Regards,      Chair Mead Treadwell,        Alaska Commissioner.      Vice Chair Paulate Rakestraw,        Georgia Commissioner.      Greg Snowden,        Mississippi Commissioner.     Mr. Chairman, I want to just bounce off of that and take  a look at the chart that we have here. When we take a look at  interest--and somehow we don't always talk that much about interest  here. We talk about borrowing money and raising our debt ceiling  continually. I have been here now for 6\1/2\ years, and the  conversation is about raising that debt ceiling so that we can pay for  our debt, but there comes interest on that.   Just as when we go to a bank and we borrow money, we have to pay  interest on that. I remember years ago, when I bought my first house,  we were at a period of time when President Carter was the President and  the interest rates were outrageous, and our interest rate on our house  at that time, when we purchased it as a young married couple, was, I  think, somewhere between 14 and 16 percent.   Interest rates now are very much more reasonable for young couples  purchasing. And so I want to turn our attention to this chart here to  take a look at the outlays in 2027 under the CBO baseline.   If we continue down this path that we are going in, without taking a  look at our mandatory spending, the amount of money that we borrow, and  the debt that we pile up with an interest to it, just what will that  look like?                                time  1745    I think if we look at our own household and we would say that our  interest that we are paying on the credit card or whatever, or the car  interest or the House mortgage, if it were more than all of the other  things like the food and maybe the education for our children and  buying books and pencils and things that they need for school, we would  be looking at the way in which we were managing our household income  and saying, wow, that is not something we want to keep doing. We are  going to have to get on some kind of a budget plan and reverse the  trajectory of where we would be going.   So here we are. At the end of the period of 2027, if we look at 17  years down the road and we don't do anything about the kind of  mandatory spending, which is two-thirds of our budget, currently, and  continues to grow, here is what happens:   We see $768 billion being spent on interest alone.   We see the next one down, the defense, at $741 billion. We would  actually be paying more in interest than we were in the security of our  Nation and supporting our men and women who serve in the military, and  all of the supplies and the necessary equipment that it takes to  protect them as they protect us.   Look at what happens with Medicaid. We will be spending less on  Medicaid that is for people who are the blind, the disabled, the  elderly, the children, the pregnant mothers.   We talk about wanting to put our money and our values where we see  the values really belong. Is this really where we want our values to be  in the money that we spend, $768 billion in interest compared to what  we are spending on our military, what we are spending on our Medicaid?   Look at our veterans, our veterans that we talk about how much we  honor them: $248 billion as opposed to $768 billion in interest.   Again, we must question where we are going and if this is the right  direction. Is this the direction that we can all just raise our hand up  and say, yes, we are making good decisions for the future of our  country? Because look at where the interest is compared to the other  programs that we both, Republicans and Democrats, have said are so  important to us.   Over and over again, we have had colleagues on both sides of the  aisle go and speak about the importance of what our values are. Our  budget is a vision of what our values are.   Transportation, and I have heard more and more times on both sides of  the aisle talking about infrastructure, how important that is for our  Nation. Look at what our transportation and our infrastructure will be.  I don't know that we want to spend only $110 billion on that and $768  billion on interest. Think of how many roads we could build, how many  bridges we could repair if we reverse this trajectory.   Then, finally, at the bottom here is science-based technology. We all  want to be competitive with those around the world to make sure that we  are spending the money where we need to spend the money to stay in  front of these other nations with our science and our space and our  technology.   I want to recommend here that there are only two other programs,  Social Security and Medicare, that exceed that net interest. So we will  say Social Security, Medicare, and then our net interest; and from  there, everything else that we say, both the Republicans and the  Democrats, are so important, that we say are our values, are going to  be underneath the interest. I don't think that is really where we want  to go.   I have to think, my oldest grandchild right now is 19 years old, soon  to turn 20, when he is 30 years old, he might say to me: Mimi, what  were you doing when you were in Congress? What were you doing to help  us, because now we are paying more in interest than we are all of these  other programs that we contend to be so important to us?   So these are difficult decisions to make, I will acknowledge that.  But I will also say to you, as someone who--I consider myself to be a  policy wonk. As I look at these various programs, I say there is  nothing that we are doing in my life that I did 40 years ago that I am  doing exactly the same. So if a program has been around for 40 years,  should we not want to say maybe we can reform it? Not necessarily cut,  but, in the reforming, you may find a way to decrease the spending that  you are doing in that program.   Can't we all lock arms, Democrats and Republicans, and acknowledge  that there are some decisions that have to be made with programs that  have been there for a very long time?   Can we not acknowledge that there are some programs that perhaps have  fraud, waste, and abuse that we can take care of, take that money and  use it in these places where we really say our values lie?   So I would say that, as we talk about this budget, I am very proud of  what we have done in this budget, in the cuts or, as I say, reforms in  those programs that would result in $203 billion worth of savings over  a 10-year period, that these are programs that we gave the committees  of jurisdiction an opportunity to look within their jurisdiction and to  make those decisions and do the homework. It is your jurisdiction; it  is not mine. We gave them recommendations and suggestions, but it is  their jurisdiction.   Let them evaluate where it is that there are programs that can have  new and creative ideas, things that can save us money, not necessarily  using the word ``cut,'' but in savings. Yes, you may have some cuts  that are done, but these are good cuts. These are things that you have  spent a lot of time thinking about.   That is really where we want to go. That is what this budget does is  it says: Open up your minds. Think differently. Let's not do things the  same old way and keep putting the same old programs out there that  maybe aren't working.   And you know what? Maybe they are not even working for the people  that we give them to. Maybe they are not working for them, because work  is dignity.   When we say that someone who is able-bodied and without any  dependents should be at work, that is not cruel. Do you know what that  is? That is dignity. When people go to work, it is a dignified  activity.    I always say, after I ask you what your name is, and we all do it, we  say: What do you do? And when someone cannot tell you what they do,  they don't feel dignified.   Look, I don't want to be cruel to people who are disabled, people who  are having a really tough time and have other circumstances, but we  should acknowledge that there is dignity in work; and when we can give  people an opportunity to have that dignity, we should be willing to  stand up and do that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H7804]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I likewise, would like to just say that the ranking member, Mr.  Yarmuth, has just been wonderful to work with, and we may have  differences of opinion, but we can do it in a very Southern hospitality  way. I just so much appreciate his demeanor, his leadership on the  committee, the way he honors the members of the committee, both  Democrats and Republicans, and it has just been a joy to work with him.  I am going to miss working with him and being able to have lively  debate, which is good for this body and it is good for America.   I want to also thank all the members who participated in the debate  today, both the Democrats and the Republicans. This is what our  democracy is about, being able to voice our opinions and at the end of  the day being able to come to a conclusion after that debate. I look  forward to continuing discussion and voting on the final passage  tomorrow.   As we finish up, I also want to thank our staff for their hard work,  and there are many of them, so I am not going to read all of them to  you. I do want to mention some of those who are the leaders of the  House Budget Committee staff and have just been great to work with.   Rick May, who is the staff director; Jenna Spealman; Andy Morton; Tim  Flynn; Mary, who has been here with me at my side the entire time. What  would I do without having somebody to pass papers to us? So Mary has  been great. Jim Bates, and I am going to leave it at that because I am  going to get in trouble if I don't announce all of them.   The staff has just been tremendous to work with, many hours,  weekends, and, indeed, even holidays that they have been here helping  to gather the information both for the Budget Committee hearings and  then, also, for this today.   Mr. Chairman, I look forward to a more lively debate tomorrow. I  include in the Record the names of the staff of the Budget Committee.
