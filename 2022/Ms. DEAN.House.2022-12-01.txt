 Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a devoted community  leader and friend, Margaret ``Peggy'' Palmer, who passed away on  October 27.   A native of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, Peggy gave her time, her  energy, and her love to our community in Montgomery County.   She was guided by her strong faith and was a committed member of the  First Baptist Church of Crestmont. She was also a guiding light for  civic engagement, serving as a committee person with the ARDC. Peggy  was a relentless volunteer for Democratic candidates that began when  she volunteered with her beloved mother, Lillian, for President Obama's  2008 campaign. She also worked as court crier and served as a member of  the Willow Grove NAACP.   No matter the role, Peggy worked harder than anyone, always with her  signature kindness, humility, Jolly Ranchers, and red lipstick. She  greeted everyone the same, with a hug and a kiss and ``hey, baby.''   She was loved by her family. Until the day she died, Peggy cared for  her whole family, especially her dear brother, Johnny.   I join Johnny and the rest of our community in mourning her passing.  Her legacy lives on in the lives of the people she inspired, including  me.                            ____________________
