 Madam Speaker, this week is National Public Schools  Week. This is a week where we recognize all the schools, all the  educators, all the students, and every educational professional's hard  work that goes into a student's success.   The strength of our Nation's public schools is a direct reflection of  the strength of our Nation and a direct reflection on the strength of  the future.   I stand here in solidarity to recognize the great work these  professionals commit themselves to. Educators and educational  professionals dedicate their lives to all students, regardless of where  they come from, and help them achieve in every single aspect of their  lives.   I am also proud to be a cosponsor of H. Res. 862, designating this  week as National Public Schools Week.   I thank all of the educators, educational professionals, and students  whom those professionals will be shaping into the next generation of  this great generation of America. May God bless them all.                            ____________________
