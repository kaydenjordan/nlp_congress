 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor the  life of my dear friend and a giant of a west Texan, Delbert McDougal,  who passed away last week after 86 years of unwavering devotion to God,  his family, and the Lubbock community.   Delbert was born and raised in Hockley County, USA, where he learned  at a young age the importance of hard work by chopping weeds in a  cotton patch for 45 cents an hour.   He met his wife, Carolyn, in 1954. Together, they started their  family and began working to transform our community with countless real  estate endeavors, including the largest privately financed urban  renewal project in America.   The citizens of Lubbock enjoy a better quality of life and have a  brighter future because of Delbert McDougal's big vision, his bold  leadership, and his boundless love for all things west Texas.   God blessed west Texas with that great man, Delbert McDougal, and I  pray that He will comfort the McDougal family in the days to come.   Go west Texas.                            ____________________
