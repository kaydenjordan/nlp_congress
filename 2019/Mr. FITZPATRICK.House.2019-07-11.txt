 Mr. Chair, I stand today in strong support of this  bipartisan amendment which includes language from the 911 SAVES Act,  H.R. 1629.   Public safety telecommunicators play a pivotal role in coordinating  effective responses to crises affecting our communities. By directing  the urgent concerns of the public to law enforcement officials, public  safety telecommunicators work to ensure emergency services are  delivered where needed.   Today, there are nearly 100,000 public safety telecommunicators  serving in over 6,000 call centers across the United States. Their  diligence, dedication to public well-being, and steady demeanor in the  presence of turmoil is needed now more than ever.    I am proud to partner with my colleague from California, a former 911  dispatcher herself, Mrs. Torres, to ensure these dedicated public  servants receive the ``protective service occupations'' classification  from OMB which they deserve. We owe this to those who are often the  first to respond to emergencies in our communities each and every day.
