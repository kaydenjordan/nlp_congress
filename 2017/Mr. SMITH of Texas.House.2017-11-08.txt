 Mr. Speaker, a front-page story in Roll Call  about Chief of Staff General Kelly is as misleading as you can get. It  clearly is an intentional hit job.   The headline read: ``Kelly's Antics Rankle Capitol.'' The article  claims, ``GOP and Democratic Members are united'' in not wanting  General Kelly to speak out. But only one Republican, known for his  criticism of this administration, is quoted, compared to four  Democrats. Of the four Democrats, three are current Members of  Congress, and one is a former Clinton administration official.   So much for balance, and so much for the article's unfounded claim.  This is what passes for journalism these days. When you see stories  like this one, you begin to understand why the President is right to  use the term ``fake news.''   I doubt General Kelly will be intimidated, and I hope he will  continue to speak out.                            ____________________
