 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today is tax day, not typically a day of  celebration for anyone, with maybe the exception of the IRS. But this  year there is--believe it or not--something to celebrate because tax  day 2018 marks the end of the old tax system.   Next year, Americans will be filling out their taxes under the new  tax system that was created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That means  that they will be paying less in taxes and keeping more of their hard- earned money.  [[Page S2208]]    If anything became clear during the last election cycle, it was that  the economy was not working well for American families. In CNN exit  polling, 62 percent of voters rated the economy as poor, and that  wasn't surprising. The Obama administration was tough for American  workers. Job creation was sluggish, wages were stagnant, and economic  growth lagged far behind the pace of other recoveries. Opportunities  for workers were few and far between. It is no wonder that so many  hard-working Americans felt like they had been left behind.   Republicans were listening, and one of our top priorities in this  Congress has been improving the economic outlook for the American  people, which is why last fall we took up tax reform.   The Tax Code may not be the first thing people think of when they  think of economic prosperity, but it actually plays a key role in  determining the success of individual families and of our economy as a  whole. The more money the Federal Government takes from you in taxes,  the less money you have to pay bills or to buy a house or repair your  car or save for retirement. The more money a business has to give to  the Federal Government, the less money it has to grow the business and  to invest in its workers.   So when it came time to draft a tax bill, Republicans had two goals.  First, we wanted to put more money in the pockets of hard-working  Americans right away. Second, we wanted to create the kind of economy  that would give Americans access to economic security over the long  term.   Now, I am proud to report that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has already  achieved the first goal and is well on its way to achieving the second.  To put more money in Americans' pockets, we lowered tax rates across  the board and nearly doubled the standard deduction--the amount of  Americans' income that is automatically free from taxation.   We also acted to provide relief for parents, who are doing the hard  work of raising the next generation, by doubling the child tax credit  and allowing more parents to claim the credit. We eliminated the  individual mandate tax, which disproportionately hit low-income  families. We also made sure to protect key retirement savings plans-- 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts--and we improved education  savings accounts, allowing families to use their 529 plans to save for  elementary and secondary as well as higher education.   Thanks to the IRS's new withholding tables and its new withholding  calculator, Americans have already started seeing the new tax relief in  their paychecks.   For a lot of Americans, that is not all they are seeing in their  paychecks. A lot of Americans are also seeing pay increases or bonuses  thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   That brings me to our second reform goal, which was creating the kind  of economy that would give Americans access to economic security and  prosperity for the long term. We knew that the only way to give  Americans access to real long-term economic security was to ensure that  they had access to good jobs, good wages, and real opportunities. We  knew that the only way to guarantee access to good jobs, wages, and  opportunities was to make sure that businesses had the ability to  create and maintain them.   But before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our Tax Code wasn't helping  businesses to create jobs or to increase opportunities for workers. In  fact, it was doing the opposite, and that had real consequences for  American workers.   A small business owner struggling to afford the hefty annual tax bill  for her business was highly unlikely to be able to hire a new worker or  to raise wages. A larger business struggling to stay competitive in the  global marketplace while paying a substantially higher tax rate than  its foreign competitors too often had limited funds to expand or  increase investment here in the United States.   So when it came time for tax reform, we set out to improve the  playing field for American workers by improving the playing field for  businesses as well. To accomplish that, we lowered tax rates across the  board for owners of small and medium-sized businesses and farms and  ranches. We lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax rate which, up  until January 1, was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed  world. We expanded business owners' ability to recover investments they  make in their businesses, which frees up cash they can reinvest in  their operations and their workers.   We brought the U.S. international tax system into the 21st century by  replacing our outdated worldwide system with a modernized territorial  tax system so that American businesses are not operating at a  disadvantage relative to their foreign competitors.   The goal in all of this was to free up businesses to increase  investments in the U.S. economy, to hire new workers, and to increase  wages and benefits, and that is exactly what they are doing.   In response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, more than 500 companies  across this country, and counting, have announced good news for  American workers. Company after company has announced pay raises,  bonuses, 401(k) match increases, and other benefits.   Others are expanding their businesses and investing in new equipment  and facilities. Still others are passing tax savings on to their  customers in the form of things like utility rate cuts. That means more  money for Americans now and more money for Americans in the future.   Tax day may never be a fun day, but Americans can take heart because  thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, next year's tax day is going to be  a lot less painful.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to speak today to the Coast Guard  Authorization Act of 2017, of which I am a cosponsor. As chairman of  the Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Coast Guard, I  am proud that we were able to bring this important bipartisan  legislation, which was originally introduced by Senator Sullivan, to  the floor today for consideration. The bill that we are debating will  increase our national security, protect our maritime industry, increase  safety for the boating public, and provide consistency for those who  depend on the water for their daily work.   As anyone impacted by the 2017 hurricane season will tell you, the  Coast Guard plays a vitally important role in our Nation's first  response efforts. Equally critical is the Coast Guard's role as a  member of our U.S. military. Coast Guard women and men protect our  waterways, defend our shores, interdict contraband, arrest human  traffickers, guarantee the free movement of commerce, and ensure the  stewardship of our national resources.   On any given day, the Coast Guard responds to an average of 45 search  and rescue missions, seizes 1,500 pounds of drugs, interdicts 17  illegal migrants, conducts 16 security boardings, and facilitates the  movement of $12.6 billion worth of goods. These professionals do their  job without seeking recognition or acknowledgement. It often goes  overlooked that our coastguardsmen are serving across every ocean and  on every continent, including Antarctica. They serve across the Middle  East, including in both Iraq and Afghanistan. They help protect our  Navy's ships, defend against pirates, and ensure our strategic ports  remain open.   This legislation provides the Coast Guard the authority to better  carry out those missions, including defending our critical ballistic  submarines when they are surfaced and at their most vulnerable. In one  way or another, the Coast Guard affects every American, even in my home  State of South Dakota. We may not have a coastline, but the work of the  Coast Guard helps facilitate the export of agricultural products that  drive our State's economy. The Coast Guard also provides boating safety  classes and outreach to tens of thousands of my fellow South Dakotans.  This outreach saves lives every single day.   This past year was the deadliest for boaters in the past 5 years,  with a 12-percent increase in deaths. Many of those deaths could have  been prevented, and this legislation seeks to make improvements to  boater safety, such as requiring the use of an engine cutoff switch for  certain recreational boats. Maybe you have seen the videos of boaters  falling overboard and their boat continuing in circles and hitting  them, often seriously injuring or even killing them. This change,  supported by the recreational boating community, will prevent these  types of incidents in the future.   This legislation also provides certainty to our mariners. It  streamlines regulations, reduces burdens, and clarifies ambiguous rules  that harm our commerce and our environment. We also reauthorize the  hydrographic services at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, which are necessary for shoreline mapping and accurate  nautical charts, and we reauthorize the Federal Maritime Commission.   Finally, this bill fixes a broken patchwork of regulations that  prevents efficiency in moving goods along our waterways. The Vessel  Incidental Discharge Act, or VIDA, is important bipartisan  legislation--sponsored by Senators Wicker, Casey, and more than 20  cosponsors from both sides of the aisle--that creates a uniform set of  rules to protect the environment while providing consistent regulations  for all ports and waterways.   You will hear from some of my colleagues that this act reduces  environmental controls and is being jammed down their throats. This is  simply not true. We have negotiated in good faith for hundreds of  hours, over the past few Congresses, to make this a strong piece of  bipartisan legislation. We need strict, science-based, and achievable  environmental standards, and that is what this VIDA title will yield.   The new standards must be based on the best available technology that  is  [[Page S2226]]  economically achievable and are designed to become more stringent over  time as technology improves. Setting limits beyond what is achievable  may make for a good sound bite, but it doesn't actually improve the  environment. This bill will.   Like so much of the work we do at the Commerce Committee, Senator  Nelson and I have worked hard to ensure the bipartisan Coast Guard  Authorization Act of 2017 can garner strong support on both sides of  the aisle. The measure meets the operational needs of the Coast Guard,  allowing the service to continue to do the job that so many of our  constituents rely on. It reauthorizes the FMC and NOAA's hydrographic  services. Finally, it provides needed regulatory certainty for  recreational and commercial vessel operators, while ensuring strong  environmental protections for our Nation's waterways.   We are going to have an opportunity to vote on this tomorrow. I urge  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the men and women  of the Coast Guard and to support this bipartisan legislation that has  been negotiated for weeks, months, and years to bring us to where we  are today--working to accommodate the concerns of individual Senators  on both sides of the aisle but finding a balanced bill that should  attract broad bipartisan support. I hope when that vote comes tomorrow,  we will be able to see Members on both sides support this legislation  and the men and women of the Coast Guard, who do so much important work  for our country.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
