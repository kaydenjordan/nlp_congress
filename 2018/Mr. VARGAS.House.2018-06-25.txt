 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 6069, the Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking  Act, FIND.   Allow me first to thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership and  also Ranking Member Waters for her leadership, and also for their  support of this legislation.   I would also like to thank my good friend, Mr. French Hill. I thank  him for his kind words and for his support of this bill.   I especially would like to thank Mr. Rothfus for his leadership on  the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee and for generously  agreeing to colead this commonsense, narrowly tailored legislation.   As you may know, a virtual currency is a digital representation of  value that can be digitally traded. Since the creation of bitcoin, the  first and most widely known example of cryptocurrency, thousands of  cryptocurrencies have emerged and are designed to serve a variety of  purses.   Some forms of virtual currency provide a digital alternative to cash  that lacks the oversight of a government or central bank and,  potentially, offers greater anonymity than conventional payment  systems.   Just as virtual currencies have grown in use in legitimate commerce,  they have also become an increasingly popular financial payment method  for criminals. Virtual currencies have been and continue to be  exploited to pay for goods and services associated with illicit illegal  sex and drug trafficking. These are two of the most detrimental and  troubling illegal activities sold online.   According to the DEA 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment,  transnational criminal organizations are increasingly using virtual  currencies due to their ease of use and the anonymity they provide.                                time  1545    While evidence points to the growth of virtual currencies as a  payment method for illicit sex and drug trafficking, the true scope of  the problem and the potential solutions have not been fully  established.   According to the International Labour Organization, in 2016, 4.8  million people in the world were victims of forced sexual exploitation,  and in 2014, the global profit from commercial sexual exploitation was  $99 billion.   Unfortunately, virtual currencies are also being used as a payment  method for transnational drug traffickers.   As you may know all too well, the United States is struggling to  combat the rising number of lives cut short by the tragic use of  opioids. As was stated earlier by my good friend Mr. Hill, in 2016  alone, the CDC estimated that there were 64,000 deaths--64,000 deaths-- in the U.S. related to drug overdose.   The most severe increases in drug overdoses were those associated  with fentanyl and also fentanyl analogs. Fentanyl is an extremely  deadly opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.  Fentanyl is being illicitly manufactured in China and Mexico, with most  of the illegal fentanyl in the United States originating from China,  and it is readily available to purchase through the online  marketplaces.   If we are to craft effective regulatory and legislative solutions to  combat these transnational criminal organizations, we need to fully  study and analyze how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are  used to facilitate sex and drug trafficking to determine how to best  eliminate their use.   H.R. 6069, the FIND Trafficking Act of 2018, requires the Comptroller  General of the United States to: one, carry out a study on how virtual  currencies and online marketplaces are used to facilitate sex or drug  trafficking; and, two, make recommendations to Congress on legislative  and regulatory actions that would impede the use of virtual currencies  and online marketplaces in facilitating sex and drug trafficking.   It is my sincere hope that this bill is the first step toward  crafting bipartisan legislation to impede and eventually eliminate the  use of virtual currencies by transnational criminal organizations that  facilitate drug and sex trafficking.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I again  thank both my colleagues here for their kind words about this bill and  the bipartisanship that we have had on this bill.
