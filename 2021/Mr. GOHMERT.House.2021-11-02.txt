 Madam Speaker, I certainly appreciate my friend General  Bergman for using this time to pay tribute to veterans. I have seen the  statistics from an article in 2018, 71 percent of young Americans  between 17 and 24 are ineligible to serve in the military; 24 million  out of 34 million people in that age group. The demographics of the  military as of 2018 indicate that there is just under 1.29 million  people serving, men and women serving in the military. That is less  than 0.5 percent of the U.S. population.   We owe our military the deepest amount of appreciation and thanks.  And I just went back to the office this afternoon and got another plea  from another servicemember. These people are the very tiny, few  volunteers willing to step up and defend America at all costs,  including their own lives.                                time  2000    Jesus said that is the greatest love there can be. They love their  country. They love those they serve with. They are willing to face  anything, except corrupt, high-ranking officers who are so busy  sticking their heads up the atriums of the White House that they are  not concerned enough about their own men.   We saw that in the exit of Afghanistan. We saw servicemembers die  because commanding officers didn't care enough about their own troops.   This notice says: You either take the vaccination--without regard to  whether you have had bad reactions to things in there, like the  warnings say--we want to experiment on you like we did the Tuskegee  Airmen. This is wrong, and we should be standing up for our  servicemembers, not only saying thank you, but thank you and you  shouldn't have to serve and follow orders that are experiments that we  have outlawed such experimentation on our servicemembers.   Thank you, we owe you a debt of gratitude, and we are going to be  fighting for you here.
