 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for  yielding the time to me.   While I support the underlying bill, I want to urge my colleagues to  defeat the previous question so that this bipartisan legislation, the  Presidential Tax Transparency Act, can be made in order for  consideration and a vote.   The legislation is very simple. It is not pages and pages and pages.  It simply states that there will be a requirement that the President of  the United States, all future Presidents, and Presidential nominees of  the major parties publicly disclose their tax returns. For decades,  Republican and Democratic Presidents and Republican and Democratic  candidates of both parties have voluntarily disclosed this information,  but not this President.   Now, this tradition began in 1973, with President Richard Nixon who,  while under audit by the IRS, publicly released his tax returns and  submitted them for review by Congress because there was a mini scandal  at that time regarding his claims of charitable giving. He released his  tax returns and, shortly after, gave what became a famous speech:  ``People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.''    The Joint Committee on Taxation, at that time, ultimately found  numerous errors in the President's return, and that he owed about a  half a million dollars in back taxes, and he paid them.   Now, since then, every President has voluntarily released their tax  returns. But this tradition is now being tested by a President who  continues to hide his finances and faces an unprecedented number of  potential conflicts of interest relating to his business empire.   Now, through his financial disclosure forms, we know that he has some  564 businesses around the world and inside the United States. This is a  legitimate question being posed by the American people, and that is: If  we don't know, whose interest is he operating under? Who is he there  for?   Is he making decisions relative to trade that will benefit his  business? We don't know. Why? Because a tax return is highly  instructive. Tax returns disclose to whom you owe debt, what the debt  is, where your businesses are, whether they are in the United States or  in a foreign country, whether you have made charitable donations,  whether you have paid taxes, whether you have avoided taxes, whether  you have used loopholes, whether you have dollars in offshore areas. So  this is an essential.   I want my Republican friends to think of something. This is not a  partisan issue. This should concern you just as much as it concerns  your constituents. The American people across the country, 74 percent,  say that his tax returns should be disclosed.                                time  1300    We are now moving into an area of questions about national security.   Who is the President doing business with?   Whose interests come first? Is it the national security of the United  States of America by the Commander in Chief, or is it for some Trump  business?   These are very serious questions that you should want answered.   In a democracy--in a democracy--transparency is essential. They go  hand in hand. We are not a banana republic. We don't have people in  charge of the government that stand above the law or just disregard it.   In this case, it is not the law. It is a beautiful tradition that  patriots on the Republican side and the Democratic side honored. Why  did they honor it? I think they honored it because they wanted to honor  the American people. That is what this effort is about.   Now, it is important to note that the President wasn't always opposed  to this important transparency. As far back as 2011, he said that he  would release his tax returns if he ran for President.    In 2012, he criticized Mitt Romney for not releasing his  returns until late in the campaign. In 2014, Mr. Trump told an Irish  television network: ``If I decide to run for office, I'll produce my  tax returns, absolutely.'' In 2016, he said repeatedly that he would  release his returns ``over the next few months'' and ``before the  election.'' It hasn't happened yet.   So all of these issues should concern all Members of Congress  because, as I said a moment ago, transparency is essential in a  democracy.   Mr. Speaker, this is the fourth time this year that I have offered  the Presidential Tax Transparency Act as the previous question motion,  and today I filed a discharge petition on the bill, which I encourage  all of my colleagues to sign at the desk. If we defeat the previous  question today or if we reach 218 Members of the House on the discharge  petition, we can vote on this bipartisan legislation and ensure-- underscore ``ensure''--that the President of the United States provides  transparency for the American people now and in the future.
