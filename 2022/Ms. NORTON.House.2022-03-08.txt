 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  this important resolution. I rise in support of this resolution  condemning threats of violence against historically Black colleges and  universities.   As the Member from the District of Columbia, I also represent two  historically Black colleges and universities, Howard University and the  University of the District of Columbia. Last month, several D.C.  schools were targeted, including my own alma mater, Dunbar High School.   This resolution is important to not only express our outrage at these  threats of violence, but to reaffirm our commitment to the students,  faculty, and staff at these universities.   HBCUs are responsible for educating the next generation and preparing  them for their careers. The value they have for the District of  Columbia and the country cannot be overstated.
