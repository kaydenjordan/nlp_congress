 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this bill  and to urge my colleagues to do the same.   After passing more than $3 trillion worth of relief packages, we find  ourselves finally overcoming the COVID-19 virus. We have successfully  developed vaccines to combat this virus in record time, and now we see  our economy opening up and coming back to full strength.   What is more, we have yet to spend $1 trillion that has already been  enacted, that has already been appropriated, already been voted on.   Why do we need to pass another $1.9 trillion? You will find the  reasons in the more than 90 percent of the bill that does not  specifically target combating COVID-19.   What you will find is a partisan list of priorities and bailouts, 27  percent of it going to bailing out State and local governments that  insisted on continued harmful lockdowns and did little to stop the  virus, 21 percent dedicated to partisan policies that will reduce  employment, and 45 percent of the bill won't even be spent until 2022  or later.   Perhaps that is why only two Republican amendments of 229 were  accepted. The only thing bipartisan about this bill has been the  opposition to it.                                time  1030     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  these firearms and background check bills that would not be effective  in ending gun violence.   Instead, these bills would restrict the Second Amendment rights of  law-abiding Americans. Simply increasing the number of laws and adding  more hurdles to lawful gun ownership does not get to the core of  reducing gun violence.   These changes to the background check system won't stop criminals  from obtaining firearms. Why don't we focus our efforts on smart  policies that would actually reduce the number of gun deaths?   Last year, more Americans bought more guns than ever. In fact, gun  ownership has grown significantly over the last 20 years, but we have  also seen our violent crime rate drop over that same period. Rather  than going after law-abiding citizens, let's figure out where we can  work together to address the real problems here. Let us invest in  solving the real policy questions we can answer instead of restricting  Americans' freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose these bills.                            ____________________
