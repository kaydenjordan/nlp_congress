 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman with  whom I have the privilege of serving on the Rules Committee for his  distinguished leadership of that committee and for yielding me the  time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to applaud the work of the Appropriations  Committee in finally upholding our obligation to invest in gun violence  prevention.   The legislation before us this week would increase funding for the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives by over 9 percent.  That additional funding will enable ATF to train more agents and hire  more inspectors to fulfill the agency's mission of keeping illegal  firearms out of criminal hands.   More than 30 percent of guns identified in a crime have been stolen,  yet ATF has long been denied the resources to properly inspect  Federally licensed firearms dealers and respond to the flow of illegal  guns onto our streets.   This funding and the additional personnel it can provide will help  ATF reach its inspection goals and enforce our existing gun laws,  making communities across the Nation safer.   Madam Speaker, I thank the committee for their hard work, and I urge  my colleagues to support both the rule and the underlying bill.
