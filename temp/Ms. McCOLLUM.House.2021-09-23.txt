 Mr. Speaker, I am a strong supporter of human rights,  Palestinian and Israeli rights.   As chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Iron Dome was  fully funded in the FY22 Defense appropriations bill that passed out of  committee with unanimous Democratic support and no Republican votes.   The CR earlier this week added language for a billion dollars for  Iron Dome, despite no requests received by me from the Biden  administration.   Madam Chair, you and I agree, this was a matter that could have been  worked out in conference committee, but today we have this emergency  bill in front of us. I would like to engage in a colloquy with the  chair of the full committee to clarify this important point.   Can any funds in this bill be used for the procurement of offensive  weapons by the Government of Israel? I yield to my friend for an  answer.    Thank you. This bill clearly states that this funding  is purely for defensive purposes.
