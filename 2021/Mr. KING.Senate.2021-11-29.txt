 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I want to talk about the national defense  bill, but first I do want to respond just in one particular to the  comments of the gentlelady from Tennessee because I have heard this  before, the idea that the infrastructure bill isn't infrastructure.   I don't get how anybody is making that claim. Here is the list: roads  and bridges, highway safety, public transit, rail, broadband, ports,  airports, the electric grid, water, and Superfund cleanup. Yes, there  are some items for EVs and for the facilitating of the electrification  of our transportation system, but the vast bulk of it is what anybody  would call infrastructure.   Infrastructure is something you can kick. Infrastructure is something  you can feel. And that is what we are talking about here--roads and  bridges, ports, airports, rail, broadband. That is the infrastructure  of the 21st century. This is an infrastructure bill, and it ought to be  recognized as such.   There are plenty of things we can argue and differ with around here,  but this shouldn't be one of them. And people are confused about it  because they are being given confusing information. They are being told  it is not an infrastructure bill; there is no infrastructure. I have  heard that. It is simply not true. So let's argue about the things  that, you know, we have genuine policy differences, but let's not talk  about things that just aren't the case. Ports, bridges, railroad,  public transit--and, yes, public transit is infrastructure. It may not  be in Tennessee. It may not be so much in Maine, although I suspect  there is some in Tennessee and there is some in Maine, but public  transportation is critical to our citizens.   Broadband, airports, electric grid, water--that is infrastructure.                                  H.R. 4350    Now, in a few moments, we will have what I hope is not a historic  vote. It shouldn't be a historic vote. It ought to be a boring vote.  The vote is to proceed to the National Defense Authorization Act for  2022, just as we have done for 60 years' running. But I understand that  there is a movement afoot to derail it because there haven't been  enough amendments. ``I didn't get my amendment in; therefore, I am  going to block this bill.''   Well, let's talk a little bit about the history of the bill. I serve  on the Armed Services Committee, as does the Presiding Officer, and  both of us can attest that the Armed Services Committee is one of the  most nonpartisan committees in the U.S. Senate. In fact, in the Armed-- let's talk about amendments for a minute. In the Armed Services  Committee, during our markup, we adopted 145 amendments--most by  agreement, by bipartisan agreement, by unanimous consent. There were a  few rollcall votes but not very many. And in my experience in 9 years  on that committee, there have only been a handful of party-line  rollcall votes in the Armed Services Committee.   It produces some very odd bedfellows, and some combinations that  don't make much sense politically, but it is because the members of the  committee put the interests of the United States of America first and  make their decision on that, not on politics.   So there were 145 amendments in the committee. Then there is a  managers' package that we are going to be voting on today that has 57  amendments in it--27 supported by Republicans and 27 by Democrats and 3  that are entirely bipartisan. So we are up to 202 amendments. That is a  lot of amendments to a piece of legislation, not to mention the fact  that the managers' package within the committee was developed largely  by consensus between the two party leaders, Chairman Reed and Ranking  Member Inhofe. So this process is replete with amendments and  compromise, and that is how it has been done for the past 60 years.   Now, last week, before we left, we had another 18 amendments that  were agreed upon by both parties to bring up as a package--not as a  package; I am sorry--to be considered one at a time and be voted on.   That process was killed by a group of Senators who said: No. I want  my amendment. I am not on the list, and, therefore, I am going to  object to the unanimous consent request, so nobody gets their  amendments.   So, today, we are going to be voting on the motion to proceed to the  substitute amendment that is chock-full of bipartisan amendments. It  doesn't have all of the amendments everybody wants. It doesn't have a  couple of amendments that I feel are very important.   But do you know what? To quote my favorite philosopher, Mick Jagger:  You don't always get what you want, but, if you try sometimes, you just  might find you get what you need.   And that is what we have got right here, is what we need.   This is the defense of the United States of America. Why can't we do  just one bill without politics and without stamping our feet, saying,  ``I didn't get my amendment, so I am going to vote against it''?   By the way, this is a vote on a motion to proceed, which, in my view,  ought to be just the most routine possible vote. It is not a vote on  the bill itself. Let's proceed to this bill. Let's proceed to the  bipartisan managers' package that has been worked out, painstakingly,  over the last several months.   Let's think about what this bill is all about. This isn't ordinary  policy. This is the national security of this country. This is a pay  raise for our troops. This is national security that our people depend  upon. That is our most fundamental responsibility. In the preamble of  the Constitution, one of the key responsibilities is to provide for the  common defense. That is why you have governments in the first place.   We have done it for 60 years in a row. I urge my colleagues--this  isn't a moment for partisanship or for complaining about, you know, ``I  didn't get my amendment, so I am not going to vote for it.'' You know,  suck it up.   I am going to vote for it. As I say, there are a couple of amendments  that I felt very passionately about involving cyber and the protection  of the country. They aren't in, but I am still going to vote for it,  because that is our responsibility.   This is the most fundamental responsibility we have around here. We  have a bipartisan process, and it came out of committee 23 to 3. Two  Republicans and one Democrat voted against it. That is as close to  unanimity as you can get on an important piece of policy legislation.   So I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the motion to proceed, and  then to  [[Page S8774]]  move the bill later this week--to meet our responsibility to the  American people, to meet the responsibility that every Congress has met  for the last 60 years.   If we don't do that because we are angry that we didn't get something  in or there weren't enough amendments--there are 202 amendments built  on top of, already, a bipartisan package that was produced in the  chairman's markup in committee. That, to me, is pretty full  consideration.   I hope my colleagues will vote yes to proceed to this bill. It is our  responsibility and, more than that, it is what is necessary to protect  this country.   I yield the floor.    Would the Senator yield for a question?    Madam President, my recollection is--and we have passed  this bill, as we both have recognized, every year for the past 60  years, including over the last 4 or 5 years--in the last several years,  there weren't that many amendments.   There were a few, and it was always agreed in advance. There was a  package, just as we had the other night, but everybody didn't get-- there wasn't an unlimited number of amendments or votes on amendments.  There was generally an agreed-upon number of amendments, and it wasn't  very many.   Is that correct?    Thank you.   Thank you, Madam Chair.                                Cloture Motion
