 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Lieutenant Marc  Tochterman, who is retiring from the Bay County Sheriff's Office after  23 years.   Marc also served his country for 22 years in the Navy before that.   During his time in the sheriff's office, Lieutenant Tochterman  assisted my office, Representative Gwen Graham's office, and  Representative Steve Southerland's office, as well.   Marc also serves as the regional coordinator for the Special Olympics  Law Enforcement Torch Run and as the vice president of the Defenders  Motorcycle Club's Panama City Chapter.   Marc has a heart of gold.   Marc is a doting father, a loving husband to his wife, Virginia, and,  additionally, a dear friend to me and everyone on my staff.   Though we are sad that Marc is retiring, we are proud of the impact  he has made on our community.   Madam Speaker, we thank Lieutenant Tochterman and we are all grateful  for his service.                            ____________________
