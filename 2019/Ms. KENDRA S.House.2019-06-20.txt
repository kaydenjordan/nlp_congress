 HORN of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk  about Oklahomans in space.   Born in Oklahoma's Fifth Congressional District in Shawnee, retired  Air Force Colonel Gordon Cooper was one of the first Mercury  astronauts. In 1962, he served as a backup for the Sigma 7 mission. A  year later, he circled Earth 22 times in the space capsule Faith 7,  completing the sixth and last of the Mercury manned spaceflights.   He also served as a command pilot of Gemini 5 on an 8-day endurance  mission. This not only made him the first person to make two orbital  flights, but he also set an endurance record on this mission of nearly  191 hours.   Before becoming an astronaut with NASA, Colonel Cooper earned a  commission with the U.S. Army in the late 1940s and then transferred to  the Air Force where he received a bachelor of science degree in  aeronautics from the Air Force Institute of Technology, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.   If you visit the National Portrait Gallery in D.C., you will see a  picture of Colonel Cooper as one of NASA's Mercury Seven astronauts. I  am proud to honor his memory, legacy, and history-making achievements  in space.   Madam Speaker, women astronauts from Oklahoma have also made critical  contributions to our Nation's space program. Jerrie Cobb and Shannon  Lucid are two of those pioneers who paved the way in space and  aeronautics.   Cobb is considered one of the most gifted female pilots in history  and a fierce advocate for women astronauts. Born in Norman, Oklahoma,  and a graduate from Oklahoma City's Classen High School, Cobb became  the first woman to fly in the Paris Air Show and was among the first  women certified to be an astronaut as a member of the little-known  Mercury 13 in the early 1960s. She testified before Congress in 1962,  urging lawmakers to allow women to go into space.                                time  0930    Though she never got to leave the Earth's atmosphere, Cobb helped  pave the way for future generations of women astronauts like fellow  Oklahoman and astronaut, Dr. Shannon Lucid. I pause to honor the memory  of Dr. Cobb today, as she passed away 3 months ago at the age of 88.   Lady astronaut Dr. Shannon Lucid, a Congressional District Five  resident, graduated from Bethany High School. Among the first six women  astronauts selected by NASA, Dr. Lucid became an astronaut in 1979. Not  only did she fly on five spaceflights, she is also the only American  woman to serve aboard the Mir Space Station.   Before Peggy Whitson broke the record of the number of hours in  space, Dr. Lucid set the record with 5,354 hours in space. In December  of 1996, she became the first woman to receive the Congressional Medal  of Honor for her record-breaking service aboard the Mir, and she  retired from NASA in 2012.   Because of the glass ceiling shattered by Jerrie Cobb and Dr. Shannon  Lucid, generations of women can and do now follow in their footsteps.                            ____________________     HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today to address the critical need to support both  our law enforcement and individuals in our communities who are  experiencing mental health crisis.   Across this country, one in every ten calls for police response  involves a person experiencing a mental health crisis; one in four  people killed by police are suffering from a mental illness; one in  three people transported to hospital emergency rooms for psychiatric  reasons are taken by the police.   Simply put, our police officers are on the front lines in our Nation  where far too few people have access to the mental healthcare they need  and deserve. But far too few have the training and the skills they need  to understand, identify, and deescalate these situations.   We need to provide our officers with the skills and understanding of  mental illness and how to appropriately respond to both the safety of  the officer and the individual. The right training makes everyone  safer. We must equip officers for encounters with people experiencing  mental health crises, and my amendment helps to accomplish this goal.   With this amendment, we can help save lives and turn these encounters  into effective responses that help both the individual and our  communities. My amendment funds grants for crisis training for law  enforcement through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant  Program. This program is giving State, local, and Tribal governments  the critical support they need to provide individuals with important  training and education, and equipment to operate at their best.   Byrne JAG is the leading source of funding for local law enforcement  to help prevent and control crime, improve the justice system, and  funds everything from education and intervention programs to reentry  services to target the roots of crime. Some of its most well-known  programs include the bulletproof vests program, Smart Policing  Initiative, and the Juvenile Indigent Defense, the National Missing  Unidentified Person System, and numerous other programs.   Byrne JAG is a critical funding source that makes our community safer  by attacking the problem of crime from multiple angles, from community  education to improving interactions with police and the neighborhoods  they protect and, thus, is an excellent way to provide mental health  crisis response training for our police officers.   Mr. Chair, in my State of Oklahoma, officers in 2018 alone  transferred 17,860 individuals experiencing a mental health crisis to  the emergency room.   Behavorial and psychological science has progressed leaps and bounds  in the last 50 years, but access to that training is expensive, and we  must break down cost barriers for law enforcement agencies to save  lives and address mental illness.   Mr. Chair, I look forward to, and urge, support on this amendment  that will make our communities safer and address mental illness.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1100     HORN of Oklahoma changed her vote from ``aye'' to  ``no.''   So the amendment was rejected.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.                 Amendment No. 136 Offered by Mr. Blumenauer
