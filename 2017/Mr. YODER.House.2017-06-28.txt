 Mr. Speaker, June 28, 1911, the day my dear grandmother,  Edna Yoder, was born, has been a special day in my life. Each year, for  the last 6 years, I have come to the floor to wish her a happy  birthday. Last year, she celebrated her 105th birthday. Sadly, today  would have been her 106th, but Grandma Edna passed away recently, and I  miss her terribly.   She was a sweet, loving, and strong grandmother. She had an  infectious laugh, an enormous love of family, and a deep belief in her  faith. She was a symbol of everything that was great about America's  Greatest Generation.   She was also a true example of what makes America a strong and  vibrant nation: working tirelessly every day on the farm, milking cows  at dawn, and bringing in the wheat harvest in the hot Kansas sun. I  like to say she had a front row seat on the journey that was the great  American century.   Mr. Speaker, today, I want Grandma to know that we love her, we miss  her, and we know that she is at peace with the Lord in Heaven.                            ____________________
