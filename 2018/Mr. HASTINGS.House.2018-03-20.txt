 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), my  friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.    Mr. Speaker, like my friend from Texas, I was overcome with sadness  by the tragic news of Louise's passing, who was not only the ranking  member of the Rules Committee, but the first and only woman to have  chaired the committee.   For 30 years, Louise poured every ounce of energy she had into  serving her constituents in upstate New York. She never hesitated to  speak her mind, and she never wavered in espousing her beliefs. I will  always be truly grateful for the time that I had to serve alongside  her.   Louise was one of my dearest friends in Congress, having not only  served with her on the Rules Committee but also on the Commission on  Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki Commission.   Her legacy speaks for itself. She was not just a champion of women's  rights. She was a champion of working families everywhere. This Nation  has lost one of our fiercest public servants, and her absence will  leave an unfillable void.   Mr. Speaker, I offer my deepest condolences to Louise's daughters:  Megan Secatore, Amy Slaughter, and Emily Minerva; her seven  grandchildren and one great-grandson; as well as to her friends,  constituents, and congressional staff during this extremely difficult  time. Her spirit and loving memory will forever live in the Halls of  Congress. She will be dearly missed.   Mr. Speaker, turning to today's rules, this rule brings the number of  closed rules for the 115th Congress to 74. In other words, more than 50  percent of the legislation coming to the Rules Committee has been  closed off from an open and honest debate by my Republican friends.   At the beginning of this Congress, we were told by my Republican  colleagues that they would run the government in an open manner. They  even championed regular order. Well, that spirit has clearly been  jettisoned in favor of an overly partisan approach to governing.   By way of example, one of today's bills, H.R. 5247, was introduced  last Tuesday, brought to the House floor for a vote on the same day  without the committee of jurisdiction holding one single hearing on the  bill or Members having the opportunity to offer their amendments.                                time  1230    Not surprisingly, the measure failed to pass under suspension of the  rules.   What was the response of my friends on the other side of the aisle  when the vote failed? Did my Republican colleagues insist that the  Energy and Commerce Committee hold hearings on the measure? Did my  Republican colleagues on the committee of jurisdiction invite experts  to speak on what the consequences would be if this bill were to become  law? Did my Republican colleagues work with Democrats to come up with a  bipartisan solution? No.   Madam Speaker, let me tell you what did happen. The Republican  leadership ignored the problems with the measure and brought it to the  Rules Committee last night for it to be considered on the House floor  today.   Now, this flies in the face of regular order, to ask the entire  membership of the people's House to vote on something for which no one  can honestly say they know what the unintended consequences would be if  this bill were to become law.   Bad process makes bad bills, and the process we have witnessed with  this bill can't get much worse. Yet it did get worse when the  Republican majority blocked the ranking member's, Mr. Pallone's,  substitute amendment, an amendment which was both germane and had  bipartisan support.   Madam Speaker, the Republican majority took it a step further when  they extended the Holman rule for the remainder of the 115th Congress.  My friends on the other side of the aisle are yet again seeking to  scapegoat Federal employees, make cuts to the Federal workforce, and  politicize the civil service system that was established to  professionalize agencies and offices, all while ignoring the waste and  abuses in the reality show of the Trump administration.   Madam Speaker, challenged by the American people to bring up  comprehensive gun reform, House leadership instead brings up one bill  that hasn't gone through anything resembling regular order and another  bill that weakens and undermines a valuable tool that gives financial  companies and regulators an opportunity to identify and correct  problems before they could lead to another financial crisis.  [[Page H1706]]    Every year, roughly 35,000 people are killed by guns. Moreover, 2,700  children and teens are shot and killed, and over 14,000 more are shot  and injured every year. That is an average of 47 American children and  teens shot every day.   And the effects of gun violence extend far beyond those struck by a  bullet. Gun violence shapes the lives of the millions of children who  witness it, know someone who was shot, or live in fear of the next  shooting. We have witnessed the effects over the last month with the  students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.   This weekend, hundreds of thousands of students and their supporters  will descend on Washington, D.C., to demand that the Federal Government  take action to stop the epidemic of mass shootings, which have become  all too familiar.   No less than this morning when I turned on the television, less than  an hour and a half away from here, in yet another school, yet another  shooting. Fortunately, it appears that the resource officer there  engaged the shooter early on and may have caused there to be less  damage, although some people were injured, and one or two critically.   We can no longer ignore what gun violence really is in this country.  It is an epidemic.   But do not just take my word for it or the students who witnessed 14  friends' and 3 teachers' lives brutally cut short. The American Medical  Association, following the tragedy at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando,  declared gun violence in this country ``a very public health crisis,''  a crisis which the Republican majority's only answer is to offer  thoughts and prayers and further block any Democratic measures to  address this crisis and to continue to block the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention from even researching gun violence.   Instead of finally making permanent the status of Dreamers in this  country as full citizens, the Republican majority ignores their calls  and the calls of the vast majority of Americans and, instead, brings up  one bill that undermines a valuable early warning system of our  Nation's economy and another bill that has gone through a completely  closed process.   Enough is enough. President Donald John Trump says he wants to fix  this problem. The Speaker says he wants to fix this problem. We on this  side of the aisle clearly want to fix this problem. So let's do it  already.   Madam Speaker, last week, when I was managing yet another useless  financial regulation, I commented and I asked the American public to  respond:   Would you rather us stop banks from having stress tests or would you  prefer that we deal with the deferred action for children in this  country, 800,000 of whom are Dreamers, 120 of whom lose their status  every day?   Would you prefer that we deal with the measure that is on the floor  today or that we deal seriously with a variety of issues having to do  with gun violence in our society, which I have described as an  epidemic?   Would you prefer as a priority, America, that we deal with these  trivial matters that are going nowhere fast or that we center ourselves  and focus on those measures that are vital to the survival, security,  and safety of all Americans?   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, last night in the Rules Committee, I had dialogue with  the author of this legislation and also the ranking member, Mr.  Pallone. I indicated to them that I have very strong sympathies  regarding persons who are in the apparent throes of death and seeking  some hope, and medication can have its advantages, and experimental  medication can have its advantages.   My quarrel with the legislation is that it didn't go through regular  order. I don't understand why, with all of the experts. I introduced  into the Record in the Rules Committee last night a substantial number  of organizations and individuals who have come forward. They all agree  that something along the lines of what is being sought ought be  undertaken, but it would allow for those persons to have added input  into what ultimately may be significant legislation. But my friends on  the other side plow right ahead on this matter that I reiterate was  brought on suspension last week that failed, and then brought here last  night for purposes of a rule along with financial stress legislation.   So it is not that many of us are not sympathetic to the underlying  principle that is being offered. It is that it is rank process and that  we should not allow legislation to continue to come to the floor of the  House of Representatives that blocks out a significant number of  persons who may have input that would make the measure be much more  salient to a more significant number of people.   It is for that reason that I continue to ask the questions: What are  our priorities here? What is the rush with reference to this matter  while we are ignoring a significant number of other matters that we  could be undertaking?   In addition to that, we were supposed to go to the Rules Committee  this afternoon on the omnibus bill; and now, evidently, there is  wrangling going on between the parties and bicameral between the Senate  and the House, and that measure isn't ready to come to the floor.   Yet we are dealing with something that isn't the highest priority of  the moment. I commented last night, anything that will help a person  who is facing death is the kind of thing that we would want that person  to have that opportunity to deal with. But we have children who have  been killed and we have children who are facing the potential for that  kind of horror, yet we are doing nothing.   So, Madam Speaker, once again, I rise to appeal to my friends on the  other side of the aisle: Please, listen to the American people and do  more to help end the epidemic of gun violence that has plagued our  Nation and that the American people are demanding Congress to do more.   For example, in a recent Gallup Poll, nearly two-thirds of adults  wanted stricter laws on the sale of firearms. According to a recent  NPR/Ipsos poll, 75 percent of respondents said they think gun laws  should be stricter.   As I indicated earlier, just this morning there were reports of  another school shooting just an hour and a half from Washington, D.C.,  in Great Mills, Maryland. The American people are begging this body to  do something to end this epidemic, so I offer the majority this  opportunity:   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to  offer an amendment to the rule to bring up four commonsense gun safety  bills: H.R. 4240, the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights  Protection Act; H.R. 3464, the Background Check Completion Act; H.R.  2598, the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act; and H.R. 1478, the Gun  Violence Research Act.   These bills would close the dangerous gun show and internet sale  background check loopholes, prevent the sale of guns without a  completed background check, ensure that people who are a danger to  themselves or others can be prevented from possessing a gun, and lift  the prohibition on government-sponsored scientific research on the  causes of gun violence.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the  previous question so that we can finally do something to address gun  violence.   Through you, Madam Speaker, I would advise my friend from Texas that  I have no further speakers and I am prepared to close when he is  prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I would say to my friend from Washington what I said last night: We  would do a great service to Louise's memory if we were to make more  open rules here on the House floor; and I will argue for her in that  regard.   Madam Speaker, before I close, I want to again reiterate the  tremendous loss felt in this Chamber with the passing of our longtime  colleague, Congresswoman Louise McIntosh Slaughter. She was a champion  of all the issues she cared about and a giant here in the House of  Representatives. Her wisdom will be missed every day.   Madam Speaker, the people's House should be approaching our work in a  manner that is fair to all Americans, in a manner where the appropriate  committee of jurisdiction holds hearings and markups, in a manner where  experts in the field are consulted, and in a manner where Members of  both parties have the opportunity to offer amendments and debate the  contents of the bill.   The process we are witnessing here today is truly a slap in the face  to regular order. A bill that has zero input from members on the Energy  and Commerce Committee or that has been the subject of any thoughtful  discussion is suddenly on the House floor for a vote.   Now, I respect my friend from Texas' view that last year in the  Senate, and even perhaps since that time, and throughout the country,  right-to-try measures have passed in several States to some degree. But  this particular bill that is on the floor that we are making a rule for  has not gone through regular order; and that, then, disallows a  significant number of persons who would have an opportunity to have  input to what could be legislation that all sides could agree upon. Our  failure to undertake to do that is a disservice, in my view, to the  institution and to the measure that is being sought to be passed here  today.   This is not just an affront to normal House procedure; it is  downright undemocratic and emblematic of the Republican majority's  inability to govern. I think it will redound to their discredit that  they are not allowing this House to proceed under regular order.   As I indicated earlier, more than 50 percent of all of the measures  that have come to the Rules Committee and have ultimately come to the  floor of the House of Representatives have been under closed rules,  which means that Members who represent millions of people in America do  not have opportunities to offer amendments that might make the measure  better or, at the very least, have their views heard with reference to  substantive legislation that is moving through this body.                                time  1300    If we continue down this path for the remainder of this session, we  will probably break the 100th barrier on closed rules. We have already  had more closed rules than in the history of legislating in this  country.   That is not fair. That is basically all we are arguing. Open up the  process. Let every Member have an opportunity for input on behalf of  his or her constituents. It is the right thing to do. What has been  happening is the dead wrong thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
