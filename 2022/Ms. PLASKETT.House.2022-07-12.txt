 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 1168) reaffirming the economic partnership  between the United States and the Caribbean nations and recognizing the  need to strengthen trade and investment between the United States and  the Caribbean nations, our ``Third Border'', as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. RES. 1168         Whereas Congress commits to strengthening economic ties and       cooperation with the Caribbean people to promote equitable       economic growth and development across the region;        Whereas the Caribbean region has a population of       approximately 44,000,000 people, millions of people have       emigrated between the Caribbean and the United States, and       approximately 13,000,000 people in the United States, or 4       percent of the United States population, share Caribbean       ancestry;        Whereas it is in the national interest of the United States       to support the economic development of sovereign Caribbean       nations and territories;        Whereas greater opportunities for mutually beneficial trade       and investments promote economic growth, development, poverty       reduction, democracy, the rule of law, civil rights, and       overall stability;        Whereas regional and global integration with our Caribbean       neighbors should be strengthened to create decent jobs, boost       economic growth in the Caribbean and the United States, and       eliminate barriers to trade and investment in the Caribbean;        Whereas it remains the goal of the United States to support       diversification of Caribbean exports to the United States;        Whereas, in 1983, Congress launched the Caribbean Basin       Initiative (CBI) through the Caribbean Basin Economic       Recovery Act (CBERA) and expanded it in 2000 with the United       States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA);        Whereas the United States shares a history of struggle with       Caribbean neighbor countries, including with our courageous       sister nation of Haiti;        Whereas Haiti suffered destabilizing events in 2021,       including severe insecurity, a deadly earthquake, widespread       democratic protests, continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic,       and the assassination of President Jovenel Moise, all of       which have contributed to a governance and humanitarian       crisis that requires immediate further attention and support       from the United States and the global community;        Whereas specialized United States trade preferences with       Haiti, including the Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) and       Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act       (HOPE II) programs, aid Haiti's growing textile and apparel       manufacturing industry and are a critical source of steady       jobs for many Haitian people to support their families;        Whereas trade preference programs for the Caribbean and       Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries, such as the       Generalized System of Preferences, CBI, and CBTPA have       provided important economic benefits for Caribbean Basin       country economies, including by facilitating niche production       and more diversified exports, while also benefitting United       States businesses and workers, including by helping to add       value for customers and supporting United States jobs;        Whereas Caribbean people and their island nation economies       have led globally by exploring innovative economic strategies       to produce collective benefits for their communities, such as       through the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, to       reduce the economic impact of major disasters;        Whereas the United States seeks to prioritize and promote a       worker-centered trade agenda that facilitates trade and       protects freedom of association, fosters a sustainable       environment and climate path, advances racial equity and       supports underserved communities, addresses unfair economic       trade practices, supports domestic producers, and promotes       growth and development around the world;        Whereas the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the       public health and economies of the Caribbean and the United       States, which has also contributed to inequality within and       between nations, and further excluded vulnerable groups from       the benefits of trade and economic development;        Whereas the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to       strengthen supply chain resilience and increase near-shoring       in global trade;        Whereas the United States believes that free and fair trade       practices, economic growth, and stable domestic employment       foster democratic principles of good governance;        Whereas United States and Caribbean economic ties,       including through Caribbean services and manufacturing       sectors, produce critical goods and services for consumers       and jobs for workers that strengthen their economies;        Whereas such economic ties serve strategic purposes by       providing an alternative to potentially predatory economic       practices of other foreign governments, including non-market       economies, in the Caribbean that harm national and regional       interests in the Western Hemisphere;        Whereas climate change and natural disasters pose acute       risks for Caribbean people and island economies; and        Whereas the United States signed a Trade and Investment       Framework Agreement in  [[Page H5950]]       2013 with CARICOM to drive strengthened trade and investment       ties between CARICOM and the United States: Now, therefore,       be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) urges the President to prioritize and implement trade       programs with the Caribbean region that promote sustainable       and resilient economic development;        (2) commits to engaging directly with diverse stakeholders       from the Caribbean, including CARICOM Trade Ministers,       policymakers, as well as labor, business, and civil society       representatives, to dialogue and develop a shared       multilateral trade agenda;        (3) affirms trade and tariff preference programs that       strengthen the economic relationship between the Caribbean       and the United States and produce economic benefits for       people of all racial, ethnic, gender, ability, economic,       linguistic, and religious backgrounds;        (4) encourages further enhancing trade programs between the       Caribbean and the United States; and        (5) supports critical trade policies and preference       programs, such as HELP and HOPE II, and further commits to       strengthen those policies to ensure they advance sustainable       economic development, produce positive economic benefits in       Haiti, the Caribbean, and the United States, and protect our       most vulnerable communities.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me begin by commending my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle, Representatives Wenstrup, Sewell, and Blumenauer, and  indeed the membership of the Ways and Means Committee collectively, for  joining me in support of U.S. trade and economic relations with our  Caribbean neighbors.   This resolution is the product of a year's worth of work, and today  would not be possible without the bipartisan support of my colleagues  from across the aisle, particularly Representative Wenstrup, and his  leadership, and our shared commitment to a focus on U.S. trade  engagement with the Caribbean.   This resolution commits to enhance the economic partnership between  the United States and the Caribbean region through strengthened trade  engagement, including by promoting economic growth and development  across the region, engaging directly with diverse stakeholders from the  Caribbean, and supporting critical trade policies and preference  programs.   The Caribbean, along with Latin America, has experienced significant  challenges in recent years. According to the International Monetary  Fund, IMF, we have seen a larger GDP contraction from the region than  any other place in the world. Simultaneously, per capita deaths from  COVID have been greater from the Caribbean and Latin America than any  other region in the world. Furthermore, many of the islands and  countries in the Caribbean have also experienced severe natural  disasters, such as the recent earthquake in Haiti and numerous other  extreme weather events like hurricanes.   So this resolution simply expresses support for furthering U.S. trade  ties and economic relations with the Caribbean region. Overall, the  resolution expresses the importance of the existing economic  partnerships between the United States and the Caribbean region and  strengthening U.S. trade and investment ties with the region.   Presently, the U.S. does about $35 billion in trade with the region,  and American businesses can have a greater opportunity to grow in the  region with our help.   Deepening economic ties between the U.S. and the Caribbean region  helps American partnerships across the Western Hemisphere, where we  support budding democracies at our doorstep and create mutually  beneficial economic stability with our neighbors. Reciprocal trade is  one of the mechanisms we pursue to do that.   Our overall trade agenda was well served by agreements like the 2013  Trade and Investment Framework Agreement between the U.S. and the  Caribbean Community, CARICOM, as well as important trade promotion  programs like the U.S.-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act and the  HOPE/HELP trade preference programs for Haiti.   The Ways and Means Committee will be taking a hard look at what is  needed for the Caribbean. As this resolution provides, we will engage  with diverse stakeholders, including CARICOM trade ministers,  policymakers, as well as labor, business, and civil society  representatives, to dialogue and develop a shared multilateral trade  agenda.   The trade programs that we have for the Caribbean, especially the  Caribbean Basin Initiative programs like CBTPA preference programs,  along with HOPE/HELP for Haiti, have historically enjoyed bipartisan  and bicameral support, in part because of the shared history and close  ties that the United States has with the Caribbean region.   I am pleased that this resolution also indicates how important the  HOPE/HELP trade promotion program is for our sister nation of Haiti. I  am committed to strengthening and renewing this program in a timely  fashion.   Like any good trading relationship, we must continue to work to  improve labor conditions, political stability, and especially to expand  economic development to all countries in the important region of the  Caribbean.   President Bush recognized the importance of this region by naming it  as our ``Third Border.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. The  month of June was Caribbean American Heritage Month. There are about 13  million Americans who have Caribbean ancestry here in this country.  They represent 4 percent of the American population. This is an  opportunity for us to reaffirm this community and demonstrate to our  neighboring nations in the Caribbean that we are committed to working  together to improve trade and economic conditions.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Nebraska for his words, and I  indeed recognize with him the importance of American engagement in the  region. As Americans, this is our border. We must be engaged in the  region so that others do not usurp our authority, our position in the  region, and so our American businesses can grow as well. Economic  development in this area is in the best interest of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
