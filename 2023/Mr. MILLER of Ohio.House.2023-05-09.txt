Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 676, the bill now  under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H2146]]    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 676, the Coastal Communities  Ocean Acidification Act. This bill contains simple and straightforward  tweaks to an important program and existing working group. It ensures  the participation of Indian Tribes and affected communities in ocean  and coastal acidification activities.   Over a decade ago, the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and  Monitoring Act of 2009 directed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, or NOAA, to increase their focus on ocean and coastal  acidification--the process in which the chemistry of oceans is altered  and made more acidic after absorbing carbon dioxide.   To do this, NOAA established an interagency working group with State  and local governments, industry, academia, and other representatives.  They also stood up a research program and published a strategic plan  for coordinated Federal activities on acidification. Yet, while not  excluded from these activities, there was no direct mention of the  inclusion of Indian Tribes and communities affected by ocean and  coastal acidification. This bill remedies that oversight by including  specific language to coordinate vulnerability assessments and research  planning with State, local, and Tribal Governments.   This bill also ensures that two representatives from Indian Tribes,  Tribal organizations, or Tribal consortia affected by ocean  acidification are on the Ocean Acidification Advisory Board with the  other members of industry, academia, and subject matter experts.   When it comes to acidification, it is a common misconception that  only communities touching the ocean see the effects. In fact, the most  recent ocean acidification research plan found that the Great Lakes are  projected to become more acidic at a rate similar to that of the  oceans.   This finding raises concerns for me because part of my district in  Ohio sits on the southern shore of Lake Erie and benefits from the $7  billion annual economic value that the Great Lakes provide.   Luckily, NOAA recognizes the tremendous asset that the region offers  and has a dedicated laboratory, the Great Lakes Environmental Research  Laboratory, to conduct scientific research on the Great Lakes and their  coastal ecosystems.   Madam Speaker, that is why I support the all-hands-on-deck approach  this bill ensures. Smaller or overlooked communities like Indian Tribes  have direct knowledge of the effects of acidification, both on the  coast and inland, and can be an important resource. It only makes sense  that they have a seat at the table to provide input on research,  assessments, and mitigation that will benefit all of us.   I thank the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree) and the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Waltz) for introducing this bill, and their many  cosponsors for supporting it.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers at this  time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for  time. I am prepared to close once the gentlewoman from Michigan does,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Speaker, I want to reiterate my support for this bill, H.R.  676. Despite the title, the Coastal Communities Ocean Acidification Act  has the potential to benefit more than just coastal communities and  oceans.   The Great Lakes basin is home to approximately 43 million people, 8  percent of the United States population, and supports $62 billion in  wages. This region and my constituents in Ohio are a small piece of the  $1 billion United States shellfish industry and the hundreds of  thousands of jobs that are affected by ocean and coastal acidification.   Increasing the involvement of Indian Tribes with ongoing NOAA ocean  acidification work will protect this critical economic pillar and lead  to solutions that the entire country can benefit from.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1715) to direct the Department of Energy and the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to conduct  collaborative research in order to advance numerical weather and  climate prediction in the United States, and for other purposes.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1715, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1715, the Advanced  Weather Model Computing Development Act.   This legislation authorizes the collaborative research partnership  between the United States Department of Energy and the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration to improve weather modeling and  prediction on high-performance computers.   Americans rely on accurate weather forecasting before, during, and  after extreme weather events. Recent severe outbreaks across the  country have further highlighted the increased need for more accurate  and effective prediction of extreme weather in every region of the  country. This type of weather prediction relies on the analysis of  increasingly large and complex datasets through high-performance  computing resources.   DOE is home to some of the most advanced supercomputers, including  the first exascale computer, and the most advanced scientific computer  capabilities in the world. This legislation will enable large leaps in  knowledge and operational tools by leveraging DOE's high-performance  computing capabilities to analyze NOAA's complex and large weather  datasets.   By working together, DOE and NOAA can combine their respective  expertise to solve some of today's most challenging problems in  environmental science. By authorizing this partnership, we can ensure  these agencies can continue their essential interagency research for  years to come. We can also save taxpayer money by sharing mutually  beneficial resources instead of building out duplicative capabilities  at different agencies.   This legislation would codify that partnership and provide new paths  forward for this important work and new mechanisms for collaboration.  In this way, we can increase government efficiency by working across  the larger Federal landscape, a good government measure that will not  only result in the protection of lives and property but also  efficiently utilize existing Federal research dollars.   It is smart, bipartisan policy, and I thank Ranking Member Ross for  working with me on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for  time. I am prepared to close once the gentlewoman from California  closes, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I feel the same way and echo the  sentiment, and I thank the gentlewoman for her comments.   As I mentioned in my opening remarks, H.R. 1715 is a good government  bill that leverages existing Federal research dollars to advance  weather and climate science that will protect American lives and  property. It is bipartisan, commonsense legislation, which is why it  recently passed unanimously through the committee.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill once again,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1734) to require coordinated National Institute of  Standards and Technology science and research activities regarding  illicit drugs containing xylazine, novel synthetic opioids, and other  substances of concern, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1734         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(3) Institution of higher education.--The term       ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given       such term in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965       (19 U.S.C. 1001).        (4) NIST.--The term ``NIST'' means the National Institute       of Standards and Technology.        (5) Nonprofit organization.--The term ``nonprofit       organization'' means an organization described in section       501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt       from tax under section 501(a) of such code.        (6) Xylazine.--The term ``xylazine'' means the nonopioid       tranquilizer methyl benzene compound frequently used in       veterinary medicine as an emetic and sedative with analgesic       and muscle relaxant properties.       SEC. 3. REPORT.         Not later that 1 year after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Director of the National Institute of Standards and       Technology shall submit to the Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the       Senate a report on the implementation of this Act. Such       report may include legislative recommendations to improve the       Director's ability to carry out section 2.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1734, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1734, the TRANQ Research  Act, led by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) and the  gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Caraveo).   Unfortunately, we are all too familiar with the destruction opioids  like fentanyl are causing our communities. Now these drugs are being  mixed with animal tranquilizers to create deadly new combinations.   Drugs like tranq are presenting new challenges for law enforcement,  healthcare professionals, and first responders. Without a better  understanding of this drug, we cannot slow  [[Page H2150]]  its spread, combat its effects, or ensure safe handling.   The National Institute of Standards and Technology, known as NIST,  has already done extraordinary work on fentanyl detection, and this  bill allows them to apply their resources and expertise to analyzing  these new variants. With NIST's help, we will improve our ability to  detect and identify these drugs and improve the tools available to keep  first responders and law enforcement safe when dealing with them.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Collins) to speak on his bill.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am ready to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Speaker, as we have heard today, this zombie drug has gruesome  side effects and is leading to an alarming rate of overdose deaths.   Overdose deaths involving tranq have increased in all regions of the  United States, according to the DEA. From 2020 to 2021, these deaths  surged 100 percent in the Northeast, more than 500 percent in the  Midwest, and 750 percent in the West, as well as skyrocketing by more  than 1,100 percent in the South.   Our first responders need every tool they can get to identify and to  fight this growing epidemic of synthetic drugs. H.R. 1734 will  authorize NIST to give them those tools by expanding real-time analysis  capabilities to frontline workers like law enforcement and EMTs.   This legislation was favorably reported out of the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee by a vote of 36-0. It is bipartisan and  addresses a critical issue every district in the Nation is facing.   I thank Representatives Collins and Caraveo for their leadership on  this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
