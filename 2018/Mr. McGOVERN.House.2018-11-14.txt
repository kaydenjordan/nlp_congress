 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse) for yielding  me the customary 30 minutes.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, we are here today considering our first  rule following a long district work period. During that time, we had a  big national debate about the direction of our country. According to  exit polling, the top issue for voters was healthcare and, in  particular, protecting coverage from preexisting conditions.   But that is not what the bill before us addresses. Nor does it  involve immigration, another top issue for voters, or strengthening the  economy or combating gun violence. All of these are what our  constituents just said was important to them.   But instead of doing anything on any of that, we are here today  considering a bill to undermine endangered species protections. Are you  kidding me?   And get this: Also, last night in the Rules Committee, the majority  placed a provision in the rule that would remove the privileged status  of Representative Khanna's War Powers Resolution, H. Con. Res. 138.  This resolution states that Congress never authorized the United  States' support of Saudi-led forces in Yemen and would direct the  President of the United States to end his support.   This measure is a privileged resolution under the terms of the War  Powers Resolution, which provides that resolutions concerning the  involvement of the U.S. military in armed conflict have a direct path  to the floor to be debated and to be voted on.   The rules provide this privileged status because such questions are  among the most important that the people's House can debate. Such  privileged resolutions or a negotiated substitute have come before the  House under Republican and Democratic majorities.   Yet, with this rule before us today, Republicans have taken the  unprecedented step of striking this privilege, preventing us from doing  our constitutional duty and foreclosing the only available mechanism to  compel an up or down vote in Congress regarding our military  involvement in the Yemen war.   As of this morning, this bill, introduced by Congressman Khanna, has  over 80 bipartisan cosponsors, including Democratic Whip Hoyer and  Ranking Members Smith, Lowey, Engel, and myself.   The U.S.-Saudi military campaign in Yemen has triggered the world's  worst humanitarian crisis, prompting the late Saudi dissident Jamal  Khashoggi to call for an end to the war. Published just weeks before  his murder, Khashoggi's Washington Post column was headlined, ``Saudi  Arabia's crown prince must restore dignity to his country by ending  Yemen's cruel war.''   It is unconscionable for Republican leadership to take this  unprecedented action to strip Members of their right to bring such  measures to the floor for debate.   Mr. Speaker, what is the majority afraid of? We should be debating  this.  [[Page H9517]]  Instead, the Republican majority continues to turn a deaf ear to this  and many other issues.   We are 11 days away from our government running out of funding. Five  appropriations bills have been signed into law so far. They have funded  75 percent of the government, but there is more work that we need to  do.   We should be continuing that momentum and getting the job done,  keeping the lights on, not wasting time considering a bill to attack an  endangered species.   Or how about reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance Program that  expires at the end of this month or putting a comprehensive  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act on the House floor  that is set to expire December 7, not to mention the need to  reauthorize the farm bill that expired back on October 1.                                time  1600    Our country's farmers are depending upon this Congress to put into  place a new bill that provides them with certainty, especially in light  of the trade war that President Trump has started; yet the majority  has, instead, prioritized a bill that completely ignores all the  important issues that we face in this country.   The American people have clearly had enough. They demanded a new  direction and a new Congress that actually addresses what they care  most about, and they demanded an end to this closed process. This rule  marks the 102nd closed rule of this Congress. Now, let me repeat that:  the 102nd closed rule. Mr. Speaker, that is a staggering number.   Now, I am not suggesting that every rule needs to be an open one or  that there is never a time for a closed rule, but there is never a time  for more than 100 closed rules. There is no justification for that at  all.   Since the election, I heard my friends on the other side of the aisle  express a hope that the next Congress is a more accommodating one. That  is ironic since the Republicans have voted in lockstep for one closed  rule after another, after another, after another.   But to them, I ask: Why wait? A Democratic majority will certainly be  better than the current one. But Republicans don't have to wait until  January. They could demand a more open process here today by voting  against this closed rule.   This is your chance to prove that your newfound calls for openness  are above more than politics. Vote against this record-breaking closed  rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Washington State, my good friend, Mr.  Newhouse, seemed to imply that it would be an inconvenience for us to  have the House consider a measure on Yemen, and I am a little bit  puzzled by that. The reason why Representative Khanna took the step is  because, for months, while this terrible carnage has unfolded in Yemen,  this House has done nothing.   We just learned that the Saudi Government was directly involved in  the killing of a Washington Post journalist and, again, nothing-- nothing at all. The Republicans took the unprecedented step of  basically derailing this privileged resolution. It is unprecedented.   Over 100,000 Yemeni children have already perished because of war- triggered  [[Page H9518]]  hunger and disease over the past 2 years. Why is the Republican  leadership stripping us of the right to debate?   According to the U.N., 14 million people in Yemen--half the  population--face an imminent and catastrophic famine not seen in 100  years if this war is not ended.   Why is the Republican leadership stripping our right to debate? I  don't understand what they are afraid of. It is not like they have a  lot to do. We are going to be talking about gray wolves today, and we  are not voting on this until Friday. They have nothing going on.  Certainly, we should have time to debate this important humanitarian  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Pocan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when my Republican friends want to dedicate the next 3  days to talking about gray wolves, people are being murdered every  single hour in Yemen. The Saudi-led effort even bombed a school bus  filled with innocent children. So it seems to me that there could be no  more important time for debate in the House on ending U.S. military  support for this war.   I just don't know what the Republican majority is afraid of.  Privileged resolutions--I want my colleagues to understand this--by  Members of this House, have always been allowed to be debated on this  House floor, under Republican and Democrat majorities alike until now;  until today. I don't know what the Republican majority is afraid of.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me begin by reminding my colleagues what the Republicans are  proposing here, it is that the next 3 days be dedicated to the gray  wolf. We are not debating healthcare, we are not debating the economy,  or jobs, or keeping the government running, but it is to this.   They bring it to us under a rule that is completely closed, so there  are no amendments to be made in order, and the rule is even worse  because it basically undercuts the privilege resolution introduced by  Mr. Khanna so we could debate this horrific war going on in Yemen.                                time  1630    It takes my breath away at the lengths that this majority goes  through to basically deny Members of Congress the right to be able to  talk about important issues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Khanna), who is the author of the privileged resolution on Yemen.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Vermont an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, undermining endangered species protections isn't a  national emergency. We shouldn't be prioritizing it today.   Not only is this rule a closed one, as you have heard from our side  over and over and over again, Republicans took the unprecedented step  of removing the privileged status of a resolution that would have given  us the chance to debate the United States' support of the war in Yemen.  We should be voting on this.   People are dying every minute in Yemen. Our silence and our inaction  mean that we are complicit.   I have always believed that if the United States stands for anything,  then we need to stand out loud and foursquare for human rights. There  was a time when the issue of human rights was a bipartisan concern. But  it is clear that this administration doesn't give a damn about human  rights. But that doesn't mean that this institution should follow suit.  Human rights ought to be the centerpiece of our foreign policy.   There are innocent people being killed every single day. Children  were riding to school in buses where the buses have been bombed, where  these children have died, have been murdered, and all my Republican  friends can say is: Oh, you can take care of that after January when  you are in charge. We are just going to spend the next 3 days dedicated  to the issue of gray wolves.   Really?   There is so much real work in front of us, including our most basic  responsibility of funding this government and reauthorizing programs  like the National Flood Insurance Program, the Violence Against Women  Act, and the farm bill. I could go on and on and on. Education costs  are skyrocketing. Americans are afraid coverage for their preexisting  conditions will be ripped away by this administration and its allies in  Congress because you have tried to do it dozens and dozens and dozens  of times. How about doing something about that?   It was interesting, during the campaign, my Republican colleagues  were rushing to every microphone they could find to say that they  somehow supported covering preexisting conditions. Let me remind  everybody, and especially my Republican colleagues, that that was a  Democratic idea that you opposed.   This was the worst election for Republican Presidents since  Watergate. Maybe that is why Republicans are trying to rewrite history.   But here is another politically popular idea Republicans should  follow: bringing an end to the most closed Congress in history. Let's  let some sunlight in. Don't wait until January. Start today by voting  against this closed rule and demand action on things that our  constituents actually care about.   Just one final note, again, on this unprecedented move of basically  denying us the right to debate this war in Yemen: I agree with what Mr.  Khanna said. History is going to look back on our inaction not only on  the war in Yemen, but on our inaction dealing with the brutality of the  Saudi regime.   I would have thought that when we came back that one of the first  items up on the agenda would be holding the Saudi Government  accountable. Instead, we got nothing. Not only we get nothing, you take  the unprecedented step of denying a Member of this House the right that  he has under the privileges of this House to debate this issue of war.   This is so wrong. This is damaging to the institution, and it shows a  callous disregard for what is happening in Yemen.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, do the  right thing and vote against this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
