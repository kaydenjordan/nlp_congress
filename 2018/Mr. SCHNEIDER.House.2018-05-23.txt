 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking member for  yielding me the time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to increase  flexibility within the Small Business Innovative Research and  Technology Transfer Programs.   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member  Smith for including it in this en bloc package.   Federal research programs invest in the future and ensure we stay at  the global forefront of innovation and advancement.   But this investment is only the first step of the process. We must  ensure that innovators and entrepreneurs have the tools necessary to  bring their ideas to market.   Currently, SBIR and STTR recipients are restricted in how much  funding they can use towards commercialization.   My amendment would increase the amount of funding recipients in phase  1 and phase 2 can use to pay for assistance protecting intellectual  property, conducting market research, mapping out manufacturing plans,  and other steps that would help them successfully commercialize their  ideas.   My amendment would help empower successful innovators with more  resources to turn federally funded research into viable commercial  products, creating quality jobs and securing our Nation's creative  leadership.                                time  1445    Modification to Amendments En Bloc No. 1 offered by Mr. Thornberry of                                   Texas     Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, Mr. Smith, for  yielding.   I rise today in support of my amendment to formally codify the Boots  to Business program, and I want to thank my friend from Iowa,  Congressman Rod Blum, for his work on this amendment and on our bill,  the Veterans Entrepreneurship Training Act.   As transitioning servicemembers enter civilian life, they bring  adaptability and experience to excel as entrepreneurs. However, they  often lack business-specific skills or experience that can help bring  their ideas to reality.  [[Page H4678]]    The Boots to Business program seeks to fill these gaps and helps  prepare transitioning servicemembers, their spouses, and also veterans  for challenges starting their own small business.   Participants take a 2-day, in-person course on business ownership,  followed by an in-depth, 8-week online course that teaches them day-to- day skills they will need to run a successful small business, such as  the fundamentals in developing a business plan and how to acquire  financing.   I am grateful my amendment is included in the NDAA, and I am hopeful  we can continue to expand Boots to Business so that more servicemembers  and veterans can start and grow their own small business.
