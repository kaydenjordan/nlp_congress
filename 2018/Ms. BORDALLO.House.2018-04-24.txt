 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the crew of  the USS Frank Cable, a submarine tender homeported at Naval Base Guam.   The Frank Cable and her crew were selected for the 2018 Secretary of  the Navy's Environmental Award for large deck combatants in recognition  of the crew's efforts. The Frank Cable crew have worked diligently to  minimize waste aboard and helped to clean up local communities, both on  Guam and where they are deployed abroad. Caring for our island and  conserving Guam's natural resources are among my top priorities, and I  am immensely proud of the Frank Cable crew's achievement.   The Secretary of the Navy's award this year, plus a second award to  the USS Frank Cable, the 2017 Chief of Naval Operations Environmental  Excellence Award, are examples of the partnership between the U.S.  military and the people of Guam that we need.   I, again, applaud the USS Frank Cable crew on their awards, and I  hope that the military will continue to act as responsible stewards of  our island.                            ____________________
