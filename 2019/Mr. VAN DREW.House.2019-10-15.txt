 Madam Speaker, Laurie Zaleski is the owner and founder  of Funny Farm Animal Rescue and Sanctuary in Hamilton Township in south  Jersey.   Currently, there are around 700 animals in Laurie's care. Even with  all these animals to care for, Laurie still works full time for the FAA  as a graphic designer and a pilot.   Laurie also has cowritten two books and created a DVD about her farm  and takes a few of her animals with her to local schools and to nursing  homes to read her books.  [[Page H8141]]    Laurie's farm, as well as her books and her videos, provides  educational experiences for all ages. Laurie doesn't charge admission  fees, as her farm sustains itself with dedicated volunteers and runs  solely on donations, 100 percent of which are given only to the  animals.   I thank Laurie and all the volunteers for the love of animals that  Funny Farm Annual Rescue fosters in our community in south Jersey.  Laurie is truly a south Jersey star.                            ____________________
