 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  yielding.  [[Page H3318]]    Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule.   While I do not support the legislation this rule brings up, that is  not the main reason for my objection. I am opposed to the rule before  us because provision 6 in the rule turns off section 202 of the  National Emergencies Act relating to the COVID-19 national emergency  for the remainder of the 117th Congress.   What this line really does is kill a joint resolution I introduced 2  weeks ago in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The framers  of this act wrote the law to inject congressional oversight to rein in  the emergency powers codified into U.S. law that give the President  additional powers in times of declared emergency.   Section 202 outlined the process where, 6 months after an emergency  is declared, Congress meets to consider a joint resolution of  termination, forcing the debate on the necessity of continuing the  national emergency and correlating powers given to the President.   Over a year later, Congress has never met to debate the merit of the  COVID-19 declared emergency, even after the President extended the  emergency another year. This is because Congress has a poor track  record in enforcing our emergency duties.   In fact, there are over 30 active emergencies on the books dating  back to the Carter administration--hardly emergencies, I take it--few  of which this body has ever met to debate the merit of the emergency  and the powers it invokes.   With nationwide cases falling, vaccine rates rising, mask mandates  being lifted, and States reopening with no capacity limits, it would  seem appropriate to debate whether or not this Nation is truly in a  state of emergency, not to mention, once again, the mandated duties of  oversight of the executive branch.   Therefore, I introduced H.J. Res. 52 to have this debate. I did this  because the first joint resolution I introduced was killed in a prior  rule.                                time  1300    Now the majority is killing debate on the COVID emergency for the  entire 117th Congress unless the majority leadership determines we can  have this debate. I guess that is not part of the law.   This completely goes against the explicit expedited procedure in the  law providing for quick and efficient oversight. This is tyranny of the  majority at its finest.   Why must we continue to neglect our duties?   Why must we continue the congressional track record of being asleep  at the wheel and yielding more power to the executive?   The National Emergencies Act mandates that we have this debate, and  that is all my joint resolution does--require the people's  Representatives to meet, debate, and vote on a termination resolution  of the COVID emergency powers in accordance with the law.   Madam Speaker, you may feel that we are still in an emergency. You  may still feel COVID is a threat but not a national emergency, or you  may feel the national emergency is over. However you feel, I am simply  asking that we engage in the debate as the law requires.   Using the National Emergencies Act, the executive has requested  powers outside the scope of Article II. As this declared emergency  continues, the executive could request even more. This body should  debate on whether to rein in the extraordinary powers, especially among  the backdrop of a radically different COVID situation in this Nation.   In a time when this body is trying to reassert its claim on Article I  authorization, simple oversight like this restores trust. Trust is a  series of promises kept with the citizens of this great Nation. Imagine  that, trust, just by following the definitions and the law.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule.
