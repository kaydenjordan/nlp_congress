 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, once again, we are hearing chatter from  some Democratic Senators about abolishing the filibuster. I had hoped  we would move on from such talk after multiple Democratic Senators  pledged to uphold the filibuster but apparently not. Apparently, some  Democrats think that they can pressure or bully those Senators and  other Democratic Senators who have expressed reservations into going  back on their word.   Let me quote a former Senator on attempts to change filibuster rules  in the Senate, and I am quoting:         We should make no mistake. This nuclear option is       ultimately an example of the arrogance of power. It is a       fundamental power grab by the majority party. . . . Folks who       want to see this change want to eliminate one of the       procedural mechanisms designed for the express purpose of       guaranteeing individual rights, and they also have a       consequence, and would undermine the protections of a       minority point of view in the heat of majority excess.    That was former Senator Joe Biden.   Here is what a current Senator had to say on eliminating the  legislative filibuster, and again I quote:         I can tell you that would be the end of the Senate as it       was originally devised and created going back to our Founding       Fathers. We have to acknowledge our respect for the minority,       and that is what the Senate tries to do in its composition       and in its procedure.    That was a statement from the current Democratic whip in 2018.   In 2017, 33 Democratic Senators signed a letter urging that the  legislative filibuster be preserved--2017.   Of course, Democrats have not limited their support of the filibuster  to words; they have supported it by their actions. In the last  Congress, Democrats set a record for forcing cloture votes, which is  what has to happen in order to end a filibuster. They repeatedly used  the filibuster when they disagreed with legislation that Republicans  were advancing. They filibustered COVID relief. They filibustered  police reform even though Senator Scott and Leader McConnell had  committed to a robust, bipartisan amendment process. They filibustered  pro-life legislation, and they made it very clear that they deeply  regretted the fact that they could not filibuster judicial nominees--a  situation, I would point out, of their own making. Even without the  judicial filibuster, they used every tool at their disposal to slow  down judicial nominations.   So, as of last year, Democrats' actions clearly demonstrated their  firm support of the filibuster, but now that they have actually taken  power here in Washington, albeit by the slimmest possible majority,  they are pushing to get rid of it.   Democrats, of course, would like people to believe that this is a  principled change; that all of a sudden, they have realized that it is  really much better for the country if the majority party gets to do  whatever it wants when it is in charge. Well, I just have to say, if  you believe that, I have some nice oceanfront property in South Dakota  to sell you.   I doubt that there is anyone anywhere in the country who seriously  thinks that the Democrats' dramatic 180-degree turn on the filibuster  is a principled reversal of their previous position. No, this isn't  about principle. It is partisanship. It is political expediency.  Democrats' principles haven't changed; their power in the Senate has.  They are in charge now. They don't want anything holding them back,  like that pesky Senate rule that they have used so often to their  advantage.   The truth is, Democrats want a one-sided advantage. Last year, they  were perfectly happy to exercise their rights as a minority and  filibuster any Republican legislature they didn't like, but now that  they are in charge, they want to deny the minority a right Democrats  repeatedly exercised when they were in power. They are apparently too  shortsighted to see that their proposal could be turned back on them in  an instant.   When Democrats abolished the filibuster for judicial nominees, Leader  McConnell warned Democrats that they would reap the whirlwind, and they  did. Much to Democrats' horror, President Trump ended up being the  chief beneficiary of the abolition of the filibuster for judicial  nominees, appointing a vast number of conservative judges to the  Federal bench.   Several Democratic Senators have openly admitted that they had made a  mistake by abolishing the judicial filibuster. The junior Senator from  Delaware came to the floor in April 2017 and said he regretted changing  the rules in 2013. The senior Senator from Minnesota not only said she  regretted changing the rules, she went so far as to say in 2018 that  she would support bringing back the 60-vote requirement. Yet now  Democrats are apparently ready to abolish--abolish--the legislative  filibuster. How have they not learned their lesson? Unless Democrats  are so arrogant as to think they will never again be in the minority.    Some Democrats have suggested that we need to abolish the filibuster  because otherwise the Senate won't get anything done. Well, not quite.  Not quite. It is not that the filibuster could prevent us from getting  anything done; it is that it could prevent us from getting everything  Democrats want done. That is a big difference.   The truth is, Democrats could easily get something done in the Senate  if they were willing to actually work with Republicans. And by ``work  with Republicans,'' I don't mean inviting Republicans to join their  bills while excluding any meaningful Republican input. I don't mean  threatening Republicans to support their bills on pain of having the  filibuster abolished or substantially altered. No, I mean genuinely  inviting Republicans to the table.   Now, it would mean the Democrats wouldn't get everything they want  done, and, of course, Republicans certainly wouldn't get everything we  want done, but we could get something done. In fact, we could get some  pretty meaningful things done. We could negotiate an infrastructure  bill. We could pass section 230 reform, like the bipartisan bill I  introduced with Senator Schatz yesterday. We could pass police reform  legislation, expand domestic manufacturing capacity, and protect  election integrity. We could do all of that and more if Democrats would  engage in genuine bipartisan negotiation.   Is it really too much to ask that Democrats find 10 Republicans to  work with on major legislative items? Everyone would like to pass their  unedited agenda just like they want it, but that is not how things are  supposed to work, at least not in the U.S. Senate, and it is certainly  not how it is supposed to work when, like Democrats, you barely have a  majority. The Senate and, indeed, our whole system of government were  designed to prevent a partisan majority from steamrolling through its  unedited, unchecked agenda.   Let's just talk for a minute about the purpose of the Senate.  Actually, let me take a step back and talk about the purpose of our  whole system of government.   Our Founders established not a pure democracy, where the will of the  majority reigns unchecked, but a democratic Republic. It was their  intention  [[Page S1627]]  to combine majority rule with representation and protection for the  minority. Why? Because the Founders knew very well that it wasn't just  Kings who could be tyrants. They knew that majorities could be tyrants,  too, and that a majority of citizens could easily trample the rights of  the minority. So they put safeguards in place throughout our  government, checks and balances to keep the government in check and  ensure that minority as well as majority rights were protected.   One of those safeguards was the U.S. Senate. Wary of, to quote  Federalist 62, ``the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies  to yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions,'' the Founders  created the Senate as a check on the House of Representatives. They  made the Senate smaller and Senators' terms of office longer, with the  intention of creating a more stable, more thoughtful, and more  deliberative legislative body to check ill-considered or intemperate  legislation and attempts to curtail minority rights.   As time has gone on, the legislative filibuster has become a key tool  in preserving the Founders' vision of the Senate. The filibuster does  indeed make it harder to get legislation through the Senate, and that  is a good thing. That is what the Founders intended. The Senate was not  designed to be a rubberstamp for a partisan agenda; it was intended to  check partisanship or, as the Founders might put it, faction.   Now, does the filibuster sometimes stop good legislation from getting  passed? Of course it does. Last Congress, it stopped us from passing  legislation to protect unborn babies who can feel pain from being  killed by abortion. The failure of the Senate to pass that bill, I  think, is a tragedy, but just as you don't abolish the burden of proof  in criminal cases just because some criminal sometimes escapes justice  for lack of evidence, you don't permanently remove protections for  minority rights because you might be able to force through a good piece  of legislation.   In 2005, when some Republicans were suggesting eliminating the  filibuster for judicial nominees, then-Senator Joe Biden said:         I say to my friends on the Republican side: You may own the       field right now, but you won't own it forever. I pray God       when the Democrats take back control, we don't make the kind       of naked power grab you are doing.    Fortunately, in 2005, Republicans didn't take that step. And in 2017  and 2018, when President Trump was pushing for Republicans, who were in  the majority at the time, to abolish the legislative filibuster so he  could push through our agenda and we could push through our agenda, we  said no.   For the future of the Senate and our system of government, I pray  that Democrats will make the same decision.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Louisiana (Mr. Kennedy).
