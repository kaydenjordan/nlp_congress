 Mr. Speaker, President Biden's waters of the United States  rule seeks to insert the Federal Government into every stream, pond,  and ditch in America, even those on private property.   When I am back in Oklahoma, I regularly hear from farmers, ranchers,  energy producers, and small businesses about their concerns with the  Biden administration's WOTUS rule.   For my constituents, it is absolutely unthinkable that a Federal  bureaucrat from Washington would come on their private property to  regulate an intermittent stream that may only have water in it for a  few days a year. This is a huge overreach.   It is also worth noting that regulations such as WOTUS, along with  others from Federal, State, and local governments, account for up to 25  percent of the price of a new single-family home and over 40 percent  for a multifamily development.   Under WOTUS, the significant nexus test would result in increased  regulatory uncertainty for Oklahomans. Furthermore, the ambiguous  nature of its policies will further delay vital projects on strict  timelines.   Despite bipartisan opposition to the WOTUS rule, President Biden  still elected to veto the resolution.   American families, farmers, and small businesses are suffering under  the economic crises caused by President Biden's policies. The last  thing they need is more burdensome regulations.   Today's vote to overturn Biden's veto would empower local landowners  instead of giving power to unelected Federal bureaucrats.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.
