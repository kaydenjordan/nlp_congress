 Mr. President, among the many barriers to safely bringing  students, teachers, and staff back to school for in-person instruction  is the condition of school facilities. A recent Government  Accountability Office (GAO) report found that over half (54 percent) of  school districts nationwide need to update or replace multiple systems  in their schools, such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning  (HVAC), or plumbing. These systems are especially critical to  safeguarding public health as we combat COVID-19.   Now is the time to invest in school infrastructure. Doing so will  improve the resilience of our schools, improve student learning, reduce  carbon emissions, and create jobs. That is why I am proud to partner  with Chairman Scott in the House of Representatives in introducing the  Reopen and Rebuild America's Schools Act to fix our schools. I would  like to thank my Senate colleagues who are joining in this effort,  including Senators Brown, Booker, Cardin, Cortez Masto, Whitehouse,  Merkley, Hirono, Gillibrand, Van Hollen, Rosen, Smith, Murphy, Shaheen,  Klobuchar, Lujan, Casey, Durbin, Warren, Blumenthal, Hassan, Heinrich,  Duckworth, Coons, Leahy, and Stabenow.   Public schools play a vital role in every community across the  Nation. They play a central role in our democracy--educating the next  generation, serving as polling places for our elections, hosting  community meetings and events, and so much more. When there is a  natural disaster or an emergency, people often gather at their public  schools for shelter, information, and resources. They are essential  facilities and must be included in any new major federal investment in  infrastructure.   Safe, healthy, modern, well-equipped schools are also essential for  advancing student achievement and ensuring that the next generation is  prepared to meet the economic, social, environmental, and global  challenges our Nation faces. Yet, too many of the over 50 million  students and six million staff who learn and work in our public schools  spend their days in facilities that fail to make the grade. In fact,  the American Society of Civil Engineers gave public school buildings  across the country an overall grade of D+ in its latest report card.  The 2016 State of Our Schools report found that state and local  governments spend $46 billion less than what is required to update and  maintain their school facilities.   States and local communities cannot bridge this gap alone, especially  when many struggle to simply keep teachers and staff on the payroll. We  know the budget shortfalls will hit low-income and minority communities  the hardest. The GAO report found high poverty schools were more likely  to rely on state funding to cover the cost of building repairs compared  to wealthier schools, which were more likely to fund projects through  local property taxes. The Federal government can and should be a  partner in upgrading our public school facilities.   Addressing this need is not only the right thing to do for our  students; it will also give a needed boost to our economy, putting  people to work in family sustaining jobs. According to an analysis by  the Economic Policy Institute, every $1 billion spent on construction  generates 17,785 jobs.   The Reopen and Rebuild America's Schools Act of 2021 will create a  Federal-State partnership for school infrastructure. It will provide,  over ten years, a total of $130 billion in direct grants and school  construction bonds to help fill the annual gap in school facility  capital needs, while creating nearly two million jobs.   Specifically, the Reopen and Rebuild America's Schools Act will  provide $100 billion in formula funds to states for local competitive  grants for school repair, renovation, and construction. States will  focus assistance on communities with the greatest financial need,  encourage green construction practices, and expand access to high-speed  broadband to ensure that all students have access to digital learning.  Our legislation would also provide $30 billion for qualified school  infrastructure bonds (QSIBs), $10 billion each year from FY 2022  through FY 2024, and restore the Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZABs)  that were eliminated in the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The  legislation also eases the matching requirements and expands the  authority and eligible purposes of QZABs to allow local education  agencies to construct, rehabilitate, retrofit, or repair school  facilities. The Reopen and Rebuild America's Schools Act also supports  American workers by ensuring that projects use American-made iron,  steel, and manufactured products and meet labor standards.   I would like to thank the broad coalition of educators, community  organizations, unions, civil rights advocates, and employers that have  provided feedback and support for this legislation, including the 21st  Century Schools Fund, AASA The School Superintendents Association,  American Association of School Administrators, American Concrete  Pavement Association, American Concrete Pipe Association, American  Concrete Pressure Pipe Association, American Concrete Pumping  Association, American Federation of Teachers, American Federation of  State, County and Municipal Employees, Association of Educational  Service Agencies, Association of Latino Administrators and  Superintendents, Association of School Business Officials  International, Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development,  BlueGreen Alliance, Build America's School Infrastructure Coalition,  Californians for School Facilities, Coalition for Healthier Schools,  Concrete Foundations Association, Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute,  Council of Great City Schools, Green Building Initiative, Healthy  Schools Network, International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail  and Transportation Workers (SMART), International Union of Bricklayers  and Allied Craftworkers, International Union of Operating Engineers,  International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, National Association  of Federally Impacted Schools, National Association of Elementary  School Principals, National Association of Federally Impacted Schools,  National Association of School Nurses, National Association of  Secondary School Principals, National Concrete Masonry Association,  National Education Association, National Precast Concrete Association,  National PTA, National Ready Mixed Concrete, National Rural Education  Advocacy Consortium, National Rural Education Association, National  Urban League, North America's Building Trades Union, North American  Concrete Alliance, Organizations Concerned About Rural Education,  Parents for School Safety, Portland Cement Association, Precast/ Prestressed Concrete Institute, Public Advocacy for Kids, Rebuild  America's Schools Coalition, Rural School and Community Trust, Teach  Plus, The Brick Industry Association, Tilt-Up Concrete Association,  U.S. Green Building Council, and the United Steelworkers.   We have no time to waste in fixing our deteriorating school  infrastructure. In the words of a student activist in Providence, Rhode  Island: ``Students cannot learn in a crumbling building, a school that  isn't fit to uplift our minds.'' We need to listen to our students,  strengthen our communities,  [[Page S201]]  and improve our school buildings. I urge all of our colleagues to  support the Reopen and Rebuild America's Schools Act and press for its  passage                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 102. A bill to amend the West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016 to  authorize the use of certain funds received pursuant to leases entered  into under such Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to  address the decades of underinvestment in our Nation's libraries by  reinstating Federal support for library construction.   Libraries are essential community institutions that give the public  access to information and services that expand learning and promote  economic opportunity. When we invest in our libraries, we are offering  a helping hand and hope for the future. During natural disasters and  economic upheaval, libraries offer the resources and information that  help people get back on their feet. As the Rolling Stones' Keith  Richards reportedly said, ``The public library is the great  equalizer.''   Over the last year, COVID-19 and the heightened attention to racial  and economic inequality have made clear that investment in our  communities should be a national priority as we work to lift people up  and bring the country closer together. And that our investment in  infrastructure must encompass vital community assets like schools and  libraries and not just roads, bridges, and highways.   And while we know libraries are more than buildings with books and  computers, they are still buildings. For thirty years, the Federal  government invested in the physical infrastructure of our libraries,  but abandoned that program in the early 1990s. The intervening years  have taken their toll on library facilities. Indeed, the average  library building is now more than 40 years old and many need large- scale improvements and modernization.   On top of this longstanding underinvestment, the pandemic has forced  libraries to adapt and innovate to meet the evolving needs of their  communities despite limited financial resources. The American Library  Association projects billions of dollars in losses to libraries over  the course of the pandemic, at a time when reliance on libraries from  low-income, underserved, and Tribal communities is increasing. The  pandemic's outsized impact on vulnerable communities only heightens the  urgency of investing in libraries.   The Build America's Libraries Act would make $5 billion available  over three years to support improvements to library facilities and  invest in new library infrastructure to expand the reach of library  services and programs. Priority is given to libraries that demonstrate  the greatest need and predominantly serve underserved or distressed  communities. The legislation also places emphasis on projects that seek  to enhance facility safety, high-speed broadband access, accessibility  for those with disabilities, or energy efficiency. Library construction  funded by this legislation will directly boost our struggling economy  by putting Americans to work and strengthening the facilities that  connect patrons with educational and workforce training resources and  local economic opportunities.   Libraries have always anchored our communities, and as such, we  should ensure their ability to provide critical services for years to  come. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Whitehouse, Wyden, and  Sanders in introducing this bill, which has the support of many  organizations, including the American Library Association; American  Indian Library Association; American Institute of Architects; American  Society of Interior Designers; Association of Tribal Archives,  Libraries, and Museums; Association for Rural & Small Libraries; Chief  Officers of State Library Agencies; Council of State Archivists;  Education Market Association; International WELL Building Institute;  National Coalition for History; National Coalition for Literacy;  National Digital Inclusion Alliance; National Summer Learning  Association; Schools, Health & Libraries Broadband Coalition; and Urban  Libraries Council. I hope that our colleagues will join us in  cosponsoring the Build America's Libraries Act and work for its  inclusion in any infrastructure package.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 138.
