 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank Mr.  Stephen Gaither for his dedication and service to our Nation's  veterans.   After over 40 years of service, Mr. Gaither is retiring as the public  affairs officer at the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital in  Columbia, Missouri.   Mr. Gaither has spent his entire life serving this great Nation. In  addition to his numerous years serving our veterans at the Truman VA,  Mr. Gaither served in the United States Air Force, the Utah Air  National Guard, and the Army Reserves.   Since 1989, he has been an active volunteer for the Heart of Missouri  United Way, a nonprofit organization that works to improve the economic  and social conditions of those who reside in our local community. His  passion for serving others will forever leave a mark on the Truman VA  and the city of Columbia.   So, Mr. Gaither, this week, as we celebrate Veterans Day, I want to  thank you for your devotion and your work on behalf of our Nation's  veterans and our community, and I want to wish you the very best in  your retirement.                            ____________________
