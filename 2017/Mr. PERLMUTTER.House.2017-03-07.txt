 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, and I hope I  don't take 5 minutes.   I rise today in support of S. 442, the NASA Transition Authorization  Act of 2017.   I have long been a supporter of our Nation's space program. I have  seen what we can accomplish when we put our best and brightest in a  room together and give them the resources they need to solve tough  scientific, engineering, and mathematical problems to better our  society and our understanding of the solar system and beyond.   The bill before us today ensures the hardworking people at NASA and  the thousands of private aerospace workers in Colorado and across the  country have a constant sea of purpose and the backing of Congress to  continue advancing our quest to understand our planet and explore other  celestial bodies.   Mr. Speaker, I enjoy serving on the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee. While we may not agree on every issue, when it comes to our  space programs, we come together and find the best solutions to the  problems we face, and this bill does exactly that.                                time  1830    As my colleagues on this committee know, I am very passionate about  getting our astronauts to the surface of Mars. This bill will require  detailed plans from NASA on how to do that and, more importantly, on  the timelines so that we can get to Mars through the development of a  human exploration roadmap.   In addition to this roadmap, section 435 of the bill also requires  NASA to report back on the feasibility of a human mission to Mars by  the year 2033. Sixteen years from now, Earth and Mars will be aligned  for what could be the most significant and inspirational journey in  history.   About 18 months ago, our committee heard testimony from former NASA  leadership about our deep space exploration missions. I asked them to  provide us a date: When can we get to Mars? As it turns out, the  planets' orbit and alignment in 2033 is optimal. So as my colleagues on  the committee know, I have prepared a bumper sticker, Mr. Speaker, just  for you, showing 2033 as the time we are going to get our astronauts to  Mars.   I thank Chairman Smith, Representative Babin, Representative Eddie  Bernice Johnson of Texas, as well as Representative Bera for allowing  me to work and to help put section 435 into the bill.   I know we can do this. This is a mission that all Americans will be  proud of. They are so proud of our space program, the scientists and  engineers at NASA. This will give us a real goal and a real project to  get our astronauts to Mars by 2033.
