 Madam President, from start to finish, President Trump's  nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court will go  down as one of the saddest, most sordid in the long history of the  Federal judiciary.   The well was poisoned from the outset when President Trump selected  Judge Kavanaugh from a list of names preapproved by hard-right special  interest groups for whom the national interest is a trifling concern  compared to repealing Roe v. Wade, cutting people's healthcare, and  achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court. The rot worsened  when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the  bulk of Judge Kavanaugh's records from the public, discarding decades  of bipartisan precedent and thwarting norms of transparency and  fairness. Finally, the dam broke under the weight of credible  allegations that Judge Kavanaugh committed a sexual assault in high  school.   In 2018, the Republican majority conducted a hearing that made the  Anita Hill hearings in 1991 look fair by comparison. At this hearing,  there were no corroborating witnesses on either side and no independent  investigation of the facts to inform the questioning. They even hired  an outside counsel to put a witness, Dr. Ford, on trial. Only at the  eleventh-hour urging of breakaway Members of their caucus, Republicans  submitted, reluctantly, to a 1-week investigation of the allegations-- an investigation which was then severely circumscribed by the White  House.   Our Republican friends blame us for this process. They are always  finding a straw man. But nothing could be further from the truth.  First, they blame us for delay, knowing full well that Majority Leader  McConnell has complete control of when nominees are brought to the  floor. Leader McConnell could have moved this nominee 2 weeks ago or 1  week ago. Democrats had no say--and don't--when it comes to what is  scheduled for floor debate. But in each case, Leader McConnell couldn't  move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans-- not Democrats--from moving forward. When it comes to complaining about  delay, two words never come from our Republican friends' lips:  ``Merrick Garland.''   Republicans are also saying that we engaged in ``a smear campaign''  or the ``politics of personal destruction'' with this nomination. In  reality, again, they are using Democrats as a straw man, because what  they are really talking about is what Dr. Ford said. Democrats did not  induce her to come forward; her conscience did. Are our Republican  friends accusing Dr. Ford and her deeply held memories of what happened  to her of a smear campaign? Are they accusing Dr. Ford of a smear  campaign, of engaging in the politics of personal destruction? Because  that is who they are actually blaming. They are decrying her testimony  and then trying to blame Democrats. I don't blame them--they have a  flawed nominee. They don't want the focus on the nominee.   When future Americans look back at these proceedings, let them draw  no lessons from the Senate's conduct here. Let them look back on this  chapter as the shameful culmination of the scorched-earth politics  practiced by the hard right in America--people who will stop at nothing  to entrench an advantage on our Nation's courts. Let the confirmation  process for Judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epilogue to the  brazen theft of Justice Scalia's seat, the ignominious end of  bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme  Court Justices. And for what? For whom were Senate Republican leaders  willing to discard all semblance of fairness to confirm? Judge Brett  Kavanaugh--certainly a product of an elite education but also someone  with a hard-right, conservative jurisprudence, far, far away from what  average Americans believe.   Why most Democrats opposed his nomination at the outset feels like  ancient history now, but let's not forget that, most importantly, we  strongly disagree with a number of Judge Kavanaugh's views. He is  deeply skeptical of unenumerated rights, including a woman's right to  make fundamentally private decisions about her medical care. He is  deeply skeptical of the government's role in protecting Americans with  preexisting conditions. He is deeply skeptical of nearly all rules and  regulations that protect consumers, workers, and the environment.   The flashing red warning sign at the center of Judge Kavanaugh's  jurisprudence is his views on Executive power and accountability.  Somehow, this conservative judge and scholar of the Constitution sees  at the heart of American democracy a President-cum-King; an Executive  who is unaccountable to the laws he is sworn to uphold; a head-of-state  who, while in office, should be beyond the reach of subpoenas, criminal  investigations, or civil investigations.   This moment in American history demands deep skepticism about Judge  Kavanaugh's views on Executive power, nominated as he was by an  Executive who disdains the constraints of his office and who is, at  this very moment, the apparent subject of investigations his Supreme  Court nominee believes should be invalid.   I met with Judge Kavanaugh for almost 2 hours, and I asked him about  all of those issues. His answers were constantly evasive and utterly  unsatisfactory. It was deja vu all over again in the first round of  hearings, when Judge Kavanaugh deliberately avoided talking about his  views on Roe, healthcare, Presidential accountability, and more. There  was no legal reason, rule, or logic that prevented him from being clear  and saying what he thought. He was evasive because he knows that his  views are deeply at odds with the progress America has made over the  last half century of jurisprudence and at odds with what most Americans  believe. His performance was not only unfair and frustrating to the  Senate, it was unfair to the American people. When a nominee refuses to  disclose their views, chances are you have a nominee whose views are  far outside the mainstream of America, whether they be far right or far  left.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle may not have as grave a  concern about these views as we do, but let no American be surprised if  Judge Kavanaugh becomes a decisive vote to restrict the rights and  privileges of the American people, while stretching the bounds of  privilege for the current occupant of the White House.   Judge Kavanaugh's nomination ultimately does not only encompass  questions of ideology or credentials but questions of character. Here  again, Judge Kavanaugh falls woefully short of what Americans expect  and deserve  [[Page S6563]]  in a Supreme Court Justice. He has repeatedly misled the Senate about  his involvement in some of the most serious controversies of the Bush  administration, including warrantless wiretapping of American citizens,  our policy against torture, the theft of electronic records from  Democratic Senators, and his involvement in the nomination of very  controversial judges. Faced with credible allegations of various types  of misconduct, Judge Kavanaugh's credibility was again tested, and he  continued to dissemble and even prevaricate about easily refuted facts.   Beyond the issue of credibility, Judge Kavanaugh presented to the  Senate the bitterest partisan testimony I have ever heard coming from a  candidate seeking the Senate's approval, whether they be for the bench  or the executive branch.   There are many who think that what happened when Judge Kavanaugh was  17 years old should not be dispositive. Even if you believe that, his  actions at age 53 in terms of demeanor, partisanship, and, above all,  credibility, should be dispositive. Judges at every level of the  Federal bench should be held to the highest standard of ethics and  moral character. Judges at every level should be judicious and credible  and independent but especially--especially--on the Supreme Court.   I do not see how it is possible for my colleagues to say with perfect  confidence that Judge Kavanaugh has the temperament, independence, and  credibility to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. So I ask my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle: Why Judge Kavanaugh? There is no  dictate that you have to march blindly forward with a nominee when  there are others available to you. There are many judges whom I am sure  conservatives would be happy to have on the Court. I would remind my  colleagues, the seat that Brett Kavanaugh aspires to fill was held by a  Justice who assumed the Bench after one nominee was voted down by the  Senate and a second nominee withdrew his nomination. But the Republican  majority has pressed forward blindly on Judge Kavanaugh, even when  brave women came forward to speak truth to power. Why? For what cause?  For the sake of winning? That is not reason enough.    My colleagues on the other side, if you have doubts about Judge  Kavanaugh's credibility, about his ability to tell the truth, about his  ability to be impartial and nonpartisan--no matter what you think of  his jurisprudence or what he may or may not have done in high school  and college--you should not vote to confirm him to the Supreme Court.   So my friends, Democratic and Republican, for all the controversy,  all the heavyhandedness of the process, all the hyperbole and  vilification of both sides, there is always hope that the Senate can  save itself. We can salvage some decency here at the end.   If Judge Kavanaugh is rejected, President Trump will select another  nominee--likely right-of-center, probably not to my liking but without  the cloud that hangs over this nominee--and we can proceed to consider  that nominee in a much less bitter, much better, less partisan way. A  bipartisan majority of Senators, considering fully the weight of Judge  Kavanaugh's testimony, record, credibility, trustworthiness, and  temperament, considering fully the heartbreaking testimony of Dr.  Christine Blasey Ford, can vote to reject Judge Kavanaugh's nomination  and ask the President to send the Senate another name.   For the sake of the Senate, of the Supreme Court, and of America, I  hope, I pray, my colleagues will do so.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to bring the Senate's  attention to the 200th anniversary of the New York City-based  institution, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. The firm, which was founded  in 1818, is still in operation in the United States and has had a major  presence in New York.   The firm evolved from a 19th-century family-operated linen import  business among Brown relatives in Northern Ireland, Liverpool,  Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City and is one of the world's  storied financial houses. The first office in New York was located at  191 Pearl Street near the wharfs of South Street. By 1835, the firm had  moved to Wall Street as the city experienced the growth in trade from  the recently completed Erie Canal and innovations in overseas shipping.   Philanthropy has been a passion of the partners who were early  benefactors of the Union Theological Seminary, as well as founders of  the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor. Brown  Brothers partners also served on a council whose work led to the  enactment of New York State's first tenement house law in 1867.   On October 5, family and partners of the firm will gather to  celebrate 200 years of their banking history. I wish them  congratulations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a short time, the Senate will take a  final vote on the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.  The road that led us here has been bitter, angry, and partisan, steeped  in hypocrisy, hyperbole, resentment, and outrage.   From start to finish, President Trump's nomination of Brett Kavanaugh  to the U.S. Supreme Court has been one of the saddest moments in the  history of the Senate. When the history of the Senate is written, this  chapter will be a flashing red warning light of what to avoid. Truly,  Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation is a low moment for the Senate, for the  Court, and for the country.   The Republican majority has conducted one of the least transparent,  least fair, and most biased processes in Senate history, slanting the  table from the very beginning to produce their desired result.   Why do I say this? Because they withheld over 90 percent of the  nominee's record from the Senate and the American people; because they  refused to allow Dr. Ford to call a single corroborating witness at the  hearing, including the only other eyewitness to the incident; because  they refused to have an independent investigation of the facts before  the hearing in order to inform the questioning; because they hired an  outside prosecutor to question Dr. Ford, as if she were on trial;  because the White House kept the FBI investigation on a short leash,  dictating the scope and even the kinds of questions the FBI was allowed  to ask; because Republican Senators, sensing after Dr. Ford's testimony  that a debate about the truth and facts was not working, adopted a  cynical new strategy to shout, pound the table, and portray Judge  Kavanaugh as the helpless victim of some unseen partisan conspiracy;  because the President of the United States, stooping to new depths-- even for him--chose to stand before a crowd of thousands and cruelly  ridicule a survivor of sexual assault; and because this grossly  distorted, biased, and unfair process, run by the Republican majority,  the Senate is about  [[Page S6696]]  to elevate a nominee who doesn't belong on the Nation's highest Bench.   Now, why doesn't Judge Kavanaugh belong on the Bench in the Nation's  highest Court? Judge Kavanaugh doesn't belong on the Bench because he  obscured his views, shrouding his jurisprudence in smoke so thick that  the American people would never know what he really believed.   Judge Kavanaugh doesn't belong on the Bench because he was chosen by  a President and a far-right organization, both dedicated to overturning  and undermining Roe v. Wade, and he did not a thing to refute the  presumption that he would want to overturn it too.   Judge Kavanaugh doesn't belong on the Bench because he was chosen by  far-right organizations that are bent on repealing healthcare  protections for Americans with preexisting conditions, and he did  nothing to refute the presumption that he would too.   Judge Kavanaugh doesn't belong on the Bench because he believes  Presidents should not be subject to investigations of any kind while in  office--a distortion of our founding principle that no person is above  the law.   Judge Kavanaugh does not belong on the Bench because his  jurisprudence is deeply skeptical of environmental protections,  consumer protections, workers' rights, civil rights, LGBT rights,  rights of treaties and agreements with Native Americans, and a host of  other hard-earned rights.    Judge Kavanaugh doesn't belong on the Bench because he  has repeatedly misled the Senate, putting into serious doubt his  credibility. A judge must be credible, believable, and honest, above  all.   Judge Kavanaugh doesn't belong on the Bench because he is an extreme  partisan--something we have seen from his earliest days in his career  and reconfirmed when he gave one of the bitterest, most partisan  testimonies ever presented by a nominee.   Judge Kavanaugh doesn't belong on the Bench because of his  injudicious demeanor. His partisan screed will go down ignominiously in  history and make it clear that it would be virtually impossible for him  to rule impartially on the Supreme Court. Judges must be temperate,  judicious, and evenhanded. Judge Kavanaugh is anything but.   Republican leaders knew before he was nominated that Judge Kavanaugh  was a very flawed choice, but once President Trump selected him,  Republicans decided they had to rush him through. They became a  steamroller over truth, fairness, and our traditions of bipartisan  cooperation--any means necessary to reach their desired end. They  blamed Dr. Ford and Democrats for Judge Kavanaugh's flaws.   They were intent on shrouding the truth, because they knew that if  the truth came to light, Judge Kavanaugh would be exposed as a truly  flawed nominee.   So, my colleagues, my fellow Americans, what is the appropriate  response?   Our country needs to have a reckoning on these issues, and there is  only one remedy. Change must come from where change in America always  begins--the ballot box.   So to Americans, to so many millions who are outraged by what  happened here, there is one answer: Vote.   If you believe Dr. Ford and other brave women who came forward and  you want to vindicate their sacrifice, vote.   If you believe the Supreme Court should uphold women's rights, vote.   If you believe the Supreme Court must protect healthcare and our  preexisting conditions that are protected now, vote.   If you believe the Supreme Court should defend workers, consumers,  the environment, civil rights, and Native populations, vote.   If you believe the Supreme Court should be a check on an overreaching  President, vote.   If you believe the process here in the Senate was a sham and you  believe Americans deserve better, vote.   If you believe that Supreme Court Justices should conform to the  highest standards of character, impartiality, temperament and, above  all, honesty and credibility, vote.   I understand and I share the deep anguish that millions of Americans  are experiencing today, but I say to you, my fellow Americans, there is  one answer: Vote.   I yield the floor.
