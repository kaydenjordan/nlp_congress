 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2382. As the author of  the National Cyber Director Act, I commend Senators Portman and Peters  for offering this important legislation to clarify the authorities of  this new office.   I said it before and I will say it again: Cybersecurity is the  national and economic security challenge of the 21st century. For 30  years we have been increasing the number of connected devices,  processes, and services connected to the internet at an exponential  rate. We can now instantly communicate with people half a world away  and use data repositories to drive advances in medicine, clean energy,  and commerce. With this connectivity comes vulnerability.   For these three decades, the United States has struggled to develop a  coherent cybersecurity strategy and to implement it to better protect  the country and cyberspace. While we have seen the results of this  failure in breaches ranging from the devastating, the tens of billions  of dollars in damage caused by, for example, NotPetya, to the mundane,  as companies fend off daily cyber probes.   Just in the last half century we have witnessed the Russian  Government target us through ransomware attacks through SolarWinds; the  Chinese Government break into instances of the Microsoft Exchange  Server, and criminals wreak havoc on the Colonial Pipeline, JBS, and  customers of Kaseya through ransomware attacks, so we are not where we  need to be.   Congress recognized this fact in 2018 when it created the Cyberspace  Solarium Commission, a distinguished body that I had the privilege of  being appointed to by Speaker Pelosi. Through a year of deliberation,  we developed a strategy of layered cyber deterrence, and had more than  80 recommendations to make that strategy a reality. Those  recommendations run the gamut from changes to our military to  regulations on private companies. But underlying all of them is the  recognition that the U.S. Government itself is still not organized for  success.    Now enter the National Cyber Director. This key recommendation called  for a Senate-confirmed leader within the Executive Office of the  President with the policy and budgetary authority to develop a national  strategy, oversee its implementation, and coordinate response to  significant cyber incidents.   With the help of Congressman Gallagher, the Solarium Commission's co- chair, and through the leadership of Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and her  staff, my National Cyber Director Act made it into last year's NDAA.  Earlier this month, the President had appointed and the Senate  confirmed our inaugural National Cyber Director, my fellow Solarium  Commission member, Chris Inglis, to take office as the first Director.   Chris' confirmation represents nothing less than a sea change in how  the government will coordinate cyberspace policy. Once this office is  fully staffed up, there will be a well of expertise within the White  House to ensure that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, sector risk management  agencies, the United States Cyber  [[Page H3883]]  Command, the intelligence community, and all of the other disparate  elements of the government are working in concert to improve our  cybersecurity. However, the Office of the National Cyber Director is  very much a startup at the moment.   While we will be voting on a full budget for this office later this  week, including, I hope, an amendment to provide the full $25 million  yearlong appropriation recommended by the Solarium Commission, we can't  wait until the full fiscal year 2022 budget is passed to get Director  Inglis on his feet and up and running.   After all, our adversaries certainly aren't constrained by our  budgetary calendar. In drafting the bill, we anticipated that the NCD  might need to call upon the personnel, facilities, or services of  Federal departments and agencies, with their permission, of course.  However, there seems to be some ambiguity within the White House about  whether this includes the ability of the Office to accept the services  of nonreimbursable detailees.   While I think the language and the congressional intent of the  original statute are quite clear, this bill should clear up any  misunderstanding once and for all by explicitly authorizing  nonreimbursable detailees. This legislation will help Director Inglis  get a staff vanguard in place and ensure he and his successors can take  advantage of the expertise resident at the various agencies that  contribute to our success in cyberspace.   Mr. Speaker, let me again thank Senators Portman and Peters and  Chairwoman Maloney for moving so quickly to address this urgent issue.  Congress has already shown tremendous support for this Office, and I  think the speed at which this bill moves is a testament to our  commitment to its success.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 2382.    Madam Speaker, this morning, I had the privilege of  joining President Biden at the White House to celebrate the 31st  anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.   This landmark civil rights law has drastically improved the lives of  people with disabilities across our Nation, including mine.   In 1980, an accidental gunshot left me paralyzed, and for 10 years, I  experienced firsthand the adversity that the disability community faced  before the ADA.   Since its enactment, this law has helped break down barriers and  stamp out discrimination. It has opened doors to new opportunities for  people with disabilities and allowed members of our community to reach  previously unattainable places in society.   In fact, I can say with confidence that without the ADA, I would not  be a Member of Congress proudly representing the people of Rhode  Island.   Madam Speaker, though we have made tremendous progress with the ADA,  we can't stop fighting yet. I will continue working closely with  advocates and lawmakers like my dear friend, our Majority Leader, Steny  Hoyer, to advance meaningful legislation to support and protect the  rights of people with disabilities.                            ____________________
