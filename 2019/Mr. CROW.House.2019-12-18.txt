 Madam Speaker, years ago, I took my first oath to the  country, went to war, and fought alongside our Nation's finest men and  women. Some of them gave their lives for our Nation. Not a day has  passed that I don't reflect on those sacrifices.   I learned during that time that our Nation is built on sacrifice. We  have overcome challenging times because people have decided to put  aside their personal interests, their livelihoods, and, yes, even given  their lives to do what is best for our Nation.   Our Founders created a system to ensure we would have no kings or  dictators, a system that vested power in the people to ensure that no  man or woman is above the law.    Generation after generation, this system has survived because people  have fought for it. Today, it is our turn.   The President's abuse of power and scorn for our constitutional  checks and balances is unprecedented. Unless we stand up against these  abuses, we will set the country on a dangerous new course.   My oath, my love of our country, and my duty to honor the sacrifices  of those who came before us require me to act. To my colleagues, it is  time to put aside our personal and political interests and honor those  who have come before us.
