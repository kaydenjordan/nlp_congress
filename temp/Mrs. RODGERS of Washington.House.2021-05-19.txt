 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1629, the Fairness in  Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act.   The Orphan Drug Act was enacted to incentivize the development of  drugs that treat rare diseases. Products designated as orphan drugs may  be entitled to 7 years of market exclusivity, meaning a drug produced  by another manufacturer that contains the same active ingredient to  treat the same condition is barred from entering the market during this  time.   However, we have seen in recent years that some drug manufacturers,  in an effort to block competition from the market, have tried to take  advantage of a loophole in existing law. H.R. 1629 will close this  loophole and prevent potential abuse of this program in the future.   We must preserve incentives to innovate, especially for drugs that  treat rare diseases, while preventing bad actors from attempting to  exploit those incentives to benefit from a national crisis, as was done  during the opioid epidemic.   This legislation strikes that careful balance. This bill garnered  both Republican and Democrat support last Congress. I hope we can  continue to work together to move H.R. 1629 forward in the future on a  bipartisan basis.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.
