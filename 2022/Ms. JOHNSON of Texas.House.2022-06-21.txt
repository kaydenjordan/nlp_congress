 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H. Res. 892, a resolution calling on the Government of the Republic of  Rwanda to release Paul Rusesabagina on humanitarian grounds.   The Rwandan genocide is considered one of the deadliest and most  brutal tragedies in the history of humankind. In just 100 days, more  than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were systematically assaulted,  raped, and slaughtered by the Rwandan and Interahamwe militaries. And  except for a few peacekeeping forces, the international community at  large refused to get involved--leaving any resistance efforts to come  from within the country.   That's when Paul Rusesabagina stepped in. As the manager at a hotel  in the capital city of Kigali at the time, he was credited for housing  and feeding more than 1,200 Tutsi and Hutu refugees during the  genocide. He knew that the consequences of his efforts would put both  himself and his family in danger, but he still chose to help his people  in their greatest hour of need.   Now, the Rwandan government has convicted, detained, and reportedly  tortured Mr. Rusesabagina on charges stemming from a trial that the  State Department and American Bar Association considered unfair and  irreparable. He has also been denied the medical attention required as  a cancer survivor and individual suffering from a cardiovascular  disorder.   By passing this resolution, the House of Representatives will join  several other international democratic bodies to express concern over  his conviction and call for his immediate release. We will also urge  the United States Government to continue to raise awareness about Mr.  Rusesabagina's case and convey our support to his friends, family, and  loved ones.   Mr. Speaker, Paul Rusesabagina's story reminds us that hope can be  found even during our darkest days. I would urge my colleagues to  support this resolution.
