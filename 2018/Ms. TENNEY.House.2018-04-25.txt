 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 125th  anniversary of the incredible Masonic Care Community of New York,  located in the city of Utica.   The Masonic Care Community of New York opened its doors on May 1,  1893, as the Masonic Home, started by the Free and Accepted Masons of  the State of New York. Their goal was to provide high-quality care to  elderly masons and families living in the Mohawk Valley region.   Within 30 years, the location expanded to include a building for 360  adults, a hospital, several dormitories for children, and a 200-acre  working farm that supplied food for those living on the campus.   Today, the Masonic Care Community of New York offers top-of-the-line  healthcare options to all. It also offers high-quality senior care,  rehabilitation services, and child care, while also making house calls  for those patients who are unable to leave their home.   Masonic Care Community of New York has supported, nurtured, and  educated the community by providing exceptional care and services with  compassion and pride guided by the Masonic principles of brotherly  love, relief, truth, and integrity. Currently, more than 500 seniors  call the Masonic Care Community of New York and their independent  living center home.   I want to extend my congratulations to the staff at the Masonic Care  Community of New York for their hard work in continuing to make the  Masonic Care Community of New York a first-class facility. I wish them  125 more years of exceptional service.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Ann Wagner for  yielding. She is a wonderful inspiration to me as a new Member.   I also want to thank Congressman McGovern for his comments.   This is really important that she is hosting tonight's Special Order  on genocide awareness and prevention.   During the month of April, we joined together to honor victims and  survivors to educate the public about genocide--it is hard to believe  it is happening in our time--and to advocate for the prevention of  future atrocities.   In the past 150 years, tens of millions of men, women, and children  have lost their lives during brutal genocides and mass atrocities.  Millions have been tortured, raped, and forced from their homes. Some  of the darkest moments in world history have occurred, oddly enough, in  the month of April.   In April 1933, the Nazi Party began its boycott of Jewish-owned  businesses. This marked the beginning of a campaign of hatred that led  to the murder of 6 million Jews.   My district is home to thousands of refugees from the former  Yugoslavia. I have a long history with Yugoslavia. I began my study of  the country of Yugoslavia in 1981 when I first participated as a  student, a college student from Colgate University, in a semester  abroad, and we traveled throughout the entire Yugoslavia and all the  different principalities and republics. It was a spectacular and  beautiful country, and it sparked a lifelong interest for me in this  region.   I completely fell in love with the country and was fascinated by the  people who were there who survived conquests, whether it was from the  Ottoman Empire to being part of so many other parts of human history.  They were also victims during the Nazi invasion, as well, during World  War II.   I had the lucky opportunity to graduate from college and work as a  foreign correspondent in the Press and Cultural Office of the former  Yugoslav Consulate in New York. I also worked, at that time, alongside  with ABC Sports during the Winter Olympics held in Sarajevo in 1984.   The war in Yugoslavia was a tragic saga in the history of human  experience, especially for me, with my long history and love of the  country and the people who inhabited this part of world.   I worked with people from the consulate, from all the republics and  autonomous provinces from the former Yugoslavia. It just seemed  unthinkable to me that this human genocide could occur in a region of  the world which had experienced many occupying forces due to its very  unique, very important geopolitical, strategic location in the world.   Yugoslavia was always known as the gateway between East and West, the  place where you could get from Europe through Yugoslavia to,  eventually, the Middle East along the Mediterranean. This region had  diverse culture, religion, and people from all parts of Europe and the  Middle East, and the world all united together for centuries, actually,  living alongside each other with different values. Certainly, they had  their differences.   But sadly, unfortunately, after all this history of unrest, the war  in Yugoslavia eventually elicited the worst in humankind and was  witness to one of the most horrific genocides in our generation against  Bosnian citizens.   To the Bosnian community, April, again, marks 26 years since the  beginning of the siege in Sarajevo, Bosnia. The horrific period of  violence lasted for over 3\1/2\ years and was the longest siege in  modern warfare. All told, over 10,000 people, including 1,500 children,  were killed in Sarajevo during the siege.   In 1995, the worst massacre within Europe since World War II took  place. The Srebrenica massacre killed more than 8,000 Bosnian boys and  men during the Bosnian War.   In addition to these horrific killings, more than 20,000 civilians  were expelled from the area. Many of these Bosnian refugees immigrated  to my region. We are thrilled to have them.   It is just worth noting that my son was actually a student in the  afterschool program at the Jewish Community Center in my area. The  Jewish Community Center was actually instrumental in helping to find  safe refuge in our community for these Bosnian Muslims who were  suffering from this unconscionable genocide and atrocities against  them.   I think it was the solidarity and the sympathy and the understanding,  the true understanding of genocide that our Jewish citizens recognized  in our region, and we are grateful to them. And we are also grateful to  the Bosnian community for the decision to have so many wonderful  Bosnian families visit our city and now remain as citizens. They  provided the same ingenuity and the entrepreneurship and the vibrancy  and the creativity that I remembered during my days of studying this  very special part of the world.   I am especially grateful to them for enabling me to sustain the bond  that developed between me, my family, who have all traveled to that  part of the world, and this amazing group of people for the past 37  years of my life. It has become almost a vocation for me, just my study  of Serbo-Croatian and my study of this region.   As we mark these tragedies of the past, we must not overlook what is  taking place in the present. I just want to mention a little bit about  my city, Utica, New York.   It has been recognized as one of the friendly cities to refugees. The  Utica City School District now has over 42 languages spoken, and so we  have a number of people coming from war-torn areas where, very  graciously and also very generously, our communities have accepted them  and provided them a home.    I want to just highlight one of the communities that is in our region  as well, and those are the people from Myanmar, where over 700,000  Rohingya people have fled the Rakhine State in the face of expulsions  and violent persecution at the hands of government forces.   In Syria, Bashar al-Assad's military butchers its own citizens and  uses chemical weapons without regard for international law.   Under this dark cloud of atrocities and massive human rights  violations, both present and past, I just want to join with my  colleagues today in remembering these and remembering to ensure that  these lessons are never forgotten, but more important, if we could only  make sure they are never repeated.   I sincerely thank my colleague, Congresswoman Ann Wagner, for her  great leadership on this issue, her tenacity and her courage and her  continued fight to try to help these people who are the most needy, who  have just been victimized in our society and across our country and our  world. I thank her for including me tonight.   It is very special for me to especially recognize the Bosnians. It  has been such a long part of my history, and my heart and my sympathy  go to these wonderful people who suffered unfairly.   I just want to say thank you again to Mrs. Wagner for her great  leadership on this issue.
