 Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Young of Iowa) having assumed the chair, Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois,  Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the  Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the  bill (H.R. 3354) making appropriations for the Department of the  Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending  September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution  thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, September 11, 2017, when  it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table (S. Con. Res. 24) providing for a correction in the  enrollment of H.R. 601, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    I would be happy to engage the gentleman in a colloquy.    Madam Chair, I thank my colleague from California for  his comments. This body is made better with his presence.   I appreciate the gentleman's hard work on the situation in Santa  Clarita and the need to come to a resolution in a timely manner. After  working with him on this issue, I have no doubt that it can be solved  with his help. I pledge to assist him in finding a resolution that all  parties can support.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment.   Suing the government and settling has been a lucrative business which  is supported by taxpayer dollars. The Endangered Species Act, for  example, has become wrapped around the axle of the judicial system by  excessive litigation.   Until then, I keep pushing on behalf of the States and the taxpayers.   Madam Chair, I urge an ``aye'' vote on the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment.   EPA has been directed by the President to take a second look at the  methane rule promulgated by the Obama administration. In conjunction  with a review, EPA has attempted to provide the regulated community  with some certainty by postponing some of the implementation dates;  however, the courts have blocked that from happening.   In light of these challenges, the time may be right for a temporary  pause on the enforcement of those requirements, so I urge my colleagues  to support the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment.   Because the administration has already withdrawn the referenced  social cost of carbon guidance in the March energy independence  executive order, this is an amendment we can support. I support the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, as I noted in our full committee markup in  July, there are no regional closures proposed in this legislation;  therefore, it is an unnecessary amendment. This topic was discussed at  our EPA hearing in June. Administrator Pruitt called rumors about  regional closures ``pure legend.''   Further, it costs money to close regional offices and move staff, and  funding has not been requested to do so.                                time  1130    In addition, the closure of regional offices is something the  administration would need to propose and go through the deliberative  process here in Congress. It would require a multiyear effort.   As a wise man within the administration once said, ``we can close any  lab or Federal building that is not located in Washington, D.C., or in  a congressional district.''   As the fiscal year 2018 process has already demonstrated, while the  President may propose changes, Congress has the final say in funding  decisions.   In addition, this amendment would have unintended consequences as  agencies review their footprints and propose ways to reduce their rent,  security, utility costs, and operate more efficiently. All executive  branch agencies are required to submit plans to the President on ways  to operate more efficiently. We need to see these plans before jumping  to any conclusions. So I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would say to my friend that we are  [[Page H7206]]  making a statement. There is no money to close offices in this budget,  so I would urge a ``no'' vote.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    While I agree with the gentleman that current law  regarding public lands must be followed, there is nothing in this bill  that contradicts that. As such, there is no purpose relevant to this  bill for this amendment. I encourage my colleagues to oppose the  gentleman's amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment.    Madam Chair, I would like to remind the gentleman, with  this bill, we have cut EPA almost 30 percent since 2010.   While we have expressed a number of frustrations with EPA's overreach  over the last few years, and even here today, I cannot support an  amendment with cuts of this magnitude which put important programs at  risk. An across-the-board cut of this magnitude would reduce priorities  like the geographic programs, Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico, and others,  State recovering loan funds, the 28 national estuary programs, several  State grants like radon, lead, and beach protection, just to name a  few.   These are programs proposed for elimination in the President's budget  that Members on both sides of the aisle requested funding in this bill.  In fact, I had 5,200 requests.   The amendment would also significantly reduce funding for the  Superfund program. The proposed budget would propose to reduce the  program by 31 percent, which would impact new cleanups and slow ongoing  cleanups.   The President's budget also proposed to reduce the State categorical  grants by 44 percent and cut the Diesel Emission Reduction Grants by 83  percent, which are essential to air quality in my home State of  California.   States need resources to best serve our constituents back home;  therefore, I think this amendment just goes too far. I urge my  colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Minnesota.    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota.    It is interesting that we are having a disagreement on  how much we should cut the EPA. It is not the argument that we are  cutting the EPA. Obviously, that is a fact. We have cut the EPA with  this upcoming budget by 37 percent over the last few years.   I know that the Administrator is doing a lot to create efficiencies  with the EPA and to operate that absolutely more effectively for our  health and for the benefit of the United States.   Madam Chair, with that, I believe this amendment just simply goes too  far. I oppose this amendment and would urge my colleagues to vote  ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Smucker) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Mimi Walters of California,  Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the  Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the  bill (H.R. 3354), making appropriations for the Department of the  Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending  September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution  thereon.                            ____________________
