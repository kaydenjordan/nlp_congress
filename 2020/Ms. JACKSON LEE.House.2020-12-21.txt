 Madam Speaker, I join in the prayer of the Chaplain  this morning. I believe it is important to open this day of lifesaving  relief with a prayer to ask that our Congress comes together and stands  in the face with help on the way to dying Americans from COVID-19, the  families of those who have died and those who are on the front lines  fighting against this virus.   It is important that we help our schoolchildren with educational  dollars and, as well, make sure that the vaccines are going as fast as  they can to the sites across America.   I spoke to hospitals in my district, smaller hospitals and community  hospitals that are still waiting for their vaccine. We know that they  want their frontline medical professionals to keep saving and serving  the public.   So this is going to be a historic and important day. We know it is  not what we want in complete, but we know we will be working into the  new year to be able to respond to the needs of the American people  helping our local governments and, as well, making sure that those  children who will be returning to school and those teachers, as well,  will be protected after they have the opportunity--the teachers, in  particular--to have the vaccine. This is a historic day. Let us work  together.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, help is on the way. Help cannot come  faster. Help is desperately needed.   Seventeen million Americans are infected by COVID-19. Almost 320,000  are dead, and the numbers keep growing. Hospital beds are overutilized.  Cities across America are getting refrigerated trucks. Help is on the  way.   People are being evicted, and this legislation helps us stop the  evictions. It provides for cash disbursements, up to $2,400 for a  family of four and $300 extra in weekly unemployment payments.   For hungry families, 54 million hungry families in America, including  our young military personnel, help is on the way.   This bill is a bill we wrote months ago. It is downsized, but it is  the very language that we have written. So we know, in the new year, we  will come back again to save lives.   Let's get this done in unity. We know how it was blocked. We know the  other House did not move forward. We know we did not get leadership on  this bill.   But as I close, let me thank Secretary Shalala, Congresswoman  Shalala, for what she brought to this Congress, what insight, what  specialness, and what kindness.   We wish you the very best, and I look forward to working with you in  the future.   Mr. Speaker, help is on the way.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support for the Rule that the  House is debating to provide for the consideration of the Fiscal Year  appropriations for the federal government and urgently needed COVID-19  relief funding.   Chairman McGovern, and Ranking Member Cole, thank you for your work  to bring this Rule before the House so that Members can debate and vote  for urgently needed aid to communities across the nation and the  funding needed to keep the federal government operational through the  remainder of Fiscal Year 2021.   As a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland  Security, and on the Budget, and the representative of the 18th  Congressional District of Texas, an epicenter for COVID-19 infections,  I recognize the urgency of providing assistance now, but I also  recognize that the assistance is insufficient to the needs of our state  and local governments, our hospitals, or the people of our great  nation.   I support this rule that will facilitate passage of this interim  package, while also saying that more is needed.   Before the Rules Committee also was the omnibus appropriations bill  providing funding to continue the operations of the federal government  through September 30, 2021, thus avoiding a wasteful and irresponsible  shutdown.   I am relieved that at long last, agreement has been reached between  the bicameral leadership to provide needed and long overdue relief to  the tens of millions Americans whose lives and livelihoods have been  devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic.   I am grateful that efficacious vaccines have been discovered and are  on their way to providing much needed protection and relief, but this  is just a down payment on the relief and support needed for our country  to recover from the pandemic and build back better.   Over the course of the 116th Congress the House Rules Committee has  done its job and provided expert guidance on the progress of nearly 600  bills that have passed the House and gone to the Senate.   These bills included legislation to lower health care and  prescription drug prices, raise wages, advance economic and retirement  security, end gun violence, act on the climate crisis, protect  Dreamers, and strengthen voting rights.   For example, in this Congress the House has passed and sent to the  Senate the following major legislative bills:   H.R. 1, For the People Act;   H.R. 2, Moving Forward Act;   H.R. 3, The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act;   H.R. 4, Voting Rights Advancement Act;   H.R. 5, Equality Act;   H.R. 6, The American Dream & Promise Act;   H.R. 7, Paycheck Fairness Act;   H.R. 8, Bipartisan Background Checks Act;   H.R. 9, Climate Action Now Act;   H.R. 582, Raise the Wage Act;   H.R. 1425, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act;   H.R. 1585, Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act; and   H.R. 7120, George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   Also among the bills passed by the House was H.R. 3710, the  Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act, legislation that increases  the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with  respect to cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  [[Page H7295]]    The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center of  DHS under this bill is directed to disseminate protocols to counter  cybersecurity vulnerabilities, including in circumstances in which such  vulnerabilities exist because software or hardware is no longer  supported by a vendor.   This bill would also provide the Science and Technology Directorate  the flexibility to establish a competition to develop remedies for  cybersecurity vulnerabilities.   Today, our nation is still attempting to understand the scope and  breath of the latest Russia sourced attack on federal government cyber  assets.   In this moment we must address the crisis created by COVID-19, and  the Cybersecurity threat that is ongoing.   There are consequences for the Senate's failure to take up House  bills once they are received in the Senate.   In truth the Republican-controlled Senate has been missing in action  for much of the 116th Congress.   Whether it is the urgent need to fortify our election systems from  confirmed foreign interference, notably from Vladimir Putin's Russia,  or lower prescription drugs prices and expanding and protecting the  right of all Americans to affordable, accessible, high quality health  care, fixing our broken immigration system, or hold a wayward Executive  to account, the other body has failed the American people in its basic  duty to promote the general welfare and provide for the common defense.   The consequences of its complete disregard for the work of the House  is now more apparent than ever and is illustrated perfectly by the  Senate's failure to take up and vote on the HEROES Act passed by the  House in March of this year to address the devastating budgetary and  fiscal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic which the President exacerbated  by his incompetent response to the crisis.   The numbers are heartbreaking.   My thoughts and prayers are with the over 315,000 families who have  lost loved ones and the tens of thousand who are sick, and the many  others who will struggle with the effects of COVID-19 over the coming  days, weeks, months, and years.   We owe a special debt to first responders who are the lifelines for  those who are very ill or who will need medical care to overcome this  coronavirus.   The need to begin work on the next aid package is evident in the  economic impact of COVID-19.   Congress and the Executive Branch must be able to manage more than  one crisis at a time, while avoiding crisis management decision making  when possible.   The Obama Administration exemplified what a President and a Congress  working in concert can accomplish.   The first two years of Obama's Administration had Democrats in charge  of the House and Senate, which made it possible for the Legislative and  Executive Branches to work in concert to attack and repel the economic  disaster the nation faced from the housing value collapse; and  addressing health care disparities by passing the Affordable Care Act  both of which saved millions from economic disaster and saved tens of  thousands of lives.   The Obama Administration had a flu pandemic in 2009 and Ebola that  threatened to become endemic in 2013.   Both of these global health emergencies were expertly managed and  because of this most Americans cannot recall the threat.   President Obama had to deal with an ecological disaster in the form  of the Deep Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that threatened the  environment and delicate hatcheries for sea turtles and the tourism  industry long the coast.   Both the turtles and tourism were saved, and as with the flu pandemic  and Ebola crisis most Americans cannot recall the incident, because  their lives were not overly disrupted and the problems were addressed  effectively.   That is the sign of a good president because he kept American safe.   When President Obama left office on January 20, 2017, unemployment  was at 4. 7 percent; but today, due to the mismanagement of the COVID- 19 pandemic by President Trump and Republicans, unemployment  skyrocketed to 8.4 percent and currently stands at 6.7 percent.   When Trump took office in January 2017, there were 241,000 initial  unemployment insurance (UI) claims for the week ending January 28, 2017  and at the beginning of the 116th Congress in January 2019, there were  236,000 initial UI claims.   Today, due to the mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic by President  Trump and Republicans, there were 885,000 initial UI claims for the  week ending December 12, 2020.   Approximately 30 million Americans have lost the job they had earlier  this year because of this Administration's ineptitude and cavalier  regard for the well-being of the American people.   During President Obama's last full year in office in 2016, the  national debt was $20.02 trillion but due to the misguided economic  policies and utter mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic, the national  debt has increased by $6.7 trillion and is projected to reach an all- time high of $29.6 trillion by the end of the FY2021 fiscal year.   The annual deficit had been cut to $585 billion (3.2 percent of GDP)  in the last year of the Obama Administration but under the  mismanagement of the current Administration, we have seen the deficit  balloon nearly seven-fold to $3.1 trillion or 15.2 percent GDP, the  largest since 1945 relative to the size of the economy.   Continuing this Administration's unbroken chain of woe, in 2019,  after repeated attempts by Republicans to undermine and sabotage the  Affordable Care Act, there were 33.2 million uninsured Americans, 5  million more than when President Obama left office.   It has been estimated by reputable experts that from February 2020  through May 2020 alone, an estimated 5.4 million Americans became  uninsured because of unprecedented job loss caused by the Republican  mismanagement of this pandemic.   Given the wreckage to the economy and the damage to the lives and  livelihoods of the American people, it is unconscionable that this  Administration is pursuing a lawsuit to strike down the Affordable Care  Act, which would take health care coverage away from 20 million  Americans and take away protections for 132 million persons who have  pre-existing conditions.   I strongly support this legislation and urge members of the Rules  Committee to join me by voting for a rule to bring the bill to the  floor today.
