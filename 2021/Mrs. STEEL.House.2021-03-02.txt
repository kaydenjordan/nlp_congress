 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of free speech.   I also rise today to protect our constituents' taxpayer dollars.   This bill we are debating, H.R. 1, would federally mandate a 6-to-1  government match of contributions in congressional or presidential  campaigns. That means for every $200 donated to the campaign, the  Federal Government would match $1,200. That is $1,200 of our  constituents' hard-earned tax dollars sent to a campaign or candidate  that they may not even agree with or believe in.   In the upcoming 2022 election cycle, that means up to $7.2 million of  public funds, per candidate, would be given to the candidates. This is  not how the government should be spending our taxpayers' money.   H.R. 1 would also allow the IRS to investigate the political and  policy background of organizations before granting tax-exempt status.    Madam Speaker, this is a slippery slope towards  discrimination against organizations. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on this bill.
