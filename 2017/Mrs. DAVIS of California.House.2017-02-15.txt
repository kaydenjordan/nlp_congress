 Mr. Speaker, after the extraordinary events  of this week, I certainly had hoped that the House would move forward  with a swift investigation into White House dealings with Russia. But,  not to be distracted, it looks like the majority would rather spend the  day stripping retirement benefits from millions.   We have known for a long time that workers who have access to  retirement plans through their workplace are more likely to save for  retirement than those who don't. It makes sense.                                time  1445    We also know that nearly half of middle class workers will fall into  poverty when they retire.   Last year, the State of California did a great thing. It established  a program to provide 7 million Californians with the tools to save for  retirement.   The Secure Choice program lets workers who do not have a retirement  plan through their employer contribute a share of their income to an  IRA account administered by the State. Under this voluntary program-- and I stress voluntary--countless Californians will get access to tax  preferred retirement accounts for the very first time. That is  extraordinary.   In August, the Department of Labor cleared the way for Secure Choice  by ruling that States could move forward with their own programs to  help workers save for retirement. Seven other States are in the process  of implementing similar laws, and dozens more are considering their  options.   The resolution in question today would undo the DOL's ruling, leaving  States in a legal gray area that could put these programs in jeopardy.  So I ask, Mr. Speaker, is this really how we should be spending our  time?   DOL spent months reviewing public comments and carefully crafting  this rule. The House will vote to repeal it without a single hearing.  Really?   We should be doing everything we can to encourage savings across the  board, certainly not voting to making savings harder for folks.   In States across the country, this effort has been bipartisan. I  wonder if we would be considering this resolution if the rule in  question had not been issued by a Democratic administration?   The word ``irresponsible'' does not even begin to do this for what  would be justice in this area.   So I urge, Mr. Speaker, a ``no'' vote on this. Let's move forward.  Let's allow more States to experiment so they can decide for themselves  whether or not this is something that the folks in their State want to  do.
