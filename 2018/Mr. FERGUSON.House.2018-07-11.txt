 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I want to talk about  our pro-growth policies that are working for the American people.   Throughout this year, I have met with small-business owners, college  students, seniors, and folks all across my district to hear how the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act has impacted them. Time and again--time and again--I  hear the same story: People have more money in their pockets. Their  businesses are doing well. Their utility bills are lower. Their small  businesses are expanding. Their economic outlook is better than it used  to be. And we are headed in the right direction.   Employers are now investing not only in their businesses but, more  importantly, in their people. These benefits are not just limited to my  district in Georgia. Our economy is booming across this great Nation,  and Americans across this country are reaping the benefits of  comprehensive tax reform.   Thanks to our pro-growth policies, we are finally seeing true  economic recovery, and America is on a path to being the best place in  the world to do business once again.   Our work isn't done. We still have work to do. And we will continue  to fight for the American worker and American business while we make  this the greatest place in the world to do business. I look forward to  continuing to work with my colleagues to do just that.   It is mind-boggling to me, when you look around this great Nation and  you see the success, that we actually have Members of this body who  want to take that success away from this country and want to take money  out of the American people's pockets and bring it right back here to  Washington, D.C. That is a thought process that I think is wrong, and I  don't understand it.  [[Page H6048]]    We need to keep fighting for the American family, the American  worker, the American business, so that this country continues to be the  best place in the world to do business. Tax reform is an example of how  we get that done.                            ____________________
