 Madam President, I want to take a moment this morning to  recognize a friend and fellow Hoosier, Mark Souder, who passed away  earlier this week after a battle with cancer.   Mark represented, as so many Hoosiers know, northeastern Indiana in  the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2010. He served eight  terms. Before being elected to Congress, he spent years working as a  staffer for Indiana Senator Dan Coats.   Anyone--anyone--who met Mark was struck by his intellect, his innate  grasp of policy details, and perhaps most importantly, his passion for  service, for serving Hoosiers in particular. You see, Mark loved  northeast Indiana. He loved his constituents. He loved the land, its  people, and its unique traditions. He was a strong advocate for Hoosier  veterans in particular and for our national parks during his service in  Congress.   He was also a man of many talents and interests. Baseball was one of  them. In fact, he wrote about the game's history and connections to our  own State. Recently, Mark collaborated on a book about the history of  television in Fort Wayne.   More personally, I always appreciated Mark's kindness and support as  I began my congressional career, and I know Mark provided similar  assistance and encouragement to others.   I offer my deepest condolences to the Souder family and to all of  Mark's friends and loved ones as they mourn his loss.                            CHIPS and Science Act    Madam President, ``Time and momentum are on our side''--so said Xi  Jingping to his colleagues in the Chinese Communist Party last year.   True, there have been some recent setbacks to China's grand plan-- corruption probes, billions of wasted government dollars--but make no  mistake, these are minor distractions. You see, the CCP is  as determined as ever to supplant the United States as the world's  leader, militarily and economically, in order to win the 21st century.  Xi and his government will subsidize any industry, spend any amount of  money, take any means--even propping up manufacturing with slave  labor--to bend the market to its ambitions and force America to its  knees.    The CCP is confident that America is too dysfunctional and that the  American people are too divided to arrest its momentum. Well, today, I  am pleased to report that the CCP has made a serious miscalculation.  Allow me to explain.   You see, earlier this month, I was in West Lafayette, on the campus  of Purdue University. Indiana's Governor, Eric Holcomb, and Purdue's  president, Mitch Daniels, were, of course, there. We were joined by  U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and U.S. Secretary of State  Antony Blinken. Our group saw up close the amazing work that Purdue is  doing across its technology ecosystem. We met and spoke with many  talented students and professors. We had a productive discussion about  ways to bolster our national security and economic competitiveness. Not  coincidentally, we did this in a hall named for Neil Armstrong and, not  coincidentally, because our conversation focused on the CHIPS and  Science Act.   This is legislation I and others in the Senate worked on for years  and of which I am proud was finally signed into law in August. The  CHIPS and Science Act will unleash the same enterprising American  spirit that sent Neil Armstrong to the Moon aboard Apollo 11--the same  spirit Beijing believes is a relic of the 20th century. This type of  bipartisan economic and national security win only comes along once in  a generation.   Enacting the CHIPS and Science Act sent a strong message to the world  that when it comes to meeting China's challenge, here in the United  States, there is cross-party consensus and a seriousness of purpose.   A thriving domestic chip industry is going to prevent future supply  chain stoppages and protect our military readiness. You see, right now,  Taiwan produces 90 percent of all advanced semiconductor chips, and the  threat of a communist China takeover of Taiwan is real.   Meanwhile, the Chinese Government is heavily subsidizing its national  security innovation base and the development of mission-critical  technologies. In fact, the CCP has invested $14 trillion--$14  trillion--in the technologies that will shape our modern economy and  decide the winners of future wars, technologies like quantum computing,  robotics, and artificial intelligence, and technologies like  hypersonics.   They have also set a strategy of dominating the global production of  semiconductors. If China produces more and more of the world's supply  of semiconductors, America's economy and our national security could be  at the mercy of the CCP, especially in the event of another pandemic or  war.   This is all part of Beijing's bet to beat America, but the CHIPS and  Science Act helps America counter that bet. You see, there is a happy  coincidence here. What benefits our national security also benefits our  economic security, especially across the industrial Midwest, where we  pride ourselves on making things--things like microchips.   Just weeks after the CHIPS and Science Act became law, its benefits  began to reverberate across the heartland economy. We have already seen  numerous, major economic announcements that are directly tied to this  bill becoming law. In fact, a corridor of the semiconductor industry  will run through the State of Indiana.   Thanks to the CHIPS and Science Act, SkyWater Technology is moving  forward with its plans to partner with Purdue to build a $1.8 billion  facility in West Lafayette, which will manufacture semiconductor chips  and create an estimated 750 direct jobs, and there is more to come.   Further, the CHIPS and Science Act provides $2 billion for the  Department of Defense to make semiconductors. The Naval Surface Warfare  Center, Crane Division, in southern Indiana, with its expertise in  chips manufacturing, is expected to play a significant role in this  effort, in turn creating economic opportunities across the southern  part of our State.   The regional tech hubs authorized by the CHIPS and Science Act will  launch innovative companies, help revive American manufacturing, and  lay the foundation for new, good-paying jobs to jump-start our local  communities.  [[Page S5513]]    For too long, our coastal States have been the near-exclusive hotbeds  of venture capital investments and launching pads for tech startups.  Only a handful of American cities account for nearly 90 percent of job  growth when it comes to advanced sectors like tech, computer  manufacturing, biotech, and telecom. But the CHIPS and Science Act  plants the seed corns to ensure that opportunity for investors,  entrepreneurs, and researchers spreads across the industrial Midwest  and other areas around the country.   It will broaden and deepen our startup and tech economy. As a result,  everyone will win, and our national defense will be safeguarded.   Our position as a leader in the development of feature technologies  will be secure. Our ability to win the contests ahead, economically  and, God forbid, militarily, will also be secured. And there will be  numerous residual benefits to this law in the years to come, such as  American labor providing the manpower needed to construct new fabs and  facilities here in the United States.   In closing, let me reiterate that the CHIPS and Science Act will be a  boost to our domestic economy, but it is not just about our economy. It  will strengthen our national defense by allowing us to have the most  sophisticated weapons systems and by ensuring their critical components  are made in the U.S.A.   But it is not just about national defense either. You see, this is  about deciding which values are going to animate these technologies in  the future: The values on display from a Communist Party when it cracks  down on protesters in the streets of Hong Kong? The values that enslave  millions of Uighurs and Xinjiang, or threaten Taiwan?   The world's autocrats are attempting to exert their influence across  the globe. They argue that the American system, with our pesky system  of checks and balances, our very ideal of government of the people, by  the people, for the people--they argue that can't work in the 21st  century. But the signing of the CHIPS and Science Act proved them  wrong.   When it comes to out-innovating China in authoring a second American  century, I am confident that, in the days ahead, both time and momentum  will be on America's side.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that should the  Senate receive from the House of Representatives a bill, the text of  which is identical to H.R. 8982, as introduced in the House and which  is at the desk, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, the  bill be considered read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage  without further intervening action or debate, and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, H.R. 8982 is another important fix to the  ongoing infant formula shortage. When the Formula Act passed in July,  it left out ``infant formula base powder.'' This bill will ensure trade  barriers are lifted as we continue to address this crisis.   I thank my colleagues Senator Lee and Senator Braun for their efforts  on this.   I yield the floor.
