 Mr. President, today I wish to thank my colleague from  California, Senator Feinstein, for including provisions from my  legislation, the Comprehensive Addiction Reform, Education, and Safety,  CARES, Act of 2018, S. 2440, in her bill the Using Data to Prevent  Opioid Diversion Act of 2018, S. 2838. Specifically, the provisions  contained in my legislation provides for a tenfold increase on civil  penalties from $10,000 to $100,000 and doubles criminal penalties from  $250,000 to $500,000 on opioid manufacturers that fail to report  suspicious orders of opioids and fail to maintain intern controls  against diversion of their drugs. Senator Feinstein's bill was  considered in and reported out of the Judiciary Committee just before  the Memorial Day recess.   Sadly, the opioid and heroin epidemic continues to ravage communities  in my home State of Washington and throughout the United States.  Between 1999 and 2016, over 10,000 Washingtonians suffered fatal  overdoses from opioids and heroin.   Over the past 4 months, I have held seven roundtables and events in  every corner of my State to hear about how the epidemic is affecting  Washington State communities from law enforcement, education, and  health perspectives. I have heard heartbreaking stories from  individuals recovering from addiction and have been moved by their  courage.   One consistent thread I have heard throughout my State is that opioid  manufacturers need to be held accountable for their role in helping to  instigate this ongoing crisis.   Drug manufacturers of controlled substances, like highly addictive  opioids, are required under Federal law to keep track and report any  suspicious orders or red flags on the distribution of these drugs.  However, opioid manufacturers, through their failure to report  suspicious orders of prescription opioids and failure to maintain their  own controls against diversion, helped create an illicit market for  prescription opioids that flooded our communities with highly addictive  substances.   My home State of Washington and many other States, cities, and  counties have filed lawsuits against opioid manufacturers for their  failure to follow the law and the devastating impact those decisions  have had on their communities.   However, it should not take lawsuits to get opioid manufacturers to  follow the law and be held accountable for their role in this crisis.   Instead, we need to make sure opioid manufacturers follow the law by  making the penalties strong enough to serve as an effective deterrent.   For these reasons, on February 15, 2018, I introduced the  Comprehensive Addiction Reform, Education, and Safety, CARES, Act of  2018, S. 2440, with my colleague Senator Harris of California to do  just that.   This legislation increases civil and criminal penalties on companies  that fail to reasonably curtail their drugs from entering the illicit  drug market. Our legislation increases civil penalties from $10,000 to  $100,000 per violation for negligence in reporting suspicious  transaction activity. In addition, the bill increases the maximum  criminal penalty from $250,000 to $500,000 for companies that willfully  disregard and/or knowingly fail to keep proper reporting systems or  fail to report suspicious activity. Again, I am pleased that Senator  Feinstein included these provisions as part of her legislation, the  Using Data to Prevent Opioid Diversion Act of 2018, S. 2838.   Demonstrating the importance of this issue, a group of bipartisan 39  State and Territories attorneys general sent a letter to the Senate  Judiciary Committee on May 21, 2018, in support of my legislation, the  CARES Act, S. 2440, that holds opioid manufacturers accountable for  negligent distribution practices by increasing civil and criminal  penalties.  [[Page S3597]]    The attorneys general wrote: ``Diversion of prescription opioids has  devastated communities in our states. The consequences for turning a  blind eye to suspicious opioid orders cannot merely be a cost of doing  business. We urge you to support CARA 2.0 and the CARES Act to ensure  that penalties effectively hold manufacturers accountable and help stem  diversion.''   Additionally, I introduced the CARA 2.0 legislation on February 27,  2018, with Senators Portman, Capito, Cassidy, Hassan, Klobuchar,  Sullivan, and Whitehouse. This legislation, while providing  authorizations for treatment and naloxone programs, also includes my  provision to increase penalties on opioid manufacturers that do not  follow the law. This same provision is what Senator Feinstein has  included in her legislation, the Using Data to prevent Opioid Diversion  Act of 2018, S. 2838.   We must hold opioid manufacturers accountable in our fight to end  this scourge. I hope that the Senate will pass this legislation so it  can be signed into law.                            ____________________
