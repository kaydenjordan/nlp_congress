 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of amendment No.  319 to H.R. 2.   The Moving America Forward Act includes a historic investment in  high-speed broadband internet infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Whip Clyburn for his leadership on  the Rural Broadband Task Force.   In central Virginia, like across so much of the country, we urgently  need funding for broadband projects, particularly as COVID-19 lays bare  the realities of the digital divide.   In our district, for example, I have spoken with teachers who, when  schools closed, were unable to maintain contact with so many of their  students because they simply cannot access the internet.   As we talk about making a significant investment in the future of  high-speed internet, we need to take appropriate steps to ensure this  new infrastructure meets the needs of the next generation of wireless  technology.   For many years, the FCC has set the threshold for determining the  speed at which areas are found to have sufficient broadband service.  However, experts have indicated that the current speed threshold is  outdated. My amendment would require the GAO to examine the efficacy of  the FCC's process for updating its broadband speed threshold.    Mr. Speaker, with this information, we can make  better decisions about how to best update these thresholds. If we are  going to keep our rural businesses, our farms, and our students  competitive into the next century, we need to recognize that the  broadband infrastructure we build must meet the need for faster  downloads and uploads.
