 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of my  legislation, H R. 6020, a bill to rename the Howell Post Office after a  local, and really a national, hero: Sergeant Donald Burgett.   Mr. Donald Burgett was born in Detroit, Michigan on April 25, 1925.  On his 18th birthday he followed in his brother's footsteps and joined  the Army. He joined the newly formed paratroop company and became a  member of the famous 101st Airborne. Assigned to A Company, he fought  in battles throughout the European Theatre.   His story is quite simply amazing. He dropped over 12 miles away from  his drop zone at just after one in the morning. He fought in the battle  at Ravenoville in a little village along the coast of Normandy, where  he was among the group of Americans that liberated the first village in  Europe--and this was all before sunrise that day. From there, he fought  in battles all down the coastline, being attacked by the Germans at  every turn and even being attacked by Russian cavalry at one point on  his way to Carentan where he was wounded twice in action.   After surviving Normandy, Mr. Burgett went on to fight in Operation  Market-Graden in Holland and survive the bitterly cold siege of  Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge. Sergeant Burgett returned to  the States on January 1, 1946--at the age of just 20 years old. After  the war, Sergeant Burgett picked up flying, became a pilot and visited  all the states in his own plane. He married his wife in 1953, and they  had 5 children which they raised in Howell, MI.   He was a very active member of his community, including extensive  service with the VFW, American Legion, and Disabled American Veterans.  He authored four books which gave firsthand accounts of the  paratroopers' experience in WWII. The first of that series was  ``Currahee!: A Screaming Eagle at Normandy'', which was endorsed by  President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He also wrote ``The Road to Arnhem: A  Screaming Eagle in Holland'', ``Seven Roads to Hell: A Screaming Eagle  at Bastogne'', and ``Beyond the Rhine: A Screaming Eagle in Germany''.   Mr. Burgett passed away on March 23, 2017, at the age of 91. As a  lifelong Michigander, Mr. Burgett was truly a member of the ``Greatest  Generation'' and he spent a great deal of time making sure the efforts  of his comrades would be known and remembered. I ask all my colleagues  to join me in honoring his life and his service to the country by  making sure his name and legacy lives on in his community.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read  the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the  table.                            ____________________
