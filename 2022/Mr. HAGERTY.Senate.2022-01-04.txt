 Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator  Blackburn, I ask unanimous consent that the following remarks be  printed in the Congressional Record to further honor the life of Andrew  Franklin Alexander, the late son of former Tennessee U.S. Senator Lamar  Alexander.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Honoring Andrew Franklin Alexander         Andrew Franklin Alexander, age 52, passed away December 31,       2021 after a short illness. Drew was born in Washington,       D.C., on September 21, 1969. He moved with his family to       Nashville, TN when he was one year old. He attended Ensworth       School, became a member of Westminster Presbyterian Church,       and graduated from University School of Nashville. He then       attended Kenyon College in Ohio where he earned a Bachelor of       Arts in Music. In 1994 he went to work for Curb Records in       Nashville as a receptionist. Quickly he rose to lead the       company's publishing division. As Vice President of       Publishing, he oversaw the division's forty-five employees       and songwriters. A classically trained guitarist, Drew also       directed creative and administrative aspects of the company       where he set budgets, signed songwriters, negotiated       contracts, placed songs, and acquired catalogs.        During his tenure Curb Music Publishing earned eighty-seven       ASCAP, BMI and SESAC performance awards, and set records for       the fastest rising country single and the longest charting       country single in Billboard Country chart history. In 2017,       after 23 years at Curb, Drew stepped down from his role as       Director of Publishing but continued working with the Mike       Curb Foundation. Drew also founded his own company, Blair       Branch Music. He became an active community volunteer working       with numerous Nashville agencies including Second Harvest       Food Bank, Nashville Rescue Mission, and Room at the Inn.       Drew's motto was ``give more than you take''. When he wasn't       on the phone raising money for the needy he often could be       found serving lunch at homeless shelters.        Drew served on the boards of The Recording Academy, Belmont       School of Music, Family and Children's Service, the Community       Resource Center, Leadership Music as Treasurer, and the       Tennessee Residence Foundation as Secretary. He was a member       of the Country Music Association, the Gospel Music       Association, Academy of Country Music, and the Downtown       Nashville Rotary Club.        Drew helped many artists and songwriters get their start in       Nashville and had many friends in the music industry. Over       the years he hosted small groups of songwriters and artists,       including Lee Brice, Bill Anderson, Kyle Jacobs, Billy       Montana, Kelsea Ballerini and many others, at writing       retreats at his family's home at Blackberry Farm in East       Tennessee, at Evins Mill in Middle Tennessee, and at Bending       Lake in Canada. From these dozens of sessions came more than       1,000 songs including many hits. Drew was active with the       National Songwriters Association defending songwriters' legal       rights.        Drew loved his daughters, his friends and watching sports       with them all, especially the Tennessee Titans and University       of Tennessee basketball and football--and he loved to fish,       traveling around the world in pursuit of new adventures. Drew       is survived by two daughters, Lauren Blair Alexander and       Helen Victoria Alexander of Nashville; his parents, Honey and       Lamar Alexander of Walland, TN; two sisters, Leslee Alexander       of Maryville, TN and Kathryn Alexander of Briarcliff Manor,       NY; his brother, Will Alexander of Nashville; and, seven       nieces and nephews. The Alexander family wishes to express       our thanks to Drew's friends Bruce Phillips and Hal Hardin       for their many kindnesses to him.                            ____________________
