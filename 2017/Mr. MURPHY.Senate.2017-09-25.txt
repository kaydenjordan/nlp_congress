 Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks  of the Senator from Massachusetts. There is a lot of work we need to do  this week; she is right. There are healthcare crises right around the  corner for millions of kids and families that we could be working on  solving right now. As the Senator knows, both Connecticut and  Massachusetts are still being wrecked by an opioid crisis--one that in  my State is getting worse by the year, not better. We could be working  together on that. We have brothers and sisters all throughout the  United States who are right now in crisis because of devastating storms  that have hit. We could be working together on trying to provide a  meaningful response, and we aren't. Yet, again, we are back now talking  about TrumpCare redux. This is version 10, version 11. I think there  have been three versions already this week. This one is really the most  dangerous version yet.   CBO just released a scaled-down analysis, noting that there was no  way they would be able to provide a full analysis given the compressed  schedule, given the need to pass this by the end of this week because  of Republicans' desire to make sure that not a single Democrat is  included in the negotiation. They gave us some hints as to what their  score would say once it was fully completed.   Federal spending on Medicaid would be reduced by $1 trillion over the  course of this decade. There is simply no way to rip $1 trillion out of  the Medicaid system--the Medicaid system, by the way, as all my  colleagues know, that provides insurance to the disabled, to children,  and to the elderly--without millions of people losing access to  healthcare, people who have nowhere else to go.   CBO unsurprisingly says that the number of people with comprehensive  health insurance would be reduced by millions, and they predict that  States would allow insurers to set premiums on the basis of an  individuals' health status. None of that is news to people who have  read this piece of legislation.   I want to talk for a second about why CBO comes to those conclusions  and why this is the most dangerous version of the bill yet.   In this bill is a massive reordering of the American healthcare  system. The healthcare exchanges, which right now insure millions of  Americans across the country, are essentially eliminated under this  bill because the whole reason they existed was to funnel tax credits  that are attached to individuals based on their income to help them buy  insurance. Those tax credits go away under this proposal; thus, the  exchanges go away.   Medicare as an entitlement is ended by this bill. No longer will you  as an individual have a payment from the Federal Government attached to  you because of your income or your health status or your disability.  States will now get a block sum of money to do essentially what they  wish, which may or may not cover the same number of people today  covered under Medicaid.   While proponents of this bill are trying to contend that it still  protects people with preexisting conditions, no one is buying it, no  one is believing it, because on the face of the text, it does not. It  is important to explain why that is.   While technically it is up to the States as to whether they protect  people with preexisting conditions, under this new version, States can  just sign a form that allows them to permit insurers to price based on  medical acuity again--meaning charge sick people more. They will have  to exercise that option under this version of TrumpCare. They will be  forced to exercise that option because what is also eliminated by this  version of TrumpCare is the requirement that healthy individuals buy  insurance. You cannot require insurance companies to charge sick people  the same as healthy people if you don't provide incentives for healthy  people to sign up. There is no incentive, at least under the latest  version of the bill that I read; thus, anybody who has taken a  semester's worth of education on insurance practice will tell you that  States will be faced with two choices: one, reimpose their own  individual mandate--and I am going to guarantee you that based on the  vitriol that has been launched against the individual mandate from  Republicans in this Chamber and the House of Representatives over the  past 6 years, most States will probably not take on their Republican  Senators and congressional delegation by passing their individual  mandate--or they will be forced to drop the protection for people with  preexisting conditions.   CBO and JCT anticipate that many States--I would argue the majority  of States--will have to drop that protection for people with  preexisting conditions because they will not pass an individual  mandate; thus, rates will skyrocket for sick people or anybody who has  ever been sick, making insurance unaccessible for Americans who have  had a cancer diagnosis or an addiction diagnosis or a mental illness  diagnosis.    This bill is a massive reorientation of the American healthcare  system, the elimination of Medicaid as we know it, the end of the  healthcare insurance exchanges, the end of the tax credits to help  people buy healthcare insurance, and the end of the mandatory national  protections for people against abusive insurance practices. We are  potentially going to vote on this later this week without a CBO score-- with one hearing, with no markups.   I don't care how mad my Republican friends were about how the  Affordable Care Act was passed. That was done in an open process, with  dozens of hearings, with markups in every committee, with 30 days of  debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate, with hundreds of Republican  amendments that were offered and adopted as part of the affordable  healthcare act, with over a year of public input and debate about the  pros and cons of the proposal.   None of that is happening on Graham-Cassidy. This is being rushed  through in the dead of night, with no time for Americans to review it,  no time for Members of this body to look at it, and no ability for any  Senator in the Democratic Party to be able to have any input into the  final product. This is nothing like what happened on the Affordable  Care Act. No matter how mad you are that in the end you couldn't vote  for it, Republicans had plenty of opportunity to have a say. The  American people had plenty of opportunity to take a look at it. That is  not happening with Graham-Cassidy.   Because there is no CBO score, we have to rely on outside independent  groups to size up the potential disaster of this bill. The Center for  American Progress--which admittedly is a left-leaning organization but  is one of the few that have taken the time to take a look at the text  and what it will mean--came to the conclusion that 32 million people  would lose coverage. The Commonwealth Fund, which is not a political  organization, which is an independent, nonpartisan healthcare think  tank, essentially came to the same conclusion, saying that after 2026,  32 million people would lose coverage. The Commonwealth Fund says that  15 to 18 million people could become uninsured by 2019.  [[Page S6093]]    I have had this chart up here for 3 or 4 months, and I have had to  adjust it over and over again because it started out with 23 million  people losing insurance as we analyzed the first Republican repeal  bill. Then, when the new version came in, you can see I had to write in  22 million people because the amended version that we were going to  vote on right before the break was 1 million better. I had to redo my  chart based upon this analysis of Graham-Cassidy, resulting in 32  million people losing insurance. Thirty-two million people. It is hard  to understand how many people--32 million people will be losing  insurance over the course of 10 years. That is the total population of  Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska,  Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, West  Virginia. We had to cross out Rhode Island, but then we had to add  Mississippi, Arkansas, Vermont, Wyoming, and Utah.   Forgive me; I had to do my own artist's rendering of these States  because the data is coming in so fast and the vote is coming so  quickly, I didn't have time to have this chart made up again.   That is 32 million people. Think about that. Over 10 years, the  equivalent population of all of these States--what is that? 17 States,  19 States--all losing healthcare at the same time. That is a  humanitarian catastrophe, and nobody knows it because this bill is  being pushed through without any debate, without any CBO score. That is  what could happen if this passes.   It is no surprise that basically everybody in the American healthcare  system opposes this piece of legislation. The proponents cannot find a  single verifier inside the medical community for this piece of  legislation.   This morning, I heard Senator Graham say: Well, that is to be  expected. You know, we are making a big reform, and anytime you are  making a big reform, the status quo players aren't going to like the  result.   Well, that is a little unfair because the status quo for groups like  the American Heart Association or the Juvenile Diabetes Research  Foundation or the American Cancer Society--the status quo for them is  that their members--people who have cancer or juvenile diabetes or  heart disease--don't go bankrupt any longer because they can't afford  insurance. So, yes, they are kind of upset that 32 million people are  going to lose insurance--many of their members--and that we are going  to go back to the day in which if you are sick, if you have cancer, in  most States, you can be charged more. So, yes, people are protective of  the status quo--the part of the status quo that makes sure that sick  people or people who have ever been sick don't lose insurance.   I think it is actually worthwhile for just a second--bear with me--to  give a quick sense as to how many people in the medical community  oppose this bill. Here is just a beginning list: the AARP, the School  Superintendents Association, America's Health Insurance Plans, the ALS  Association, America's Essential Hospitals, America's pediatric  dentists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of  Family Physicians, the American Association on Health and Disability,  the American Cancer Society, the American Dental Association, the  American College of Physicians, the American Congress of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists, the American Diabetes Association, the American  Federation of Teachers, the American Heart Association, the American  Hospital Association, the American Lung Association, the American  Osteopathic Association, the American Medical Association, the American  Public Health Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the  American Psychological Association, the Arthritis Foundation, the Big  Cities Health Coalition, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the Children's  Hospital Association, the Center for Medicare Advocacy, the Cystic  Fibrosis Foundation, the Endocrine Society, Family Voices, the  Federation of American Hospitals, the HIV Medicine Association, the  Human Rights Campaign, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the  Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, the Lutheran Services in America, Main  Street Alliance, March of Dimes, the Medicare Rights Center, the  National Association of County and City Health Officials, the National  Association of School Nurses, the National Alliance of State &  Territorial AIDS Directors, the National Coalition for Cancer  Survivorship, the National Health Council, the National Multiple  Sclerosis Society, the National Organization for Rare Diseases, the  National Partnership for Women and Families, Planned Parenthood, the  Arc Connecticut, the Arc of the United States, the Trust for America's  Health, and 47 religious organizations representing various  denominations, including American Muslim Health Professionals, Alliance  of Baptists, Methodist Federation for Social Action, the National  Council of Jewish Women, the Presbyterian Church of the United States,  the United Church of Christ, and the United Methodist Church.   That is the tip of the iceberg. You are not really in good company if  you are supportive of this bill when every single medical association,  every single patient advocacy organization, every single hospital  association, every single insurer thinks that you are wrong. You would  like to think there might be a couple of these groups who would think  it was a good thing to pass a bill that uninsures potentially 32  million--maybe 25 million, maybe 22 million--and jeopardizes  preexisting protections for millions of Americans.   What is so bonkers about this is that we were this close to getting a  bipartisan agreement. It is not as if there wasn't another path. I sit  on the HELP Committee. I had half a dozen conversations with Senator  Alexander and Senator Murray. I know we were 80 percent of the way  there on passing a bipartisan package of reforms--at least out of the  HELP Committee--that would have kept what was working in the Affordable  Care Act and tried to fix what wasn't working.   I saw Leader McConnell's tweet from earlier today in which he said  that Senate Democrats have two thoughts on how to fix ObamaCare--one,  do nothing; two, a fully government-run system that would take away  even more of their decisions.   That is not true. That is not true, and everybody here knows that it  is not true. Why? Because Senate Democrats were sitting down and  talking with Senate Republicans. We were at the table just a week ago,  trying to come up with a package of reforms. So to say that the  Democrats want only a single-payer healthcare system or what we have  today is not true, and everybody knows that is not true.   I am certainly raw at the fact that Republicans walked away from that  negotiating table when we were so close. I do not think that was in the  best traditions of the U.S. Senate, but I am ready to sit back down at  the table. I know that Patty Murray is ready to sit back down at the  table if this process blows up, as every previous attempt at repealing  the Affordable Care Act with a thoughtless alternative has blown up.   My constituents are not happy with the American healthcare system.  They like a lot of the things the Affordable Care Act did, but they  acknowledge there are still lots of problems that need to be solved.  Amongst those constituents in my State who like what the Affordable  Care Act has done but who still want to see changes are Isabelle and  Rylan.   Isabelle first wrote about her son to my office 2 days after the last  election. This is Rylan, who was born with a congenital heart defect.  He looked healthy when he was born. He and Isabelle had been scheduled  for discharge from the hospital when Rylan went in for some routine  testing, but he never came back. His parents kind of knew something was  up, but when the doctors arrived back in their room, they told Isabelle  and her husband that Rylan needed to be rushed to the hospital for  emergency surgery because his body was not getting enough oxygen, and  there was something wrong with his heart. He was diagnosed with several  severe heart defects, and he required emergency open heart surgery.   The first thing Isabelle thought was: How are we going to pay for  this? Does insurance cover it?   She found out, much to her relief, that insurance did cover it,  because insurance was required to cover things like hospitalizations  under the Affordable Care Act and that they would not lose coverage,  because no matter how big the bills got, the Affordable Care  [[Page S6094]]  Act prohibited insurance companies from cutting her off.   Isabelle has been a warrior in preserving those protections in the  Affordable Care Act, and I just want to leave you with an email that  she sent me this week.   She writes that she is exhausted and that she is so tired of having  to fight over and over and over again for Rylan. She feels that no  matter what she tries to do, this repeal is going to happen, regardless  of Rylan's story, and that they are just going to be casualties of this  political imperative to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   In 3 weeks, Rylan is going to be going up to Boston for his big  cardiac and neuro checkup. She wishes that their biggest fight were to  keep him healthy and alive, but it is not. They are engaged in a  political fight to try to stop the protections, which keep him alive  and keep this family solvent, from being stolen from them.   This is not a game to Isabelle and to Rylan. This is not about  politics. This is about this little boy's life. I am going to tell you  that my State cannot hold this together if you cut Federal funding for  healthcare by 50 percent to Connecticut, as this bill would do--maybe  more. What we are hearing is that money is going to be stolen from  States that have implemented the Affordable Care Act in order to be  delivered to the States of Senators who have not yet committed to the  bill on the Republican side. We cannot hold it together for Rylan in  Connecticut if you take away half of our Federal healthcare funding, if  you take away the tax credits that help people buy insurance, if you  take away the Medicaid that helps insure these kids--if you let  insurers go back to the days in which they discriminated against these  kids. It is not a game to Isabelle.   She writes:         Every time the repeal comes up (what is it--the third time       or more), I feel sick with anxiety. How quickly the rug will       be pulled from under us. How quickly the bricks will begin to       fall.    We are ready to work with you. We are ready to sit down, once again,  and try to work something out that gets Democrats and Republicans  together on this and that does what the American people want us to do-- keep what works in the Affordable Care Act and improve what does not  work. Please give this up. You are ruining the lives of these families  who, in addition to having to save their children's lives, are having  to become full-time political activists to stop this from happening. We  can do this together. We can deliver peace of mind to these families.  It is not too late.   I yield the floor.
