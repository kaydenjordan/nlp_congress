 Mr. President, I wish to add a few Rhode Island  voices to the voice of the Senator from Minnesota. By the way, I am not  cherry-picking my correspondence to find the rare letters in opposition  to this nominee. We have had an unprecedented avalanche of opposition  to this nominee. It is running well more than 100 to 1 against her, and  it is people from all walks of life.   Here is a letter from William, a 12th grader in Pawtucket, RI.  William took the trouble to write to me. Let me start with the topic  line: ``Concern over Betsy DeVos.''         Hello, Senator Whitehouse!        My name is William and I am a senior at Blackstone Academy       Charter School, a public charter school in Pawtucket, Rhode       Island. I am contacting you today due to my concern about       educational equality, specifically Betsy DeVos' ability to       commit to practices that ensure that the children who need       the most help aren't forgotten about and brushed under the       rug. These children are our kids of color, as well as our       low-income kids attending urban public schools with limited       resources.        Having attended a Pawtucket public school, I can       confidently say that there are some genuinely brilliant minds       here in this very city, in the areas where somebody like Mrs.       DeVos would least expect. Yet it also cannot be denied that       the students here begin their journey on ground that is       unequal to that of other kids who are not people of color, or       are not part of the public school system, etc. These bright       young saplings are being crushed before they are given the       chance to blossom, and that is a systemic problem that DeVos,       given her various shortcomings, will only serve to perpetuate       and make worse.        DeVos, given her support of the privatization of public       schools and her open disdain towards the LGBTQIA community,       has established that she will not improve the experiences of       marginalized communities. Her interest is not the betterment       of education for people, but the monetization of education to       put money in her pockets and the pockets of people like her.       DeVos will never spearhead movements that promote equity in       education and will continuously disappoint us all throughout       her term which will not be defined by deviating from the       status quo and creating a system that our troubled but gifted       youth can thrive in. In fact, she will do the opposite.        With this in mind I ask that you, Senator Whitehouse,       openly speak out against Betsy DeVos, and do everything in       your power to keep her out of the Secretary of Education       office. I also ask that you continue to remember me and       children like me; public school youth who could be incredible       if they are just given the opportunity to thrive.        Thank you for your time!        William.    Now let's hear from Da-naijah, a 10th grader from Central Falls, RI.         Dear Senator Sheldon Whitehouse,        My name is Da-naijah, and I am in 10th grade at Blackstone       Academy School which is a public charter school. I live in       Central Falls, RI. I'm writing today because I'm concerned       about kids being able to afford college, regardless of       background. I care about this because I have plenty of       family members and friends who go to public school, and       they either want or are trying to go to college. I know       they will need help with paying for college because they       don't come from a very wealthy background. Fair and equal       education is so important to me because I think everyone       should be treated fairly regardless of how they look       because we are humans. I am concerned about Betsy DeVos       being nominated for Secretary of Education because she       doesn't have any experience with classrooms. Also because       she basically doesn't like public schools since she is       trying to make public school private and is trying to take       resources away from public schools. With that being said,       I hope that you do everything you can to help the kids in       public school get equal education and fair education as       much as private schools do. Please read my email when you       can and I would like to thank you for your time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S732, February 6, 2017, near the bottom of the first  column, the following language appears: My name is Da-naijah XXXX,  and . . .      The online Record has been corrected to read: My name is Da- naijah, and . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================          Sincerely,        Da-Naijah    Next is Sara. She also lives in the city of Central Falls.         I am writing today because I'm concerned about the       education in the public schools in my city. The students in       Central Falls are not given the education they deserve in the       environment of Central Falls as of schools in other       districts. This is important to me because my younger brother       is a disabled boy, and it worries me that he won't continue       to get the education he deserves. I'm very concerned about       the nominee Betsy DeVos because she has 0 experience in the       role of Secretary of Education and there are videos on almost       any social media as well as YouTube to prove it and it       clearly shows she has no experience and will put our       education, or I'll say ``future'' at risk. Please Senator I       hope you can do everything you can to prevent her nomination.       . . . Thank you!        Sincerely,        Sara    The last one I will read is from Jennyfer, 10th grade at Blackstone  Academy Charter School, from Pawtucket.         I'm writing today because I'm concerned about students in       public schools not receiving the same and fair education       students in charter and private schools have. I care about       students in public schools because I want every student to       have the privilege of receiving fair and equal education as I       have the chance too.        Fair and equal education is so important to me because I'm       a Latina and a woman of color, I deserve the same equal and       fair education as every other individual. I want my siblings       who go to a public school to receive the same education and       resources I get.        I am concerned about Betsy DeVos [that she] will take that       privilege away from students in public schools.        I hope you do everything you can to prevent Betsy DeVos       from taking this privilege away from students in public       schools.        Thank you for your time!    There are more letters that I could read, but one point I would like  to make is that these are students writing from charter schools. In the  flood of opposition from Rhode Island that we have seen to this  nominee, it has included teachers, managers, and students in charter  schools. There has been a notion developed that this is a battle  between public schools and charter schools and that public schools  aren't good, but they want to trap children in them; that charter  schools are the way out; and that Mrs. DeVos will lead us off into that  charter school happy land.   The fact is, it is not that simple. We have great charter schools in  Rhode Island, and we have some great public schools in Rhode Island. We  have both. The charter school leaders are opposed to her nomination.  Why is that? It is in part because the transition from charter to  public schools can be done fairly or it can be done unfairly. In all of  her work, Mrs. DeVos has shown that she would do it unfairly.   There is an obvious--what demographers would call--selection bias  between the kids who turn up in a charter school that they have to  select to go into and the kids who are still in the public school that  is left behind.   The selection bias is based on all sorts of different reasons. It  could be as simple as they have more engaged parents. The parents are  interested enough in their education to take the trouble to sign them  up for the charter school, and that creates a slightly different  demographic than the ones who are left behind. It helps the charter  school population, and it makes it easier for the charter school.   Charter schools have authority that public schools don't have with  respect to discipline; indeed, the ability to remove children and  return them to the public schools. They are able to force students to  sign contracts and agreements regarding their behavior. Public schools  can't do that. Again, that confers an advantage on the charter school  that a public school doesn't have.   Children with disabilities often get immense support through the  public school system. When they try to go to the charter school, they  see that the supports for the children with disabilities aren't there,  and so it doesn't make sense to move to a charter school. The charter  schools tend to get a smaller population of children with disabilities.  They don't have that additional expense of dealing with and meeting a  child wherever their abilities and disabilities are. The public school  keeps that expense.   In Rhode Island, we have people flooding into Providence. We teach  kids who speak something like 70 original languages in our Providence  public schools. A new immigrant is going to go to the public school.  That is where they go. It is going to take them time to get settled and  to learn about America and to pick up enough language to understand  that a charter school exists, to make the choice to move their child  there, and by the time they do, fine, if they make the choice. But,  again, the public school had to be there for them; again, it is an  advantage to the charter school.    It is all great for charter schools, but the idea that they are  outperforming public schools and there is no recognition of that  selection bias is just unfair to the public schools. It gets worse when  you move from the selection bias on students to the funding because the  way it often works and the way it works in Rhode Island is that the  money follows the student. If you are  [[Page S733]]  in the public school and you are selected for a charter school, then a  certain stipend of money goes with you to support that charter school.   The problem is that as that money gets taken out of the public  schools' budget, the costs in the public school didn't follow you to  the charter school. The money followed you to the charter school, but  many of the costs remained. If one child leaves a public school  classroom and goes to a charter school, you still have to turn the  lights on, you still have to hire the teacher, you still have to heat  the building, you have maybe one less pencil and one less piece of  paper in the room, but those are tiny costs. The fixed costs remain.   That is a very serious threat to public schools. Anybody who truly  supports the charter school movement, as our charter schools do, has to  understand, first, the selection bias problem and understand that the  testing and accountability has to be fair between public and charter  schools and, second, this funding problem--that if you are simply  pulling the money out of the public schools into charter schools and  the costs are staying behind, what you are doing is crashing the  revenues but leaving the expenses of public schools.   The public school students are going to suffer from that. If you  don't adjust for it, you are being unfair to the public schools, and  you are being unfair to the students. This is a serious enough problem  that our Providence City Council is debating the issue right now and,  as students move to charter schools, trying to figure out: How do you  provide adequate funding so you are not stripping the public schools of  what they need to continue to teach the other students? Not only are  they serious about trying to figure out this budget equation at the  city council level, but Moody's, the service that looks at municipal  budgets and determines how sound they are and rates municipalities, has  looked at this problem of charter school movement and the remaining  costs in public schools and identified it as a fiscal threat to  municipalities.   These are both real problems, and the refusal of Mrs. DeVos to  grapple with them suggests to our charter school leaders and to me that  this is not just an effort to enhance students in being able to go to a  good charter school; this is actually an attack on public schools.   There are all sorts of reasons somebody might want to knock down  public schools. One is that they simply don't like teachers unions.  Teachers unions tend to vote Democratic, let's face it. If you want to  cripple teachers unions, destroy the schools they work in. That is a  really nasty reason to get into this charter school fight, but it is  real, and it is out there.   A second is, if you want to bring for-profit investment into this  space, a lot of money gets spent on education. People who could figure  out how to make money in this space want to get their noses in and to  get a chunk of that money. When they come in, they may or may not do a  good job, but they are highly profit motivated. If you are interested  in trying to facilitate them and to give them a money making  opportunity, then you may well want to damage public schools in order  to support their move to for-profits.   This creates a fairly significant problem when you connect it to the  next piece of Mrs. DeVos's application. That is conflict of interest.  One of the basic elements that we are here to look at in our advice and  consent process is conflict of interest. Will the nominee be able to do  a fair job? Will she be looking at things fair and square or will she  have conflicts of interest that impede the fair exercise of her  judgment?   One place that we need to look for conflict of interest is when we  have nominees who have run political dark money operations. This is a  new thing for us. Not too long ago we swore in a new President-- President Barack Obama. When we did, we had ethics rules, government  ethics offices, filing requirements, and all of that in place. That was  2008. Then came the Citizens United decision--one of the worst  decisions that five Justices on the Supreme Court have ever made, and  it opened up the floodgates of dark money.   This nominee is a practitioner of the dark arts of dark money. We  know nothing about what she has done, but the conflicts of interest  ought to be pretty obvious. If you raised millions of dollars from  people in your dark money operation, then there is an indebtedness  there that somebody might think could be an appearance of impropriety  or conflict.   We should know so that evaluation can be made. Or if you spent dark  money in support of certain things, we should know so that we can  connect the dots and evaluate the linkages and see whether it is a  conflict of interest.   We wrote to Mrs. DeVos about this. The first letter was January 5,  2017. We got an answer, and the answer was spectacularly incomplete and  unhelpful. So we wrote a second letter on January 27. I wish to take a  minute and read this letter because I think it explains our  predicament.         Elisabeth DeVos        Trump-Pence Transition Team        Pennsylvania Avenue, NW        Washington, DC        Dear Mrs. DeVos,        Thank you for your response of January 17, 2017, to our       January 5, 2017 letter--    Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the letter at the end of my remarks.         Thank you for your response of January 17, 2017, to our       January 5, 2017 letter requesting additional information on       your vast political fundraising and spending network. Along       with various responses and objections to our request, you       produced a series of already public campaign finance reports       related to the American Federation for Children Action Fund,       a 527 organization, and its various State affiliates. For the       reasons that follow, we view your response as, while sizable,       nonresponsive.        We requested you provide information about two 501(c)(4)       organizations with which you have been associated: the       American Federation for Children and the Great Lakes       Education Fund. You acknowledged your association with these       entities in your disclosures to the Office of Government       Ethics (OGE). You also acknowledged in your letter to us that       ``[e]ach organization with which [you] have been involved is       independent.'' It is not clear what you mean by       ``independent'' since you have already acknowledged your       association with these organizations. I hope you can       appreciate how both fundraising and spending of these       organizations (from whom? to whom? in what amounts? your       personal role?) might produce conflicts of interests in       potential decisions if you are confirmed to serve as       Secretary of the Department of Education.        Our concerns are not hypothetical as known contributors to       your political organizations have had business before       Department of Education. For example:        Vahan Gureghian: In 2010, Gureghian donated $100,000 to the       American Federation for Children Action Fund. Mr. Gureghian       founded and is the CEO of CSMI LLC, a Pennsylvania charter       school management company and helped found the Chester       Community Charter School. He has been a major donor in       promoting charter schools in Pennsylvania.    I will interrupt reading the letter for a moment to point out how  obvious it is that somebody involved in the charter school movement  could very easily have business before the Department of Education. Who  knows how much he gave? We know of about $100,000, but it could be a  lot more. He knows. She knows, but the public won't know. When bids or  competitions are up, that is simply not fair.   On to the next one and back to the text of the letter:         J.C. Huizenga: Between 2005 and 2007, Huizenga donated       $25,000 to All Children Matter, and in 2010 he donated       $30,000 to the American Federation for Children Action Fund.       Mr. Huizenga founded the National Heritage Academies, a for-      profit charter network that has 80 schools in 9 States and       has received over $43 million in federal funding. According       to a 2012 review by the Michigan Department of Education of       the schools in the ``focus'' category, due to significant       gaps in achievement, more than half were managed by National       Heritage Academies. It has been reported that Mr. Huizenga       said that his involvement with charter schools was due to       realizing that ``privatizing public education was not only       practical but also desperately needed.''    Again, to step back out from the letter, here is somebody who is in  the for-profit charter school business, whose charter schools are more  than half of the troubled charter schools reviewed by the Michigan  Department of Education and who wants to privatize public education. He  is linked with her through the dark money operation. We don't know  anything about the dark money side.         David L. Brennan: Brennan donated a total of $200,000 to       All Children Matter from 2004 to 2007, prior to AMC's wind       down due to campaign finance violations.    This is a series of campaign violations, finance violations, that led  to the $5 million fine that neither the entity nor Mrs. DeVos have ever  paid.   [[Page S734]]              In 2010, he donated $39,000 to the American Federation for       Children Action Fund. He is the founder of White Hat       Management LLC, a for-profit charter school management       company that operates 15 schools in three states with over       12,000 students. Since 2008, Whitehat and its affiliates have       received $3.6 million in federal funds including IDEA funds.    How are we ever going to know if people like this--who are making  big, dark money contributions into the dark money operation that she  runs--will not be rewarded in a pay-to-play fashion with grants and  favors and an advantage in competition at the Department of Education?  You would ordinarily evaluate that by knowing that the conflict of  interest existed. But because it is dark money, we will never know.   They will know. She will know, but the public will never know. The  Senate will never know. The press will never know.         While you may not have a direct financial interest in the       for-profit education enterprises headed by those listed       above, your political fundraising relationship with them, and       perhaps others, could cause a reasonable person concern over       your impartiality in matters involving them.    Let me step out of the letter again. Doesn't that make sense? If you  were applying for a grant before the Department of Education and your  competitor was somebody who had given $1 million to Mrs. DeVos's Action  Fund, wouldn't you want to know that? Don't you think the public should  know that? If you were to find out later that had taken place, and they  were awarded the grant and you were not, wouldn't that rankle you a  bit? Wouldn't that suggest to you that perhaps we are not being treated  fairly because of that big contribution that was made? But we will  never know. We are disabled from doing our constitutional job of  reviewing these nominees for conflict of interest when it is dark money  that is at stake.         The OGE process does not capture conflicts that arise       through political activity. . . .    This is the first transition of Presidents since the Citizens United  decision. This is the first one; so there is no history. We have to do  it now, but we are not--not for this nominee, not for other nominees.  We are leaving a black hole of secrecy around this enormous conflict of  interest potential.         The OGE process does not capture conflicts that arise       through political activity so it is incumbent upon us to       assure the Senate record is complete as to such conflicts and       how they will be resolved.        These are just the publically known examples of potential       conflicts. Our original request asked you for information to       assess potential conflicts with 501(c)(4) organizations that       are not required to publicly disclose donor information.       Accordingly, we reiterate our request that you provide:        A list of all donors, their total donations, and       affiliations, who have contributed to the American Federation       for Children 501(c)(4), and the Great Lakes Fund 501(c)(4)       since their inception.        A list of donations made by you, members of your family,       and foundations or organizations with which you are       affiliated, to other 501(c)(4) organizations over the past       five years.    That seems like a perfectly reasonable request.         According to the American Federation for Children's IRS       Form 990 filed for the year 2014, it spent nearly $1.1       million on political activities, including a $315,000       transfer to the American Federation for Children Action Fund,       Wisconsin IE Committee.    I think most people here know how this works, but to make it clear  for people listening, many political organizations require that the  donors be disclosed. So if you want to engage in the dark money game  and hide your political influence-seeking, what you do is you take your  money and you give it to a 501(c)(4), a dark money operation. Then they  in turn give it to the political action group. That is what happened  here. $1.1 million into the American Federation for Children, $315,000  transferred to the American Federation for Children Action Fund in  Wisconsin. The only function that provides is to launder the identity  of who the donor was. So that all you see is the money emerging from  the dark money organization, with no transparency as to who put it in.         Because donations to a 501(c)(4) are anonymous, they       effectively launder the identities of donors to the other       parts of the political apparatus. But you know, and the       donors know, and therein lies the potential for conflict of       interest. Additionally, you refused to disclose donations to       501(c)(4) organizations that you, your family and your       foundation have made. You explained, ``(t)he information       request requested has no bearing on the office to which I       have been nominated nor the duties of the Department of       Education.''    That was her answer to the first letter. Our letter here continues:         Your donations to 501(c)(4) organizations are indeed       relevant to your nomination, just as your donations to       political candidates, parties and causes are. One obvious       instance would be where groups to which you have made       political contributions are before the Department as       advocates or grant seekers. Again, you know and the donors       know, and therein lies the potential for conflict of       interest. Senators have a Constitutional duty to provide       advice and consent on Presidential nominees, and       understanding the scope and nature of potential conflicts of       interest is at the heart of that duty.    I do hope that we can agree on that in this Body: That part of our  advice and consent role is to understand the potential for conflicts of  interest. If we can't agree on that, then we have a real problem here,  because that is the purpose or at least one purpose of what we do.         Your role in raising and distributing ``dark money''       clearly raises the possibility of such conflicts. As a       result, we renew our request for information related to your       501(c)(4) organizations as outlined above.        Please contact us if you have any questions regarding this       request. We look forward to your additional information and       disclosures and timely and responsive answers.    Well, as of today, what we have is no answer at all--no answer at  all. This is a recurring problem here. This business of dark money not  being caught by the rather obsolete, in that respect, government ethics  reporting conventions that have been carried forward from the Obama  transition before all of this became a problem doesn't just apply to  Mrs. DeVos.   Secretary of State Tillerson, as CEO of ExxonMobil, ran a massive  dark money operation. ExxonMobil has money all over front groups that  deny climate change, all over political groups to try to discourage  action on climate change, and a lot of it is dark money. There has been  reporting that traces it back to Exxon, but we never know how much  because it is dark money, and Mr. Tillerson hasn't told us one thing  about it in his hearing.   We will be considering shortly the nomination of Scott Pruitt as the  EPA Administrator. Scott Pruitt ran a dark money operation as the  attorney general of Oklahoma. Why would an attorney general want to run  a dark money operation in the first place? That is a whole separate  question--but he did. It was called the Rule of Law Defense Fund, and  what it did was it took in money, prevented the donors from having  their identities revealed, and then funneled the money publicly to the  Republican Attorneys General Association. It was an identity laundering  machine for the Republican Attorneys General Association for big donors  who didn't want anybody to know who the source was of the money that  was being funneled into the Republican Attorneys General Association.  That is fine, I guess. I would like to be rid of all of it. We should  pass the DISCLOSE Act and clean this mess up. But for sure, when  somebody who has run a dark money operation comes before the Senate  seeking to be nominated to a Cabinet office, we hold a constitutional  duty to protect that office from improper conflicts of interest.  Surely, then, their role in the dark money operation should be  disclosed.   It only makes sense. But, no, like Mrs. DeVos, absolute stonewall on  any information related to the Rule of Law Defense Fund and Mr.  Pruitt's dark money operation, a black hole of secrecy and enormous  opportunity for conflict, because obviously, given his background and  given where the rest of his fundraising went, you can draw a reasonable  conclusion about where the dark money came from: Devon Energy,  ExxonMobil, American Petroleum Institute, Murray Coal--the usual  suspects. That is where a lot of his other money came from. You have to  believe it went here. But do we know that? No. He could have taken $1  million from one of those groups and then, as EPA Administrator, be  ruling on an application of theirs and we would not know. Please don't  anyone tell me that is not a potential conflict of interest. I mean, we  can deal with alternate facts around here, but that is just crazy.   We don't know about Mrs. DeVos's dark money. We don't know about  Tillerson's dark money. We don't know about Pruitt's dark money. It is  as if  [[Page S735]]  there has been an understanding--some secret handshake around here-- that nobody will allow dark money information into the nomination  process. That is just wrong. That is just wrong. It infects this  nomination of Mrs. DeVos. We have to get answers to these questions.   Let me move on to one other point: student college debt. I had a  meeting recently. I think all of us had the same experience. From our  home States, groups come to visit us and to get our time and to bring  our attention to problems that concern them. I think we all get visits  from the same groups. We get visits from our community bankers from our  home States. We get visits from our credit unions in our home States.  We get visits from the automobile dealers in our home States. We get  visits from the insurance brokers in our home States. We get visits  from the Realtors in our home States.   When the Realtors of Rhode Island came in to visit me the last time,  they raised a new issue that I had not heard before from them. The  issue that they raised was this: You know, we are starting to have a  real problem financing houses for the next generation of home buyers,  the young home buyers who are coming into the market and who would  ordinarily be buying their starter homes. The problem we are finding  with them is that they are so loaded up with college debt that we can't  finance the purchase of a home for them.   That is how enormous the student loan debt problem is in this  country. It is now preventing so many young people from buying a home  that the Realtors have noticed and put it on their problem list as  something for us to take action on.   If the Realtors have noticed this, I don't think it is asking too  much for a nominee for Secretary of Education to have noticed this. If,  in fact, she has noticed this, I don't think it is asking too much for  her to have thoughts and a plan, because we are well over $1 trillion  in debt for these kids. I think it is about $1.3 trillion now. It has  been a known problem for some time. Over and over again, Democrats have  tried to find and propose solutions here in the Senate. Over and over  again, we have been shot down. But it remains a very considerable  issue.   You would think that a new Secretary of Education coming in would  want to hit the ground running on this issue. She would have something  she wanted to get done to solve it. There would be a plan or an  outline. We may not agree with it, it may be something that we have to  work together to find a way to get it to the floor, but at least there  would be a starting point. All I got was, well, I would be interested  in your views on that issue. How is it possible that with over $1  trillion in student debt piled up, with the student debt problem so  severe that even Realtors have put it on their to-do list to get  something done about it, that a nominee for the Secretary of Education  has nothing? Pockets out. Nothing to get started on this problem. Is  she ever going to take an interest? I don't know.   But it would seem to me, particularly when you look at where we are  in the HELP Committee--our ranking member, Senator Murray, is here.  Senator Murray and Chairman Alexander helped lead us together through  the ESSA, the reform of No Child Left Behind, the Every Student  Succeeds Act. It passed roaring through the Senate. The House even  picked it up and took it. It came out of committee unanimously. States  are still working on implementation of it because it freed them up to  do a lot more things, and so they have to go through the process of  deciding how they are going to take advantage of its new freedoms. So  with respect to elementary and secondary education, we are actually in  pretty good shape. All we have to do is implement the bipartisan  popular law that we passed. So where is the attention going to be?  Well, what we have not passed is the Higher Education Reform Act.   So if you know at all that has been going on in education in the  Congress, which is not asking too much of a Secretary of Education  nominee, you know that we have just implemented a major reform of  elementary and secondary education, that our next order of business is  higher education, and that an elemental part of that is going to be  college debt.   So the fact that this nominee has nothing on that issue and is in the  traditional deer-in-the-headlights-nominee mode of, well, I look  forward to working with you on that Senator. Oh, yes, I understand that  is a serious problem, Senator, but actually I don't have any ideas; I  don't have any plans; I don't have any strategy; I have nothing. Let's  just work together on it. That is not very convincing to me.   I see the Senator from New Jersey here. The night is going on, so I  will yield the floor to him, but I will close by saying that this  recurring question about nominees who are involved in dark money  operations and then refuse to disclose anything about their dark money  operations so that it remains a black hole of secrecy and potential  conflict of interest is wrong. It is just wrong.   I know there are forces in this building that love the dark money,  and there are huge special interests behind the dark money. There are a  lot of people who benefit from the dark money who don't want any light  on it ever. But once a nominee has had their name put in for a Cabinet  position of the Government of the United States, by God, they ought to  disclose their dark money connections because otherwise it is an avenue  toward conflict of interest. Where there is conflict of interest, there  comes scandal. It is our job to head that off by getting the  information before the public so everybody can evaluate it, and we have  been knee-capped in that effort by an absolutely positive shutdown from  the other side of the aisle on any information about any dark money  from any nominee.   They don't have to be nominees. If they don't want to cough up their  dark money information, they can turn the papers back in and tell  President Trump: Find someone else. I would rather keep my secrets.   But you should not keep your secrets and get the job.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   January 27, 2017.      Elisabeth DeVos,      Trump-Pence Transition Team,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mrs. DeVos, Thank you for your response of January 17,       2017, to our January 5, 2017 letter requesting additional       information on your vast political fundraising and spending       network. Along with various responses and objections to our       request, you produced a series of already public campaign       finance reports related to the American Federation for       Children Action Fund, a 527 organization, and its various       state affiliates. For the reasons that follow, we view your       response as, while sizeable, non-responsive.        We requested you provide information about two 501(c)(4)       organizations with which you have been associated: the       American Federation for Children and the Great Lakes       Education Fund. You acknowledged your association with these       entities in your disclosures to the Office of Government       Ethics (OGE). You also acknowledged in your letter to us that       ``[e]ach organization with which [you] have been involved is       independent.'' It is not clear what you mean by       ``independent'' since you have already acknowledged your       association with these organizations. I hope you can       appreciate how both fundraising and spending of these       organizations (from whom? to whom? in what amounts? your       personal role?) might produce conflicts of interest in       potential decisions before you if you are confirmed to serve       as Secretary of the Department of Education.        Our concerns are not hypothetical as known contributors to       your political organizations have had business before       Department of Education. For example:        Vahan Gureghian: In 2010, Gureghian donated $100,000 to the       American Federation for Children Action Fund. Mr. Gureghian       founded and is the CEO of CSMI LLC, a Pennsylvania charter       school management company and helped found the Chester       Community Charter School. (he has been a major donor in       promoting charter schools in Pennsylvania.        J.C. Huizenga: Between 2005 and 2007, Huizenga donated       $25,000 to All Children Matter, and in 2010 he donated       $30,000 to the American Federation for Children Action Fund.       Mr. Huizenga founded the National Heritage Academies, a for-      profit charter network that has 80 schools in 9 states and       has received over $43 million in federal funding. According       to a 2012 review by the Michigan Department of Education, of       the schools in the ``focus'' category, due to significant       gaps in achievement, more than half were managed by National       Heritage Academies. It has been reported that Mr. Huizenga       said that his involvement with charter schools was due to       realizing that ``privatizing public education was not only       practical but also desperately needed.''        David L. Brennan: Brennan donated a total of $200,000 to       All Children Matter, from 2004  [[Page S736]]       to 2007, prior to AMC's wind down due to campaign finance       violations. In 2010, he donated $39,000 to the American       Federation for Children Action Fund. He is the founder of       White Hat Management LLC, a for-profit charter school       management company that operates 15 schools in three states       with over 12,000 students. Since 2008, White Hat and its       affiliates have received $3.6 million in federal funds       including IDEA funds.        While you may not have a direct financial interest in the       for-profit education enterprises headed by those listed       above, your political fundraising relationship with them, and       perhaps others, could cause a reasonable person concern over       your impartiality in matters involving them. The OGE process       does not, capture conflicts that arise through political       activity so it is incumbent upon us to assure the Senate       record is complete as to such conflicts and how they will be       resolved.        These are just the publicly known examples of potential       conflicts. Our original request asked you for information to       assess potential conflicts with 501(c)(4) organizations that       are not required to publicly disclose donor information.       Accordingly, we reiterate our request that you provide:        A list of all donors, their total donations, and       affiliations, who have contributed to the American Federation       for Children 501(c)(4) and the Great Lakes Education Fund       501(c)(4) since their inception.        A list of donations made by you, members of your family,       and foundations or organizations with which you are       affiliated, to other 501(c)(4) organizations over the past       five years.        According to the American Federation for Children's IRS       Form 990 filed for the year 2014, it spent nearly $1.1       million on political activities, including a $315,000       transfer to the American Federation for Children Action       Fund--Wisconsin IE Committee. Because donations to a       501(c)(4) are anonymous, they effectively launder the       identities of donors to the other parts of your political       apparatus. But you know, and the donors know, and therein       lies the potential for conflict of interest.        Additionally, you refused to disclose donations to       501(c)(4) organizations that you, your family, and your       foundation have made. You explained, ``[t]he information       requested has no bearing on the office to which I have been       nominated nor the duties of the Department of Education.''       Your donations to 501(c)(4) organizations are indeed relevant       to your nomination, just as your donations to political       candidates, parties, and causes are. One obvious instance       would be where groups to which you have made political       contributions are before the Department as advocates or grant       seekers. Again, you know, and the donors know, and therein       lies the potential for conflict of interest. Senators have a       Constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on       presidential nominees, and understanding the scope and nature       of potential conflicts of interest is at the heart of that       duty. Your role in raising and distributing ``dark money''       clearly raises the possibility of such conflicts. As a       result, we renew our request for information related to your       501(c)(4) organizations as outlined above.        Please contact us if you have any questions regarding this       request. We look forward to your additional information and       disclosures and timely and responsive answers.            Sincerely,      Sheldon Whitehouse.      Robert P. Casey, Jr.      Tammy Baldwin.      Bernard Sanders.      Al Franken.      Elizabeth Warren.    The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from New Jersey.    Mr. President, I have a question. I guess it is in  the nature of a parliamentary question, and that is, whether it would  be in order to ask unanimous consent that the letter from which Senator  Warren read be put into the Record as a confirmation that she was, in  fact, accurately reading from the letter, that it be added as an  exhibit in the Congressional Record.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The text of the letter is in the Record of the  Senate as the Senator was reading it in her testimony.    The text of the letter as she read it, but not the  complete letter.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may ask consent.    I ask unanimous consent that the complete letter from  which Senator Warren read be printed in the Congressional Record to  confirm that she has in fact read from it.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Mr. President, pursuing Senator Merkley's  hypothetical, if it came before the Senate that a Member of the Senate  who was a nominee seeking the advice and consent of the Senate to the  position was, for example, in fact, a horse thief, and we found the  fact that he was a horse thief to be relevant to whether or not he  should be confirmed, say, to the Department of Interior, which has  authority over lands, does the ruling of the Chair mean that it would  not be in order for the Senate or for Senators to consider what in my  hypothetical is the established fact that the Senator was a horse thief  as we debate his nomination here on the floor?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Once again, the answer is the same, that each  of these decisions will be made at the time and in the context in which  they occur, and the decision of the Chair is subject to a vote of the  Senate and an appeal.    I guess, Mr. President, what I don't understand is  that we have fairly significant responsibilities under the Constitution  to provide advice and consent. It appears that the ruling of the Chair  has just been that when a Member of this body is the subject of that  advice and consent, then derogatory information about that person is  not in order and is a violation of rule XIX on the Senate floor. And  with that being the ruling, I don't know how we go about doing our  duties. Are we supposed to simply blind ourselves to derogatory  information, discuss it privately in the cloak rooms, not bring it out  onto the floor of the U.S. Senate, this supposedly great debating  society that actually has a constitutional responsibility to discuss  both the advantages and the deficits of a particular nominee?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. In each case, it is the opinion of the  President, subject to the final vote by the Senate to support or not to  support the President's decision.    So the precedent going forward is that any Senator  who discusses derogatory information that is a matter of public record,  that may even include criminal behavior by a Senator who is a candidate  for Executive appointment that requires advice and consent, is at risk  of being sanctioned by this body by a simple partisan majority of this  body under rule XIX if they raise those issues on the floor?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not necessary for a point of order to be  raised under rule XIX, but if the point of order is raised, an opinion  will be made and it is subject to a vote of the Senate in the manner  previously described.    I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.    I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.    I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.    Madam President, the Attorney General of the United  States holds a vital and also somewhat unique position in the Federal  Government. The Attorney General of the United States is tasked with  [[Page S862]]  significant responsibilities that must be executed independently,  sometimes even in defiance of the White House's wishes and interests.   The Attorney General of the United States is tasked with enforcing  our laws fairly, justly, and evenhandedly, as well as with protecting  the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans of all  persuasions, of all backgrounds. The Attorney General of the United  States does not work for the President so much as for the people and  does not serve the administration so much as the law.   I have served in the U.S. Department of Justice. I have felt its  esprit de corps, its pride. That pride is founded on a firm sense of  the Department's willingness to stand on what is right, even against  the wishes of the White House. One fine example of this was Attorney  General Ashcroft challenging and refusing to accede to the wishes of  the White House on the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping of  Americans. The Department of Justice is well aware of the importance of  its independence.   A successful Attorney General must be stalwart in protecting the  Department from political meddling by the administration or by  Congress. We need only look back to Attorney General Gonzales's  resignation to recall how badly things turn out when an Attorney  General yields to political pressure.   An Attorney General also makes policy decisions about where and how  to direct the Department's $27 billion budget and when and how to  advise Congress to recommend new laws and modify existing policies.  These are policy choices an Attorney General makes. It is no answer to  questions about those policy choices to say: I will follow the law.  That doesn't apply in this arena of funding decisions and legislative  recommendations that are policy choices not dictated by law. Those  policy choices can have a profound effect on individuals, on  communities, and on the fabric of our Nations.   Americans should be able to trust that their Attorney General will  not only enforce the laws with integrity and impartiality but stand up  for Americans of all stripes and fight on behalf of their rights. That  is the prism through which I evaluate Senator Sessions' nomination.   I have known Senator Sessions for a decade and have enjoyed working  with him on a number of pieces of legislation. However, the standard by  which I evaluate an Attorney General nominee is whether Rhode Islanders  will trust that in the tough clinches, he will always be independent  and always fair.   I have reviewed Senator Sessions' career as an attorney and as a  Senator, as well as his testimony before the Judiciary Committee. I  have reflected on my own duties and experience as my State's attorney  general and as the U.S. attorney in Rhode Island. I have also served as  an attorney in our State attorney general's office.   By the way, the attorney general in Rhode Island has full prosecutive  authority. Many States have a division in which the attorney general  has a narrow ambit of authority and district attorneys do the bulk of  the criminal prosecution--not so in Rhode Island.   I have also had the occasion to listen closely to very strong and  honest, serious concerns from Rhode Islanders who have made it plain to  me that they fear what Senator Sessions would do as head of the Justice  Department. For every constituent of mine who has expressed support of  his nomination, 15 have expressed opposition.   Senator Sessions has fought against fixing our immigration system,  opposing as the leading opponent of bipartisan legislation which, had  it passed, would have spared us much of the current debate over walls       and immigration.   Senator Sessions fought against our bipartisan criminal justice and  sentencing reform bill.   Senator Sessions opposed reauthorizing the Violence Against Women  Act--a bill which is vitally important to the Rhode Island Department  of Attorney General and to the anti-domestic violence groups around  Rhode Island.   Senator Sessions' record on support of gay and lesbian Americans has  alarmed many Rhode Islanders. Public statements and confirmation  testimony by Senator Sessions suggest that he brings a religious  preference to the Department and that what he calls secular attorneys  would be, to him, suspect compared to Christian attorneys. That  distinction between a secular attorney and a religious attorney is one  that runs counter to very solid principles upon which my State was  founded. Roger Williams brought to us freedom of conscience.   Senator Sessions has called Breitbart News a bright spot. I must  disagree. Breitbart News is not, to me, a bright spot. Breitbart has  published baseless and inflammatory articles with titles like ``Birth  Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.''   In fairness, I should disclose that Senator Sessions' nomination  carries an additional burden with me as the nominee of this President  and this White House. The need for an independent Attorney General has  rarely, if ever, been greater.   On the campaign trail, the American people witnessed Donald Trump  glorify sexual misconduct, mock a disabled reporter, and make  disparaging remarks about immigrants and minorities. We all witnessed  chants at Trump rallies of ``lock her up.'' At his confirmation  hearings, Senator Sessions excused these as ``humorously done.'' In  mass rallies that also featured people getting beaten and the press  caged and vilified, this didn't seem very humorous to many Americans. I  think Americans know that the good guys in the movie are not the ones  in the mob; the good guy is the lawman who stands on the jailhouse  porch and sends the mob home. To me, that ``lock her up'' chant was un- American. I believe that across the country it made honest prosecutors'  stomachs turn.   Not surprisingly, many Americans are fearful of what the Trump  administration will mean for them, for their families, and for their  country.   The problems with this President did not end with the campaign.  President Trump and his family have brought more conflicts of interest  to the White House than all other modern Presidents and families  combined. The proposed Trump domestic Cabinet is an unprecedented swamp  of conflicts of interest, failures of disclosure and divestment, and  dark money secrets. We have not even been permitted, in the course of  our nomination advice-and-consent process, to explore the full depth of  that unprecedented swamp because the dark money operations of nominees  have been kept from us. In one case, thousands of emails are still  covered up. The Trump White House traffics in alternative facts,  operates vindictively, and is a haven for special interest influence.  None of this is good. All of this suggests that there will be more or  less constant occasion for investigation and even prosecution of this  administration.   Independence is at a premium. Nothing could have made this more clear  than the first disagreement between the Trump White House and the  Department of Justice, whose outcome was that the Acting Attorney  General--a woman with 30 years' experience in the Department, a career  prosecutor, former assistant U.S. attorney, former U.S. attorney, and  someone recognized for her leadership throughout the Department--was  summarily fired.    This is also not a good sign. In recent history, Attorneys General  Gonzales, Meese, and Mitchell were politically close to their  Presidents, and the Gonzales, Meese, and Mitchell tenures did not end  well.   Attorney General Mitchell worked for President Nixon. They met when  their New York law firms merged in the early 1970s, and they became law  partners. John Mitchell was the campaign manager for Nixon's 1968  Presidential campaign. There were signs that things weren't quite right  because when Nixon nominated Mitchell to be his Attorney General, he  appealed directly to FBI Director Hoover not to conduct the usual  background check. Mitchell ultimately resigned as Attorney General in  order to run President Nixon's reelection campaign. So the political  link between Mitchell and Nixon was very close, and sure enough,  scandal ensued. Attorney General Mitchell turned out to be a central  figure of the Watergate scandal. As the chairman of the reelection  committee, the famous CREEP, Mitchell was responsible for appointing G.  Gordon Liddy and approving the dirty tricks program while still  Attorney General.   That dirty tricks program ultimately included breaking into national  Democratic headquarters in the Watergate.  [[Page S863]]  The upshot of this was that Mitchell was charged with conspiracy,  obstruction of justice, and three counts of perjury. He was convicted  on all counts, and he served 19 months in prison.   Attorney General Edwin Meese was also very close to President Reagan.  Meese joined the 1980 Reagan Presidential campaign as Chief of Staff.  He ran the day-to-day campaign operations and was the senior issues  adviser. After the election, Edwin Meese was given the job of leading  the Reagan transition, and once in office, Reagan appointed Meese as  Counselor to the President. According to press accounts at the time,  Meese was known as someone who ``has known the President so long and so  well, he has become almost an alter ego of Ronald Reagan.'' That was  the political background between Meese and President Reagan.   Again, it did not end well. Meese came under scrutiny for his role in  the Iran-Contra scandal. The congressional committee that reported on  the Iran-Contra scandal in November 1987 determined that Meese had  failed to take appropriate steps to prevent members of the  administration from destroying critical evidence. An independent  counsel named Lawrence Walsh finished a report in 1993 that stated that  Meese had made a false statement when he said Reagan had not known  about the 1985 Iran-Contra deal. Iran-Contra was not the only  controversy that plagued Attorney General Meese. A company called  Wedtech Corporation was seeking Department of Defense contracts in the  early 1980s. The company hired Meese's former law school classmate and  his personal attorney, a lawyer named E. Robert Wallach, to lobby the  Reagan administration on its behalf. Attorney General Meese helped  Wedtech at Wallach's urging get a special hearing on a $32 million Army  engine contract, although the Army considered the company unqualified.  Well, the contract was awarded to Wedtech, and then one of Meese's top  deputies went to work for Wedtech.   The Federal criminal investigation that resulted led to the  conviction of E. Robert Wallach, the former law school classmate and  personal attorney of Meese, for whom he had set up the meetings with  the government.   Independent counsel James McKay investigated the Wedtech contract,  including investigating allegations of misconduct by Meese. While Meese  was never convicted, he resigned following the issuance of the  independent counsel's 800-page report.   Third is Attorney General Gonzales. Attorney General Gonzales was  close to then-Governor Bush in Texas. He was his general counsel. When  Governor Bush became President Bush, Gonzales came to Washington to  serve as White House Counsel. He was appointed Attorney General in  2005. During his tenure at the Department of Justice, there were  multiple investigations, many of which played out before the Senate  Judiciary Committee, involving the Warrantless Wiretapping Program, the  U.S. attorney's scandal, and inquiries into the Department's management  of the torture program legal opinions.   Ultimately, Members of both Houses of Congress called for Attorney  General Gonzales's resignation--or demanded that he be fired by the  President--and Attorney General Gonzales resigned.   There is a track record here of Attorneys General who are politically  close to a President coming into harm's way and doing poorly in the  Department. One particular office that is vulnerable to this kind of  undue proximity, and failure of independence, is a body in the  Department of Justice called the Office of Legal Counsel. Jack  Goldsmith, a former head of the Office of Legal Counsel--and a  Republican, by the way--testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee  that ``more than any other institution inside the executive branch, OLC  is supposed to provide detached, apolitical legal advice.'' And it has  an honorable tradition of providing such advice to a remarkable degree,  but under the Bush administration, the OLC departed from that  tradition. It came up in a number of ways. The first was during our  investigation into President Bush's Warrantless Wiretapping Program.   When Office of Legal Counsel memos supporting the program came to  light, I plowed through a fat stack of those classified opinions that  were held in secret over at the White House and pressed to have some of  the statements declassified. Here are some of the statements that were  declassified found in those OLC opinions:         An Executive order cannot limit a President. There is no       constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new       Executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms       of a previous Executive order.    So this means a President could issue an Executive order, have it  published in the Federal Register, put it forward as the policy of the  administration--a direction to all the attorneys in the  administration--and then secretly depart from it without ever changing  what the public is told about the policy. A theory like this allows the  Federal Register, where these Executive orders are assembled, to become  a screen of falsehood, behind which illegal programs can operate in  violation of the very Executive order that purports to control the  executive branch. That was just one.   Another one I will quote: ``The President exercising his  constitutional authority under Article II, can determine whether an  action is a lawful exercise of the President's authority under Article  II.''   If that sounds a little bit like pulling yourself up by your own  bootstraps, well, it sounds that way to me, too, and it runs contrary  to a fairly basic constitutional principle announced in the famous case  of Marbury v. Madison--which every law student knows--which says: ``It  is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the  law is.''   A third example--and this is another quote from an OLC opinion: ``The  Department of Justice is bound by the President's legal [opinions.]''   Well, if that is true, what is the point of a President sending  matters over to the Department of Justice for legal review? If the  President did it, and it is therefore automatically legal, there would  be no function to the Department of Justice accomplishing that legal  review.   So in this area of warrantless wiretapping, the Office of Legal  Counsel within the Department of Justice came up with what seemed to be  quite remarkable theories in the privacy and secrecy of that office, in  those classified opinions that are really hard to justify in the broad  light of day. That is why independence matters so much. Obviously, the  White House wanted those opinions to say what they said, but in the  clear light of day, they don't hold up.   Let us move on from the warrantless wiretapping opinions of the Bush  Department of Justice to the OLC opinions that the Bush administration  used to authorize waterboarding of detainees. Again, I was one of the  first Senators to review the OLC opinions, and when I read them, I will  say I was quite surprised. I was surprised not just by what they said  but by what they didn't say. One thing that was entirely omitted was  the history of waterboarding. Waterboarding was used by the Spanish  Inquisition, by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, by the French-suppressing  revolts in Algeria, by the Japanese in World War II, and by military  dictatorships in Latin America. The technique, as we know, ordinarily  involves strapping a captive in a reclining position, heels overhead,  putting a cloth over his face, and pouring water over the cloth to  create the impression of drowning. Senator John McCain, held captive  for more than 5 years by the North Vietnamese, said this of  waterboarding:         It is not a complicated procedure. It is torture.    American prosecutors and American judges in military tribunals after  World War II prosecuted Japanese soldiers for war crimes for torture on  the evidence of their waterboarding American prisoners of war. None of  that history appeared in the Office of Legal Counsel opinion.   The other major thing the Office of Legal Counsel overlooked was a  case involving a Texas sheriff who was prosecuted as a criminal for  waterboarding prisoners in 1984. Let's start with the fact that this  was a case that was brought by the Department of Justice. It was the  U.S. attorney for that district who prosecuted the sheriff. The  Department of Justice won the case at trial.   The case went up on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth  Circuit, the court one level below the U.S. Supreme Court. In its  appellate decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  [[Page S864]]  Fifth Circuit described the technique as ``water torture.''   All a legal researcher had to do was to type the words ``water'' and  ``torture'' into the legal search engines Lexis or Westlaw, and this  case would come up: United States v. Lee. You can find it at 744 F2d  1124.   Over and over in that published appellate opinion by the second  highest level of court in the Federal judiciary, they described the  technique as torture. Yet the Office of Legal Counsel never mentioned  this case in their decision.   Ordinarily, what a proper lawyer is supposed to do, if they find  adverse precedent--i.e., decisions that appear to come down a different  way than the argument the lawyer is making--is they report the decision  to the court, and then they try to distinguish it, they try to convince  the judge they are before why that case was either wrongly decided or  does not apply on the facts of their case. But the Office of Legal  Counsel did not offer any effort to distinguish the Fifth Circuit  decision; it simply pretended it did not exist or it never found it. It  is hard to know which is worse.   At sentencing in the Lee case, the district judge admonished the  former sheriff who had been found guilty of waterboarding: ``The  operation down there would embarrass the dictator of a country.''   Well, it is also pretty embarrassing when what is supposed to be the  institution inside the executive branch that is supposed to provide  detached, apolitical legal advice in an honorable tradition of  providing such advice, to a remarkable degree, to quote Professor  Goldsmith, misses a case so clearly on point.   That was not the only OLC error. In addition to the warrantless  wiretapping statements, in addition to the Office of Legal Counsel  opinions on waterboarding, they undertook a review of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act.   In the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is something called an  exclusivity provision. It says this: The Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act ``shall be the exclusive means by which electronic  surveillance and the interception of domestic wire, oral and electronic  communications may be conducted.'' Shall be the exclusive means. Seems  pretty clear. But the Office of Legal Counsel said about that  language--I quote them here: Unless Congress made a clear statement in  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that it sought to restrict  Presidential authority to conduct wireless searches in the national  security area, which it has not, then the statute must be construed to  avoid such a reading--which it has not.   Congress said that this shall be the exclusive means. If the OLC was  not happy reading the language of the statute, they could go to a court  where this language had already been construed. The decision was called  United States v. Andonian, and the judge in that case ruled that this  language, the exclusivity clause--I am quoting the court's decision-- ``reveals that Congress intended to sew up the perceived loopholes  through which the President had been able to avoid the warrant  requirement.''   The exclusivity clause makes it impossible for the President to opt  out of the legislative scheme by retreating to his inherent executive  sovereignty over foreign affairs. The exclusivity clause assures that  the President cannot avoid Congress's limitations by resorting to  inherent powers.   In the face of that case law, the Office of Legal Counsel held that  Congress had not said what it said and this was not exclusive language,  even though a court had said so.   The reason I share those three stories is because it really matters  in important issues when the Department of Justice has the capability  and the courage to stand up to the President. It really matters when  they get it wrong. It really matters when they say things that simply  are not correct or legally sound in order to support a warrantless  wiretapping program. It really matters when they don't find the case on  point to evaluate whether waterboarding is torture. It really matters  when they go around a clear congressional statute which a judge has  said closes the door to going around that statute by simply saying  privately: Well, that door is not actually closed. It matters.    I have insufficient confidence that as Attorney General, Senator  Sessions will be able to stand up to the kind of pressure we can expect  this White House to bring. We know that this White House operates  vindictively and likes to push people around.   We found out recently that Mr. Bannon went running over to see  General Kelly to tell him to undo the green card waiver of the Muslim  ban. Thankfully General Kelly refused and stuck by his duty. But this  is the kind of White House we have, where they try to push people  around to do the wrong thing.   They are so contemptuous of authority outside their own that they are  willing to attack a Federal judge who disagrees with them, calling him  a ``so-called judge.'' They are willing to fire an Acting Attorney  General who disagrees with them, firing her summarily and accusing her  of betrayal. The pressure this White House can be expected to bring on  the Department of Justice to conform itself not to the law but to the  political demands of the President is going to be intense.   Moreover, the conflicts of interest that crawl through this White  House and that crawl over this swamp Cabinet offer every reasonable  cause to believe that there will have to be investigations and  prosecutions into this administration.   That combination of a target-rich environment in this administration  for investigation and prosecution with a vindictive White House that  does not hesitate to try to bully officials into conformity calls for  the highest degree of independence. I do not feel Senator Sessions  makes that standard. He was too close to the President during the  political race. He has not stood up against any of those excesses I  have mentioned since then. It is with regret that I must say I will not  be able to vote to confirm him.   One of the reasons I became a lawyer was because of ``To Kill a  Mocking Bird.'' As a kid, I just loved Atticus Finch. He is great in  the movie. He is even better in the book. Some of the things that  Atticus Finch says about the law and about human nature are so brave  and so profound that from the first time I read that book, boy, I would  love to have been Atticus Finch. I would love to have had the chance to  stand in the breach when everyone was against you and stick up for  doing something that was right. Gosh, that felt so great.   Like the scene in many movies, the hero is not a part of the mob, not  carrying a torch toward the jailhouse; the hero is the lonely lawman  who sits on the porch and won't let the mob in. That is what I think we  are going to need in our next Attorney General.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Oregon.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, may I ask the Senator, through the  Chair, if the letter from which he just read has a date?    1986. And is the Senator aware of the occasion that  brought this letter to the Senate?    What was that occasion?    And this letter was made a matter of record in that  hearing?    But clearly the content of this letter has been a  matter known to the Senate and, depending on what the facts may show,  may actually have been a record of the Senate for more than 30 years.    So a Senator of the United States has been accused of  violating a rule of the Senate for restating to the Senate a phrase  that has been a matter of record in the Senate--if, indeed, that is the  case--for 30 years.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
