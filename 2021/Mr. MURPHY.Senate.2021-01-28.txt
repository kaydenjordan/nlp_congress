 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this is a screen shot from a video taken  during a school field trip on August 9, 2018. These are Yemeni  schoolchildren going to school in a northern governorate inside the  country, and they are on their way either to or back from a picnic that  they were having with their classmates.   As you can see, they are schoolchildren of elementary age--around 8,  9, 10 years old. They don't look any different than what school  children here in the United States would look like on their way to a  fun-filled school field trip. There is a little boy catching a little  nap somehow amidst all of the den of the rest of his classmates so  excited.   They are excited because there isn't and there wasn't a lot of fun to  be had for schoolchildren in Yemen today or in 2018. A civil war still  plagues that country and plagues Yemeni children who are too often  facing starvation and disease, but on this day, there was fun to be  had.   This is that schoolbus hours later. Forty children died when a U.S.- made bomb dropped from the sky and hit this schoolbus. Not every child  on that bus died, miraculously, but 40 children on the bus and around  the bus did. It was a war crime.   The Saudis, in the aftermath of the incident, defended it saying that  it was a legal action. They were targeting enemy leaders who were  responsible for recruiting and training young children.   They hit a schoolbus in the middle of the day, right next to a  crowded marketplace. It wasn't on a lonely road. It was in a crowded  area. It is why not only people on the bus died, but children and  families surrounding the bus died as well.   This was a military strike done, in part, as part of a coalition  campaign of which the United States is a member. It is not just that we  sold the bomb that hit this bus. We participated and still do  participate in this military campaign in a myriad of ways   For years, we flew planes in the sky that put fuel into the Saudi and  Emirati jets that dropped these bombs. We embedded U.S. personnel in  the operations center that planned these bombing campaigns, and maybe,  most importantly of all, we lent moral authority to the Saudi-led  campaign inside Yemen.   But over the course of our time as a coalition partner with Saudi  Arabia, the war in Yemen has been a national security apocalypse for  the United States. Our bombs and our planes have been used to kill  thousands of civilians; 17,000 civilians have died inside Yemen since  the beginning of this war.   The war has caused the world's worst humanitarian catastrophe on the  ground inside Yemen. Over 100,000 children have died of starvation and  disease. Yemen, since 2015, has been the site of the world's worst  cholera outbreak anywhere in the world during all of our lifetimes-- likely caused by the targeting of water treatment facilities by the  coalition, of which the United States is a member.   And inside this country, Yemenis rightfully blame the United States  for this cataclysm. They know that it is our equipment, they know that  it is our bombs, and they know that it is that moral authority that the  United States gives to this war through our decision to continue to  take part in it, human rights crime after human rights crime.   It has radicalized a generation of Yemenis against the United States.  It has made us part and parcel of repeated human rights violations, and  it has created a chaotic environment on the ground in Yemen that has  allowed for AQAP, the wing of al-Qaida with the clearest designs to hit  the United States, again, room to govern and room to grow. AQAP and  ISIS are able to operate and control territory inside Yemen because of  the chaos created by this civil war.   Iran has grown stronger. At the beginning, Iran and the Houthis, who  are on the other side of this civil war, had a slightly tenuous  connection, but as the war has dragged on, the Houthis have had to  become more and more reliant on Iranian assistance and Iranian  expertise. Iran has grown stronger and stronger inside Yemen and inside  the region as this war persists. In every way, it has been a nightmare,  from a security perspective, for the United States.   But with the election and inauguration of President Biden, our  participation in this national security cataclysm is coming to an end.  I come to the floor today to thank the Biden administration and to  thank the incoming Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, for their  recognition that it is no longer in our security interest to be a part  of this.   The Biden administration has made several very important decisions  that they have announced at the outset of their term in office: one,  the plan to withdraw from the military coalition; second, a decision to  suspend arm sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who are the primary  participants in this coalition. UAE has dramatically scaled back their  involvement--to their credit. The Saudis continue to fight this war on  the ground and in the air.   And lastly--and, perhaps, most immediately importantly--the Trump  administration announced that they were reserving an eleventh-hour  decision by the Trump administration naming the Houthis a terrorist  group.   Now, the Houthis are incredibly bad actors. The Houthis are also  guilty of war crimes in and around this conflict. They recruit child  soldiers. They deliberately hold up aid and don't allow it to get to  the citizens in areas under which they control. The Houthis have a lot  to answer for as well. But by naming them a terrorist group, what the  Trump administration effectively did was to stop the international aid  community from being able to deliver any aid into Yemen because the  Houthis control some of the most important ports, and 80 percent of the  aid is commercial food. That would have all stopped if you couldn't run  aid through ports controlled by an organization named at the eleventh  hour by the Trump administration as a terrorist organization.   The Biden administration has made a decision to suspend that  designation to make sure that we are not going to end up with millions  of people starving inside Yemen because the United States makes the  decision to eliminate the ability of humanitarian groups to get food on  the ground in Yemen. They are all incredibly important decisions that  the administration has made--decisions supported by a majority of this  body.   We have voted here in the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, to end the  U.S. participation in the war in Yemen. We didn't have a veto-proof  majority. So we couldn't overcome the President's veto. But there is a  bipartisan coalition that believes the United States  [[Page S190]]  shouldn't have anything to do with this, and President Biden is now  effectuating that bipartisan consensus in policy.   Lastly, let me say this. Saudi Arabia is an important security  partner for the United States. The UAE is an important security partner  for the United States. We have an important counterterrorism  relationship. The Saudis and the Emirates have been part of this  groundbreaking detente with Israel, resulting in several recognition  agreements. That is great for U.S. security interests in the region.  But it is time for us to reset those relationships to make clear that  if our Gulf partners are going to participate in actions inside the  region that are terrible for our security interests, then we can't join  them in those actions--a reset that includes an expectation that the  Saudis and the Emirates address what is a very disturbing downward  trend in the ability of individuals inside those countries to have  political space with which to contest grievances with the regimes.    It is time for us to make sure that our relationships with our Gulf  allies are always consistent with U.S. national security endeavors, and  the Biden administration is off to a very good start in resetting those  relationships by pulling ourselves out of a war inside Yemen that has  killed 17,000 civilians, caused 100,000 kids to die of starvation and  disease, and ends up with our bombs doing this to a school bus full of  8-, 9-, and 10-year-olds.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
