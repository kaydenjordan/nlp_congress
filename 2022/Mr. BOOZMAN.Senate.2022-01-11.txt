 Mr. President, I have had the privilege of serving  Arkansans in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives in both  the majority and minority. So I know how unmistakably important it is  to protect the rights of the minority in the interest of individual  States--especially those like Arkansas that are more rural and less  populated.   That is what our country's Founders had in mind when they designed  the  [[Page S138]]  Senate. The Senate is sometimes referred to as ``the world's greatest  deliberative body''--the key word being ``deliberative.''   It is not crafted to quickly approve or reject legislation passed by  the House as a mere formality. Instead, it offers equal representation  to each State and a procedural process that incentivizes and rewards  consensus.   Allowing individual Senators to secure and, just as importantly, stop  dramatic policy changes is what sets this body apart. The filibuster  provides each of us leverage that must be preserved.   Unfortunately, many of our colleagues on the other side have  succumbed to shortsighted political calculations and are endorsing  changing the Senate's rules in order to jam through their legislative  priorities.   However, the ability to prevent radical, swift, and far-reaching  changes that would surely sow confusion and uncertainty is invaluable.  As such, I intend to continue protecting the filibuster.   Our Democratic friends, with some exceptions, are now abandoning  their previous support for the filibuster, which, while in the  minority, they argued was indispensable and utilized with zeal to great  effect.   Even President Biden, who enjoyed a long career in the Senate and  exercised his right to stop or hamper legislation and nominees he had  concerns with, has decided his decades-long embrace of the filibuster  is no match for the loudest voices in his party demanding to discard  it.   The justifications all point in one direction: keeping power.   Today, the Biden administration and Senate Democrats believe a  supposed threat to our democracy requires abandoning the minority  party's ability to pump the brakes on the excesses of one-party control  in Washington.   Worse, the grave threat to the fabric of our society and experiment  in self-government they are touting amounts to nothing more than duly  elected State legislatures reining in some of the most overly  accommodating voting policies that were enacted during the COVID-19  pandemic: things like reasonable limits on absentee voting, commonsense  registration rules, and practical deadlines.   Instead, they want to bring the full weight of the Federal Government  down on States like Arkansas that have sought to protect election  integrity by instituting voter ID, blocking ballot harvesting, or  ensuring the accuracy of voter rolls.   These commonsense safeguards are not an existential threat to our  Nation, nor do they warrant breaking the Senate and being  unconstitutionally superseded.   It is concerning that most Members of the majority are now singing  quite a different tune when it comes to tinkering with longstanding  rules of the Senate to achieve partisan ends.   I think it is important to applaud our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle who remain committed to protecting the filibuster and, by  extension, the very integrity of this institution. They have come under  intense pressure. Yet I recognize and they recognize how important this  tool is, the harm that would come from abandoning or undermining it,  and that majorities in the Senate do not last forever.   Should the Senate go down this path, it would result in exceedingly  scorched Earth, where consensus is even harder to find and shifting  majorities implement drastic policy transformations when a President is  willing to rubberstamp whatever Congress approves.   I have opposed this ill-advised tactic in the face of opposition from  my own side of the aisle in the past and understand it is not always an  easy thing to do.   My colleagues and I will not acquiesce on this question, and I hope  the Senate can move on, in a bipartisan way, to addressing the  challenges that our country is facing and finding solutions that  actually help Americans facing real-world problems instead of spending  any more time on partisan threats that upend this body's traditions  that would ultimately diminish its unique and necessary place within a  government that is truly the envy of the world.   With that, I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to commend Mark  Bennett, who is retiring as chief of the water development division of  the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission after a 34-year career  creating and preserving access to water in our State.   Through his work, Mark has helped provide clean, safe, and reliable  water to countless Arkansans and has been instrumental in the  conservation of our State's land and water resources. Thanks to Mark's  dedication and commitment to the people of Arkansas, he has ensured  that future generations will be able to enjoy the beautiful land and  wildlife the Natural State is known for.   Mark is a true Arkansas success story. Raised near Lake Village and a  graduate of Lakeside High School, Mark earned a bachelor's degree in  both agricultural economics and banking and finance from Mississippi  State University. He continued his education at the University of  Arkansas at Little Rock William H. Bowen School of Law  [[Page S158]]  and the University of Arkansas School of Law, where he earned a master  of laws degree in agricultural law.   Mark served the people of Arkansas as general counsel for the  Arkansas Natural Resources Commission for nearly 20 years. He continued  his public service as the chief of water development with the natural  resources division of the department of agriculture. In this role, Mark  oversaw a variety of crucial infrastructure programs including the  Arkansas Clean Water Revolving Loan Program, the Arkansas Drinking  Water Revolving Loan Program, the Arkansas Water Development Fund, and  the Arkansas Water, Sewer and Solid Waste Fund to assist Arkansans with  water, wastewater, and solid waste projects. Mark has also served as  the state cochair and member of the EPA--State SRF working group and is  a former board member and past president of the Council of  Infrastructure Financing Authorities board of directors.   I am grateful for Mark's experience and expertise. His guidance was  instrumental in crafting Federal legislation to modernize investment in  water infrastructure. The Securing Required Funding for Water  Infrastructure Now, or SRF WIN, Act was signed into law in 2018 and is  improving access to clean water in Arkansas and across the country.  Mark's knowledge in this field was invaluable as my staff and I  developed this legislation.   Generations of Arkansans will continue to benefit from Mark's  extraordinary efforts to provide quality water infrastructure and  further conservation efforts in our State. His dedication to improving  the lives of his fellow Arkansans is an inspiration, and I wish him the  best of luck in retirement.                            ____________________
