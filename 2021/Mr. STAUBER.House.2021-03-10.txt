 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today a retired law  enforcement officer and the victim of two violent gun crimes.   While off duty, a repeat offender shot me through my car window while  I was with my wife, Jodi. While on duty, another violent criminal  pointed his gun at me and pulled the trigger. By the grace of God, his  gun malfunctioned. Mr. Speaker, I was fighting for my life. I am lucky  to be here today to speak to this body.   Criminals who are willing to take someone's life don't care about the  gun legislation we debate in Congress. And the bills we are debating  this week would not have prevented those two criminals from attempting  to take my life.   So let's talk about who is going to be impacted by these bills. The  law-abiding citizens who are looking to protect themselves, their  families, and their communities from death or great bodily harm. They  will be the ones who are penalized for and prevented from exercising  their Second Amendment rights.   Defending my constituents' constitutional rights will be something I  do until my very last day in office, and I implore my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
