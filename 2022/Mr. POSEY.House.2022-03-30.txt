 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the most competent,  respected, and effective advocate for children and families that I have  ever known, someone who has made a difference in the lives of countless  Space Coast families, Irene Burnett.   When the space center was developed in the early 1960s, there were  almost no social services, so Irene was brought in to lead the Human  Planning Council.   Irene devoted herself to serving the health, mental health, and  social needs of our communities, establishing circles of care, the  first dental clinic, and the first legal aid society.   Irene's philosophy was: ``We don't work with blind or disabled, we  work with people,'' always stressing the importance of not only helping  individuals but families as well.   Irene exemplifies servant heart leadership. Thus, I ask my colleagues  to join me in saluting Irene Burnett's lifetime of service.                            ____________________
