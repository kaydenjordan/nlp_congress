 Will the Senator yield?    Reserving the right to object, now that I have the floor,  will the Senator from Hawaii answer a question?   Do you agree with this administration's policy to denying MiGs to the  Ukrainians?    Well, the Senator doesn't want to answer any questions. I  see. He denied my request to ask a question a moment ago.    I object.    Mr. President, thank you for finally giving me an option  to speak. It is interesting, the Senator will come to the floor but  doesn't want to engage in a colloquy or answer questions.   Let's talk a little bit about the policy--disastrous policy--that he  is supporting. This is the White House's latest talking points that  their failure in Ukraine is now due to some logistics problem and the  Department of Defense--they, of course, can't be responsible for what  they are doing, just like they are not responsible for anything. They  are not responsible for what happened in Afghanistan--their policy.  They are not responsible for what has happened in Ukraine--their  policy.   Let's talk about their policy in Ukraine.    So what has President Zelenskyy been asking for for  weeks, indeed, months on end? He said: ``Send us planes.''   What has this administration done? No. Actually, first they said yes,  then they said maybe, then they said no.   Today, the Secretary of Defense testified before the Armed Services  Committee, under oath, that even though this Congress has appropriated  $3 billion in military lethal aid to the people of Ukraine, the Defense  Department has so far given them less than one-third of it. Why,  because of logistics? No. He was asked that. No, because of policy. His  comment was: We are giving them what we think they need.   I would just point out that that is not what the Ukrainians think. If  you listen to President Zelenskyy, if you listen to the Ukrainian  parliamentarians who have been here, if you talked to them, what they  will say is they need more military aid; they need more help.   This administration won't give it to them, not because of logistics  but because of policy. We don't have a logistics problem; we have a Joe  Biden problem, and we have had that problem in Ukraine from day one.   This administration's policy was to deter a Russian invasion of  Ukraine. It failed. Why did it fail? It is not hard to see. President  Biden came to office, what did he do?    When Ukraine asked for military assistance, he denied it.   Can we have order?    When Joe Biden came to office, the people of Ukraine  asked for military assistance a year ago--a year ago. Did he give it to  them? No. He denied them military stance. He denied them lethal aid.  What did he do, though, for Vladimir Putin? When he came to office, he  green-lighted Vladimir Putin's pipeline. He turned their pipelines on.  He turned our pipelines off. What did he do with American energy  production? He throttled it down. He turned it off.   His first actions in office were to, among other things, cancel the  Keystone Pipeline, halt the leasing program in ANWR, issue a halt to  new oil and gas leases and drilling permits on Federal lands, impose  tougher regulations on oil and gas and methane emissions, and a host of  new regulations on other energy production.   And that had the desired effect. Russian energy production--up.  Russian revenues--up. What has happened since then, since the invasion  of Ukraine? It has been one gaffe after another. He won't send them  planes.   Today, the Secretary of Defense also confirmed that this  administration has, in fact, not been sharing intelligence with the  Ukrainians. In fact, today the Secretary of Defense had to admit that  the administration was going to be forced to change policy--his words-- change policy in Ukraine because of the fact we had not been sharing  all the intelligence we might have with Ukrainian soldiers and the  Ukrainian military despite their request for that. Whose decision was  that? Joe Biden's. It is his policy.   The President hasn't been entirely silent. He did have this to say:         For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power.    Now Joe Biden doesn't appear to know whether we are fighting or  struggling to help the Ukrainians defend themselves or whether we are  launching a war of regime change in Russia, itself.   You know, the bottom line is this: On one issue after another, when  it comes to Ukraine, this President has been wrong. On every aspect of  policy that has mattered, he has been wrong. Is it any wonder the  Ukrainians are saying: Change policies, share your intelligence, send  us the aid that we have requested.   I say again, we don't have a logistics problem. The White House  shouldn't point fingers and shift the blame. We have a Joe Biden  problem. That is the nub of the issue here.    There was Joe Biden's comment sounding like we are going to send  ground troops:         You're going to see when you go there--    He said to servicemembers.         And you . . . some of you have been there. You're going to       see--you're going to see women, young people standing . . .       in front of a damn tank, just saying, ``I'm not leaving. I'm       holding my ground.''    The President--it is one gaffe after another. It is one switch in  policy after another. It is disaster from beginning to end. And let's  not forget where these foreign policy disasters really kicked off in a  big way. Yeah, I was in Afghanistan. Am I concerned about Afghanistan?  You are darn right I am. Thirteen servicemembers were killed at Abbey  Gate, including one from my home State. I will never forget talking to  his father as soon as we learned of the attack--before, in fact, the  official notice of his son's death had been released. His father asked  me to do everything in my power to hold this administration  accountable, and that is exactly what I am going to do.   Has anyone been held accountable yet for Afghanistan? Has somebody  been fired? Has somebody been relieved of command? No. Has somebody  been shown the door? No. Has there been a change in policy at the  Department of Defense? No.   We just stumble from one crisis to another. Why? Because we have a  Joe Biden problem. This administration is doing exactly what their  Commander in Chief wants them to do and it is wrong, again and again  and again and again.   Until we see some change in policy from this administration, until  this Senate gets serious about its oversight responsibilities at the  Department of Defense, I am going to ask that for senior defense  leaders, we at least observe regular order. I can't block a nomination.  I can't halt it, but I can ask that regular order be followed. That is  exactly what I am going to ask with regard to this nomination and other  senior leaders until there is accountability, until we have a change in  policy, and until this administration admits that on issue after issue,  in virtually every aspect of its foreign policy, it is just dead wrong.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted no on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 863, Erik  Kristopher Raven, of the District of Columbia, to be Under Secretary of  the Navy.                            ____________________
