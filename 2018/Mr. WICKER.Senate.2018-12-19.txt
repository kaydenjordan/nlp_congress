 My friend from Nebraska, Senator Sasse, tells me he has  remarks that will take approximately 2 minutes. I have remarks that  will follow that will take somewhat longer than 2 minutes.   I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sasse be allowed to speak before  me and that I might speak afterward for such time as I will consume.    Mr. President, yesterday the Government of Guatemala took  a decisive step toward regaining sovereignty. Guatemala revoked the  visas of and deported 11 U.N. personnel working for the International  Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, better known by its Spanish  acronym CICIG.   Chartered in 2006 to help the Guatemalan state fight corruption,  CICIG morphed into a modern-day United Nations proconsul, selectively  administering justice and abusing power in ways never intended.   Voices on the political left, both here and overseas, will no doubt  decry the decision by the duly constituted Government of Guatemala. I  take the floor of the Senate this afternoon to state plainly my  emphatic approval of this action by our Guatemalan friends.   Prior to yesterday's action, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales had  previously announced that CICIG's mandate would not be renewed after  September 3 of next year. The President's decision marks a logical and  welcome step toward ending CICIG's presence in Guatemala. Ultimately,  an independent country has the right to decide if, and under what  terms, a supranational institution can administer justice within its  borders. CICIG was never meant to be permanent, and no country could  accept an unending infringement on its sovereignty. Certainly, we in  the United States would never consent to having an international body-- accountable to no one--run our judicial system. Our Guatemalan friends  have determined it is time for CICIG to leave, and they have a right as  a sovereign nation to make that decision.   The initial reasons behind CICIG's presence in Guatemala cannot be  disputed. Like many Latin American countries, Guatemala had suffered  from pervasive corruption, and its government was in ruins from a  decades-long civil war. Criminal enterprises colluded with politicians,  military officers, and other government officials to bribe, cheat, and  steal. Mafias, with deep tentacles into the state, acted with such  impunity that Guatemala felt compelled to ask for outside help. In  2006, Guatemala and the United Nations signed an agreement meant to  ``support, strengthen, and assist'' Guatemalan institutions responsible  for investigating crimes committed by so-called ``illegal security  groups'' and ``clandestine security organizations.'' Although CICIG  enjoys complete functional independence, the agreement stated that  CICIG must discharge its mandate in ``accordance with Guatemalan law  and the provisions of the Constitution.'' Regrettably, this provision  has not been followed.   Despite noble goals, it has become apparent that CICIG is not being  held accountable to either Guatemalan law or the United Nations. As the  largest financial contributor to the United Nations, the United States  has an interest in investigating the credible allegations that CICIG  was grossly overstepping its mandate. After all, the American taxpayers  were largely financing this enterprise.   The questionable practices of CICIG and its unelected leader have  been reported in our national papers. The Wall Street Journal's Mary  Anastasia O'Grady has been a close observer of Colombian jurist Ivan  Velasquez, who serves as CICIG's Commissioner. Ms. O'Grady states:         Under his leadership, there is strong evidence that CICIG       routinely flouts the rule of law and tramples civil liberties       in violation of the Guatemalan constitution. His methods       can't be supported by a republic that pledges allegiance to       transparency and human rights.    Powerful institutions have a tendency to amass more powers to  themselves and stretch their authority far beyond their legal mandates.  Even its most strident supporters have acknowledged that CICIG now  essentially answers to no one and needs to be reformed. Nowhere is this  contention better supported than the CICIG-backed persecution of the  Bitkov family on behalf of the Russian Government. For all its flaws,  which are numerous, CICIG's decision to conspire with Russia is the  most outrageous.    Igor and Irina Bitkov built a successful paper mill company, the  Northwest Timber Company, in Russia's Kaliningrad enclave. This rare  example of successful private enterprise in Russia was once valued at  nearly half a billion dollars, but success comes with a price in  Putin's Russia.   In 2005, a senior officer of the state-owned Sberbank demanded that  the Bitkovs sell him a controlling stake in their company. Imagine. It  is an offer the Bitkovs refused. Two years later, the Bitkovs' 16-year- old daughter, Anastasia, was kidnapped, drugged, raped, and held until  the Bitkov family paid a ransom.   In April 2008, three Russian state banks--the VTB, Sberbank, and  Gazprombank--forced the Bitkovs' company into bankruptcy by calling in  the immediate repayment of nearly $160 million in loans. Traumatized  and threatened with detention and death, the Bitkovs decided to flee  Russia. More death threats followed as Moscow opened a criminal case in  2009.   The Bitkovs eventually immigrated to Guatemala in 2009 after paying a  legitimate law firm for Guatemalan passports with new identities for  their protection. The Bitkovs settled into a new life that was  blessedly free from Russian harassment and intimidation. Igor and Irina  began teaching at a local school. Anastasia began to heal from her  ordeal. A son, Vladimir, was born in 2012.   The reprieve was short-lived. VTB, one of the Russian banks,  collaborated in 2015 with CICIG and the Guatemalan Attorney General to  arrest the Bitkovs for passport violations. Detained in appalling  conditions, Anastasia was denied medication and had a nervous  breakdown. Three-year-old Vladimir was sent to an orphanage for 42 days  without having contact with his parents or appointed guardians.  Eventually freed by a court order and with an upper respiratory  infection, conjunctivitis in both eyes, and clear physical and  psychological abuse, Vladimir returned to his family. This is modern- day CICIG in Guatemala.   Under the direction of CICIG, the Bitkovs were sent to trial in  February of 2017. The Guatemalan Court of Appeals, however, enjoined  the Bitkovs' prosecution and stated that the family was not criminally  liable for passport violations. Despite this injunction, a lower court,  at the behest of CICIG, went ahead with the case and eventually  sentenced Igor Bitkov to 19 years and Irina and Anastasia to 14 years  in prison. Let me repeat--19 years and 14 years for passport  violations. They were passports that they believed to be legitimate  based on legal advice they had been given. These were infractions that  are usually settled with a fine at worst, but this was all in  collaboration with CICIG and the Russian accusers.   Following more convoluted legal wrangling, Igor Bitkov was released  on house arrest in May, but, inexplicably, Irina and Anastasia remained  in jail--more injunctions, more appeals, more tortuous legal  proceedings. Irina and Anastasia were finally released on bail in mid- June. This is CICIG in Guatemala. Pushed by CICIG, the Constitutional  Court, which is the highest court in Guatemala, ordered a retrial for  the Bitkovs. It began last week and supposedly continues.   American taxpayers who are footing the bill for CICIG have a right to  ask Commissioner Velasquez and his CICIG team: Is this the way to fight  corruption in Guatemala? In short, CICIG, under the direction of  Commissioner Velasquez, has gone from fighting corruption to doing  Vladimir Putin's dirty work even. He has gone even so far as to  persecute victims, like the Bitkovs, of corruption.   The Bitkov affair demonstrates how badly CICIG has gone astray and  why President Morales is right to want it out of his country. CICIG was  established to help investigate and prosecute Mafias who were  entrenched in the state and able to act with impunity. Yet it gets  involved in a passport  [[Page S7858]]  violation case against a family that is clearly fleeing Russian  persecution.   CICIG is supposed to be above reproach. Yet it collaborates with a  state-owned Russian bank that, incidentally, is currently under U.S.  sanctions. The CICIG is doing the bidding of Putin's henchmen in its  acting as the long arm of Russia's dictatorship. The intervention of a  Kremlin-controlled bank shows that influencing CICIG is a part of the  Kremlin's broader campaign to exert pressure across Latin America, and  we ought to be concerned about that.   Earlier this month, in the Wall Street Journal, Ms. O'Grady wrote  that the creeping intervention from Moscow is designed to damage U.S.  interests by destabilizing liberal democracy.   ADM Craig Faller, the commander of the U.S. Southern Command, told  the Senate Armed Services Committee that Russia is flooding Latin  America's internet, social media, and television outlets with original  and reproduced propaganda to sow doubt about U.S. intentions. Russia  has also provided crucial financial support to the infamous Maduro  regime in Venezuela, and it competes with the United States to provide  military support for regional partners.   Another strategic competitor, China, is also seeking to influence  important U.S. partners in Latin America. China has provided more than  $140 billion in Belt and Road Initiative loan commitments. Beijing is  now Latin America's second largest trading partner.   Although CICIG once played a significant role in exposing and  prosecuting serious corruption, it has now fallen victim to Lord  Acton's famous observation--that power tends to corrupt and absolute  power corrupts absolutely.   President Morales has made a decision, as the duly elected head of a  sovereign country, that he will no longer tolerate an increasingly  neocolonial force. The United States should stand behind this decision.  The CICIG was never supposed to stay indefinitely.    This move by the Guatemalan Government does not absolve its own  responsibility to fight corruption. Indeed, we should demand a  redoubling of these efforts. As a critical country in the Western  Hemisphere, a return to pre-CICIG conditions would be unacceptable.  This is the chance for Guatemalans to work toward the justice that  CICIG abandoned with its complicity in Moscow's vendetta. This should  begin with an end to the Bitkov family's long nightmare. Their ordeal  has gone way beyond a miscarriage of justice, and with CICIG's being  gone, Guatemala must do the right thing without further delay or  excuse.   In conclusion, the duly constituted Government of Guatemala has made  the right decision and should be congratulated for yesterday's action.  The country's leadership took a necessary step in asserting its  sovereignty and in ending a dysfunctional relationship with CICIG, a  well-intended agency that has exceeded its mandate and outlived  whatever usefulness it may initially have had.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise for a long overdue floor speech to  recognize a school in my home State of Mississippi that continues to  win national football championships, five, in fact, over the past 10  years.   I can assure my friends from Alabama that I am not trying to steal  the thunder from the Crimson Tide. I am here to recognize the  undefeated East Mississippi Community College Lions, who have become  their own football dynasty and are the reigning National Junior College  Athletic Association champs. NJCAA is commonly known as JUCO.   What makes the East Mississippi Community College football program  special is the grit and determination that fuels its success. Some of  these players are truly playing for their lives. They are the comeback  kids, rising above adversity to get back into the game. The stories of  these players are so inspirational that they won over the hearts of  Americans in the Netflix documentary series, ``Last Chance U.''   In the first two seasons of that program, viewers had a prime spot in  the bleachers to watch East Mississippi's 2015 and 2016 football  seasons. I will not reveal any spoilers, but the Lions have undeniable  star power.   One of the compelling themes throughout the show is the belief in  second chances. Past misbehavior or poor grades do not define these  players or their futures. They have legions of fans cheering for their  success and for the next touchdown. They have introduced to the Nation,  if not the world, the small Mississippi town of Scooba, population 700.  According to the show's trailer, ``One of football's best recruiting  grounds is a place you've never heard of,'' but now the secret is out.   I would like to congratulate the East Mississippi Lions as this  year's JUCO champions and recognize the leadership of the head coach,  Buddy Stephens, who only this afternoon was named National Coach of the  Year for junior college football.   I also want to congratulate East Mississippi's six All-Americans this  year, which was the most for any school except Iowa Western, which tied  with them. These All-Americans include first team All-American wide  receiver Dontario Drummond and second team running back Deon McIntosh,  offensive lineman LaQuinston Sharp, and defensive lineman Everitt  Cunningham. Honorable mentions went to quarterback Messiah deWeaver and  return specialist DJ Clayton. There have been 32 All-Americans during  Coach Stephens' 11-season tenure with the Lions.   Many East Mississippi players go on to 4-year universities and even  pro football teams. LaGarrette Blount, running back for the Detroit  Lions and a three-time Super Bowl champion, was a former East  Mississippi Lion, and so was defensive back C.J. Reavis, who plays for  the Jacksonville Jaguars. Other alumni currently playing in the NFL are  defensive lineman Jarran Reed for the Seattle Seahawks, Za'Darius Smith  for the Baltimore Ravens, Denico Autry for the Indianapolis Colts, and  D.J. Jones for the San Francisco 49ers.   Although there is no question about East Mississippi's skills on the  field, the team also earned the title of being the Football Academic  Team of the Year among junior colleges, showing that the work goes far  past the end zone.   Our State and Nation are proud of East Mississippi Community  College's success. I am confident their football dynasty will continue,  and I look forward to cheering them on to other championships in future  years.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.
