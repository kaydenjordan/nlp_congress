 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1257, the Homeless Veterans Credit Act, and would like my good friend  Chairman Pallone for his work to bring this bill to the floor.   The freedom and luxuries that we are afforded on a daily basis are  made possible by the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform. It is  unthinkable that, after returning home from serving our country,  veterans are often faced with several challenges including a lack of  accessibility to quality and affordable housing. The state of Texas is  home to the second largest population of veterans in the United States,  and veterans homelessness is becoming an increasingly prevalent issue  in our communities.    That is why I am proud to support the Homeless Veterans Credit Act.  This bill will direct the Department of Veterans Affairs to conduct a  study on the effectiveness of financial and credit counseling services  currently available to homeless veterans and how those services can be  improved so these veterans can move a step closer to securing stable  housing, employment and income. Such studies are critical for us as  legislators to determine the efficiency of the institutions, programs,  and funding levels in place to assist veterans.   As Chair of the Congressional Homelessness Caucus, I remain committed  to advocating on behalf of veterans experiencing homelessness and  housing insecurity. This pandemic has brought to light the stark  inequities in access to housing for veterans, but I am confident that  this bill will set the stage for transformative efforts to reform care  for those in need.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to voting in favor of this bipartisan,  commonsense legislation and would urge my colleagues to do the same.
