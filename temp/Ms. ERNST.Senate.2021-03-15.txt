 Madam President, in this country we are so blessed to call  home, every woman, no matter her background--like growing up on a small  farm in Iowa--can be the next first.   After serving in the U.S. Army Reserves and the Iowa Army National  Guard--a historically male field--I became the first female combat  veteran elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. I was also the first woman  to represent the great State of Iowa in Congress. Now, just 6 years  later, women make up a majority of the Iowa congressional delegation.  Iowa is also blessed with a fierce female Governor in Kim Reynolds and  some extremely talented and strong women leaders in our State  legislature. Today, there are over 140 women serving in Congress--more  than ever before in U.S. history.   Because of the suffragettes and so many other determined women who  stepped up and broke the barriers society placed on us, female  trailblazers across this country are writing new pages in history books  every single day. Women have made strides in the boardroom, on the  playing field, in the military, and through elected office.   But this pandemic has been tough on women in the workforce,  threatening to derail the progress we have made. Before COVID, women  made up the majority of the U.S. workforce, but 1 year later, women  have lost over 2 million jobs--nearly 1 million more than our male  counterparts.   There are many reasons for this but two major factors. First, moms  tend to be the sole caregivers in the family. With schools going remote  and childcare centers closing, working moms have been forced to choose  between their careers and their children. Second, women tend to work in  fields that have been hit the hardest by the pandemic, such as the  hospitality industry, restaurants, education, and retail.   We absolutely need to focus on getting these women back into the  workforce and on their feet so that they can support themselves and  their families. The focus needs to be on three things: first, safely  reopening our schools; second, expanding access to childcare, which I  have worked with the Presiding Officer on--thank you very much; and  producing, distributing, and administering the vaccine as quickly as  possible so folks can get back to work safely.   If I were able to choose the theme for Women's History Month based  off of this past year struggling through the pandemic, it would be  ``Overcomer.'' Woman to woman, we all, no matter what we do, are  overcomers by nature.   Moms, you overcome so much every single day when you work tirelessly  at the thankless and never-ending job of caring for your children and  for your families. You have the one and only job that you cannot simply  clock out of, especially this year, when many of you had to balance  being a teacher for the first time in your life.   Women in the workforce, you overcome stereotypes daily and have  continued to smash glass ceilings and set new standards in corporate  America. Your resilience and strength alongside our historic women's  rights heroes continue to shape a bright future for all young girls  across this country.   In honor of Women's History Month, I challenge everyone to remember  the sacrifices it took to secure the freedoms and opportunities we  women enjoy today and continue to build on these opportunities for the  next generation.   Whether that is in your local community or State or Federal  Government, we are a better nation because of the contributions of  women in all walks of life, in all fields of service, and in both  Chambers of Congress, and it is important to continue to remind folks  of that.   It is my hope that each and every young woman, no matter your  hometown or your background, will see the opportunity and potential  that lie ahead. Many of us have heard this really outdated quote: ``Act  like a lady, but think like a man.'' Well, I think history has proven  that, instead, we should say: ``Act like a woman, and think like a  woman'' because we are powerful, we are fearless, we are smart, and we  are strong just the way we are.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
