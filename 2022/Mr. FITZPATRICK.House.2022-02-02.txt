 Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise  today to pay tribute to the life and legacy of a very respected member  of our beloved Bucks County community, Eileen Reed.   Born in Macon, Georgia, as an Army child, Eileen often relocated  before eventually settling in our beloved Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  Eileen enjoyed a long, successful career with New Jersey Bell  Telephone, AT&T, and Lucent Technologies, before retiring in July 2000  to devote more time to her two granddaughters.   Eileen was a lifelong learner with a keen interest in understanding  the detail of exactly how things worked, especially in technology. Our  community will remember Eileen for her strong passion and commitment to  a number of local and national political, social, and charitable  organizations.   Mr. Speaker, the story of how I met Eileen is she was actually a  protestor outside of my office who I got to know. I invited her up to  my office and quickly saw her passion, her intellect, and her love for  our country. Eileen taught me a lot. She taught our staff a lot. There  is no question that Bucks County is missing a very, very special person  today without Eileen in it.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of myself, my family, and our entire staff, we  send our deepest condolences to Eileen's family and all who knew and  loved her. Eileen will be deeply missed and remembered for her love and  devotion to her family, her friends, and her community.                            ____________________
