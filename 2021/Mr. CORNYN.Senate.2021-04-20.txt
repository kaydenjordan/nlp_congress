 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a State as big as Texas--as the  Presiding Officer knows, having lived in and around Houston for a  number of years in his previous life--we rely on a strong network of  roads and bridges to travel safely and efficiently.   We have I-35, which spans the entire length of Texas, from north to  south, and from Laredo all way to Dallas-Fort Worth. Much of that  stretch, it seems like and feels like, is constantly under some  construction.   There are bridges that are part of people's daily commutes, like RM  2900 in Kingsland. After this bridge was destroyed by floodwaters a few  years back, it didn't just create inconvenience in the community but  also risks. It could take a firefighter an hour to get around the  water.   Fortunately, the Texas Department of Transportation and construction  crews didn't waste any time, and I was able to join the dedication less  than a year later. You heard that right. The bridge was destroyed, and  less than a year later we dedicated the opening of that bridge.   Then we have critical projects in the works, like the ``forts to  ports'' corridor of I-14, which stretches from Fort Hood all the way to  the Gulf of Mexico. This will connect our critical military  installations to our seaports and provide a serious boost to our  military readiness.   These are much more than just roads and bridges. They are vital parts  of our daily lives, trade, emergency response, and, of course, national  security.   And as we welcome more new Texans every day, things are nearing a  breaking point. We can't punch above our weight much longer when it  come to our transportation infrastructure. It is time--and I believe it  is a bipartisan belief that this is the time--to invest in our Nation's  infrastructure, and we know, historically, that this has not been a  partisan issue.   I am pro-infrastructure, and I imagine every person in this Chamber  would tell you the same thing, regardless of whether they are from a  red State or blue State. We have a strong history of working together  to fund the networks of roads, bridges, airports, railroads, tunnels,  and the ports that the American people rely on. For example, in 2015,  we passed a 5-year highway and transit funding bill called the FAST  Act, with overwhelming bipartisan support. It received 83 votes here in  the Senate and 359 votes in the House, as well as the signature of  President Obama. This legislation provided the certainty and stability  our States need to make long-term investments in critical projects, and  it was the first of its kind in more than a decade.   Last Congress, we were poised to pass a similar bill. The Environment  and Public Works Committee developed a truly bipartisan example of an  infrastructure bill that built on the success of the FAST Act. That was  led by Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper, at the time, but it  was unanimous. This legislation included provisions to rebuild our  crumbling roads and bridges and improve road safety, protect the  environment, and grow the economy. Once again, it received broad  bipartisan support and passed the committee with unanimous support.   As we know, the last year has brought us untold changes and,  unfortunately, put this and other legislative goals on pause while we  battled COVID-19. But now is the time to pick up where we left off and  get a strong infrastructure bill signed into law.   Unfortunately, the proposal by the administration is a far cry from  what the country actually needs. For starters, the cost of the plan is  beyond comprehension. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible  Federal Budget estimates said it will cost $2.65 trillion, nearly nine  times the size of the last highway bill--nine times.   When talking about this proposal, one House Democrat said: ``It's  gonna to be a kitchen sink.''   The founding director of the Cornell Program in Infrastructure Policy  said: Well, the administration certainly has a ``giant definition'' for  what constitutes ``infrastructure.''   But even journalists are making fun of the scope of this plan, with  one writing: ``Maybe the real meaning of infrastructure is what's in  our hearts.''   Well, these aren't just jokes. Only about 5 percent of this proposal  is directed at roads and bridges, what some have called core  infrastructure. In fact, it puts more money toward electric vehicle  chargers than pavement that we drive on every day.   The proposal funds a long list of programs that are a far cry from  what most people consider to be infrastructure: caregiving for the  elderly and disabled, community colleges, programs to improve diversity  in STEM careers. All of these are significant and important issues, but  they don't belong in an infrastructure bill--certainly not one that  proposes to raise taxes on the American people or to create more debt.   Then there are the most absurd policies that really resemble the  Green New Deal, which I note was just reoffered by Senator Markey and  Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez: more than $200 billion to build or  retrofit more than 2 million ``affordable and sustainable'' places to  live, a ``Civilian Climate Corp,'' and an unrealistic goal of 100  percent renewable-generated electricity by 2035.   My State is an all-of-the-above State when it comes to energy, but I  can tell you that if all you are depending on is renewable energy,  without appropriate attention to the baseload you need, you are going  to end up like we did, unfortunately, just a couple of months ago, with  electricity going down due to extreme weather.   I support efforts to rebuild our infrastructure, but this is not an  infrastructure proposal. This is, really, much closer to the Green New  Deal 2.0. It is an encore to the nearly $2 trillion wish list that our  Democratic colleagues rammed through on a partisan basis earlier this  year.   Any attempt to claim that Republican won't work with Democrats on an  infrastructure bill is completely disingenuous because this is not a  good-faith attempt at bipartisanship.    I would be happy to work with our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle to craft an infrastructure bill that addresses our legitimate  infrastructure problems, and I think every person on this side would  agree with that. That would include traditional transportation, such as  roads and bridges, as well as certain forms of nontraditional  infrastructure, for example, broadband.   The pandemic has really highlighted the digital divide that exists  across our country, and as Americans relied on the internet to work, to  attend school, for telehealth, and a long list of other activities, it  has become increasingly apparent that we are far from where we should  be when it comes to broadband access in this country.   There is bipartisan support for a bill that addresses our most urgent  infrastructure needs without tacking on unrelated partisan priorities.  As far as the price tag of the bill, I am not married to a particular  number. The last highway bill that became law was roughly $300 billion,  and I think we all agree there is a need to pursue something bigger and  bolder. But that needs to be limited to infrastructure.   The final pricetag of that bill should be the result of bipartisan  negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, not in numbers handed  down from the administration, unilaterally.   There is one point I want to make abundantly clear: A bipartisan  infrastructure bill must exist instead of, not in addition to, our  Democrat colleagues' unrelated priorities. We can't work in a  bipartisan way to pass one bill only to have our Democratic colleagues  then attempt to jam through on a partisan basis on reconciliation  another long list of their priorities. In other words, we have to  choose, and what I suggest we choose is bipartisan infrastructure  legislation.   The choice before our Democratic colleagues is whether to work  together or attempt to go it alone. You really can't have both.   We also need to be serious about paying for our infrastructure in a  sustainable way. We have just spent trillions of dollars on  coronavirus, not to mention the long list of priorities included in the  most recent partisan bill.   This is not a time to continue the spending spree. Investments in our  [[Page S2051]]  roads and bridges are needed, but we need to figure out how they will  be paid for. The massive tax hikes that the President has proposed are  not a viable option. The burden will be borne by both American  employers and workers.   In previous years, the vast majority of infrastructure funding came  from the highway trust fund. Every State sends dollars to this fund,  which finances infrastructure across the country. But the formula to  distribute the funding is out of date and is facing serious deficits.   Making matters worse, Texans are getting short-changed and carrying  the weight of these shortfalls, as a so-called donor State. We get 92  cents back on every dollar we send to Washington, DC.   That is not the same treatment for every State. In fact, we receive a  lower rate of return than every other State. If we want to have any  long-term success in maintaining our roads and bridges, we need to  bring this funding formula up to speed as well.   Unfortunately, the administration's proposal fails to do that, and  instead of making any repairs to the highway trust fund, it leans on  damaging tax hikes to pay for this broad range of unrelated policies.   The President has, indeed, proposed the largest set of tax hikes in  more than a half a century. Economics 101 would teach you that tax  increases aren't a clear and easy way to boost revenue, especially when  your economy is already on fragile footing.   I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle will be willing to  work with us to pass a true infrastructure bill, one that will, first  and foremost, improve roads, bridges, airports, and other critical  projects all across the country.   Notably, we must find a responsible way to pay for this, but tax  hikes are not the answer. We have always had this idea in the highway  trust fund that user fees--the people that buy gasoline and use the  roadways--were the ones to pay for them, not pay for them out of  general revenue. And I think we need to continue down this user-fee  model, as opposed to deficit spending and adding to our debt.   Again, in closing, let me just say, if our Democratic friends want to  act in a bipartisan way, there are people on this side of the aisle,  including me, that would be happy to sit down and start talking. But,  first of all, our Democratic colleagues must agree to abandon their  long wish list of unrelated partisan provisions. They can't work with  us on an infrastructure bill and then follow it with a reconciliation  bill that includes the kitchen sink.   A bipartisan bill to rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges is  possible. We have done it before, and we can do it again.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
