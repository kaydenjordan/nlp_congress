 Mr. Chair, as I have told you, it is an absolute honor  to serve on the Committee on Agriculture, under the leadership of the  chairman as well as the ranking member. There is no doubt about that.  But I mainly say that based on the work that this committee does, the  work that this committee does to serve those in agriculture and what  that  [[Page H4055]]  service can do for the backbone industry of our country.   However, as a Representative on this committee and as a  Representative of the salad bowl of the world on the central coast of  California, my country and, yes, my community expected more out of this  farm bill.   Look, in my area, with its flourishing specialty crop industry, we  wanted more funding for the specialty crop research initiative. Because  of our specialty crops, we have a labor shortage because of the people  who are needed to pick those crops. Therefore, we needed stronger  language in the bill for mechanization to help with our labor issues  and to bridge that gap from the Salinas Valley into the Silicon Valley.   With our burgeoning organic industry, we needed more funding and less  cuts for the Organic Certification Cost Share Program so that we can  properly invest in beginning producers.   In addition to this, the majority is trying to implement an untested  and unproven change to title IV of the SNAP provision. Such a change  threatens to remove over a million people from the program and deeply  affects the 74,000 people who are recipients of SNAP living and working  in my community.   We can do better by our farmers. We can do better by the families  across our country by getting back to our bipartisan roots. That is how  we help our agriculture. That is how we help our country.
