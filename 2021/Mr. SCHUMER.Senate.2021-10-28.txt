 Madam President, I rise today to recognize a great  milestone in this Chamber. Our colleague Susan Collins will in a few  moments cast her 8,000th vote.  [[Page S7446]]    I join in extending a warm congratulations to Senator Collins on this  terrific achievement and thank her for her many years of public service  to her State and country.   And, in deference to this nice occasion, I would ask we all stay in  the Chamber and vote quickly so we can leave. I know that is a passion  for Senator Collins.   Seriously, we should all try to stay in the Chamber and get this done  fast.    Mr. President, so we had a good and productive week in  the Senate this week. We confirmed seven judges and a good number of  executive appointments and Ambassadors, and we made good progress on  President Biden's Build Back Better agenda. So it has been a good week  here.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.
