 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas (Mr. Arrington),  he is a good friend and he represents--I will tell him, the second best  part of the State, given that I represent the Hill Country in central  Texas, and my dad grew up in west Texas and went to Texas Tech  University.   I have a soft spot in my heart for my friend. He is consistent in  bringing to this floor of the House the need for all of us to work  together to deal with the spending problem. And it is a problem that we  face in this country.   I was just thinking when I started running for office 5 years ago  this fall, the national debt of the United States was $21 trillion.  Today, 5 years later, our national debt is $31 trillion dollars.   Just think for a minute. We never know how big that number is--nobody  understands. $31 trillion. Well, let me just tell you this. If you set  out to count to 31 trillion--we would just say, let's go, one  Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, it would take you  almost a million years to get to 31 trillion. That is absurd.   We are spending money we don't have. This body believes itself to be  the United States House of free stuff. We just write blank checks. We  dole it out. Spending money we don't have, obliterating our children's  future, devastating the future financial security and stability of the  United States.   All for what?   So that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can walk outside  and give a fancy speech about free stuff they are doling out.   And with all due respect, colleagues on my side of the aisle can go  say, well, I wrote a bunch of checks to fund our defense, so I got to  vote for another big spending bill.   Every day. Just today, we had a whole bunch of votes on suspensions.  There was $10 billion in there for global food security. We have men  and women in uniform on food stamps, and this body writes another blank  check to dole it out to global food security.   When are we going to stop.   But here is the problem. These blank checks, this spending that we  engage in, it isn't just about debt, it isn't just about weakening our  dollar, it isn't just about deficit spending, it is that we are funding  the very government that is at war with its own people every day.   We have a Department of Homeland Security that refuses to secure the  homeland with wide open borders and fentanyl pouring in killing  Americans and empowering cartels, with migrants dying in the meantime.   We have an FBI that is targeting parents for domestic terrorism. We  have an FBI that is targeting a father of seven in Pennsylvania for  daring to have gone to speak out and exercise his free speech rights to  defend the unborn.   We have an IRS targeting Americans--85,000 new IRS agents and  personnel. We are funding an entire energy--I should say anti-energy  agenda--that is destroying our energy independence, driving up the  price of goods, driving up the price of gas, driving up the price of  electricity, weakening the grid of the United States, decreasing the  reliability of our energy sector, and decreasing the freedom of the  American people.   All of that for what?   So that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the  President and the climate czar, or whatever the heck his title is, John  Kerry, can go fly around the world in jets, spewing all sorts of  garbage out of their jets to go hang out in Davos and pat themselves on  the back that they are doing some sort of benefit for the world with  respect to carbon dioxide, while China  [[Page H8306]]  has 1,100 coal-fired plants and they are adding one new coal-fired  plant a day. And my colleagues on the other side of the aisle just walk  around like butterflies and hummingbirds, saying, aren't we great for  the world?                                time  1915    Oh, isn't this great? Devastating the American economy and  devastating the American way of life, devastating our national security  for fake hummingbirds and fake unicorns, because they want to say they  are doing something for the environment.   Well, they are not doing crap for the environment, literally. You  could ban every single combustion engine in America, and you are not  going to dent CO2 production, while we destroy our way of  life and destroy our economy.   So America, welcome to the world of the Democratic Party. Plug your  car in. Use up your entire electricity bill that you use for your air  conditioning unit to run your battery-powered car.   Oh, 60, $70,000, why can't you just go by a Tesla, the Secretary of  Energy says; completely out of touch with the average hardworking  American. But that is what we are dealing with.   But that is not all. Today, my colleagues on my side of the aisle, 22  of them in the United States Senate, voted for the continuing  resolution. They voted for it, they will say, because, oh, no, the  government funding will expire tomorrow, and we might have a government  shutdown.   You can hear all of the people in America crying big crocodile tears  over the possibility that the Federal Government might not have its  lights on on Saturday morning.   But let's actually talk about what is really going on; that CR that  22 Republican Members of the Senate voted for contains $17 billion in  emergency funding, unpaid for, another blank check.   That same CR will expire in December, on December 16, in a lame-duck  Congress, which my colleagues on this side of the aisle know full well  means it empowers my colleagues on that side of the aisle to continue  to stick it to the American people with their radical leftist policies  undermining their way of life.   That continuing resolution has nothing in it to secure the border of  the United States when our border is wide open and fentanyl is pouring  in, killing Americans; 72,000 dead Americans last year, from opioid,  fentanyl-related poisoning, directly coming in at the hands of cartels,  coming from China. That is more than every American who died in the  Vietnam War.   Are we going to put a great big memorial out there for all of those  72,000? What about the year before? What about this year?   What about the four people in Hays County that I represent in Texas,  the four kids who died from fentanyl poisoning because my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle want to turn a blind eye to cartels  exploiting our border for the endangerment of Americans. That is the  truth.   Americans are dead because of the policies of this administration  failing to secure the border of the United States, and they know it.  Migrants are dead. Migrants' bodies are piling up in south Texas, by  the hundreds; 53 cooked in a tractor trailer in San Antonio, which I  represent; 53 human beings cooked in the false name of compassion,  while my colleagues on the other side of the aisle walk around going:  Look at me, I love Brown people. I love immigrants.   Bull. It is a lie, and my colleagues need to wake up, because I can  promise you that the Brown people--not my terminology, by the way--in  south Texas, are fed up, fed up with being exploited, abused, and used  for political purposes.   While my colleagues like to say, oh, well, Governor DeSantis and  Governor Abbott sent some people to D.C., to Martha's Vineyard.   Well, welcome to the party. The country is now alerted. These were  volunteers, volunteers who said yeah, I will take a ride to D.C. Fifty  people in Martha's Vineyard, 53 dead migrants in a tractor trailer in  San Antonio.   Just last night, the mayor of Uvalde, Texas--yes, that Uvalde,  Texas--called up, there was a pickup truck with 10 immigrants in the  truck that T-boned into a tractor trailer at an intersection; two of  them dead, two in the hospital.   Every stinking day this is happening, and my colleagues the other  side of the aisle turn a blind eye. That is the reality of our border.   But this continuing resolution that my Republican colleagues in the  United States Senate, 22 of them, were all too happy to support,  continues to fund that Department of Homeland Security of an annual  budget of $57.5 billion; $8 billion for ICE. Even though it was a 70  percent reduction in removals last year for ICE.   Millions in grants each year, in that same continuing resolution, to  nongovernmental organizations who are the ones actually transporting  people around the United States, effectively subsidizing illegal  immigration.   This CR empowers the authoritarian bureaucrats targeting Americans.  It is not just the Department of Homeland Security leaving our border  wide open and exposed, but the FBI, to the tune of $10.8 billion, to go  after former President Trump, to go after parents concerned about  schools, to go after a pro-lifer father; and IRS, $12.6 billion. We  just gave them another $80 billion.   But no, no; we just funded a CR with an annual appropriation of $12  billion.   Oh, you think that is good enough? How about NIH, $45 billion. After  NIH has been basically screwing the American people for the last two  and a half years with their nonsense spewing out about COVID, resulting  in our children being set back a generation; shunned to the corner of  classrooms; forced to wear masks; unable to have proper speech. All so  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can run around wearing  masks and scaring the bejesus out of the American people.   $45 billion. My Republican colleagues in the Senate said, sure, let's  keep giving them more money.   What will my colleagues on my side of the aisle do tomorrow? I hope  they will oppose it.   How about Pfizer and Moderna, who faced no liability; made $93  billion in 2022, $93 billion, Pfizer and Moderna, because the  government was cramming shots into people's arms, and then forcing our  men and women in uniform to lose their job and get fired if they dare  not take a shot, which the current CDC says, you know what? It doesn't  even help with transmission.    What the hell kind of a country are we living in? This isn't freedom;  and we are funding it. Republicans are complicit.   NIAID, $6.3 billion, run by the COVID tyrant in chief, Dr. Fauci.   CDC, $8.5 billion, colluded with the teachers' unions to impose the  lockdowns.   The World Health Organization, $122 million in this annual funding  just approved; already got $280 million under the Democrats' COVID  relief bill. They pushed a completely unfounded COVID narrative and  partnered with the Chinese Communists to cover up their role in the  COVID origin. This we know.   The Department of Defense and all of their glory--and no, don't say  that over here on my side of the aisle because we have got to rush in  and we have got to give the money for the Department of Defense,  without any accountability, by the way, for how about forcing troops  out with their tyrannical COVID-19 vaccine mandates; set to discharge  over 75,000 Active servicemembers for daring to say no to a vaccine  that doesn't even help with transmissibility.   How about a woke military informed policy? The DOD won't admit China  is a greater threat than climate change, according to the leadership.  They are preoccupied with diversity training; constructing training  centers with mixed-sex restrooms and locker rooms and showers. The Air  Force is going to spend $66 million for one in San Antonio, which I  represent.   $56 billion for the Department of State and Foreign Operations  budget, for U.S. embassies to fly pride and BLM flags; add unspecified  X-gender designations to passports. $15 million for the State  Department's Global Equality Fund sending tax dollars to LGBTQI  whatever, whatever, persons around the world.   Empowers Biden's administration's anti-American, anti-biology  ideology; $39 million for HHS Office of Civil Rights promoting gender  transition surgeries for kids.   $76 billion obviously goes to the Department of Education, where we  subsidize schools failing our kids; shoving  [[Page H8307]]  them into the corners of classrooms; making them wear masks; and  rewarding teachers filling their minds with anti-American teachings  under critical race theory. Even in my own city that I represent in San  Antonio, Northside ISD forced a radical equity exercise dividing people  by their hair color.   $2 billion for the Student Aid Administration carrying out the  Biden's $400 billion student loan giveaway.   $525 million for the public broadcasting. HHS, $94 million for  diversity training; $64 million for the Office of Minority Health; $1.1  million for the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity in HHS.   Energy, $100 million for environmental justice. The EPA used this to  create a new Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights  in the Department of the EPA.   $20 million for the Department of Energy's Office of Impact and  Diversity; $885 million for the Department of Education programs that  fund colleges based solely on students' race and ethnicity.   $235 million for Federal apprenticeship programs that includes grants  to equity intermediaries to hire CRT indoctrination consultants.   How about the United Nation's population funds, praising China's  abusive population control program.   How about U.N. women, which can't even define women? What is a woman?  Promotes trans and intersex athletes.   Climate, $15 million for the U.N. Climate Agency; $149 million for  the global environment facility.   $125 million for the World Bank's Clean Technology Fund.   And my Republican colleagues in the Senate, 22, voted for it and, of  course all the Democrats, for the most part, passed this through to get  it to a lame duck in December, to then allow for even more. That is  what we are funding.   At some point you would think that we would wake up on a bipartisan  basis or, Lord willing, at least my side of the aisle, that we actually  have the power of the purse; and we are actually supposed to use it,  instead of giving massive blank checks to an administration that is at  war with the American people on a daily basis.   When the Founders gave us this government, they knew that they didn't  want to empower an executive with unfettered power, yet that is what we  do every day in this Chamber. That is what the so-called people's House  of the United States does every single day.   Federalist 58, James Madison, ``The House of Representatives cannot  only refuse, but they alone can propose, the supplies requisite for the  support of government. They, in a word, hold the purse. . . . `'    ``This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most  complete and effectual weapon with which any Constitution can arm the  immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of  every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary  measure.''   In other words, we are supposed to have the power. We are supposed to  be the ones who can stop the funding of the tyranny against the people.   Oh, Chip, it is not tyranny. I am sure my friend from Pennsylvania  has thoughts on that. Of course it is tyranny.   An FBI targeting parents for being domestic terrorists? An FBI  targeting a father of seven, showing up with 25 to 30 armed SWAT team  members to arrest him in front of his family? All true.   How is that freedom? How is that not tyranny?   How is it not tyranny to steal money from a plumber who worked his  whole life, didn't borrow money to go to some fancy university, and go  give it to somebody else to pay off their loan?   How is it not tyranny to steal money from a person who worked their  whole life to do it right and pay their loans back after going to  college, and give it to someone else who got a ridiculous degree from  some ridiculous college and is sitting in their parents' basement on  social media trying to be a social media influencer? That is what  happening.   We are just going to take money from somebody else and go give it to  another person. That is tyranny. It is theft, and we are doing it  through executive fiat.   We didn't vote on it here. None of these people are going to go  answer to their constituents for stealing money from them to go give it  to someone else. The President just decided it by decree. That is  tyranny.   It is tyranny to stick a needle in somebody's arm or tell them that  you are going to get fired from your career in the military.   Well, I have had it. But I have not just had it with the tyrannical  policies of a President. I have had with it with a United States House  of Representatives that does not represent the people; and I have had  it with a Republican Party who refuses to stop funding the very things  they campaign against every single day.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, I would just add that we are talking about,  again, decisions we make with the money that we are taking from  taxpayers, printing and borrowing to the tune of a trillion-dollar-plus  deficit every year.   I started this by saying when I ran for office 5 years ago for the  first time, our national debt was $21 trillion. Today, it is $31  trillion--$10 trillion in the mere 5 years since I have been here, $2  trillion a year, my friend from Pennsylvania. But we keep funding this  stuff.   This is the nexus I want the American people to understand. The  deficit spending isn't just about the deficits. The deficit spending is  why our Nation is being torn apart.   We are supposed to be able to agree to disagree. We are supposed to  be able to have 50 laboratories of democracy sewn together under a  commonality, defending ourselves and having an economy that functions.  Instead, we are funding the bureaucrats that are ripping us apart,  thread by thread, IRS agent after IRS agent, FBI agent after FBI agent.  I say that as someone who worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office with  great men and women in the FBI, whose father was an IRS agent. My  father worked for the Internal Revenue Service as an auditor.   I have no problem with how we try to set these things up to work. But  hiring 85,000 new IRS personnel on the back of what we knew happened,  targeting certain individuals with the power of the IRS, the FBI  targeting a father, targeting Scott Smith in Loudoun County, saying he  is a domestic terrorist, in coordination with the National School  Boards Association, which 26 States' school board associations have now  removed themselves from.   That is what the American people need to understand. We are funding  that--$10.8 billion for the FBI, $12.6 billion for IRS, $1.5 billion  for ATF. For public health, $8.5 billion for CDC, $6.3 billion for the  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, $45 billion for  NIH generally, $3.3 billion for the FDA, $122 million for the WHO, $612  million for OSHA. Remember, it was OSHA that tried to force a vax  mandate on private businesses.   How do you get any more tyrannical than the President saying: You,  private entity, through OSHA, are going to require your employees to  take a needle in the arm for a vaccine, by the way, that was unproven,  untested, had liability protection, and enriched two pharma companies  to the tune of $93 billion in 2 years.    Somebody tell me that is not tyranny.    Mr. Speaker, if I might inquire about the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we spend approximately $58 billion--I don't  have it right in front of me--a year for the Department of Homeland  Security, $55 billion, $56 billion.   We just approved earlier this year $58 billion for Ukraine, and now  there is an additional $12 billion in the continuing resolution that  passed out of the Senate today and is now sitting in the House. That  puts it at almost $70 billion, which is well more than the entire  annual budget of the Department of Homeland Security for the United  States.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate what the gentleman just said.   I would say, for our constituents back home, I feel them. I feel the  frustration of being in a Chamber where I can offer no amendment, where  I have no power to have any input on what bill we are going to be  debating on the floor. Literally, for 6-and-a-half years, no amendment  has been offered on the floor of this body in open debate, meaning it  wasn't precooked up in the Committee on Rules.   Think about that, in the people's House. That should infuriate both  sides of the aisle. That is no way for the people's House to operate.  It is being operated by dictate. That is a bipartisan statement, I want  to say, over time.   I think, for the American people, they want to see us do something. I  think we can.   To the fine folks in Pennsylvania that you ran into who said, ``What  can we do? We can't do anything about it,'' do you know what? We can.   One, we can freeze spending to stop the complete disregard for the  economic well-being of this country and the driving up of inflation by  spending money we don't have. We can do that.                                time  1945    We can agree as a body that we have to make tough decisions like  families and businesses do. Freeze spending. Let's just stop the  bleeding.   We can take a second step, and we can actually demand that when we  have debates about the spending of taxpayer money and the borrowing and  printing of money that we actually deal with these crises in real  terms.   I am really talking to my colleagues on my side of the aisle on this  one:   We should demand that we get changes at the border.   We should demand that we turn away or detain fully at the border.   We should demand that we stop the forced jabs in people's arms in the  military or they get fired.   We should demand changes in our energy policy so that we can free up  American energy to increase our power on the world stage, make our  grids reliable, make us more dependent on reliable energy, instead of  unreliable energy, while making the environment better, by the way.   We should demand that we neutralize the power of the authoritarian  state by pulling back on the reins of the FBI and the IRS.   There are things we can do. It is right here. We have the power of  the purse. We should use it. I tell you, I am speaking to my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle. We have an obligation.   Look, I have run into the buzz saw of challenging the administration  when it was Republican because I believed so much in Article I primacy.  I introduced the ARTICLE ONE Act with my friend, Mike Lee, to say we  should take away emergency powers from the President.   I did that when the President was using emergency powers to build a  wall when there was an emergency and we needed to build it because my  colleagues refused to. But I wanted there to be a limit into how much  power the executive branch can use.   I subpoenaed records about unaccompanied alien children because I  knew that when my colleague on the other side of the aisle was wearing  a white pantsuit, staring through a fence that it was all theater.  There weren't kids in cages. Those were set up by the previous  administration under Jeh Johnson and President Obama, and they know it.  They know it.   So you know what?   I subpoenaed information from HHS under a Republican administration  because I wanted to know the truth.   We should care about Article I here. If we do, we can take power back  and we can represent the people again.   We can use the power of the purse to check the executive.   We can stand up and defend the people of the United States.   We can secure the border.   We can rein in the tyranny of the IRS and the FBI.   We can get American energy going again by opening it up, so our  people don't have to have inflation and the inability to have a  reliable grid.   We can stop forcing our men and women in uniform to get fired if they  refuse to take an experimental jab.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Not one. And I will tell you that across the board,  regardless of ideology, the people that come to me and are talking to  me are concerned about the border.    They are concerned about fentanyl.   They are concerned about energy prices and their inability to pay  their bills.  [[Page H8310]]    They are concerned about the extent to which they are in danger in  their communities, the crime, and their relationship to the border.   They are concerned about the things that are impacting their lives,  their inability to pay for their kids' school, their inability to  afford healthcare because we have regulated it to death, and we have  funded it and subsidized it to death, so that we are in a position  where they can't afford to live the American Dream for their kids and  their grandkids.   Our job in this body is to address that, not by spending more money  and not by continuing to fund the very things that are undermining it.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I will yield for the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert), but first I want to add to what the gentleman said because it  is on point.   We are funding $5 million for the Special Presidential Envoy for  Climate John Kerry; we are funding $15 million for the U.N.  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and U.N. Framework  Convention; $2 billion to the SEC, which they use to help advance the  very ESG constraints on the flow of capital that is constraining our  ability to produce energy; $3.2 billion to the Department of Energy's  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which funnels  taxpayer dollars to unreliable green energy; $825 million for DOE's  Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, which gives credit  handouts to massive oil companies; $450 million for DOE's ARPA; $29  million to administer a DOE loan program responsible for the Solyndra  debacle.   I could go on and on. I have got a list here.   All that money to go to the Department of Energy to keep spending  taxpayer money to screw up American energy and drive up their energy  bills.    Mr. Speaker, we are talking about the drop-off of the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   If you can see this here on C-SPAN, this top level is 750 million  barrels. And you can see up here in 2020, there is this sharp drop-off?  That drops down to 350 million barrels. That is the defense being  exercised by a President trying to save his party. That is not being  used specifically for the national security interest of the United  States.   That is absolutely horrific. Dumping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,  dumping it in order to drive gas prices down.   You know what? Those chickens are going to come home to roost.    Close to $60 billion.    Mr. Speaker, I mentioned this before, but I think it merits  repeating, that we are at roughly $31 trillion in debt, as the  gentleman said.   If you set out to count to 31 trillion at one Mississippi, it will  take you 1 million years to count to that.   Just to put in perspective what that is, when I began running for  office in December of 2017, our debt was $21 trillion; $10 trillion in  5 years since I began running for office.    Well, I think we have got about 20 seconds left.  [[Page H8312]]         All I would say is, if we want to do this, if we want an  economy that is strong, stop spending money we don't have. Stop  spending money to fund the bureaucracy that is going after the American  people.   If you want a Nation that is safe, stop talking down your cops. Stand  with your cops.   If you want a military that is strong, stop being woke. End the woke  destruction of our military.   If you want a border that is secure, secure it. Turn people away.  Accept the people that need help but turn people away and actually  detain them and stop the control of our borders by cartels that are  endangering the American people.
