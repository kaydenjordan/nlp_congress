 Mr. President, the process of confirming a Supreme Court  Justice is supposed to be lengthy, thoughtful, rigorous. I am grateful  to the Presiding Officer and Chairman Durbin for doing it right with  Judge Brown Jackson.   Judge Jackson has answered hours of questions about her judicial  philosophy, why she made certain decisions, why she represented certain  clients, how her background has shaped her world view. Nearly every  detail of her professional and personal life has been and will continue  to be interrogated publicly as she goes through the final stages of  this process.   But a strange thing is going to happen when Judge Jackson finally  takes her seat on the Supreme Court. She will, after all of this review  and scrutiny, become effectively immune from ethics standards.   Why is that? Because every Federal judge--circuit judges, district  judges, court of international trade judges, court of Federal claims  judges, bankruptcy judges, magistrate judges--every Federal judge is  bound by a code of ethics in order to safeguard the judiciary's  neutrality and transparency--all Federal judges, except for nine: the  Supreme Court.   It is not because the Supreme Court is so highly regarded by the  American people. In fact, the opposite is true.   Trust in the institution's reputation is in rapid decline right now.  According to a recent C-SPAN poll, only 30 percent--about 37 percent,  actually--of likely voters believe that the Supreme Court acts in a  ``serious and constitutionally sound manner.''   In a democracy that prides itself on a fair and independent  judiciary, that is unacceptable. It is worrying, but it is not  surprising. Recent revelations surrounding Justice Thomas and his  wife's involvement in the events of January 6 have finally brought  attention that  [[Page S1885]]  those standards we try to uphold during the confirmation process  quickly disappear upon confirmation.   Now, this isn't some new phenomenon. We have seen Justices--both  liberal and conservative--promote political fundraisers, speak at  partisan events, fail to recuse themselves from cases with pretty clear  conflicts of interest. And if the past is prologue--the recent incident  that has gained a lot of attention regarding Justice Thomas's family-- it won't be the last.   Now, I first introduced a bill that would require the Supreme Court  to adopt a code of ethics 10 years ago. And I have reintroduced a  version of that bill in every Congress since.   The majority of Americans agrees with me: There is absolutely no  reason why the Supreme Court shouldn't be subject to a code of conduct  just like every other Federal judge.   But the Court disagrees. John Roberts said in 2011 when he was asked  about this:   The Court has no reason to adopt a code of conduct as its definitive  source of ethical guidance.   Well, it has a reason now. And to be clear, I am not talking about a  code of conduct that is written by Congress. Instead, my legislation  would require the Judicial Conference to create a binding code of  conduct that applies to all Federal judges and Justices, including  those on the Supreme Court.   It is a simple step that would improve transparency, enforce  accountability, and restore some lost faith in the institution. And,  frankly, because of that diminishing faith, it is in the Court's  interest to do everything possible to try to help rebuild public  confidence.   During Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation process, Justice Kagan put it  best. She said:         The Court's strength as an institution of American       governance depends on people believing [it has] a certain       kind of legitimacy, on people believing it is not simply an       extension of politics, that its decision-making has a kind of       integrity to it.    If people don't believe that, they have no reason to accept what the  Court does. Justice Kagan said it well.   And right now, that belief is teetering dangerously close to the  edge. The spouse of a Supreme Court Justice was involved in an effort  to organize a coup and overthrow of a democratically elected President  of the United States. That is extraordinary. That is not normal. It  should not be treated as just another flavor of legitimate political  action, and the fact that there is no clear binding code of conduct  that addresses this kind of behavior and no clear standards of recusal  for Supreme Court Justices that the American people can see and trust  is just unacceptable.   I think that my Democratic and Republican colleagues can agree on  this, the American people deserve to know that our Supreme Court  Justices are being held to the highest standards whether they be  Justices appointed by Democratic Presidents or Justices appointed by  Republican Presidents. It is not enough for us to just trust the Court  any longer to self-enforce a secret internal code of ethics.   The highest Court in the land cannot be exempt from the standards  that we hold every other Federal judge to. I am glad that this piece of  legislation has gained additional cosponsors just over the course of  the last week. I hope that it eventually becomes a bipartisan piece of  legislation, and I would urge my colleagues to join me in holding the  Court to account.                Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar    Mr. President, finally, I know votes are pending, but I am also  coming to the floor to request, as I will in a moment, unanimous  consent for the nomination and approval of Javier Ramirez to be  Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.   I would guess that not a lot of my colleagues know much about the  Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and that is because we  normally don't have to have a debate over the confirmation of its  Director on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   The Agency is an independent one that has been in place since 1947.  Its mission is to preserve and promote labor management peace and  cooperation by providing mediation and conflict resolution services to  industry, government agencies, and communities. The FMCS has 10  regional offices, more than 60 field offices. Its headquarters are here  in Washington, DC.   It does the basic blocking and tackling of keeping our economy  running. It is charged with trying to avoid conflict between labor and  management so that we don't have strikes, so that we don't have work  stoppages, so that our economy runs as smoothly as possible. It is a  pretty noncontroversial Agency, and the individual who has been  selected to run it is equally noncontroversial. He is a career public  servant.   Javier Ramirez began at the FMCS in 2005. He is currently the  director of Agency initiatives there. To me, this would be a no- brainer, that we could come together and decide as a body that we are  going to make sure that we have someone running an Agency that is  pretty vital to the smooth flow of our economy and the mediation of  disputes between labor and management.   And so I would ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No.  665, Javier Ramirez, of Illinois, to be Federal Mediation and  Conciliation Director; that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; that any statements related to  the nomination be printed in the Record; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.     I know colleagues are eager to get this vote going, but  20 seconds in response.   This place is grinding to a halt. And it is absolutely extraordinary  the number of noncontroversial nominees who are now required to move  through full votes, cloture motions on the floor. U.S. Attorneys who  never, ever had to come before this floor for votes and debate now do.   This is an exercise in fundamentally breaking the Senate. This place  only works with UC. We cannot run every single nominee through regular  order or we would be here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   I am grateful for my colleague's comments. I hope that we will be  able to confirm Mr. Ramirez. But this is the kind of work that the  Senate used to be able to do through UC, and it is unfortunate that we  continue to have this breakdown in process.  [[Page S1886]]    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.
