 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to stress the  importance of maintaining our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   The Biden administration has recklessly handled our SPR and made us  more vulnerable economically and defensively. They have drained the  reserve by almost 40 percent with no plan to replenish it, jeopardizing  our economy and our national security.   America is currently unprepared for a true emergency, forcing us to  beg for oil from countries like Venezuela. We are also more vulnerable  to an energy supply disruption caused by natural disasters like  hurricanes.   H.R. 21 would ensure that the administration has a plan in place to  increase domestic energy production and to replenish the SPR.   Democrats want you to believe that draining the SPR is the only way  to combat prices. Wrong. We can produce our own oil and gas.   Americans have suffered enough under the left's failed Green New  Deal.   I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 21.   I also encourage them to support Representative Gaetz's amendment to  ensure the important Gulf Test Range remains a pillar of our military  readiness.
