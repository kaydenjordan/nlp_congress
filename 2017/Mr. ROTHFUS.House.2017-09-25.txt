 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Corporal  Daniel Francis Kelly, who, after being listed as missing in action in  Korea for 67 years, is finally home.   Danny was the youngest of nine boys of Irene and John Kelly from  Pittsburgh's north side. Seven of his eight brothers served in World  War II, one of whom was Medal of Honor recipient Chuck ``Commando''  Kelly. Danny idolized Chuck and wanted to be a war hero just like him.   With Chuck's help, Danny enlisted in the Army in 1950, at the age of  17. By November of that year, as part of the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd  Infantry Division, he found himself at the Battle of Ch'ongch'on River,  where he was captured on November 26. It is believed he died at the POW  camp known as ``Death Valley'' in March 1951.   Corporal Kelly, this week, your country gives you the funeral with  military honors you have long deserved. Like your brother Chuck, you  are a hero. A grateful nation says ``thank you.''   Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine  upon him.                            ____________________
