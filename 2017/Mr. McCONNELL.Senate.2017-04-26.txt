 Mr. President, North Korea's determined effort to  field a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile threatens the  United States and our allies. By all appearances, Kim Jong Un has  broken from a predictable cycle of escalation demonstrated by previous  leaders by which the regime takes a provocative action, draws the  United States into a negotiation, and extracts concessions. Instead,  Kim appears willing to risk the disapproval of the U.N. and our  regional allies by undertaking a breakneck testing program.   The President has made clear that a North Korea that is armed with a  nuclear-armed missile--a capability they have yet to test--is  unacceptable to us and threatens our vital national security interest.  Thus, in order to allow the Senate to better understand this threat, I  asked the administration to brief all Senators on the issue, and the  President graciously offered to hold the meeting down at the White  House. I encourage all of our colleagues to attend this afternoon's  meeting on North Korea down at the White House.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, I am pleased that  the Senate voted yesterday to confirm Rod Rosenstein to serve as Deputy  Attorney General, despite the unnecessary delay, and I look forward to  advancing another nominee today.   For the past 8 years, burdensome regulations put forth by the Obama  administration have held back our economy and taken a toll on too many  hard-working Americans. Fortunately, we now have an administration that  has already proven its commitment to easing the regulatory burden on  our economy and advancing policies that actually promote economic  growth and job creation.   The Department of Labor nominee before us today, Alexander Acosta,  shares that commitment, and he has just the right experience to address  these issues. He was previously confirmed to three positions by voice  votes here in the Senate, meaning not a single Senator of either party  recorded a vote in opposition, so it is no surprise that he has earned  a host of bipartisan support for his current nomination as well. We  should confirm him without delay. The sooner we do, the sooner he can  advance labor policies that put American workers, businesses, and our  economy first.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one other important matter currently  being discussed here in the Senate, conversations are ongoing about the  way forward on a government spending bill. Our friends on the other  side of the aisle sent me a letter that asked for this bill to reject  poison pill riders. I would suggest that if they take their own advice,  we can finish this negotiation and produce a good agreement that both  sides can support.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have 8 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to Rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                  Committee on Environment and Public Works    The Committee on Environment and Public Works is authorized to meet  during the session of the Senate on Wednesday, April 26, 2017, at 10  a.m., in room 406 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, to conduct a  hearing entitled, ``A Review of the Technical, Scientific, and Legal  Basis of the WOTUS Rule.''
