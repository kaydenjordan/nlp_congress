 Madam Speaker, I thank my true friend from the State of  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), who chairs the LGBTQ-plus Equality  Caucus, for his work.   I want to say that Pride is always a very special time of year. It is  a time of protest, a time of celebration, a time that we remember the  struggles, honor the trailblazers, and appreciate the progress that we  have made in the fight toward equality.   Throughout our history, LGBTQ people have been denied their basic  rights. To this day, LGBTQ Americans across the country still face  discrimination in key areas of life, from housing to healthcare.   While the Supreme Court has ruled to expand nondiscrimination  protections in employment and made marriage equality the law of the  land, in 29 states LGBTQ people aren't fully protected from  discrimination.   That is why we are working hard to get the Equality Act signed into  law.   Discrimination in this country has also been enshrined into policies  at every level, including in the military.   Despite this, thousands of brave LGBTQ Americans have still stepped  up to serve our country in uniform. For decades, LGBTQ members of the  U.S. military and veterans have faced discrimination stemming from  official military policies, including Don't Ask, Don't Tell and the  Trans Military Ban.   Before Don't Ask, Don't Tell became an official military policy,  servicemembers who were LGBTQ had to hide their identities, and those  who were suspected of being LGBTQ were targeted by horrendous and  traumatizing so-called witch hunts, which stripped them of their  dignity and mistreated them based on a suspicion that had nothing to do  with their service.    It is estimated that approximately 114,000 servicemembers were  discharged on the basis of their sexual orientation between World War  II and 2011, while an estimated 870,000 LGBTQ veterans have been  impacted by ``hostility, harassment, assaultive behavior, and law  enforcement targeting'' by discriminatory military policies.   Many LGBTQ veterans who were discharged on discriminatory grounds are  [[Page H2999]]  unable to access their VA benefits, and those still serving face  inconsistent protections that make them vulnerable to harassment and  put their careers at risk.   But the true extent of the harm by discriminatory anti-LGBTQ policies  in the military and at the VA is not known or well understood. To  remedy the harm that has been done, we must reckon with the truth of  what happened and understand the disparate effects of discriminatory  military policies on LGBTQ people.   That is why I have introduced the Commission to Study the  Stigmatization, Criminalization, and Ongoing Exclusion and Inequity for  LGBTQ Servicemembers and Veterans Act, otherwise known as the  Commission on LGBTQ Servicemembers and Veterans Act.   This legislation would launch a comprehensive study on the effects of  discriminatory military policies on affected servicemembers, their  families, and their units to help America learn the full extent of the  harm caused by these policies and the status of protections for LGBTQ  servicemembers today.   There are currently 250,000 Active Duty LGBTQ servicemembers and more  than 1.5 million LGBTQ veterans receiving healthcare from the VA. But  there continues to be a pervasive lack of data collection on LGBTQ  servicemembers and veteran populations and an absence of education for  both members of the military and the general public about members of  the LGBTQ community who serve in uniform. This legislation seeks to  address that.   It is essential for the American people to hear stories of LGBTQ  servicemembers and veterans to understand the stigmatization they  endured while serving our country and to know that, despite this, they  are still immensely proud of their service.                                time  2100    This month, I have been sharing powerful stories of LGBTQ veterans on  my social media. Every video testimonial reveals stories of bravery and  profound love for country. It ends with veterans sharing the same  message: LGBTQ people want and deserve to serve, just like everyone  else.   We have, of course, made a lot of progress as a country, but there is  still a lot of work that needs to be done to make the military and VA  more inclusive. It is my mission as co-chair of the Equality Caucus and  chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs to ensure that we  honor the service of every American who has served, regardless of their  identity.   This past weekend, we saw action that steers us toward that goal. The  Biden administration announced that the VA will begin the first steps  to expand care to include gender confirmation surgery for transgender  veterans. This is truly a first and incredibly significant step that  the VA is taking, and I applaud the VA's decision. Veterans in need of  gender confirmation surgery should not have to seek healthcare outside  of the VA healthcare system or navigate complicated processes to get  the care they need.   This announcement will be life-changing for many, and it is the  result of years of hard work and advocacy on behalf of trans veterans  and allies.   So in honor of Pride Month, we must keep up the momentum, honor all  those who have served our country in uniform, and commit ourselves to  creating a truly equal nation.
