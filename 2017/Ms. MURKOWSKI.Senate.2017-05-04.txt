 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that if the  motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R.  244 is agreed to, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H. Con.  Res. 53, an enrollment correction to H.R. 244, that the resolution be  agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Madam President, I have come to the floor this  afternoon  [[Page S2755]]  to speak on the Omnibus appropriations bill that is now before the  Senate. We will have an opportunity to vote on that very shortly here.   I would like to take a few moments to explain why I intend to support  this legislative measure. I support this bill because I think it is  good for the country, and I believe it is good for my State of Alaska.   I think what we have seen through this appropriations process is a  negotiated bill going back and forth between both sides, between both  bodies, and it is a bill that funds the Federal Government through the  end of this fiscal year. It is far from perfect. I think we recognize  that, but it is tough to find legislation anyplace where we are all  going to be in agreement that it has everything each of us wants. I do  believe it is a solid bill. It is a solid, bipartisan effort, and I  would urge my colleagues to support this bill.   The first thing it does is it prevents the government from shutting  down. Simply put, there are very few things in my mind that would  warrant a government shutdown. The people of this country expect us to  govern. They don't expect us to come to work and say we are going to  shut it down. They expect us to figure out how we are going to fund it,  to keep it open, and to do so in a responsible way that allows for the  priorities to be reflected. I think we have done that.   I feel very strongly that those who would suggest that the way to  deal with things is to shut it down is not the proper approach. That is  why I have supported Senator Portman's legislation to put an end to  government shutdowns. We just don't need disruptions that ultimately  hurt our economy and hurt our families.   I certainly would have preferred a process that would allow for  funding the government by passing appropriations measures on an  individual basis, one by one. My colleague from Vermont, who is on the  floor, has been around for a few Congresses, and he knows that used to  be the way we handled appropriations. We had an approps bill come to  the floor. We debated it. We amended it. We moved it through. We worked  through that process. It was somewhat tediously slow at times, but it  was a very open and collaborative process that I think reflected,  again, the priorities around the country.   What we have in front of us is a measure that did in fact go through  the full appropriations process, all 12 appropriations bills. It made  it through the committee. Sometimes not all of them do, but for fiscal  year 2017, these appropriations bills did.   As we saw at the end of last year, there was an agreement that we  would not move forward with the appropriations bills at that time-- actually, it was probably less than an agreement, but a decision was  made--and we are here, as of May 4, still working on fiscal year 17.   This is clearly not the best option, in my view, in terms of how we  handle our appropriations bills, but it is where we are right now, and  the option we have in front of us, in my view, is clearly the best  option.   Continuing resolutions are just not a way to operate. I think they  are poor policy. Keeping funding at previous levels doesn't allow for  Congress to have any input on any new priorities. In some cases,  programs receive more money than they may actually need at that time;  thus, you have a situation where you are ending up wasting dollars,  rather than being good and efficient stewards of the taxpayer dollars.   I think we saw that with this omnibus bill we have in front of us  now, it gave our new President the opportunity to weigh in. Clearly, we  heard President Trump's priorities expressed not only throughout the  campaign but early in his new administration, his priorities on  national security, making sure that from a defense perspective and  border security, these issues were addressed. I think we have done so  in a responsible way on the defense spending side but also with a  comprehensive approach to border security and utilizing new  surveillance and new technologies.   This bill consolidates or terminates dozens of existing programs and  rejects unnecessary spending tax dollars. It reduces spending and  wasteful programs, eliminates unnecessary, ineffective, and duplicative  programs.   Again, I think what we have put together within this appropriations  omnibus is a spending proposal that does apply the taxpayer dollars  responsibly. Overall, the bill puts real dollars behind our Nation's  priorities by enhancing our national security, investing in education  infrastructure and innovation, as well as improving the health and  well-being of all Americans.   I would like to take just a few moments to speak specifically to some  of the provisions that will be helpful in my State of Alaska. The  omnibus bill sustains Alaska's contributions to our national defense,  helps to protect our fisheries, address high energy costs, helps our  very struggling timber industry in Southeastern Alaska, and helps keep  the Federal Government's commitment to Alaska Natives.   There are some programs that would appear to be pretty small, but in  terms of consequence and impact on Alaska, they are quite significant.   Essential Air Service, we provide funding in this measure that helps  maintain commercial air service to as many as 60 small communities in  the State. The reason it is called Essential Air Service is because in  most of these communities, there is no other way to get to these  smaller communities. There is no road access. There is no other way.  You might be able to run a riverboat out, but in terms of ability to  access, this Essential Air Service is exactly that.   The bill provides for new investments in the Coast Guard that will  help increase safety in Alaska's waters. There are infrastructure  improvements in Kodiak to support homeporting Offshore Patrol Cutters  in the Arctic region and funding for new cutters that we will see  stationed throughout Alaska.   There is a lot going on in the news right now with regard to Russia  and North Korea, and it certainly is front and foremost for Alaskans.  We have our neighbors to the west of us there, in Russia, and of course  we are within range of anything North Korea might consider. So there is  a very keen interest and a desire to ensure that our Nation is  investing in our Pacific and our Arctic defense.   This bill recognizes the issue, and it recognizes the strategic value  that Alaska has. It provides $4.3 billion for the procurement of F-35s,  including some of those that will be based in the interior part of the  State. We saw the need for the next generation of fighter jets in  Alaska when, just a few weeks ago, Russian planes were buzzing the  coast for 4 days straight. Well, today's news reups that. F-22s  intercepted two Russian Bear bombers 50 miles southwest of Alaska,  according to the news this morning.   Again, when you are thinking about the investments we make to provide  for our Nation's security, Alaska sits at the center up there in terms  of strategic location.   There is also money for developing the long-range discrimination  radar at Clear and funds for the ground-based missile defense at Fort  Greely. Again, this is very significant at this time, given the  geopolitics not too far from our State.   Another key part of our Arctic defense strategy is finally being  realized, after years of me kind of pounding on this drum--funding for  icebreakers. As of right now, we are woefully behind when it comes to  our ability to maneuver in the Arctic regions in our waters. So there  is $150 million in advance procurement funding for an icebreaker that  is in the DOD budget and an additional $55 million in the Coast Guard  budget. It is imperative that we move to fund a new icebreaker now.   We also recognize the role the Coast Guard plays in terms of national  defense across the country, particularly in the Arctic. So the bill  provides $1.3 billion in acquisition construction and improvement  money. The Coast Guard needs to recapitalize its aging fleet, and we  see this no more apparent than in Alaska. A ship that was built back in  1971 is still being used to patrol areas that are perhaps some of the  roughest seas in the world. This is not smooth water sailing. Congress  needs to recognize the role played by the Coast Guard, not only in  national defense but in drug interdiction, fisheries patrol, and safety  encroachment, and we must give it the assets it needs to do its job  well.   On the education front, this bill provides funds for our public  schools, including money for programs that were authorized in ESSA. It  funds IDEA,  [[Page S2756]]  Carl Perkins, impact aid, and 21st Century Community Learning Centers.  Especially important for us in Alaska are the programs like ANEEP,  Alaska Native Education Equity Program, strengthening Alaska Native and  Native Hawaiian-serving institutions, tribally controlled colleges and  universities, and Indian education national activities.   We have all come to the floor over the course of these past few  months this Congress to talk about the impact on our communities of the  opioid epidemic in this country. This bill helps to get money where it  is needed to help fight this epidemic.   Over $1 billion is provided to various programs and agencies to  specifically address this problem. Over $600 million of that will go to  SAMHSA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,  including $500 million for a new program that was created by the 21st  Century Cures Act that we passed earlier last year. The CDC, the  Department of Justice, and the VA will see increased funding to help  deal with this scourge of addiction.   As chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  Approps Subcommittee, the division G of the omnibus is of particular  significance to me. The Interior appropriations section probably has  more impact on the State of Alaska than most would realize. It controls  funding levels for the Federal agencies and Departments that have a  huge presence in my State: BLM, Forest Service, EPA, Fish and Wildlife  Service, Indian Health Service, BIA, and National Park Service. These  are all within the auspices of Interior.   I will give you some of the highlights within the Interior bill. This  is the centennial year of the National Park Service so we were able to  do more to help address the maintenance backlog within our park system.   The two agencies that deliver services for Indian communities, BIA  and Indian Health Service, we did our best to support those programs  which are critical to the Indian community. For those agencies, we have  provided full contract support costs. We continue Tribal court funding  for those Public Law 280 States. We have really worked to do what we  can within IHS to address the issues of suicide, domestic violence,  alcohol, and substance abuse programs. Making sure we are doing right  by providing the support for our healthcare facilities is critically  important.   We also have oversight of the EPA within our jurisdiction. I have  heard some criticism from some that we didn't do enough to reduce EPA  spending and then others are saying we took too much from the EPA, but  what we really looked to try to do was to take a commonsense approach,  focus resources on the programs that do the concrete things to improve  the quality of the environment for the public when it comes to clean  air and clean water. We need to effectively make sure that whether it  is the WIFIA program, the State revolving funds for our water and our  waste water programs, making sure we have the resources to do right by  our communities, and making sure there is clean air and clean water,  whether it is the Targeted Air Shed Grant Program, which helps  communities deal with pollution issues and air issues--I think we did a  fair job with the EPA budget.    Again, we have worked to reduce in areas where we are just staffing  up for initiatives that quite honestly have been questioned and  challenged, making sure we are focusing on the priorities that deliver  on EPA's mission, which is clean air and clean water.   Madam President, the last thing I would like to add is what we were  able to do with regard to wildfires because this is an issue for so  many of us in the West. We were able to include funding for wildland  fire management programs to fully fund the 10-year average of  suppression costs, as well as to allow for emergency funding in the  event that we have a catastrophic wildfire season. I think we all  understand the challenges our agencies face when we have fire borrowing  going back and forth. So this is an effort we have long sought to  address, and we will continue to work on that.   It has been interesting to watch and to read the news about this  omnibus. You have the President who said: This is good. This is what  winning looks like. You have Democrats who have said: We won.   It is not about a win for the D's or a win for the R's; it is about  making sure this is right for the country. I would suggest that if both  sides are taking credit, we must have hit the sweet spot somewhere in  the middle.   I think at this place where we are right now, with over 7 months into  this fiscal year, it is well past time that Congress pass a bill that  funds the government for the balance of this fiscal year. These are  uncertain times for the country--uncertain times certainly in my  State--and I think it deserves some certainty from us. It is a good  bill, and I think we owe it to the American people not to create  unnecessary and unwanted drama about whether the Federal Government  remains open for business.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure.   With that, I yield the floor.
