 Madam Speaker, we are all concerned about the growing  spread of coronavirus, and these concerns are not relieved by troubling  stories of shortages of critically needed medical devices, including  respirator masks.   Concerningly, as our healthcare system responds, it is exposing  serious weaknesses in the supply chain for medical devices. These are  products providers depend on to deliver lifesaving care.   That is why, today, with my colleagues Jan Schakowsky from Illinois  and Jody Hice from Georgia, I am introducing important, bipartisan  legislation to help the FDA combat the threat.   My bill would allow the FDA to act expeditiously to address  shortages, including by importing medical devices as needed. It would  ensure that the manufacturers are communicating with the FDA about  expected shortages of medical devices and that this information is  shared transparently with the public.   The FDA already has these authorities to act during drug shortages,  and we should grant them the same ability to respond to shortages of  medical devices.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting  this commonsense bill.                            ____________________
