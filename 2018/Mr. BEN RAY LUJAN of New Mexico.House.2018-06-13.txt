 Mr. Speaker, every community in  America has suffered from the opioid epidemic. These are our moms and  dads, our brothers and sisters, our sons and daughters. All across  America, families are suffering.   This is not a new problem. Earlier this year, The New York Times  wrote about how one of the most distressing truths of America's opioid  epidemic is that it has been with us for 150 years. For more than a  century, this crisis has been breaking communities.   This certainly isn't a new problem in New Mexico. Since 2000, New  Mexico has had one of the highest rates of drug overdose deaths in the  United States. This cycle must be broken because, if there is no  action, America is doomed to see these tragedies repeat for another 150  years.   This week, we are working on passing a package of bipartisan bills to  address this crisis, and that is good. However, if you listen to our  friends on the other side of the aisle, you might think that  congressional Republicans think this problem has been solved.   We need to do more and be more aggressive. As The New York Times  wrote, serious legislation needs to be considered, such as proposals  modeled on the Ryan White CARE Act that would appropriate $100 billion  over 10 years for research, treatment, and support. One of the packages  we have today is a bipartisan approach around the Ryan White CARE Act.  The funding is not sufficient. We can do more.   Last year in Congress, we came together in a bipartisan fashion to  provide a billion dollars to States to address the opioid crisis in the  21st Century Cures Act. We all knew that the billion dollars included  in Cures would only be a first step. That is what people said.   I am going to say today what I said last Congress when we were  debating these bills: While the House is taking a step toward  addressing the opioid epidemic, this is a missed opportunity.   There are good policies in this package of bills, but I am deeply  disappointed in the lack of investment on such an urgent crisis facing  America. Congress can and must do more.   On behalf of 129 people who will die today from a drug overdose,  Congress must do more to address this crisis in a deeply meaningful  way. And to do that, real investment must be made, large dollar  investments that save lives across America.   My bill extends the bipartisan block grant funding passed in Cures  for an additional 5 years. These grants would continue to support  States in their efforts to enhance access to treatment, bolster  substance abuse prevention programs, and expand evidence-based  initiatives that will help address this deadly epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an editorial written by The New  York Times, titled, ``An Opioid Crisis Foretold,'' from April 21, 2018.  [[Page H5111]]                       [From the New York Times, Apr. 21, 2018]                         An Opioid Crisis Foretold                          (By The Editorial Board)         One of the more distressing truths of America's opioid       epidemic, which now kills tens of thousands of people every       year, is that it isn't the first such crisis. Across the 19th       and 20th centuries, the United States, China and other       countries saw drug abuse surge as opium and morphine were       used widely as recreational drugs and medicine. In the West,       doctors administered morphine liberally to their patients,       while families used laudanum, an opium tincture, as a cure-      all, including for pacifying colicky children. In China, many       millions of people were hooked on smoking opium. In the mid-      1800s, the British went into battle twice--bombing forts and       killing thousands of civilians and soldiers alike--to keep       the Chinese market open to drug imports in what would become       known as the Opium Wars.        That history has either been forgotten or willfully ignored       by many in the medical and political establishments.        Today's opioid crisis is already the deadliest drug       epidemic in American history. Opioid overdoses killed more       than 45,000 people in the 12 months that ended in September,       according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.       The epidemic is now responsible for nearly as many American       deaths per year as AIDS was at the peak of that crisis.        Experts say that the death toll from opioids could climb       for years to come. Millions of people are dependent on or       addicted to these drugs, and many of them are increasingly       turning to more potent, illicit supplies of heroin and       fentanyl, which are cheap and readily available on the street       and online. Yet only about 10 percent of Americans who suffer       from substance abuse receive specialized addiction treatment,       according to a report by the surgeon general.                           WE HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE         As many as 313,000 people were addicted to injected       morphine and smoked opium in the United States in the late       19th century, according to David Courtwright, a history       professor at the University of North Florida who has written       extensively about drugs. Another scholar, R. K. Newman,       estimated that as many as 16.2 million Chinese were dependent       on opium and smoked the drug daily.        In the United States today, about 2.6 million people suffer       from opioid use disorder. But some experts say that data,       which is based on a government survey, underestimates the       number of pain patients who are addicted to their       prescription pills because of how surveyors ask people about       drug use; the actual number might exceed five million.        In the 19th century, like today, the medical community was       largely responsible for the epidemic. Doctors did not fully       appreciate the risks these drugs posed. In the 1800s, many       doctors viewed morphine as a wonder drug for pain, diarrhea,       nerves and alcoholism. In addition to getting homemakers,       Civil War veterans and others addicted, many doctors became       addicts themselves. The drug was overused in large part       because there were few alternatives; aspirin, for example,       didn't become available until the late 1890s.        In his 2001 book, ``Dark Paradise: A History of Opiate       Addiction in America,'' Mr. Courtwright notes that the use of       morphine began declining as younger doctors who had been       better trained started practicing medicine and as non-      addictive pain treatments became available. He also notes       that many local governments across the country set up clinics       that sought to help addicts--a forerunner of contemporary       methadone clinics--but a hostile federal government forced       virtually all of them to shut down by 1923. It did so under       the misguided idea that it was wrong to keep supplying drugs       to people who had become dependent on them--a view that is,       regrettably, still widespread today.        Today's opioid crisis has its roots in the 1990s, when       prescriptions for painkillers like OxyContin and Vicodin       started to become common. Companies like Purdue Pharma, which       makes OxyContin, aggressively peddled the idea that these       drugs were not addictive with the help of dubious or       misinterpreted research. One short 1980 letter to The New       England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Hershel Jick and Jane       Porter said the risk of addiction was less than one percent,       based on an analysis of nearly 12,000 hospital patients who       were given opioid painkillers. That letter was widely--and       incorrectly--cited as evidence that opioids were safe.        Federal regulators, doctors and others were swayed by       pharmaceutical companies that argued for greater use of       opioids; there was increasing awareness that doctors had       become too unresponsive to patients who were in pain. Patient       advocates and pain specialists demanded that the medical       establishment recognize pain as the ``fifth vital sign.''        Mr. Courtwright says that this was not a simple case of       historical amnesia. In the earlier epidemic, doctors ``made       mistakes, but it was a bad situation to begin with,'' he       said. ``There was no equivalent of Purdue Pharma flying you       off to the Bahamas for the weekend to tell you about the       wonders of these new drugs.''                            WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?         The AIDS crisis might provide public officials some lessons       for how to move forward. Like with opioids, the federal       government responded to that epidemic by doing next to       nothing for many years. But an organized movement led in part       by people with H.I.V. and gay activists eventually forced       Congress to create and fund new programs. For example, in       1990 Congress approved the Ryan White Care Act, a bipartisan       bill that poured billions of dollars into providing treatment       and support to people with H.I.V. By 1995, the federal       government was spending $3.3 billion a year (about $5.4       billion today after adjusting for inflation) on AIDS efforts,       not including billions spent through mandatory programs like       Medicaid and Medicare, according to the Kaiser Family       Foundation. That was up from just $116 million in 1985.        Though slow to act, Congress eventually treated AIDS as a       complex, multidimensional problem and tackled it by funding       prevention, treatment, support services and research.       Lawmakers provided money to make expensive antiretroviral       drugs accessible to more people and allocated money to help       house people infected with H.I.V., recognizing that they       needed more than just access to drugs.        Lawmakers so far have fallen far short of such a vigorous       effort when it comes to opioid addiction. Congress has taken       what can be considered only baby steps by appropriating a       total of a few billion dollars of discretionary opioid       funding in recent years. This funding amounts to a pittance       relative to what is needed: substantial long-term funding for       prevention, addiction treatment, social services and       research. Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy       research at Brandeis University, says at least $6 billion a       year is needed for 10 years to set up a nationwide network of       clinics and doctors to provide treatment with medicines like       buprenorphine and methadone. Those drugs have a proven track       record at reducing overdoses and giving people struggling       with addiction a shot at a stable life. Today, large parts of       the country have few or no clinics that offer medication-      assisted treatment, according to an analysis by amfAR, a       foundation that funds AIDS research.        Next, lawmakers need to remove regulations restricting       access to buprenorphine, an opioid that can be used to get       people off stronger drugs like heroin; its use is unlikely to       end in an overdose. Doctors who want to prescribe the drug       have to go through eight hours of training, and the       government limits the number of patients they can treat.       These limits have made the drug harder to obtain and created       a situation in which it is easier to get the kinds of opioids       that caused this crisis than to get medicine that can help       addicts. France reduced heroin overdoses by nearly 80 percent       by making buprenorphine easily available starting in 1995.       Yet many American lawmakers and government officials have       resisted removing restrictions on buprenorphine, arguing it       replaces one addiction with another. Some of the same people       have also stood in the way of wider availability of naloxone,       which can help reverse overdoses, and opposed harm-reduction       approaches like supervised drug consumption sites, where       users can get clean needles and use drugs under the watch of       staff who are trained to reverse overdoses.        To stem the number of new opioid users, lawmakers and       regulators need to stop pharmaceutical companies from       marketing drugs like OxyContin and establish stronger       guidelines about how and when doctors can prescribe them.       These drugs are often the last resort for people with cancer       and other terminal conditions who experience excruciating       pain. But they pose a great risk when used to treat the kinds       of pain for which there are numerous nonaddictive therapies       available. Doctors have been writing fewer opioid       prescriptions in recent years, but even the new level is too       high.        Some lawmakers have begun to take this epidemic seriously.       Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Elijah Cummings,       both Democrats, recently proposed legislation modeled on the       Ryan White Act that would appropriate $100 billion over 10       years for research, treatment and support. While that might       seem like a lot, President Trump's Council of Economic       Advisers said in November that the epidemic cost the economy       $504 billion in 2015 alone.        Leaders in both parties are responsible for this crisis.       Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama and members of       Congress did too little to stop it in its earlier stages.       While Mr. Trump talks a lot about the problem, he seems to       have few good ideas for what to do about it. As we've learned       the hard way, without stronger leadership, the opioid       epidemic will continue to wreak havoc across the country.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on ordering the previous question so we can take a  meaningful step toward defeating this crisis.
