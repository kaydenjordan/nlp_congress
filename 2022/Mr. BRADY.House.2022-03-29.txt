 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join with my friend, Chairman Rich  Neal, in jointly reintroducing SECURE 2.0, which will help hardworking  Americans approach retirement with both confidence and dignity.    For 5 years now, members of the Committee on Ways and Means have  worked tirelessly together to ensure Americans have the resources to  save for a secure retirement. A lot of hard work and negotiation has  gotten us to this point, and I am grateful to Chairman Neal for his  commitment to get this bill across the finish line to the President's  desk.   It is important to remember how far we have come in our joint efforts  to help Americans better prepare for their long-term financial goals.  Following the historic rewrite of our Tax Code with the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act, Republicans moved toward building on this success for years  to come.   That happened when the Republicans and Democrats worked together to  develop and enact the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement  Enhancement Act, known as the SECURE Act, the most significant  retirement legislation to become law in over a decade.   We made it easier for Main Street businesses to offer retirement  plans to their workers by easing administrative burdens, cutting down  on unnecessary and often costly paperwork.   The SECURE Act made significant improvements to our country's  retirement system. And today, we will do even more.   A recent AARP survey found that rising prices are taking a big toll  on workers, making it difficult to cover everyday expenses or save for  the future. In fact, with a 40-year high inflation, nearly a quarter of  workers surveyed reported that their financial situation is worse today  than it was last year.   A study also found that nearly 40 percent of workers said that they  have no emergency savings, with one out of five reporting they have  nothing saved for retirement. Nothing.                                time  1615    Both groups peg rising prices of everyday goods as the biggest  barrier for planning for their financial future.   Ensuring Americans have the resources they need for a prosperous  retirement is a bipartisan priority. And with American families'  paychecks falling further behind through rising prices, it has really  never been more important for Congress to help workers get back on  track with their retirement plans.   With this bill we build on the landmark provisions in the SECURE Act,  enabling more workers, especially those with low income and modest  income, to begin saving earlier and giving them piece of mind as they  plan for the future.   Our bill, SECURE 2.0 improves workers' long-term financial wellbeing  by helping more Americans save for retirement at every stage of their  life. SECURE 2.0 contains more than 20 provisions sponsored or  cosponsored by Republicans and Democrats in standalone legislation.   By providing flexibility, for example, we make it easier for local  businesses to tailor retirement plans to best fit the needs of their  workers. These reforms help Americans not only save earlier in their  careers, but helps families save longer as well.   We expand access to workplace retirement by increasing the incentives  for businesses, especially small businesses, to create new plans or  join groups of plans while sharing the cost of administration.   To further help small businesses shoulder the burden of creating a  new plan, our bill matches employer contributions with the new business  tax credit. That can help a small business match up to the first $1,000  in matching contributions for that work.   For those Americans who are further along in their career or already  in retirement, this bill raises the amount these workers can contribute  to catch up on their retirement savings as they near retirement,  doubling it to $10,000 a year. Because we want Americans to save  throughout their lifetime, together we increase the age at which  retirement plan distributions become mandatory to age 75 over time from  72 today.   These changes are especially important because many workers find  themselves making more at the end of their careers and are more open to  focusing on retirement. Those already in retirement often worry about  the effects of mandatory taxable distributions on their long-term  financial plans.   Another recent study by Edward Jones and Morning Consult found 57  percent of Americans who prioritize paying off a student loan are now  behind on their schedule on saving for retirement. Our bill allows  employers to essentially match their workers' student loan repayments  with contributions to the workers' retirement plan.   This means from workers struggling to make ends meet under crushing  student debt and rising prices, they are able to tackle both, paying  off their debt and getting help in working toward a secure retirement.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Neal and the members of the  Ways and Means Committee from both parties for their long-term and  diligent efforts. Together, we will ensure more hardworking Americans  are confident in their retirement.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith), the Republican leader of the Trade Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Schweikert).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I have a few more.    Madam Speaker, I am really proud to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Madam Speaker, first, I include in the Record a number of  letters and documents in support of SECURE 2.0.   Among a litany of letters advocating for swift passage, there are  four I would like to include. These letters are led by the Employee- owned S Corporations of America, the American Benefits Council, the  American Retirement Association, and the Investment Company Institute,  all of which were invaluable members in crafting this bipartisan  legislation.                                                      Employee-Owned                                       S Corporations of America,                                     Washington, DC, March 24, 2022.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways & Means,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways & Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal and Ranking Member Brady: Employee-Owned       S Corporations of America (``ESCA'') applauds your efforts to       advance the bipartisan Securing a Strong Retirement Act. We       are particularly supportive of the inclusion of a key       provision reflecting themes of legislation introduced by       Committee members Ron Kind and Jason Smith to encourage the       creation of more private, employee-owned businesses. We thank       you for recognizing the value of S corporation ESOPs to       worker retirement savings, and for reflecting that       recognition in your important legislation.        ESCA is the national voice for employee-owned S       corporations, and its exclusive mission is to preserve and       promote employee-owned S corporations and the benefits       provided to their employee-owners. Most S corporation       employee stock ownership plans (``S ESOPS'') are 100-percent       owned by their employees. Our S ESOP companies engage in a       broad spectrum of business activities ranging from       manufacturing to construction to playing critical supporting       roles such as retail grocery stores and other essential       functions to America's infrastructure.        As you know well, S corporation ESOPs were created 25 years       ago with significant bipartisan support from Congress. Today       S ESOPs accomplish exactly what Congress intended: they       create jobs, generate economic activity, and promote       retirement savings.  [[Page H3943]]         Both specifically for S ESOP employees and more generally,       your bill will increase retirement savings opportunities at a       time when more than 30 percent of Americans do not have       access to a workplace retirement plan and 20 percent of       Americans have no retirement savings at all. By contrast, we       note, the vast majority of S ESOP companies offer their       workers two retirement plans--typically the ESOP plus a       401(k). This focus on retirement security is a hallmark of       employee-owned companies.        A new study conducted by the National Center for Employee       Ownership found that, heading into and during the pandemic,       employees at S ESOP companies had greater job retention and       retirement security, including more than twice the average       total retirement savings of Americans who work at non-ESOP       companies.        We appreciate you recognizing the value of having more S       corporation ESOP companies and look forward to working with       you to continue to identify more ways to enable more working       Americans to be employee-owners.        Thank you for your leadership.            Sincerely,                                               Stephanie Silverman,      President and CEO.                                   ____         Dear Paige: I am writing on behalf of the American Benefits       Council to express our support for bipartisan retirement       security legislation that will soon be considered on the       floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. This important       legislation follows in the tradition of the Setting Every       Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019.        The forthcoming ``SECURE 2.0'' bill reflects a thoroughness       and thoughtfulness that provides enormous value to the       American worker by expanding access to workplace retirement       plans and removing barriers to financial well-being. We have       recently completed a study of the enormously beneficial       impact of the past 25 years of bipartisan retirement       legislation:        Millions of Americans are facing short-term challenges that       need critical attention. But it is also important to continue       our work on enhancing retirement security because of the       harmful effect of the pandemic on savings and retirement       programs, which were facing challenges even before the       pandemic. As we rebuild our economy, part of that effort       needs to include even greater attention to the role of       retirement programs that have been jeopardized. We look       forward to continued progress in the field of retirement       security and stand ready to assist in those efforts.

Re Letter of Support for the Securing a Strong Retirement Act           of 2022.       Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, Ways & Means Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, Education & Labor Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Ranking Member, Ways & Means Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Education & Labor Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal, Ranking Member Brady, Chairman Scott,       and Ranking Member Foxx: On behalf of the over 30,000 members       of the American Retirement Association (ARA), we hereby       express our support for the Securing a Strong Retirement Act       of 2022. We commend you for championing this important piece       of bipartisan retirement legislation.        The ARA is the coordinating entity for its five underlying       affiliate organizations representing the full spectrum of       America's private retirement system--the American Society of       Enrolled Actuaries (ASEA), the American Society of Pension       Professionals and Actuaries (ASPPA), the National Association       of Plan Advisors (NAPA), the National Tax-Deferred Savings       Association (NTSA), and the Plan Sponsor Council of America       (PSCA). The ARA's members include organizations of all sizes       and industries across the nation who sponsor and/or support       retirement saving plans and are dedicated to expanding on the       success of employer-sponsored plans. The ARA and its       underlying affiliate organizations are diverse but united in       their common dedication to the success of America's private       retirement system.        The Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2022 (SSRA) builds       upon the success of the Setting Every Community Up for       Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act to make it even easier       for small businesses to adopt and maintain a workplace-based       retirement savings plan. The SSRA further increases the small       employer pension plan start-up credit to cover 100 percent of       the cost to small employers to implement a 401(k) plan for       the first three years. The SSRA creates an additional new       credit to encourage small employers to make direct       contributions to their 401(k) plan for their employees,       offsetting up to $1,000 of these employer contributions for       each participating employee.        The SSRA contains several policy items championed by the       American Retirement Association. The first item gives       employers more time to adopt beneficial discretionary       retirement plan amendments up until the due date of the       employer's tax return. This new deadline to adopt a       beneficial discretionary amendment is consistent with the       deadline to adopt a new retirement plan that was provided for       in the SECURE Act. This provision gives employers with       existing retirement plans the flexibility to make their       401(k) plans more generous to rank and files workers after       the end of the year. The second item corrects and modernizes       the outdated and unfair family attribution rules to ensure       women business owners are not penalized if they happen to       have minor children or live in a community property state. A       third item would broaden the scope of the SECURE Act's pooled       employer plan or open multiple employer plan provisions to       allow unrelated public education and other non-profit       employers to join a single 403(b) plan.        The SSRA also creates a retirement plan matching program to       encourage employees to pay off student loans. The latest       version of this program addresses a problem that ARA       identified about the impact this new retirement plan design       feature could have with the special test that applies to       401(k) plans called the average deferral percentage (ADP)       test. Since that problem has been fixed in this bill, small       businesses will now not have to worry that this benefit puts       their retirement plan testing at risk.        While the SSRA has many good provisions, it is not perfect.       The ARA remains concerned about the provision in the bill       (Section 314) that would require at least one participant       benefit statement be mailed in a paper format given the       impact on the environment as well as plan and participant       costs. ARA supports the provision that would direct the       Department of Labor, Treasury, and the Pension Benefit       Guaranty Corporation to issue a report recommending ways to       consolidate, simplify, standardize, and improve the various       retirement plan disclosure requirements. The ARA will       continue to work with Congress on ways to ensure retirement       plan participants are effectively accessing the required       disclosures.        But on balance the Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2022       builds upon the success of the workplace-based retirement       system and is yet another example of the extensive history of       bipartisan legislating in this critical policy area. The ARA       thanks Chairman Neal, Ranking Member Brady, Chairman Scott,       and Ranking Member Foxx for your hard work and results to       improve and enhance the retirement savings of the American       workforce and would urge Congress to enact this bill into       law.            Sincerely,                                       Brian H. Graff, Esq. APM,                                             Executive Director/CEO,      American Retirement Association.                                   ____                                     Investment Company Institute,                                     Washington, DC, March 28, 2022.      Re. Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2022.       Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and Labor      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Neal and Scott and Ranking Members Brady and       Foxx: On behalf of the Investment Company Institute (ICI), I       commend your leadership on the bipartisan Securing a Strong       Retirement Act of 2022 or SECURE Act 2.0, which would expand       access to retirement savings plans and improve Americans'       ability to save.        The ICI urges the House of Representatives to pass this       landmark bipartisan bill as soon as possible and work with       the Senate on a unified package of retirement-savings       reforms.        The ICI notes that the bill would:        Allow savers to keep their retirement savings invested       longer by increasing the age for required minimum       distributions from retirement accounts to 75 from 72;        Ensure that workers get the same ``bang for their buck''       for their retirement saving efforts over time by indexing       individual retirement account (IRA) catch-up contribution       limits to inflation;        Broaden the ability of employers of various sizes, across       different industries to band together in a new type of       multiple-employer  [[Page H3944]]       retirement plan--called a ``pooled employer plan'' or       ``PEP''--created by the original SECURE Act;        Streamline and clarify information retirement savers       receive concerning increasingly popular target date funds by       allowing use of a single benchmark for the funds that more       appropriately tracks its asset allocation;        Allow employer matching contributions based on student loan       payments; and        Simplify and clarify more than a dozen retirement plan       rules.        We hope that the legislation can be further improved by       allowing 403(b) plans to invest in collective investment       trusts.        We wholeheartedly support these provisions and believe your       legislation is vitally important to the country and the       financial well-being of millions of Americans. SECURE Act 2.0       would strengthen our nation's retirement-savings system by       expanding coverage, further increasing savings opportunities,       and streamlining administrative rules. We look forward to       seeing its enactment into law.            Sincerely,                                                    Eric J. Pan,                                                    President & CEO,                                      Investment Company Institute.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Actually, never make that offer to a sitting Member of  Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This has been awfully good work on behalf of the bipartisan Members  of Congress on an issue they believe in. But Chairman Neal and I are  both blessed to have incredibly hardworking personnel, a professional  team.   Madam Speaker, I thank Payson Peabody and Derek Theurer, from our tax  subcommittee team, for the work that they put in, along with Chairman  Neal's folks, to develop this legislation, fine-tune the legislation,  make adjustments as it comes to the floor, and, again, put it in the  format and with the right designs that we think will do great things  for the American people and American workers.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I think one of the things I am most proud of in this legislation  began almost 2 years ago. After the passage of the SECURE Act, Chairman  Neal and I sat down on the floor talking about what more we could do to  help people save for retirement.   What we both talked about is what everyone knows exists, the savings  gap, and what little is being done to address it. This is the gap of  how many Americans will spend their lifetime and save virtually  nothing. When it is time to retire, their retirement isn't in their  hands. It is all owed to government or other help.   We decided we would do the hard work to try to engage millions of  Americans. We know who they are. They don't make lots of money. It is  low income or moderate income. They usually work for a very small  business. They are the toughest to be able to begin getting into that  savings environment.   We designed this bill to really focus on those who have not saved in  the past and, unless we do something differently, were not going to be  saving for the future.   That is why so much of this bill is designed around them. That is why  we help small businesses set up plans.   Here is what we know, Madam Speaker. To have a secure retirement, we  need to make sure a business offers a plan.   Secondly, we need to make sure that worker is part of that plan.   Thirdly, we need to have those contributions matched.   Fourthly, you need to save more over time as your income increases.   This bill really takes significant steps to make sure small  businesses are offering those plans and get help matching those first  thousand dollars.   We use the saver's credit, which is pretty unused these days, and  muscle it up, make it more available to help those with low income  provide those first dollars.   Then, we make the changes so it is easier for small businesses to  either start their own plan or pool with others, as we did in the  SECURE Act, all of which we think are the elements to close that  saver's gap and give Americans who really had no chance to save an  opportunity to do that.   That is what, in my view, is the importance of this legislation, why  I am proud of the work.   Chairman Neal and the Republican and Democrat members of our  committee worked together beautifully on this bill. I think this is an  important one that I urge the Senate to take up and pass as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen), and I ask unanimous consent that he may control  the remainder of the time.
