 Mr. Speaker, lost amidst the tumult of the last  couple of weeks was the quiet passing of an outspoken leader of  California, H.L. ``Bill'' Richardson. H.L., as he was known to his  friends, arrived in the California State Senate with the freshman class  of 1966, part of the Reagan landslide that year.   For every one of the 22 years he served in the Senate, H.L. was a  force to be reckoned with. He served for many years in the Republican  leadership, but he was never ever a political insider. His enormous  influence inside the senate stemmed from the fact that he never joined  that club; he never lost sight of the people who elected him. And he  not only worked tirelessly to serve them inside the capitol, he worked  even harder to organize, inform, and mobilize them outside the capitol.   He founded a multitude of advocacy groups to empower the millions of  Californians who believed in individual liberty and economic freedom.  He started the Free Market Political Action Committee to support free  market principles and the candidates who embraced them, and it became  the inspiration and prototype of groups like the Club for Growth and  Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks today.   In the 1970's, when Jerry Brown first came to power and appointed  radical leftists to the California courts, H.L. founded the Law and  Order Campaign Committee, which became the driving force between the  historic recall of Chief Justice Rose Bird and two of her associates on  the California Supreme Court. That organization went on for many years  to restore common sense to the California courts and criminal justice  system, including pressing the legislature to restore the death penalty  over Jerry Brown's veto.   His passion for the Second Amendment was his most defining cause. He  founded Gun Owners of California to fight the growing movement in  California to disarm law-abiding citizens, and its success not only  beat back Proposition 15, a 1982 initiative to ban handguns in  California, it generated so many new Second Amendment voters in that  election to put George Deukmejian over the top by a tiny margin of  victory over Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley in that Governor's race that  year. Gun Owners of California continues its good work to this day, as  does its spin-off, Gun Owners of America.   H.L. had a wicked sense of humor, and it was keenest when bursting  bubbles of political pomposity. One of his half dozen published books,  still required reading in some college classes, is titled, ``What Makes  You Think We Read the Bills?'' His book, ``Confrontational Politics,''  offers a civilized, but no less resolute, conservative response to Saul  Alinsky's ``Rules for Radicals.''   California, once called ``The Golden State,'' is today drawing more  and more attention as a slow-moving train wreck. The radical left has  now dominated the State's institutions for more than 20 years, and  California is showing all of the political, social, and economic  pathologies that accompany leftist governance: failing schools; rising  crime; chronic traffic congestion; skyrocketing costs of housing,  energy, and water; rampant homelessness; oppressive regulations; the  highest effective poverty rate in the Nation; and a population now  fleeing to other States.   Senator H.L. Richardson held back that tide for nearly 30 years. He  was a mighty seawall that protected California from the left, giving  one final generation of Californians the joy of living in the most  prosperous and beautiful State in the Nation.   But, as age took its toll, his influence waned, the left steadily  advanced, and none of us whom he inspired to follow him has been able  to stop it.   On January 13, H.L. Richardson passed away at the age of 92, and with  him passed the golden California of freedom, opportunity, and  prosperity that he fought so hard, so long, and so effectively to  preserve. Perhaps the day will come when California will see a rebirth  of freedom, and on that day, H.L.'s wisdom, courage, and leadership  [[Page H1020]]  will show that generation the way back.   We can hasten that day by remembering and celebrating his life, his  lessons, and his achievements.                            ____________________
