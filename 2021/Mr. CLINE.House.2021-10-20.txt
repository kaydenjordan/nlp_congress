 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is facing avoidable crises on many  fronts. Because of President Biden's and the Democrats' failed  leadership, Americans are dealing with a border crisis, an inflation  crisis, a spreading crime crisis, and a crisis in Afghanistan. And now,  with the national average for a gallon of gas hitting $3.30 last week-- a 7-year high--we are also facing an energy crisis.   Let me be clear: the responsibility for this crisis belongs at the  feet of none other than President Joe Biden. His anti-energy agenda has  destroyed American jobs and ended America's energy independence. On his  first day in office, the President killed 11,000 jobs by canceling the  Keystone pipeline, and one of his first executive orders paused new oil  and gas leasing on U.S. lands and waters. That executive order alone  will cost approximately 1 million American jobs in the near term and  will decrease U.S. gross domestic product by $700 billion.   That same order also puts America's energy security at risk. To make  up for slowed production in the United States, U.S. imports from  foreign sources will increase by 2 million barrels a day, and through  2030 we would spend $500 billion more on energy from foreign suppliers.  Instead of making it easier for American companies to increase American  oil and gas production and hire more U.S. workers, President Biden  begged OPEC and Russia to increase global output to ease rising prices.   It is a shame. The President has made us more reliant on dangerous  adversaries overseas rather than maintaining policies that had us on  the verge of energy independence.   It would be great if Joe Biden would reverse course and turn, once  again, to an all-of-the-above American energy solution that ensures we  are reliant on no one but ourselves; but, instead, I guess we are just  going to have to lower our expectations.                            ____________________
