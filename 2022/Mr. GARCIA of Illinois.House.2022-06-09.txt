 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Manuelita Garcia.   Manuelita was a force to be reckoned with, a fierce advocate for  justice, a true fighter for the community, and a longtime Little  Village resident.   On Mother's Day, 2001, Manuelita launched Madres de la Villita to  demand the construction of a promised high school in our neighborhood.  I joined her and others as they initiated  [[Page H5431]]  a 19-day hunger strike to push the school board to fulfill their  promise.   Her organizing led to greater support for educational equity and the  eventual opening of the Little Village Lawndale High School.   Manuelita will be remembered for her devotion to the youth of La  Villita. She knew that when we invest in youth, we invest in our  future. Above all, she will be remembered for her commitment to  fairness, justice, and equity.   Manuelita, thank you for your friendship. Rest in power, my friend.                            ____________________
