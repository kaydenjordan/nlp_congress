 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Honorable  Sid Morrison on a lifetime of selfless public service. Sid recently  retired as the chair of Energy Northwest Executive Board, having  dedicated 20 years to supporting northwest public power. And that was  only the latest chapter in a storied career spanning seven decades.   Embodying the spirit and commitment of the Greatest Generation, Sid  served in the U.S. Army, spent 14 years in the Washington legislature,  and was elected to six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives  representing Central Washington, before being appointed as Washington's  Secretary of Transportation.   A lifelong Washingtonian, Sid has long been a role model in the  Evergreen State, and the recently-dedicated Morrison Energy Center in  Richland will serve as tribute to his innovative spirit and enduring  legacy.   A man of humility, compassion, and conviction, it is my honor to call  Sid a mentor and a friend. I ask the House to join me in congratulating  our former colleague on a most-distinguished career and deserved  retirement.                            ____________________
