 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise; because I love my  country, I rise.   And I rise today to ask a question of all people of good will. I rise  today to pose a question: What do you do when the leader of the free  world, when the leader of the country that extolls liberty and justice  for all--government of the people, by the people, for the people, all  persons are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain  inalienable rights--what do you do when the leader of the free world is  a racist? What do you do?   Well, here is what you do: You file a resolution, a resolution  condemning the President for racist comments directed at Members of  Congress.   What do you do? You file Articles of Impeachment impeaching the  President of the United States of America.  [[Page H5830]]    These two things are not mutually exclusive. We can condemn for the  comments that have been made, and we can impeach for the harm that the  comments are causing to our society.   Both of these things can be done, and neither will interfere with the  Mueller report. The Mueller report--some 90 days now the President has  been above the law since the Mueller report was made public.   What do you do? You pass this resolution.   I intend to support it, and I thank the gentleman who filed it for  doing so. I believe it is a good resolution.   One of the statements in this resolution that has been reported  widely is that the President presented racist comments that have  legitimized fear and hatred. I will salute and support the resolution,  but you also will hear this resolution to impeach. I would like to read  to you what it says in part:         Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United       States.    Then it goes on to read:         The aforementioned, Donald John Trump, has, by his       statements, brought the high office of President of the       United States in contempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disrepute;       and has sown discord among the people of the United States;       has demonstrated that he is unfit to be President, and has       betrayed his trust as President of the United States to the       manifest injury of the people of the United States; and has       committed a high misdemeanor in office. Therefore, Donald       John Trump, by causing such harm to the society of the United       States, is unfit to be President and warrants impeachment,       trial, and removal from office.    Those who tolerate bigotry perpetuate bigotry.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule  IX, I rise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the  privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, of high  misdemeanors.   Resolved, that Donald John Trump, President of the United States, is  unfit to be President, unfit to represent the American values of  decency and morality, respectability and civility, honesty and  propriety, reputability and integrity, is unfit to defend the ideals  that have made America great, unfit to defend liberty and justice for  all as extolled in the Pledge of Allegiance, is unfit to defend the  American ideal of all persons being created equal as exalted in the  Declaration of Independence, is unfit to ensure domestic tranquility,  promote the general welfare and to ensure the blessings of liberty to  ourselves and our posterity as lauded in the preamble to the United  States Constitution, is unfit to protect the government of the people,  by the people, for the people as elucidated in the Gettysburg Address,  and is impeached for high misdemeanors that the following Article of  Impeachment be exhibited to the Senate:   Article of Impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of  the United States, in the name of itself, of the people of the United  States, against Donald John Trump, President of the United States, in  maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for high  misdemeanors committed as President constituting harm to American  society to the manifest injury of the people of the United States:   Article I.   The House of Representatives on July 16, 2019, strongly condemned  President Donald Trump's racist comments that have legitimized and  increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color by  saying that our fellow Americans who are immigrants, and those who may  look to the President like immigrants, should ``go back'' to other  countries, by referring to immigrants and asylum seekers as  ``invaders,'' and by saying that Members of Congress who are  immigrants, or those of our colleagues who are wrongly assumed to be  immigrants, do not belong in Congress or in the United States of  America.   In all of this, the aforementioned Donald John Trump has, by his  statements, brought the high office of the President of the United  States in contempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disrepute, has sown seeds  of discord among the people of the United States, has demonstrated that  he is unfit to be President, and has betrayed his trust  [[Page H5858]]  as President of the United States to the manifest injury of the people  of the United States, and has committed a high misdemeanor in office.   Therefore, Donald John Trump by causing such harm to the society of  the United States is unfit to be President and warrants impeachment,  trial, and removal from office.
