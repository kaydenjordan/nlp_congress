 Madam Speaker, President Trump's incitement to  violently overturn the results of a free and fair election is an attack  on our rule of law.   Any President, any Member of Congress who obstructs the electoral  college or attacks judges and the court system when there is no  evidence to support their contentions undermines the public's trust and  confidence in the judicial process.   How do my Republican colleagues expect ordinary citizens to respect  and trust the courts in civil and criminal matters all across this  country? Think about that as you make this decision.   Vote ``yes'' on the Articles of Impeachment.
