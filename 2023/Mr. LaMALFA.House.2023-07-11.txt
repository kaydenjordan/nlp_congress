 Mr. Speaker, one of the cornerstones of our  responsibilities in Congress is oversight of government operations,  whether that is the agencies, the White House, courts, or ourselves.   What are we looking at right now with the Biden administration? They  can't even keep the White House clean and orderly and honorable. The  story coming out on this cocaine issue is embarrassing for the country,  and it is embarrassing that the leader of the free world will not  investigate and provide answers on that and some other tawdry  activities that have gone on on the lawn there during other events.   Accountability is extremely important for people to have faith in  what their government is doing, and to see the Department of Justice  either not doing its job or being weaponized against individuals they  disagree with politically really lowers the faith that people and we as  legislators have in the process here.   We have to do better, and that starts with our ability to have  oversight hearings that are attended and questions that are answered  here in this House, but also maybe a little better self-governance by  the White House and this place of acting right, of doing right, and  being honorable in their jobs.                            ____________________
