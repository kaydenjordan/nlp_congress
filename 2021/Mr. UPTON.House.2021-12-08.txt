 Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Upton for yielding.  [[Page H7524]]    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1667, the Dr. Lorna  Breen Healthcare Provider Act. This bill strikes close to home for me.  I know a gentleman who served in our Armed Forces as an enlisted  hospital corpsman and advocated for this bill.   He responded after the 2011 earthquake in Haiti, working in an  intensive care unit and caring for local residents, even as an  estimated 200,000 lives were lost. He and many of his fellow corpsmen  were teenagers at the time.   Upon returning home, he thought, as this bill calls it, that he was  simply burned out. Many of those he served with would abruptly leave  the service or transition to administrative duties.   After suffering from flashbacks during emergency and medical  situations, though, this gentleman would quietly leave the service as  well, recognizing that he could no longer render the care that he had  been trained to give. It would take nearly a decade for him to begin  accessing mental health resources that he needed.   Madam Speaker, I tell this story, with his permission, of course, to  make two points.   First, that widespread provider burnout can lead to staffing  shortages.   Second, that many times we use the phrase ``burnout'' to hide deeper  wounds. Burnout implies a short-term change, one that seemingly heals  with a break or a vacation. But as our hospitals have overflowed in  places with COVID patients, burnout can be something more serious.    That is why this bill is important. It establishes a communication  campaign to educate and encourage providers to seek care. It will  decrease costs by establishing grant programs for providers who use  that care, and it will produce cutting-edge science on the problem of  burnout among physicians.   Madam Speaker, let me close by saying that all healthcare providers  should know that accessing the resources this act will provide is a  good thing. It means they are still human enough to appreciate the  tragedies they experience.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Madam Speaker, first of all, I thank the leadership on our committee.  I thank Mr. Pallone, Ms. McMorris Rodgers, Mr. Guthrie, and obviously,  Chair Anna Eshoo, and our staffs for moving this legislation forward.   Madam Speaker, this is a very important bill. All of our healthcare  workers, particularly in this COVID pandemic, are really heroes. They  are, without exception. All of us know many of these workers because  they are our neighbors and friends. And each of us have heard those  cries of woe as they have done their job every day, every day, day  after day for 24/7.   I can't imagine how they do it; watching so many folks suffer as they  try to help them from their hospital beds. Passing on the sad words  that they passed away to family members, maybe not even in person  because of this terrible pandemic. And thinking of the hundreds of  thousands of Americans that have died because of this awful disease,  let alone so many more across the globe.   Well, one of those healthcare workers who was well-publicized at the  time was Lorna Breen, a physician from Charlottesville, working on the  front lines of the pandemic in New York, moving up there to try and  help the need. And, yes, as it was mentioned, took her own life.   This was a national story. It gripped the Nation. I can remember  watching the news show that week as this tragic story was portrayed. It  outlined the severe stress that this pandemic has put on our healthcare  workers and the need for the resources that they need to help them  cope. The demands that our healthcare heroes are facing, they have not  changed. They haven't changed yet. For months, for a year-and-a-half,  they have been asked to care for communities in my district in  Southwest Michigan and across the country 24/7 as the pandemic  continues. This bill helps us have their backs.   Madam Speaker, I talk to major hospitals in my district every week.  And the common refrain that we have been hearing throughout the State  of Michigan is that our hospitals are still strained to the breaking  point. Staff shortages are severe. I saw a story a few hours ago but I  think the State of Maine is now taking up their National Guard. We have  asked for national help from President Biden as well in Michigan. There  have been too many examples of healthcare workers that are suffering  from this enormous pressure as they fight the worst public health  crisis in a century.   This legislation is going to help promote mental and behavioral  health for those healthcare professionals, improving their overall  well-being and maybe even saving their own lives. This bill helps  promote mental and behavioral health among those working on the front  lines of the pandemic. It supports training for health professionals to  prevent suicide and burnout, and it increases awareness about suicide  and mental health concerns among their peers.   I am glad that we are considering this important bill and that we  will vote on it yet tonight. I look forward to having it being signed  into law.   Again, I thank the bipartisan cooperation on both sides of the aisle.  Hopefully, we can get our Senate colleagues--and I know that they are  with us on this--to work together to get this bill to the President as  soon as we can. We can't wait another day.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am ready  to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, this is a great bill. We need to vote for  it without delay, and I thank my chairman. I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 4555, the Oral Health  Literacy and Awareness Act of 2021, sponsored by my Energy and Commerce  Committee colleagues, Representatives Bilirakis and Cardenas.   We all know that oral health plays such an important role in an  individual's overall health and well-being. A lack of proper oral  hygiene has been proven to increase the risk of chronic health  conditions.   However, good oral hygiene and dental checkups, in addition to  increased education, can help patients avoid most oral health ailments.  It is so important for kids to develop healthy habits at a young age.   This bill directs the Health Resources and Services Administration to  develop a public education campaign to increase oral health literacy  and awareness. By increasing such, the bill will promote good oral  health habits and will help to prevent the development of avoidable,  complex medical conditions in the future.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I remind  them this bill, as I recall, passed unanimously in the committee and  should not be a problem. I thank my chairman and ranking member for  getting this bill to the House floor quickly.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would again urge my colleagues to support  this bill passed unanimously in the greatest committee on the face of  the Earth.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
