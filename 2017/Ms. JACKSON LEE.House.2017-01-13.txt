 I thank the distinguished gentleman.   Mr. Chairman, I stand in opposition to this reckless, irresponsible,  heartless, and bare bones Republican budget resolution because it does  nothing to provide jobs for the American workers; it does nothing to  invest in the roads, bridges, ports, cyber networks, and other  infrastructure that is needed to sustain economic growth; it explodes  the deficit and enriches those who are already wealthy at the expense  of middle and working class families.   In particular, this foolish rush to repeal the Affordable Care Act  makes plain for all to see that congressional Republicans are far more  interested in scoring political points with their rightwing base than  they are in protecting the health and economic security of American  families.   Thirty million people will lose their insurance; the insurance market  will be in shambles; and families left behind will have higher  premiums. We will close rural hospitals; and hospitals will lose  billions of dollars and might reduce services and cut jobs. The economy  will lose 2.6 million jobs.   Repeal and replace is just a straw man. It is about real lives, like  Pamela Gross', who suffers from chronic lupus and a number of other  autoimmune disorders that have required her to spend upwards of $5,000.    I thank the gentleman.   She writes: ``I asked my doctor recently, `With all that's going on,  would I make it without treatment?' The doctor's answer: `No.'''   In her instance, if the Affordable Care Act goes--if is it repealed-- she could completely lose her eligibility for expanded Medicaid and  simply die. A young man in my district would die as well.  [[Page H495]]    This is a bad bill. Vote against it. Save America's good health.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to S. Con. Res. 3, the  Congressional Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2017, which more  appropriately should be known as the ``Make America Sick Again''  Budget.   I stand in opposition to this reckless, irresponsible, heartless, and  bare-bones Republican budget resolution because it does nothing to  provide jobs for American workers; does nothing to invest in the roads,  bridges, ports, cybernetworks, and other infrastructure needed to  sustain economic growth; and explodes the deficit and enriches those  who are already wealthy at the expense of middle and working-class  families.   Let us be very clear about the real objective of our Republican  colleagues: their sole purpose in bringing this resolution to the floor  is to pave the way for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the  defunding of Planned Parenthood by a simple majority vote in the  Senate.   This foolish rush to repeal the Affordable Care Act makes plain for  all to see that congressional Republicans are far more interested in  scoring political points with their right-wing base than they are in  protecting the health and economic security of American families.   Mr. Chair, the Affordable Care Act has been an undisputed success,  making access to quality affordable healthcare available to more than  20 million Americans who previously lived with the dreaded fear that an  unexpected injury or illness to them or a family member would go  untreated or could bankrupt their families.   While House Republicans may pine for a return to those bad old days,  the large majority of Americans do not because they understand that  repeal of the Affordable Care Act will have devastating consequences  for working families, women, and the economy.   Mr. Chair, health care experts, governors, and hospitals warn that  repealing the ACA without a comprehensive plan in its place will cause  chaos and catastrophe, including:   1. Nearly 30 million people would lose health care coverage,  including more than 4 million kids;   2. With the individual insurance market in shambles, families  remaining in what's left of it could face higher premiums and fewer  choices as insurers exit;   3. Hospitals would lose billions of dollars and might reduce services  or cut jobs; and rural hospitals would close.   4. The economy would lose 2.6 million jobs in 2019, with the majority  in non-health sectors.   Additionally, eliminating Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood  would severely restrict women's access to comprehensive care such as  contraception, cancer screenings, and STI tests and treatments.   Mr. Chair, Republicans claim they have a replacement plan for the  Affordable Care Act but the truth is they do not have a plan now nor  have they in the past nor will they in the future.   ``Repeal and Replace'' is an empty slogan and is about as serious as  the President-Elect's promise of ``something terrific.''   Republicans have had seven years to produce and coalesce around an  alternative to the ACA, and they totally failed.   The reason for their failure is they are afflicted with Obama  Derangement Syndrome that blinds them to the ACA's substantial and  positive improvements in people's lives.   Without the ACA, insurance companies could continue to make their own  rules, and deny coverage based on a person's health status or job,  offer lousy benefits, and impose annual and lifetime limits.   Without the ACA, seniors would still face the Part D donut hole and  have to pay more for drugs, and parents would not be able to keep their  kids on their plan until age 26.   Without the ACA, 20 million people would not have gained coverage,  and we would not have the lowest uninsured rate on record.   If Republicans really thought they could match this record of  success, they would have unveiled and campaigned on their alternative  plan in the last election or at least reveal it to the American people  right now.   It is immoral to put families, the health care system, or our economy  at risk by repealing the ACA, hurting the economy, ballooning the  deficit, and giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts to  corporations and the wealthy.   Mr. Chair, the constituents of the 18th Congressional District of  Texas, which I am privileged to represent, are not buying the `Repeal  and Replace' bill of goods that Republicans are selling because they  know the Affordable Care Act, which they lovingly call ObamaCare, has  brought peace of mind and security where before there was only worry  and fear.   Here are some of the ways the Affordable Care Act has made a positive  difference to the residents of my congressional district:   1. Coverage for the Previously Uninsured.   Up to 193,000 individuals in the district who lack health insurance  will have access to quality, affordable coverage without fear of  discrimination or higher rates because of a preexisting health  condition.   2. Tax Credits to Make Insurance Affordable.   Under the ACA, tax credits are available to assist individuals and  families purchase the private health insurance they need.   The amount of these tax credits range from $630 to $4,480 for  individuals and from $3,550 to $11,430 for a family of four.   This benefits as many as 446,850 constituents in my congressional  district.   3. Extra Benefits for Seniors.   More than 4,100 seniors in my district receive prescription drug  discounts worth an average of $828 per person.   4. Extended Coverage for Young Adults.   11,400 young adults in the district now have health insurance through  their parents' plan.   5. No Exorbitant Out-of-Pocket Expenses, Deductibles or Co-Pays.   121,000 individuals in my district--including 23,000 children and  50,000 women--now have health insurance that covers preventive services  without any co-pays, coinsurance, or deductible.   6. Premium Rebates.   113,000 individuals in my district are saving money due to ACA  provisions that prevent insurance companies from spending more than 20%  of their premiums on profits and administrative overhead.   7. No Discrimination for Pre-Existing Conditions.   In my district, up to 46,000 children with preexisting health  conditions no longer can be denied coverage by health insurers.   8. No Annual or Lifetime Caps on Coverage.   153,000 individuals in my district now have insurance that cannot  place lifetime limits on their coverage and no long face annual limits  on coverage.   It is said often, Mr. Chair, but is no less true, that the federal  budget is more than a financial document; it is an expression of the  nation's most cherished values.   As the late and great former senator and Vice-President Hubert  Humphrey said:         The moral test of government is how that government treats       those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who       are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are       in shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped.    It is for this reason that in evaluating the merits of a budget  resolution, it is not enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal  responsibility.   To keep faith with the nation's past, to be fair to the nation's  present, and to safeguard the nation's future, the budget must also  pass a ``moral test.''   The Republican budget resolution fails both of these standards.   Because the American people deserve to know exactly what ills  Republicans have in store for them, I strongly oppose S. Con. Res. 3  and urge all Members to join me in voting against the reckless, cruel,  and heartless measure that will do nothing to improve the lives or  well-being of middle and working class families.   Pamela Gross dreads repeal of Medicaid expansion. Still, millions of  people like Gross, could face immediate effects. While her disability  allows her access to Medicare coverage, she also relies on Medi-Cal,  California's Medicaid program, to help pay for costs Medicare doesn't.  Gross says she was insured before Obamacare became law. But her Medi- Cal coverage, which she relies on to pay her monthly premiums and co- pays, hung in the balance each year when she received a Supplemental  Security Income cost of living increase. The minor jump in pay  threatened to push her out of eligibility for the program, which would  leave her without the means to pay for a private insurance policy and  the doctor visits and medications she says her life literally depends  on.   ``I asked my doctor recently, with all that's going on would I make  it without treatment?'' The doctor's answer: ``No,'' Gross says.   Because Obamacare expanded eligibility for Medicaid and increased the  program's income limits, Gross no longer has to be concerned each year  that the cost-of-living increase she receives from her SSI income will  throw her out of coverage. That would change if Medicaid expansion is  eliminated as part of the law's repeal.   ``If they repeal I could completely lose eligibility,'' she says. ``I  would die.''    I thank the gentleman specifically for a clarity on  the status of General Mattis as the legislation is written.   I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, that all of us who stand make  sure the American people know of our greatest respect and honor for  General Mattis. His history of service to this Nation, his tactical  expertise, and his ability to acknowledge the constitutional  underpinnings of which this Nation is based is without question. But we  have, as my colleagues have said on the other side of the aisle, a very  serious moment in history.   In the public domain is a conspicuous intrusion of Russia and the  election of 2016. There is also knowledge of other areas of which they  have used the cyber system for cyber warfare.   The talent of military persons is welcome, but that is the strength  of this Nation: that we don't yield and bend this little book called  the Constitution, which has, as I indicated, its essence being that our  Nation is governed by the civilian population under principles of  democracy and equality, the recognition of the three branches of  government, and the separation of our military and civilian operation.                                time  1430    This waiver is extraordinary. This waiver, I believe, undermines the  very sense of the freedom of our military, its ability to counsel as a  separate entity, and it undermines, again, the idea that in 1947 our  Congress decided to acknowledge and only waived to General Marshall  because of the potential concern and catastrophe of the Korean  conflict, now Korean war. It has not been done since.   So I would ask my colleagues whether or not we are going to bend--not  bend the arc toward justice and recognition of the Constitution, but  bend at any moment of convenience. I do not believe that this is a time  in history to bend for convenience.   I believe General Mattis would agree, with his very fine record, that  civilian control of the government should be superior and raise the  question himself, if asked, whether or not this waiver is for this time  and for now and whether or not we are in such a moment of history that  that waiver needs to be granted. My view is that it does not. My view  is that we should, in essence, adhere to the regularness of  constitutional premise and also to recognize the well-established  separation of civilian and military.   At this time, I want to thank General Mattis for his service, and I  would argue that this resolution should receive a ``no'' vote from our  colleagues in the United States House of Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to S. 84, which provides an  exception to a limitation against appointment of persons as Secretary  of Defense within seven years of relief from active duty as a regular  commissioned officer of the Armed Forces so that the President-Elect  can nominate Gen. James Mattis to serve as the next Secretary of  Defense.   Gen. Mattis retired from active duty in 2013, which under current  law, makes him ineligible for appointment as Secretary of Defense.   Civilian control of the military has been a bedrock principle of our  democracy since the founding of the Republic.   That principle has served the nation well and there is no reason to  depart from from 66 years of precedent in strictly protecting the  American principle of civilian control over the military.   Indeed, in the history of the Department of Defense, the only Defense  Secretary ever given a waiver was then-Secretary of State, General  George Marshall--who was provided an individual waiver in 1950 at the  height of the Korean War in a stand-alone bill approved by the  Congress.   It is not the service of the individual nominated or his or her  fitness to serve that is in question, but the dangerous precedent that  would be set by entrusting leadership of the Department of Defense to a  retired military person whose active duty military experiences have not  been moderated by the tempering effect of life in the civil sector.   I urge all Members to join me in voting against S. 84.
