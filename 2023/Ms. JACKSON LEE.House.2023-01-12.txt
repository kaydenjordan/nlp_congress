 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for his  leadership and recognition that when we speak about this legislation  and the question of blocking the utilization of the petroleum reserve  during times of crisis, we must raise a question.   Obviously, having experienced a big freeze in Houston and the State  of Texas, where 151 people died, we had to face the question of a very  poor energy system; a lack of access to fossil fuel, I must admit; a  frozen nuclear system; and being unprepared in terms of alternative  energy. It was a freeze that we had never experienced in Texas.   The idea of the utilization of the petroleum reserve for me is a  national security issue, and this legislation literally says if the  President has the need and necessity to protect the American people, it  will not be allowed.   Mr. Speaker, I have to rise in opposition, even coming from what has  been called previously the energy capital of the world. What we want to  have in Houston, and I believe in the Nation, is a multidisciplined  recognition that there is a climate crisis, but at the same time  recognizing the importance of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for, in  fact, the necessities of the President to be able to provide for this  Nation.   The American people are listening. They want an executive who can  make decisions that will block the Russians from absolutely crippling  us. They want a President who can utilize this reserve.   Today, I stand against this legislation because it baffles me as to  how we can undermine the President of the United States in serving the  American people and providing for energy relief when necessary.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 22--Protecting America's  Strategic Petroleum Reserve From China Act.   It is critically important that we opposed the Republican effort to  put together half-baked solutions to nuanced energy policies.   This bill is yet another Republican attempt to appear tough on China  and for them not taking responsibility for their misguided actions in  2015 when they reversed the 40-year ban on exporting crude oil-- including exporting to our foreign adversaries.   This bill does nothing to prevent the sale of oil to China, whether  from the strategic petroleum reserves or otherwise, because American  companies can simply buy the oil and sell it to China for a profit.   This legislation will result in unwarranted and unnecessary restraint  on the ability of the president to act in a time of crisis or a  national emergency.   We should not be passing legislation that will restrict the  president's ability to help American working families, as he did when  he used the strategic petroleum reserves in response to Putin's illegal  invasion of Ukraine.   If we really want to address this issue in a common sense and  expansive manner, then we should instead adopt the Democratic  alternative to this ill-conceived Republican bill now under  consideration.   In the 117th Congress, under the leadership of Energy and Commerce  Committee Chairman Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), the Democrats introduced the  Buy Low and Sell High Act, which would implement a comprehensive  approach to protect American interests.   The Democrats' Buy Low and Sell High Act not only bans the export of  oil from the strategic petroleum reserves to China, but it also bans  sales to North Korea, Russia, Iran, and any other country under U.S.  sanctions.   If Republican's were serious about protecting and refilling the  strategic petroleum reserves, they would work with Democrats to pass  the Buy Low and Sell High Act that advances a comprehensive approach to  American energy policy.   We must take a wide-ranging, bipartisan, and strong approach to  ensure that the president can support all Americans, and especially  working-class families during times of national energy crisis.   We must take a strong bipartisan approach to ensure that we do not  allow our politics to cloud our judgment and hamstring the president's  ability to bring down gas prices in times of need.    Madam Speaker, let me, first of all, acknowledge  Damar Hamlin for his courage and his fight to survive. Welcome home as  he is discharged from a Buffalo hospital so that he can recover. That  is the kind of strength that represents America, and though I am not  from Buffalo, let me salute the Buffalo Bills.   I rise today, Madam Speaker, to speak about the child and to ask  America: How does a 6-year-old shoot a teacher?   From the research from the University of Pennsylvania, the answer is  that children become shooters because they have access to guns. So in  my congressional year 2023, I am going to demand that this Congress  claims this as the Year of the Child.   As a founder of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I am going to  call upon my Democrat and Republican colleagues to join this caucus to  be able to establish the premise that no child should go to bed hungry;  no child should be without housing or good education; and no child  should get off a school bus and be shot as two children were in  Washington, D.C.   Stop the gun violence. Let this be the Year of the Child. Let us lift  up our children so they can be healthy adults.                            ____________________
