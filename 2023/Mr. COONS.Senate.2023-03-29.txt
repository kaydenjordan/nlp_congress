 Madam President, today I would like to talk about  S. 316, a bill to repeal the authorizations for use of military force  against Iraq. It is well past time to repeal the 1991 and 2002 AUMFs.  Congress must reaffirm its constitutional authority over war powers,  and this vote goes a long way toward asserting the way in which our  leaders choose to wage war and use force. Iraq is now a key partner for  the United States in the Middle East. I hope the vote today will not  only affirm our cooperative and strategic relationship with the  country, but also begin a new chapter in U.S.-Iraq bilateral relations.  While I was unable to vote in person in its favor, I support the  passage of this bill without amendment.                            ____________________
