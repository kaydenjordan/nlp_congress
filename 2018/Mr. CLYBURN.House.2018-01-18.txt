 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White  House. The responsibility to govern rests squarely on their shoulders.  Democrats stand ready to keep government open, but neither Speaker Ryan  nor Leader McConnell seem interested in finding bipartisan solutions.  Maybe they are adhering to President Trump's admonition that we need a  ``good government shutdown.''   House Democrats wholeheartedly disagree. We ought to work together in  a bipartisan way to help our veterans, to fight the opioid epidemic, to  protect millions of workers' pensions, and to help the DREAMers.  Today's CR is the fourth kick of the can. Once again, Republicans are  engaging in legislative sleight of hand, shamefully using low-income  children as political pawns. The Children's Health Insurance Program  provides health insurance for 9 million low-income children. Every  Democratic Member of this body supports it.   Republicans allowed it to expire more than 4 months ago and have  refused to bring it up on its own until they can get something in  return. That is wrong. What good is health insurance if you have  nowhere to go when your child is sick? Republicans leave community  health centers and disproportionate share hospitals out of their  temporary authorization.   Mr. Speaker, we could save $6 billion if we permanently authorize  CHIP. We should fund community health centers and protect  disproportionate share hospitals for 2 years. We should permanently  repeal the cap on therapy services for seniors in Medicare. We should  fund the highly successful home visiting program for 5 years.   And we could do all of this by passing Representative Donald  McEachin's Advancing Seniors and Kids Act. I urge my Republican  colleagues to stop playing games with the children's health. Reject  this grotesque political calculation, and let's work in a bipartisan  way to keep government open.
