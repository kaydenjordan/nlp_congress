 Mr. Speaker, today's vote is about love. The love that  couples have for each other and the government's role in respecting  that love regardless of their sex or race. Same-sex couples and  interracial couples get married for the same reason others get married:  to make a lifelong commitment to the person they love.   Yet, for too long, our government has rejected that love. They told  these couples they were less than--that their marriages weren't valid;  that they didn't deserve the affirmation or protections that come with  legal recognition.   The Supreme Court made clear in Loving, Windsor, and Obergefell that  this rejection of interracial and same-sex couples and their commitment  to one another was unconstitutional. Today, we have the opportunity to  send a clear message to worried couples that the Federal Government  will continue to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages, no  matter what the future holds.    To Mr. Jordan's suggestion that this is not necessary--tell it to the  millions of LGBTQ families that are worried about the Supreme Court's  intention to rip away more freedoms. They have taken away the freedom  to reproductive care. They have hinted at taking away contraception.  Justice Thomas urged them to look at marriage equality. This is real  for families.   When you talk about inflation, all families are dealing with the cost  of fuel and food, but we don't have to layer on top of that another  fear about the sanctity of your marriage. This is about a fundamental  fairness in our system, ensuring that people can marry the person they  love.   If it is not necessary, then vote for it. If you are right that we  are worried and we shouldn't be, reaffirm it. But don't hide behind  that to justify your refusal to vote for marriage equality in this  country, that every single American has the right to marry the person  they love.
