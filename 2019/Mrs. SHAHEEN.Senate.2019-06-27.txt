 Mr. President, today I wish to salute Clyde  Terry for his many years of dedicated service and staunch advocacy on  behalf of people with disabilities. Clyde is retiring from his longtime  role as CEO of Granite State Independent Living, and he leaves a legacy  worthy of our praise and our gratitude.   Granite State Independent Living--GSIL--is a nonprofit that breaks  down barriers for seniors and people with disabilities and expands the  training and support services available to them. Its mission is  grounded in a firm belief that all people have a right to define their  own level of independence. Under Clyde's leadership, GSIL has blossomed  into an essential statewide organization with a $17 million budget and  several awards and accolades to its name, including Non-Profit of the  Year Awards from Business NH Magazine, NH Business Review, and the  Greater Concord Chamber of Commerce. Service offerings have grown as  well to meet the aging, education, and employment challenges faced by  so many across the Granite State.   Clyde has tapped into a wealth of experience to build GSIL into an  expansive and responsive organization that remains committed to its  founding principles of personal choice and direction. Before his tenure  at GSIL, he was  [[Page S4625]]  the executive director of the New Hampshire Developmental Disabilities  Council, a State agency tasked with protecting the rights of our  State's most vulnerable citizens. While affiliated with the council, he  coauthored a report on the accessibility of polling locations in the  United States and established himself as a national expert on election  reform. He was also an administrative hearings officer in the State's  service systems, and before that, he helped to create and implement New  Hampshire's Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Throughout his  career, Clyde has shown an unrivaled passion for improving the lives of  the disabled, the aged, and the impoverished.   I was honored to recommend Clyde when a vacancy arose on the National  Council on Disability in 2009. As a member of the council, he became a  sought-after voice on the potential of autonomous vehicles to broaden a  sense of independence among people with disabilities. He was also a  force in fighting for fair pay and equal treatment in the workplace.  Clyde was eventually named chairperson of the council, a testament to  his leadership and communication skills and his fluency on the broad  set of issues in the disability community.   I have known Clyde for decades. We worked together on Gary Hart's  1984 Presidential race. Though the campaign eventually ended in  heartbreak, Clyde emerged from the race having met Susan, who would  become his beloved wife of many years. As Governor of New Hampshire and  U.S. Senator, I always appreciated Clyde's guidance and counsel.   On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all  Americans to join me in thanking Clyde Terry for his years of service  and advocacy and wishing him all the best in the years ahead.                            ____________________
