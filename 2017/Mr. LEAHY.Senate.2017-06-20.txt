 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana. I have  hiked in his State before, and it is a wonderful place. Their mountains  are a tad higher than ours, but both my wife and I love hiking in the  mountains, and I have enjoyed his State.    Mr. President, in Vermont, we believe in forging resilient  communities through strong local governments and in fostering well- informed leaders to understand and respond to the many complex issues  facing us today. The Vermont League of Cities and Towns, VLCT, embodies  these principles and more, and I am delighted to contribute in honoring  the league and its members on its 50th anniversary.   Established in 1967, the VLCT was created to help improve local  governance. Local officials needed a way to help towns best serve their  constituents and to connect members of their communities with their  local governments. In response, a handful of municipalities formed the  organization that provided these services. Beginning with VLCT's first  executive director and continuing through today, this organization has  consistently worked to represent the values of all Vermonters. For the  first time in 1995, every city and town in Vermont had joined as  members of VLCT, demonstrating how valuable this institution is for all  of our communities regardless of their size.   For many years, I too have worked alongside VLCT to improve the lives  of Vermonters. Whether through their efforts supporting the State's  recovery from Tropical Storm Irene or improving the water quality of  Vermont's rivers and streams, their dedication to Vermont's way of life  and quality of life makes us all better. They provide direction and  advice and support our municipalities in their timely and important but  often underfunded responsibilities.   As a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, VLCT will always be there  to support us, to support Vermont communities. Our great State is made  better by the involvement of organizations like the VLCT, and I wish  them continued success over the next 50 years in bettering the lives of  all Vermonters.                            ____________________
