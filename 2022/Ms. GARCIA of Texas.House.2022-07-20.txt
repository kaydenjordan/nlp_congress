 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House  Democrats and their efforts to protect women and their reproductive  rights.   In 2020, more than 930,000 women had an abortion nationwide,  exercising their fundamental human right. These are women who made one  of the most intimate and personal decisions for their family and their  futures.   However, with the decision to overturn Roe, the Republican-controlled  Supreme Court has achieved the dark and extreme goal of stripping away  a woman's right to choose. In doing so, they erased nearly five decades  of progress. For the first time in America's history, our daughters  have less freedom than their mothers. This is plain and simply  shameful.   To make matters worse, now MAGA Republicans are determined to take it  a step further and strip women of their right to contraception. I  repeat: Extreme rightwing Republicans want to strip women of their  right to birth control.   House Democrats won't stand for this. We are fighting for you. We  trust you. We always have, and we always will.   Today, we will act. We will continue to fight. Tomorrow, we will pass  the Right to Contraception Act to protect women's access to birth  control.   We are doing this to protect the more than 60 percent of U.S. women  of reproductive age who use contraception. This bill will guarantee the  right to obtain and use oral contraception, emergency contraception,  and IUDs because no one--and I mean no one--should have the right to  take away a woman's right to choose their own healthcare.   While Republicans seek to control a woman's body for their political  base, Democrats remain the party that puts people over politics and  protects women and their reproductive rights.   It is simple. Democrats trust women. We trust women to make their own  healthcare decisions without any questions.   To everyone listening, you have my promise that I will never stop  fighting for women and their reproductive rights. I trust you, and I  will never stop fighting.                            ____________________
