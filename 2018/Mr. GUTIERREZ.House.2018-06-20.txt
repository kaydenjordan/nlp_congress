 Madam Speaker, I want to thank all of my colleagues  from all over the United States. I would like to ask them all to please  step forward and bring your guests. Every Member of Congress is allowed  two children under the age of 12. Please bring them forward with you.   I think more powerful than anything I could say is to stand with  children. Please. Please. We only have 5 minutes, but let's take the  minutes so the children can step forward. Please bring them forward.  All of the Members of Congress, you are all allowed under our rules to  have two children.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore     Madam Speaker, under the protection of Members of the  U.S. House of Representatives, we are here with the children because we  believe that this is what is important.   I want to thank all of my colleagues, I know that the rules do not  allow all of you to speak. But I think you speak with your presence  here and with these children in your arms.   I want to tell you something. I know this is a tragic moment, but  this weekend, I couldn't have felt prouder to be an American. I  couldn't have felt prouder about just what our exceptionalism is.   I saw Americans everywhere across this country standing up for  children, standing up for those who are in need, and standing up for  moms and dads who are being separated.   Let's celebrate, too, that America sees this injustice, sees this  cruelty, sees this evil, and did not remain silent. That is the America  that I am so happy I was born into.   We have a great country. Let's remember that. So let's keep the  fight. Let's keep the fight for these children who are here. They are  so beautiful.
