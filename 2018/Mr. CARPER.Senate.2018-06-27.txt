 Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to  allow the District of Columbia to receive funding and other benefits  under the Coastal Zone Management Act. I am pleased to offer this  companion legislation to a bill, H.R. 2540, introduced by the  Congresswoman from the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton.   Few of us realize that 70 percent of the District is located within  the coastal plain. Similar to my State of Delaware, sea level rise,  upstream sources of water and degraded infrastructure mean that the  District could experience serious future cleanup and repair costs due  to flooding--including damage to federal property, which makes up  almost 30 percent of the District. Since 1950, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports there has been a 343 percent  increase in nuisance flooding in the District. And, since 2006, DC has  experienced two 100-year flooding events, and District officials  estimate that a future 100-year flood event could cause over $1.2  billion in damages. Needless to say, these events will become more and  more common due to climate change and sea level rise.   The District of Columbia would use funding from the Coastal Zone  Management Program for flood risk planning and environmental  restoration to prevent and mitigate future flood damage. At the same  time, this work would help to restore and conserve the District's  coastal resources such as habitat, fisheries, and endangered species.   If included in the Coastal Zone Management Program, the District of  Columbia would be eligible for $1 million or more of federal funding  annually to assist in coastal flood-control projects, to combat non- point source water pollution, and to develop special area management  plans in areas experiencing environmental justice and/or flooding  issues.   The National Coastal Zone Management Program, housed in NOAA, was  established through the passage of the Federal Coastal Zone Management  Act of 1972. At the time, Congress recognized the need to manage the  effects of increased growth in the nation's coastal zone, which  includes jurisdictions bordering the oceans and the Great Lakes.   There are currently 34 jurisdictional coastal zone management  programs, including both states and territories. In order for the  District of Columbia to participate in the program, Congress must pass  this amendment to the Coastal Zone Management Act that would include  the District under the definition of a ``coastal State.'' Thank you,  Mr. President.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3146         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Flood Prevention Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2.

Section 304(4) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972       (16 U.S.C. 1453(4)) is amended by inserting ``the District of       Columbia,'' after ``the term also includes''.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to  allow the District of Columbia to receive funding and other benefits  under the Coastal Zone Management Act.
