 Mr. Speaker, June is Alzheimer's Awareness Month.  Alzheimer's is a progressive disease that leads to memory loss and  other challenges in brain and physical function. Ultimately, it is  fatal.   More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's, including  over 220,000 residents of Illinois. Every 66 seconds, another American  is diagnosed with this disease, and the rate of new cases are  increasing. It has become our Nation's sixth leading cause of death.   Last year, Congress and the White House worked in a bipartisan manner  to enact the 21st Century Cures Act. The legislation transforms our  health research system to speed up the fight against Alzheimer's and  other diseases, but that is just the start. Let's keep working together  to end this devastating disease.                            ____________________
