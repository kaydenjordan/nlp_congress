 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the rule in  order that the Quigley amendment restore funds to prevent Russian  interference in our elections.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my fellow Texans in  honoring Tarrant County Commissioner Roy Charles Brooks for a  tremendous year of leadership as president of the National Association  of Counties.   For over 30 years, Commissioner Brooks has fought for underserved  communities across Tarrant County. As a community volunteer, a city  elected official, and county commissioner, his integrity, innovation,  and fervor to help others has touched generations of Texans.   He has taken on issues such as healthcare for the homeless, infant  mortality, obesity, criminal justice reform, mental health, and AIDS  education; and this past year, he worked tirelessly to bring awareness  to his presidential initiative Serving the Underserved: Counties  Addressing Poverty.   The project has pushed over 3,000 counties to look at the role they  play in alleviating poverty and to develop best practices to address  vital societal needs, especially as pertain to early childhood  development.   Through his work, he has created a community family that supports and  lifts each other up, building hope and faith across Tarrant County. I  honor his lifetime of work and his dedication to advocating for the  toughest issues that our communities face.                            ____________________
