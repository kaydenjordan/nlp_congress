 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, universally  respected Senator Joe Lieberman provided an extraordinary op-ed in The  Wall Street Journal: ``President Trump's order to take out Qasem  Soleimani was morally, constitutionally, and strategically correct. . .  . No American can dispute that Soleimani created, supported, and  directed a network of terrorist organizations that spread havoc in the  Middle East.'' In Syria, ``more than 500,000 Syrians have died.''   ``During the Iraq war, Soleimani oversaw three camps in Iran.'' These  trained fighters have killed more than 600 American troops.   The claim that President Trump ``had no authority to order this  attack without congressional approval is constitutionally untenable and  practically senseless. Authority to act quickly to eliminate a threat  to the U.S. is inherent. . . . Democrats should leave partisan politics  at `the water's edge' and . . . stand together against Iran and  dangerous leaders like Qasem Soleimani.''   Senator Joe Lieberman tells the truth.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism, with the courage and  leadership of President Donald Trump.                            ____________________
