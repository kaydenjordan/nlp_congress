 Mr. Speaker, how tragic it is that before  House Republicans skip town, they will steal from Medicare, pass an age  tax on older Americans, say that children with autism are a preexisting  condition, and tell folks: If you have diabetes, you are paying $5,600  more.   This morning, I heard from many hospitals, doctors, and nurses across  Illinois. They know what families need to be taken care of and to be  healthy. They do not believe that stripping 24 million Americans of  their health insurance is in the best interests of our national health.   To my eight Illinois colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle,  if you vote ``yes'' on this bill, the eight of you own its aftermath in  our State; you own the 47,000 jobs that you will kill; you own the  health of the million-plus Illinoisans who will be stripped of their  health insurance.   Let's kill this horrific bill and work together to make health  insurance affordable and accessible for all.
