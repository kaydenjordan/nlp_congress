 Mr. Speaker, Austin, Texas, is known as the Live Music  Capital of the World, and every year millions of people come from  around the world to my district to enjoy concerts and events.   Venues like Songbird Live in Cleburne, Hudson's on Mercer Street in  Dripping Springs, and Mohawk in Austin play a crucial role in our  culture. During COVID-19, these venues have faced devastation as they  were the first to close and will be among the last to open.   In order to provide relief, I am proud to introduce the bipartisan  Save Our Stages Act with my colleague, Peter Welch, to create a grant  program that will ensure they have the resources needed to survive.   American music legends that rose to fame once graced their stages  that are currently empty and motionless. They moved the young and old  alike and inspired the next generation of artists.   It is my hope that our venues, with the help of Congress and our  communities, will be able to once again welcome their next act to the  stage. I urge consideration and passage of this vital bill.
