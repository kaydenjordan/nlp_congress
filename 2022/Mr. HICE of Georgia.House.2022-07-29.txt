 Madam Speaker, I am amazed at how my radical  friends on the left now are so concerned with the lives of children  when they literally stand and cheer and celebrate the killing of 3,000  through abortion every single day.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule that allows the  consideration of the assault weapons ban.   What we have going on right now is a complete disregard for regular  order that started yesterday and is continuing here today. The House  floor is being run like a circus, quite frankly, and the American  people deserve better than this.   They continue, the Democrats do, to ram legislation through without  proper notice and without even markup in committees. The floor should  be run with at least a basic sense of decorum, and that is totally out  of control right now. There is a complete lack of respect for the rules  and the norms of this historic institution and how it should be run.   As for the legislation being considered, it is just another attempt  by the radical left to once again take away the Second Amendment rights  of the American people.   Madam Speaker, time and time again, the left here has tried to  disregard and trample the constitutional rights of the American people.   This bill is full of, among other things, questionable definitions  that show that the left doesn't even know what they are talking about  when it comes to the issue of assault weapons.   Madam Speaker, I implore my colleagues to vote against this rule and  the previous question, as well.
