 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Brady and Chairman Neal.   I really appreciate the opportunity to come here to once again remind  our colleagues that, if there is one thing that we ought to do right in  this institution, it is to help Americans recover from a disaster that  they didn't ask for. We did that by coming together for the CARES Act.   The PPP program in Illinois, alone, has made 69,893 loans to our Main  Street businesses, worth almost $16 billion. But I want to tell you  about one person who still has a need: Lindy McDonald of Myler  Automotive Repair in Champaign, Illinois. She kept all of her  employees. She is keeping her business going even though customers are  down. She is still in the queue to get funded by what we do today.    Vote ``yes'' for this legislation, and I thank you for the  bipartisanship.
