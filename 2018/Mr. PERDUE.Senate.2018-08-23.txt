 Mr. President, today, I want to remember and pay tribute  to Mr. Powell Moore, a native Georgian, veteran, and patriot who passed  away earlier this month.   Mr. Moore was a native of Milledgeville, GA, and a graduate of both  the University of Georgia and Georgia Military College. Over the course  of his life, Mr. Moore served in the U.S. Army, aided two U.S. Senators  and four Presidents, gave back to the community, and positively  influenced those around him.   Mr. Moore served as a U.S. Army infantry officer in Germany. He  worked as Senator Richard Russell's press secretary for 5 years, and  over 30 years later, he returned to the U.S. Senate to serve as Senator  Fred Thompson's chief of staff. He was Deputy Director of Public  Information at the Department of Justice. He was a White House aide to  President Richard Nixon, President Gerald Ford, and President Ronald  Reagan. He was an Assistant Secretary of State under Reagan and an  Assistant Secretary of Defense under President George W. Bush. He  represented the Department of Defense in Vienna, Austria, at the  Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and in 2005, he  was awarded the DOD's Medal for Distinguished Public Service.   Clearly, Mr. Moore was a man of accomplishment and service to his  country. Perhaps the greatest measure of his accomplishment, however,  is the manner in which he conducted himself.   Throughout his career, Mr. Moore was universally respected by both  political parties. He was known for investing in those around him,  mentoring generations of America's future leaders of all political  stripe. Mr. Moore served as president of both the Senate Press  Secretaries Association and the Association of Former Senate Aides. He  gave back to both of his alma maters, serving on the board of visitors  for the University of Georgia's journalism school and as a trustee for  the Georgia Military College Foundation and the Richard B. Russell  Foundation.   Mr. Moore leaves behind a legacy that his family, friends, and  certainly all Georgians and Americans can be proud of. His life is an  example of true servant leadership and the American Dream. It is  humbling to honor his memory today. My wife, Bonnie, and I join fellow  Georgians and Americans in offering condolences and prayers to Mr.  Moore's family and friends during this time.                            ____________________
