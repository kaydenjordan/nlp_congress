 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded and I be permitted to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, the passing of former Senator Kay Hagan  was sad news to all of us who were privileged to serve with her and  counted her as a friend.   In her final address to the Senate 5 years ago, Senator Kay Hagan  reminded us of our obligation to work together on behalf of the  American people with these words: ``To whom much is given, much is  expected.''   Kay Hagan was given much. She had the energy, intelligence,  dedication, and compassion, and she gave back to her home State over  many years of public service. As a person of deep faith, she fully  understood the New Testament ``Parable of the Talents.'' Its message  that gifts must be put to use in service of others guided her life.   In this time of sorrow, I offer my deep condolences to Kay's family.  I hope that they will find comfort in knowing that Kay left an  inspiring legacy. She left the world a better place for her service.  The loss felt by the people of North Carolina and by her family, in  particular, is felt by people throughout America.   I was privileged to serve with Kay for 6 years. We served together on  the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I always appreciated her focus  on solutions rather than partisan advantage. She was passionate about  many issues, particularly those affecting children.   In 2011, Kay and I introduced legislation to commemorate the work at  the March of Dimes by minting a coin to celebrate the 75th anniversary  of this organization and directing the proceeds to the March of Dimes  Prematurity Campaign. As the author of the Newborn Screening Saves  Lives Reauthorization Act, Kay reaffirmed her belief that we in  Congress must always remember whom we are advocating for.   When Kay took office in 2009, she was very proud to be one of 17  Senators who were female. It is significant that her very first speech  on the Senate floor that January was in support of the Lilly Ledbetter  Fair Pay Act to strengthen protections for women against wage  discrimination.   It was so refreshing to hear her assert that neither party had a  monopoly on good ideas. Throughout her time in this Chamber, she proved  the truth of that maxim.   In the ``Parable of the Talents,'' the master leaves on a journey and  entrusts a servant with a portion of his treasure. Upon his return, the  master is delighted to find that his wealth has been wisely invested  and multiplied.   Kay Hagan was entrusted with the great treasure of principles,  determination, and spirit. She invested that treasure wisely and  multiplied its benefits for all. Like the master in the Parable, to Kay  Hagan we say: ``Well done, good and faithful servant.''   May God bless her and her family and may we all keep her memory in  our hearts.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am about to offer the managers' package  for the four appropriations bills currently before us: Commerce,  Justice, Science, Agriculture, Interior and the Transportation,  Housing, and Urban Development bill. This managers' package includes 45  amendments, many of which--indeed, most of which--have been offered on  a bipartisan basis. They have been cleared by both sides.   The Appropriations Committee has worked very hard with Members to  accommodate as many amendments as possible. For the T-HUD  appropriations bill, for example, both Senator Jack Reed and I worked  to review, approve, and clear managers' amendments in our part of the  bill.   This package reflects a positive step forward as we move toward final  passage of this appropriations bill. It is imperative that we move  these bills and go to conference with the House. Therefore, I urge all  Members to support this managers' package.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to offer  the following amendments: Lee amendment No. 1209 and Jones amendment  No. 1141, as modified. I further ask unanimous consent that no second- degree amendments be in order to these amendments prior to the votes,  and that at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, October 31, the Senate vote in  relation to these amendments in the order listed.   Finally, I ask unanimous consent that upon resumption of the bill on  Thursday, October 31, the following amendments be called up and agreed  to en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table: Tester amendment No. 953; Smith amendment No. 1023;  Hirono amendment No. 1037; Brown amendment No. 1088, as modified;  Baldwin amendment No. 1099; Whitehouse amendment No. 1121; Thune  amendment No. 1133; Jones amendment No. 1143; Smith amendment No. 1149;  Rosen    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S6293, October 30, 2019, third column, the following  appears: Finally, I ask unanimous consent that upon resumption of  the bill on Thursday, October 31, the following amendments be  called up and agreed to en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table: Tester amendment No. 953;  Smith amendment No. 1023; Hirono amendment No. 1037; Brown  amendment No. 1088, as modified; Baldwin amendment No. 1099;  Murkowski amendment No. 1121; Thune amendment No. 1133; Capito  amendment No. 1143; Smith amendment No. 1149; Rosen      The online Record has been corrected to read: Finally, I ask  unanimous consent that upon resumption of the bill on Thursday,  October 31, the following amendments be called up and agreed to en  bloc, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table: Tester amendment No. 953; Smith amendment No.  1023; Hirono amendment No. 1037; Brown amendment No. 1088, as  modified; Baldwin amendment No. 1099; Whitehouse amendment No.  1121; Thune amendment No. 1133; Jones amendment No. 1143; Smith  amendment No. 1149; Rosen    ========================= END NOTE =========================    amendment No. 1161; McSally amendment No. 1163; Reed amendment No.   1217; Stabenow amendment No. 1223; Cornyn amendment No. 1224; Warner   amendment No. 951; Capito amendment No. 1077; Cantwell amendment No.    1094; Toomey amendment No. 1129; Durbin amendment No. 1146; Gardner   amendment No. 1150; McSally amendment No. 1234; Sinema amendment No.     1025; Ernst amendment No. 1079; Ernst amendment No. 1081; Cornyn    amendment No. 1151; Cardin amendment No. 1159; Rosen amendment No.     1160; Thune amendment No. 1162; Peters amendment No. 1182; Cornyn   amendment No. 1193; Menendez amendment No. 1199; Blunt amendment No.   1211; McSally amendment No. 1215; Collins amendment No. 1220; Schumer    amendment No. 1227; Hassan amendment No. 956; Collins amendment No.    1002; Shaheen amendment No. 1005; Kaine amendment No. 1010; Cortez    Masto amendment No. 1061; Cortez Masto amendment No. 1062; Heinrich   amendment No. 1114; Shaheen amendment No. 1130; Hoeven amendment No.                   1214; and Portman amendment No. 1235.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, following the disposition of the Jones  amendment, the postcloture time on amendment No. 948 expire, the  pending McConnell amendment be withdrawn, and amendment No. 948, as  amended, be agreed to; further, that the cloture motion on H.R. 3055 be  withdrawn, the bill be read a third time, and there be 2 minutes of  debate equally divided; and that following the use or yielding back of  that time, the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended, with a  60-affirmative-vote threshold required for passage. Finally, I ask that  the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2740 occur at 1:45  p.m. on Thursday.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 377.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 389, submitted earlier  today.    I know of no further debate on the measure.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 390, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, October 31; further, that following the prayer and the  pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings  be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate resume  consideration of H.R. 3055, under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent  [[Page S6308]]  that it stand adjourned under the provisions of S. Res. 390 as further  mark of respect for the late Kay Hagan, former Senator from the State  of North Carolina.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:38 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, October 31, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
