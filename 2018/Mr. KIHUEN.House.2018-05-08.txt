 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Carrie  Parsons. Carrie always made sure to live her life by her favorite  saying: ``live, laugh, and love.''   She enjoyed playing intramural softball and working at the staffing  firm, Ajilon. Carrie recently got engaged in Hawaii to the love of her  life, and they were excited to start their life together.   She went to the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1 with four  of her friends for a girls trip. Carrie always loved dancing and  singing to her favorite country songs, and she made sure to ensure  everyone was having a good time. Her friends remember her as being a  ``one in a million friend'' who was young, vibrant, and full of life.   I would like to extend my condolences to Carrie Parsons' family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
