 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding  teacher from Wakulla County, Florida's Second Congressional District.  [[Page H1232]]    Katrina Roddenberry, a science teacher at Wakulla Middle School, was  selected by the Space Foundation as one of 31 educators worldwide who  were honored for her work promoting science and space curricula at  Wakulla Middle School. Along with this honor, Ms. Roddenberry and her  colleague, Melissa Martin, were selected to work with NASA as part of  their Microgravity University for Educators 2018 Challenge.   This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will give these teachers and four  of their students the chance to work directly with the experts at NASA.  It is clear that they are inspiring a love of science and space in  their students. These teachers are forming not just strong minds but  also strong characters and big hearts in young men and women with a  sense of community.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Ms. Roddenberry and  thanking her for instilling a love of science and space in our next  generation                            ____________________
