 Mr. Speaker, Cody Stashak grew up in Mays Landing in  south Jersey. He graduated from Oakcrest High School in 2012 where he  played baseball for the Falcons and went on to attend Cumberland County  College for 2 years where he played baseball, as well.   Cody moved on from our south Jersey district to St. John's University  in New York where he continued to excel in his sport. Now Cody has  moved to the major leagues. Cody was drafted to the Minnesota Twins in  2015 where he was mainly used as a relief pitcher.   This year Cody made his major league debut in a recent game against  the New York Yankees where he allowed only four hits and he struck out  three. Cody, your talent and dedication are admirable, and we are so  impressed with how far you have come.   Cody might be in Minnesota now, but we know that he is south Jersey  through and through and his south Jersey community is rooting for him.  I am happy to say that I have known Cody's father and his grandfather  through the years, and I know how proud they are and how proud south  Jersey is of its star.                            ____________________
