 Mr. Chairman, it is an honor to serve  beside Mr. Davis.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today with my adamant opposition to H.R. 4617,  otherwise known as the SHIELD Act.   I think my Republican colleagues would agree that this bill is  misleading at best and should be more effectively monikered as the  First Amendment suppression act.   Simply put, this bill is an extension of House Democrats' efforts to  federalize the election process away from the States by substantially  restricting free speech through governmental overreach. Furthermore, it  does not actually do anything further to secure our elections from  foreign interference.   In the buildup to the 2016 election, Russian operatives broke many  existing U.S. laws in their attempt to spread misinformation. Nothing  in SHIELD would provide additional resources to law enforcement  officials to pursue these foreign actors.   Additionally, this bill will create a chilling effect on free speech  by punishing organizations that have nothing to do with politics, and  it mandates Federal overreach on a substantial scale.   The SHIELD Act even gives the Federal Government the duty of  determining what qualifies as a legitimate news source.   To combat this recklessness, I actually offered a commonsense  amendment that Democratic leadership would not consider for debate. It,  simply enough, would have struck the word ``legitimate'' from the  section because it is vague, overbroad, and open to subjective  interpretation. Do we really want the Federal Government deciding on  what is or is not a legitimate news outlet?   Two minutes is not enough time to fully detail the unintended  consequences of the SHIELD Act, which I intend to vote against later on  today on the floor.
