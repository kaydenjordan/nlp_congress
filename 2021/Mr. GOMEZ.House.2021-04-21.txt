 Madam Speaker, I rise in memory of Juana Sequeira Solis,  who passed away in April at the age of 94. Juana was the mother of  former Congresswoman, former Secretary of Labor, and now L.A. County  Supervisor Hilda Solis.   Juana was born in 1926 in Nicaragua, the eldest of five. She  immigrated to America when she was just 18, in search of a better life.   After moving to Los Angeles, Juana met her late husband, Raul Solis,  while taking citizenship classes. They raised seven children and taught  them the values that define who we are as Americans: the importance of  community, education, and respect for our environment.   Juana spent over 20 years on the assembly line at Mattel and was an  active union member with the United Rubber Workers until her retirement  in 1991.   Let us always remember Juana for her kindness, determination, and  fighting spirit.                            ____________________
