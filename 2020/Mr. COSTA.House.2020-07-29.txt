 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stress the importance of  investing in programs that expand opportunities for every person in  every corner of our Nation, including my district in California's San  Joaquin Valley.   Just last week, we passed a spending bill that will benefit our  farmers, repair aging water infrastructure, help food-insecure  residents from going hungry, support revitalization efforts on our  public lands, and combat the climate crisis by cleaning our air.   This week, we have an opportunity to make further investments in the  future sustainability of our Nation.   Face it, Mr. Speaker, we are living off the investments our parents  and grandparents made a generation ago.   The availability of a reliable supply of water is the foundation of  the San Joaquin Valley's economy and, I might add, California and much  of the West, which grows food that feeds the world. As we say, where  water flows, food grows.   We also must ensure access to clean drinking water so our communities  can thrive. No one should have to worry in the richest nation in the  world of having access to clean water in their homes.   These bills will provide more than $100 billion to help repair the  aging valley canals, such as the Delta-Mendota Canal, the Friant-Kern  Canal, and the California Aqueduct, which are critical to delivering  water to not only our farmers but to our valley communities.   These bills would also make small, disadvantaged communities safer  and healthier by providing nearly $1 billion for infrastructure  repairs, communities like Dos Palos, Livingston, Fairmead, and Los  Banos in the San Joaquin Valley to name but a few. It also provides  more than $10 billion for clean water and drinking water State  revolving funds, which are important. It matches funds and is the best  use of money.   We have been living off these investments, as I said, for way too  long. The  [[Page H3886]]  coronavirus pandemic has worsened Americans' food insecurity crisis as  we have witnessed, but with this bill we have an opportunity to ensure  hungry Americans, especially children and seniors, have access to  nutritious food.   For more than 50 years, hungry Americans have relied on the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to keep from  going hungry. These are the working poor and young and old alike.  Thirty-eight million Americans, including 25 percent of my  constituents, depend on these programs.   Throughout my time in Congress, I fought to increase funding and  expand eligibility for this program, which has come under constant  attack from the administration, and I don't understand it. There has  never been a right time to cut support for the most vulnerable  residents in our country, and doing so now certainly is not righteous  in dealing with this worldwide pandemic.   The package also includes significant funding for agriculture  research programs to help mitigate crop diseases, eradicate invasive  species like the navel orange worm, and also has cost billions of  dollars in California's agriculture economy. In addition, we need to do  more for farmworkers' safety, people who are working in partnership  with farmers to, every day, put food on America's dinner table, as well  as for our packing sheds and our food processing facilities.   The climate crisis is having an unquestionable impact on the planet.  This bill makes significant investments to preserve America's  landscapes and prevent the worst impacts of climate change.   California's San Joaquin Valley, unfortunately, has some of the worst  air in the Nation. By providing $450 billion in grant funding for the  Diesel Emission Reduction Act, this bill will help replace and retrofit  emission diesel fuels for cleaner burning options to help clean our  air.   These DERA grants have already removed dozens of air-polluting  vehicles from our valley roads, creating immediate and tangible  results. I have worked for decades to improve our air quality and  remain committed to finding resources to improve our environment and  reduce pollution.   In California, sadly, we have wildfires that have caused incredible  destruction and hardship to California's mountain communities. There  are estimated to be more than 100 million dead trees in the State from  multiple causes. This spending bill will provide nearly $6 billion to  help maintain our forests and fight deadly fires. We must do more to  manage our fires and prevent devastating fires. This bill will help us  do just that. That is why these appropriations bills are so important.   Finally, it makes strong investments in our nature preservation,  wildlife conservation, and ecological protections by providing $500  million to support areas like San Luis National Wildlife Refuge near  Los Banos, the important refuge area for the Pacific Flyway between  Canada and Mexico, an important wildlife refuge.   This spending bill prioritizes public health and safety, invests in  our aging infrastructure, protects the environment, and prepares us for  a brighter future. I am proud to vote for it, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same in a bipartisan fashion.   Finally, we must also pass a bipartisan version of the HEROES Act for  all the right reasons, which is contained in that legislation: for our  States, for our counties, for our cities, for those who work there, for  our healthcare workers, for further testing, and to create a safety net  for American agriculture.   I encourage my colleagues across the aisle to do that as well. We  must work together during this pandemic that is affecting all of our  country and the entire world.                            ____________________
