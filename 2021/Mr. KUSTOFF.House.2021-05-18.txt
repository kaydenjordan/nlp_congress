 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in the memory of my friend  and a great Memphian, Arnold Perl.   Arnold was known as a devoted husband, father, grandfather, friend,  and strong advocate. While Arnold Perl was born in Texas and raised in  Chicago, Memphis was Arnold's true home. He earned his undergraduate  and law degrees from the University of Illinois and, in 1968, moved to  Tennessee. Memphis remained his adopted city until his passing on May 4  of this year.   After he came to Memphis, Arnold founded his own law firm, Young &  Perl, a law firm focusing on labor law and labor-management relations.  Arnold later served as a member of the well-known Memphis law firm  Glankler Brown, where he represented some of the biggest Fortune 500  companies.                                time  1015    Arnold also argued cases before numerous State and Federal courts,  the U.S. Court of Appeals, and the United States Supreme Court.   As a lawyer, Arnold was sought after for his impressive skills, his  expertise, and his extensive knowledge of the rule of law. Since 1983,  he was listed in each edition of The Best Lawyers in America and even  served on its advisory board.   Without a doubt, Arnold was an extremely accomplished lawyer, but his  passions went beyond the law.   For over 30 years, Arnold served as a strong and committed member of  the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority. For 16 of those years,  from 1996-2012, he was its chairman.   Through his leadership, Arnold played a vital role in making the  Memphis International Airport into one of the top hubs in the world.  Working in conjunction with FedEx, Arnold helped the Memphis airport  become the world's largest cargo airport.   He also facilitated the relocation of the Tennessee Air National  Guard's headquarters, which helped promote growth for Memphis.   Arnold was chairman of the New Arena Public Building Authority, where  he oversaw the development of the FedExForum, the home of the Memphis  Grizzlies and the Memphis Tigers.  [[Page H2427]]    This was a huge accomplishment for Memphis, as it brought great  economic development and unity to the community.   During its construction, Arnold's mantra was to build the facility on  time and on budget. Indeed, the FedExForum was built in 3 years and on  budget.   Most importantly, Arnold was a dedicated member of the Memphis Jewish  community and was devoted to his faith. He served as the 45th president  of Temple Israel in Memphis, from 2006-2009.   Arnold was passionate in his advocacy for Israel. In 1983, he and his  wife, Mary Lynn, were two of the founding members of the AIPAC chapter  in Memphis. Arnold was devoted to educating people on the importance of  a strong U.S.-Israel relationship.   Ultimately, Arnold was not only a gifted lawyer; he was a true civic  giant, a fierce advocate, a faithful individual, and a loving family  man. He worked tirelessly to make Memphis a better place for all to  live.   His two daughters, Stephanie and Laurie; and his two sons-in-law,  Jeff and Jonathan, who he saw more as sons, said that their dad  followed four pillars that he adopted from one of his mentors: Family,  faith, professionalism, and community.   Roberta and I extend our deepest sympathies to Mary Lynn, his loving  wife of 55 years; their daughters, Stephanie and Laurie; his sons-in- law, Jeff and Jonathan; his six grandchildren, and the rest of his  family and friends.   May his memory be a blessing.                            ____________________
