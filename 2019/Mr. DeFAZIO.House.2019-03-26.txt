 Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves),  the ranking member of the House Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on the veto message of the President of the United  States to the joint resolution, H.J. Res. 46.    Madam Speaker, today, we will vote to override the  President's veto of Congress' bipartisan action to terminate his so- called national emergency declaration. The bottom line is that this  emergency declaration is nothing more than an end run around a  majority, a bipartisan majority, of both the House and the Senate, in  complete disregard of our constitutional system of separation of  powers.   There is no doubt that we have a broken immigration system, and  comprehensive reform should be a subject of congressional deliberation.  But today, in particular, we have a new crisis. It is a humanitarian  crisis, but the President has said that this wall will solve  that problem.    He also says that this is about drugs. Well, let's talk about that,  if we could.   Here we have walls that are static. It is very old technology that  has been used for many centuries, as we know. Most recently, when the  French built the Maginot Line, the Germans went around it in 24 hours,  similar to what the President is proposing. He wants a wall on part of  the border.   If the problem were people illegally crossing, they would cross in  other areas where there is no wall, but that is actually not the case.  He says that this will stop the flood of people who are coming to the  border. These are not the historic people who were crossing the border  legally to come to the United States for the purposes of work and to  remit funds home or those who were illegally smuggling drugs through  remote areas. This is a humanitarian crisis.   This is recently in Tijuana, a photo of a flood of people coming to  actually two areas where we have walls and fences, wanting to surrender  to the Border Patrol and claim asylum, or coming to places where we  don't have walls and fences, searching for Border Patrol agents so they  can claim asylum.   A wall is going to do nothing to deal with the humanitarian crisis,  and we need to take a much more thoughtful approach to that.   Secondly, he says it is about drugs. He makes a big deal about this  contributing to the deaths in the opioid crisis, fentanyl, and all  that. Of course, the Chinese are shipping in fentanyl in other ways. It  is not coming across the Mexican border. Maybe we ought to do something  about that.   We have tried with walls to prevent the smuggling of drugs. The drug  smugglers are very creative. They have used rather primitive devices.  That is a catapult. They have used drones. They frequently use tunnels.   We found out, in the trial of El Chapo Guzman, that their preferred  route is not some remote area that is unwalled but, actually, to come  across at the legal border crossings here. It is such a big business,  they can modify a semi tractor-trailer, put in a fake floor, and send  10 in a day. We only inspect 1 out of 10. Therefore, they get nine  through. They lose one truck, millions of dollars' worth of drugs in a  truck, and they don't care. It is a multimillion-dollar business.   We need new tools and technology at the legal border crossings. In  particular, we need that so we can scan 100 percent of the vehicles. We  are going to have to reconfigure the border crossings. We have to bring  in the equipment. We have to hire more personnel. These are very  expensive undertakings.   Instead, we are going to waste money on a static wall, which isn't  going to stop the drugs. Even more than that, the former Commandant of  the Coast Guard testified that they have actionable intelligence, they  think, on about 80 percent of the maritime drug shipments targeting the  U.S., mostly from Central America, some from other Asia-Pacific areas.   They can only act on one-fifth of the actionable intelligence because  they don't have the personnel. They don't have the ships. They don't  have the helicopters. They don't have the tools they need to interdict  those maritime drug shipments.  [[Page H2807]]    We are going to waste money on a stupid, static wall. Meanwhile, the  drugs are going to flood in on a maritime basis or through the legal  border crossings.   Last year, the Republicans--this is supposedly a crisis, and somehow  it wasn't a crisis when the Republicans controlled the Congress up  until the beginning of this year. They refused to appropriate funds for  the wall. Then the President shut down the government for 35 days, the  longest government shutdown in our Nation's history. More than 800,000  people were either denied coming to work or had to work without pay.   Finally, the President agreed to open the government with a short- term continuing resolution, and he said that lawmakers should come up  with a comprehensive border security proposal.   Congress did that. A bipartisan group delivered compromise  legislation that rejected the proposed border wall as ineffective.  Alternatively, it made effective, robust investments in border  security. Congress overwhelmingly passed the legislation. The President  agreed to sign it. Then he issued a national emergency declaration in  order to raid funds from other departments to secure funding for a  border wall, which Congress has repeatedly voted against.   As I already said, he has made it about drugs; the wall will be  ineffective. He made it about the humanitarian crisis; the wall will be  ineffective.   How is he going to pay for it? Well, he is going to take money that  the Department of Defense was going to spend on high-priority military  construction projects, which will ultimately undermine the training,  readiness, and quality of life for our men and women in the Armed  Forces.   In fact, General Robert Neller, Commandant of the Marines, has  detailed that the ``unplanned/unbudgeted'' shift of funds to deploy  troops to the southern border last fall has forced him to cancel or  reduce training exercises, delay urgent repairs, posing an  ``unacceptable risk'' to our Armed Forces' training and readiness.   Then he is also going to take, ironically, money from the DOD drug  interdiction program, which will further inhibit the capability of the  DOD in effectively interdicting drug shipments, in favor of a stupid,  static wall.   This emergency declaration also violates a number of existing laws.  The Military Construction Codification Act only authorizes the  Secretary of Defense to reallocate funds for construction projects  during a national emergency if the project is ``necessary to support''  a ``use of the Armed Forces.''   Our Armed Forces are not responsible for enforcing our immigration  laws. Using these funds in this way is a direct violation of existing  law.   The administration would also need to seize thousands of acres of  private property by eminent domain to build this wall. This is the  party of private property rights and local control, and they are going  to support that activity, or some are.    Currently, more than two-thirds of border property needed to build  the wall is owned by private parties or relevant States. In 1952, the  Supreme Court held in Youngstown Sheet & Tube that President Truman's  declaration of a national emergency, even in the midst of an  international armed conflict, did not permit him to unilaterally seize  private property.   It is unlikely that this thing will get built anyway, but we are  going through this process. Because of this likely illegal overreach,  the House passed a bipartisan resolution to terminate the national  emergency declaration. Even the Republican-controlled Senate passed the  resolution, with 12 Republican Senators breaking with the President.   With the President's decision to override this resolution, we must  send a strong, clear message to the President that we live in a  constitutional, representative democracy, and the President and his  administration cannot ignore Congress and existing law when they don't  like our actions.   We must stand up and defend our constitutional system, separation of  powers, and Article I of the Constitution of the United States.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Castro).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just in response to the gentleman, if he had been listening, he might  have heard the gentleman from Texas listing bases in Texas which are  going to lose funds for critical military construction projects, yet he  launches off into some fantasy about Iraq--I didn't even quite get that  part--and also that we are proposing open borders. I am not aware of  anyone on this side of the aisle who is proposing open borders.                                time  1300    We are proposing effective, 21st century border security at the real  threats to America, like drug importation through our legal ports of  entry and maritime drug imports that we can't intercept because we  don't have the resources, and we are wasting money on a stupid, static  wall.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Barragan).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I was just looking up that most of the deaths--or  many--  [[Page H2810]]  are due to fentanyl, and the fentanyl, of course, is all produced in  China. Some of it is shipped via UPS, FedEx, and the international  postal service. We lack the screening capability to deal with that.   Much of it does go to Mexico and is then smuggled into the U.S., but  it is not the classic myth of these people carrying backpacks through  remote areas of the desert where, if we only put up a wall, the wall  would stop them from getting the drugs into the U.S.   If people had paid attention to the extraordinary trial of El Chapo  Guzman in New York, which I did, there was testimony after testimony  after testimony that he is bringing and they--his successors--are  bringing the drugs through our ports of entry, because they deal in  volume and sophistication.   And what are we going to do? We are going to build a medieval wall  over here while they continue to flood this country by modifying pickup  trucks, passenger cars, and semis to smuggle humans and drugs into the  United States of America.   Border Patrol is understaffed. Border Patrol does not have adequate  technology. They only screen a very small percentage of the vehicles  coming through, sometimes 6 percent, sometimes as high as 8 percent.  Wow.   Well, then, you have got a 92 percent chance, if you are El Chapo  Guzman or some other scumbag drug person from a cartel in Mexico, of  getting your product in in an efficient, volumetric way.   Why would you pay someone with a backpack to go through some remote  area when you can just ship them in that way, or you can use FedEx or  UPS if you are Chinese.   You can go online and find Chinese selling fentanyl, and they will  give you advice about how you should order it from them and how you can  get it into the United States.   Why aren't we doing something about that? The President is making a  big deal about getting tough on China. They are producing all the  fentanyl, and it is coming in here in many, many different ways, and  this wall will do nothing--nothing--to deal with that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time remains.    Madam Speaker, I won't use that much. I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   I would like to have a quote here from someone who, I think, is quite  prominent: You go under; you go around; you go through it. What they  need is more manpower and more technology.   That was the Acting Chief of Staff for the White House, Mick  Mulvaney, when, perhaps, he was a little more independent as a Member  of the United States Congress. That was August 25, 2015.   I would ask: What has changed since then? Well, he now works for the  President. That is a change.   Donald Trump, during his campaign, was real hardline on immigration,  but he kept forgetting to mention immigration in some of his speeches.  So his staff came up with a mnemonic. They said: Well, he is a builder.  If we say ``wall,'' he will remember it.   And the President did. It was just an afterthought. It was: How are  we going to get him to give his hard line on immigration during his  campaign speeches and get rousing going. Let's use the wall.   The wall then became a life unto its own, as a campaign promise, not  as something that is effective.   As we have talked about before, the drugs, use a trebuchet or a  catapult. Use a drone, tunnels--really common, tunnels--and, of course,  legal border crossings.   This is an end conclusion to a campaign promise for his base but not  what is in the best interests of the United States of America in terms  of preventing the shipment of illegal drugs.   Now, I don't know where the gentleman came up with that new statistic  that three times as many drugs were intercepted outside the ports of  entry, unless he was using the Coast Guard, which he may have been,  because the Coast Guard intercepted more drugs than every other agency  of the Federal Government, combined, in the maritime route.   Unfortunately, as the former Commandant of the Coast Guard said: We  can identify 80 percent with our intel, 80 percent of the drug  shipments coming in on a maritime basis, but the Coast Guard only has  the resources to intercept 20 percent.   So I guess that is probably where that statistic came from.   The Coast Guard is doing a great job with inadequate resources. In  the bipartisan compromise, they got some additional money for air and  marine assets, three multi-enforcement aircraft. They could use a heck  of a lot more.   Why don't we get that 80 percent? Why don't they have resources to  get that 80 percent that they know about, and then let's get better  intel and get the other 20 percent.   And then let's scan 100 percent of the vehicles coming across the  border. I have been at the border, when, through intuition, a Border  Patrol agent found drug smuggling. I just happened to be there that  day. I mean, it was just sort of a: Whoa, Congressman, you might like  to see this.   The guy drove up to the border. He had a birthday cake and a bottle  of tequila on the seat. The Border Patrol guy said: Hmm, something is  suspicious. Take the truck over there.    They scoped out the gas tank. They found big blocks of drugs in the  gas tank.   Was that because we had sophisticated technology and when the guy  pulled the truck up we could use that technology? No, it was the  intuition of the Border Patrol agent.   I said: How did you know to go and really search through that guy's  vehicle?   He said: Well, there was nothing on his key ring. There was only one  key in the ignition. He was a throwaway.   The cartel was probably paying him 10,000 bucks or something to drive  that stolen or purchased pickup truck across the border concealing  drugs, and the human element caught that guy.   There aren't enough Border Patrol agents. They have openings. They  are not adequately compensated. They weren't paid during the shutdown,  but they were still working at the border. They are the first line of  defense.   But they also need new technology. We can't install all that  technology to scan 100 percent of the vehicles coming through unless we  invest a lot of money in improving the border crossing because we will  have trucks backed up 100 miles back into Mexico because of the amount  of commerce that comes across.   So what are we going to do? We are going to build a stupid, static  wall over there and over there, and we are still going to let,  probably, 85 percent of the vehicles go through without applying  technology.   Guzman, sitting in his jail cell, is probably just chortling over  this. He is saying: Boy, are those Americans stupid. Why don't they get  the technology they need to scan the cargo that we are hiding in very  sophisticated ways in tractor trailers, in pickup trucks, in individual  passenger vehicles? Why don't they intercept the drugs that are coming  in through the oceans that they even know about and they are not  intercepting them?   No, we are going to build a dumb wall.   And, by the way, when the Republicans were in charge, we had a vote  on that and it failed. If this was such a crisis and such a great idea  when the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the White  House, why didn't they make it a priority?   Well, they didn't make it a priority because they thought it was a  stupid idea. But now it is a political thing. This is a victory for the  President. It excites his base. It energizes his base. He has to have  it, so he declares a national emergency.  [[Page H2812]]    The emergency is political. It is not national security. It is not  drugs.   We have a humanitarian crisis at the border--yes, we do--and what is  a wall going to do about that?   They come to the border. They stand there and they say: We want to  apply for asylum in the United States.   If they come across in a remote area, they hope they come across a  Border Patrol agent because they want to surrender at the moment, right  there, and get some shelter and get medical care. They are now  organizing busloads to come up from Guatemala and Honduras.   We are not dealing with the root problems down there, and we are not  dealing with the smugglers who are now hiring very nice, luxury buses  as opposed to the old ride on that killer train that people used to  take to come up, when there were smugglers who would often rape them,  kill them, rob them, whatever else. Now they have converted to: Oh,  let's put them in a luxury coach and they will have rest stops and  everything else.   This has become big business. Why aren't we doing something about  that? The wall will do nothing about that--nothing.   Why, why, why are we going to waste billions of dollars on a medieval  fortress that won't work?   I urge my colleagues to vote and override the veto of the President  of the United States; restore the integrity of the Congress of the  United States and the appropriations process under Article I of the  Constitution of the United States.
