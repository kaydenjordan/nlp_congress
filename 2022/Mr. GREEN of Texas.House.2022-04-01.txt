 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. I thank Mr.  Nadler, Ms. Lee, and Mr. Perlmutter.   Mr. Speaker, I rise because I see this as a bill that will benefit  some of the least, the last, and the lost; people who have been denied  access to housing, denied access to loans, denied access to things that  we need to succeed in the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I plan to support it. I ask that my colleagues support  it because it is tough being a Black man with a criminal record in the  United States of America. This bill will help a lot of Black men have  opportunities that they have been denied.
