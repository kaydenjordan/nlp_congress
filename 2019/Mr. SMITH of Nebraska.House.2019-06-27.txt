 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take  from the Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment thereto,  and concur in the Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill passed the  Senate with 84 votes and could immediately be sent to the President's  desk for his signature.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Nebraska State Trooper Jerry Smith. Jerry was killed last week in a  tragic accident while on duty.   Jerry dedicated his life to serving. First, he served our Nation in  the Army, where he won a Bronze Star. After his retirement from the  Army, he served our great State with the Nebraska State Patrol.   He was highly respected in our community of Scottsbluff and Gering,  Nebraska, and we grieve with his family.   His memorial service today was a testament to how many lives he  touched and a tribute to his service. People from all around the State,  and even law enforcement from out of State, joined together to pay  their respects to Jerry.   He is survived by his wife, Karen, their children, and their  grandchildren. Our hearts go out to them during this time, and they can  be assured the entire State of Nebraska is with them.   We thank Jerry for his service to our State and remember him for his  service as well.                            ____________________
