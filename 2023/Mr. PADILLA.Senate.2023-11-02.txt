 Madam President, I rise to introduce the Wildland  Firefighter Fair Pay Act to permanently increase the pay caps of some  of the United States' most hard-working employees, who risk their lives  to keep our communities safe and manage the land from severe wildfire.   In every State, we rely on Federal firefighters who spend weeks to  months away from their families in dangerous conditions. As fire season  turns into a year-round issue, firefighters must be compensated for  their overtime work that grows each year.   The Wildland Firefighter Fair Pay Act would increase the overtime pay  caps Federal wildland firefighters and adjust for the new proposed pay  scale.   This overtime pay cap increase boost the Federal Agencies' ability to  recruit Federal wildland firefighters and avoid firefighters walking  off the line midincident or leaving for other opportunities.   As it stands, current United States Code limits wildland  firefighters' premium pay and hurts Federal Agencies' ability to  recruit and retain firefighters.   Building off the bipartisan infrastructure law, a bipartisan group of  Senators and the White House are working to ensure that our wildland  firefighters are compensated appropriately for their intense line of  work. The ``Wlldfand Firefighter Fair Pay Act'' complements these  efforts by ensuring that any pay bump would not be limited by a pay  cap.   I would like to thank Senators Steve Daines, Martin Heinrich, Ben Ray  Lujan, Catherine Cortez Masto, Jacky Rosen, and Jon Tester for joining  me in introducing this bill, as well as Representative Zoe Lofgren for  championing this bill in the House.   Lastly, we owe these efforts to California's Late Senator Dianne  Feinstein, who had written the original bill. We must continue Senator  Feinstein's legacy of supporting our firefighters and investing in  wildfire mitigation efforts across the country by permanently  increasing the premium pay cap.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this necessary  legislation to improve pay for Federal firefighters.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Mr. Carper):   S. 3224. A bill to codify Internal Revenue Service guidance relating  to treatment of certain services and items for chronic conditions as  meeting the preventive care deductible safe harbor for purposes of high  deductible health plans in connection with health savings accounts; to  the Committee on Finance.
