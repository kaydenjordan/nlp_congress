 Madam Speaker, last but certainly not  least, today I rise to honor the life of the eighth wonder of the world  on what would have been his 75th birthday: Andre Roussimoff, better  known as Andre the Giant, who spent his final years in the small town  of Ellerbe, right in the middle of the Ninth District of North  Carolina.   Standing 7 feet 4 inches tall and weighing over 500 pounds, Andre was  known for his time in the World Wide Wrestling Federation, where he was  a fan favorite. During his professional career, he headlined  WrestleMania and also defeated Hulk Hogan to win the WWF World  Heavyweight Championship. To nonwrestling fans, he is best known for  playing the role of Fezzik in the 1987 film ``The Princess Bride.''   Despite his great size, those who knew him found him to be gentle and  kind. Andre passed away at the age of 46 in 1993, and his ashes were  scattered on his beloved Ellerbe ranch.   I am proud today to pay tribute to the memory of Ellerbe's most  famous resident.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I had not intended to  speak, but the careful mask of bipartisanship seems to have faltered  here at the last, with the majority leader's attacks on the minority  leader, who has not spoken, and the minority leader in the Senate for  comments he has made in public but not in debate.   So what was an image of bipartisan cooperation has now become one  more partisan attack. It caused me to believe that it was important to  stand up and say this: How can you have a bipartisan commission with an  all-Democrat staff? How do you do that?   And why is it that there is no willingness to look into all of the  riots and the arson and the violence and the burning? If we are  concerned about the danger that police officers were in on January 6-- and certainly they were--then why don't we have that concern for the  dangers, the violence, the injuries, the deaths that have been faced by  police officers across this country?   Why is one form of political violence equivalent to 9/11 when a blind  eye has been turned by this Congress, or at least by the majority in  this Congress, to that same phenomenon across this country for a year?  Where is the inquiry into that?   When the images are raised, the lurid images of insurrection--let me  just say this. If it was an insurrection, it was the worst example of  an insurrection in the history of mankind. It was a riot, it was a mob,  it was significant, and it was troublesome.   But this is not bipartisanship, and I fear that the gentleman from  New York may find that he has been played.    Mr. Speaker, just like that, America  faces four simultaneous crises: loss of control of the border, energy  supply disruption, a sudden spurt of stagflation, and a key ally under  assault.   Why is all this happening at once on the eve of the 4-month  anniversary of Inauguration Day?  [[Page H2601]]    Because a weak President signals a weak America. The President sets  the tone, and, today, it is very different than the previous 4 years.   On the world's stage, our adversaries are newly emboldened, and our  allies more vulnerable. After several years of creative Trump peace  deals, Israel is already under attack.   Is that a coincidence?   No. Hamas and other terrorists knew that with Trump there would be  consequences. They know with Biden there will be none.   At our southern border, we have plateaued at a 20-year high for  illegal border crossings. It is not slowing down. The word is out: You  can cross without consequences. In fact, Biden and his allies think  progress is expanding the throughput.   Persons are also now experiencing gas shortages, last seen with Jimmy  Carter. Even before, the price at the pump sky-rocketed.   Why?   Because this President doesn't value or fight for American energy  independence, like the last one. Instead, he cancels our pipelines and  green-lights Russia's. Now families have new worries about their fuel  budgets, while being lectured to by this legislation on leftist green  energy fiascos.   Perhaps, most pressing of all, our economy is not recovering as it  should, while all the warning signs of inflation grow stronger.  Practically every day I hear the same thing from North Carolina small  businesses, that they cannot find workers. And after that last pathetic  jobs report, it is clear that this isn't isolated to any home State.    Biden isn't fighting for jobs. He is paying more to not have one.   What we are seeing across the board is trickle-down weakness, and the  adverse effects are clear. For the first time in 4 years, America has a  President who backs down without a fight, and it is costing us. Biden  is nowhere to be found on the issues that matter. In his absence,  Republicans will keep fighting for the American people.
