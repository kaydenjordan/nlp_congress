 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, marking the 48th day since  Hurricane Maria made direct landfall on the island of Puerto Rico.   Wreaking havoc for over 3.4 million American citizens living on the  island, this administration's response has been beyond atrocious. I  witnessed it myself a couple of weeks ago, and so did a group of 50  registered nurses from across the country who volunteered for a two- week disaster relief fund and mission.   What these courageous women described upon returning was not at all  reassuring. The lack of efficient action has led to deadly conditions  and consequences: lack of food, water, medicine, proper healthcare  services, houses with roofs blown off or infested with black mold, and  leptospirosis outbreaks across the island.   Laura Maceri, a registered nurse, said: ``It's hell there. The people  have nothing, yet they are the first to offer you the shirt off their  back.''   Another nurse, Hau Yau, expressed: ``We couldn't believe this is part  of the United States. We did home visits in low-income communities with  the public health liaisons there who identified those in need, and  helped them do basic blood pressure checks, blood sugar checks, to  refill their medicine, et cetera. They have already had chronic  diseases going on, and now their environment is full of hazardous  materials, and the sanitation is very, very poor.''    From another nurse, Erin Carrera: ``Spent the day in Rio Grande, a  hard-hit area right outside of San Juan. No power or water here since  Maria. We set up a clinic at the FEMA site for the first time here.  People lined up blocks since 10 p.m. last night. But FEMA was only  handing out papers--papers, which need to be filled out in order that  they may receive some reimbursement eventually. Each person received a  small bottle of water, a mini bag of Cheez-It and a little pack of  vanilla cookies. Outrageous. We were able to provide care to some, not  nearly enough, but one small contribution to this tragedy today.''   Another nurse said: ``Today we went to a town called Barranquitas.  They had almost no water or food there. They were desperate. They are  relying on rainwater. One million chickens died during the storm and  are now decomposed and causing people to get sick. Overwhelming is the  only thing I can say to describe it.''   Mr. Speaker, I stand with these nurses in their demands to address  the humanitarian crisis on the island of Puerto Rico. This  administration must respond immediately.   We need to waive FEMA's cost-sharing requirements in Puerto Rico.  Yesterday, Representative Gutierrez and I introduced the WEPA  legislation--the Waiver of Emergency Payments Act--that chooses and  aims to do exactly that.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to shed light and to  put a face on an imperative issue, the imperative issue of affordable  housing. I am here representing neighborhoods like Marble Hill, Inwood,  Washington Heights, Hamilton Heights, Morningside Heights, Harlem and  east Harlem, and the northwest Bronx.   Public housing and public housing capital funding is imperative for  many of my constituents. Just to shed some light on the magnitude of  this problem, Mr. Speaker, in the 13th Congressional District, there  are 62 housing developments--62 public housing developments.   There are a total of 340 buildings, and, within those buildings,  there are 34,609 apartments where families live; so 62 housing  developments out of 326 for the entire city of New York, 340 buildings  out of 2,462 buildings in the city of New York, and 34,609 apartments  out of 176,692 apartments across the city of New York.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, public housing houses over 400,000 residents.  It is larger than many cities in many States across the Nation, and  public housing capital funding is imperative and necessary for my  constituents.   Not only do these residents rely on stable, affordable housing to  stay close to their families and be near their jobs and schools, but  our city relies on these residents who are also teachers, home  healthcare workers, caregivers, and taxi drivers. They run our city. In  fact, they are an integral part of the economic engine of the city.  They are part of our local economy. They fuel our economy on a daily  basis. Mr. Speaker, these folks really represent the economic engine of  New York City.   As you will hear from my colleagues, affordable housing--public  housing--and its residents are under threat. After a decade of funding  reductions, the President's administration made one thing clear: they  plan to drastically accelerate funding reductions for HUD. This turns  that housing agency, essentially, into an absentee landlord, into a  slumlord, if you will, administrating public housing developments  across the country that are in decrepit and seriously embarrassing  conditions.   The administration's fiscal year 2018 budget proposal revealed a $7.6  billion cut, almost a 20 percent cut to HUD, and a two-thirds cut to  public housing capital needs.   Now, New York City has a need of $17 billion to do point work, roof  work, boiler work, and elevator work to improve the quality of life of  the residents of these housing developments. Yet the administration has  proposed a $7.6 billion cut. This is a national crisis, an affordable  housing national crisis.   We have Members from California to Texas to New York who all believe  that affordable housing should be at the forefront of our progressive  priority. It is a fundamental cornerstone of the American Dream that we  cannot afford to let slip away.  [[Page H8648]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from the State  of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  Texas for her eloquent remarks regarding this pressing need, this  national crisis of housing.   Let me just share with you some other numbers that will further  ensure that the American people understand in full depth this crisis.   In my district, as I said earlier, there are 75,463 residents of  public housing out of 400,000 citywide. There are 34,035 NYCHA families  in the district out of 174,283 citywide. Twenty-five percent are  children who are subject to mold like you see right here on this easel,  Mr. Speaker, mold that contributes to asthma and to other respiratory  diseases that then lead to absenteeism in the schools and long-term  problems for young people and children who live in these public housing  units.   In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, 21 percent of the residents of  these housing developments are seniors over 62 years old who are also  subjected to mold, chipping paint, and elevators that don't work. They  have to go up and down 18 or 20 stories. Some of them are in  wheelchairs or have some real challenges getting around. Yet the  Federal Government and its Department of Housing and Urban Development,  HUD, continue to be an absentee landlord abandoning them to their own  fate. Fifty-two percent of those residents, Mr. Speaker, are on fixed  incomes, and 46 percent across the city have an employed family member.  So these are the numbers that are very telling to this national crisis.   The reduction in capital funding which leads to the deterioration of  buildings' roofs and facades, failure of boilers, leaks, mold like we  see right here, and other unacceptable conditions are devastating to my  constituents, and they contribute to a public health crisis, asthma,  respiratory disease.   Americans need a better deal for housing. As we continue negotiations  on the fiscal year 2018 appropriations and the administration prepares  the fiscal 2019 budget proposal, we need to ensure that public housing  is adequately funded.                                time  1800    Sufficient capital funding is imperative for my district and the  country, and it ensures the creation of jobs through capital work.   Investing capital dollars in public housing repair would also yield  employment in our communities. It also ensures the reduction of  negative health outcomes and healthcare costs related to the  deterioration of housing conditions. It also results in quality, stable  housing for low-income Americans, which is one of the most important  factors in the alleviation of poverty.   Americans need a better deal for housing. I hope that my colleagues  remember the constituency that we serve, particularly the most  vulnerable ones like the residents of public housing, and we continue  to fight back against budget cuts. Growing the public housing capital  fund must be elevated as a priority.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Gomez).    Mr. Speaker, earlier, I talked about some of the  proposed budget cuts that HUD has brought forward for this fiscal year.  Let me tell you, the American people, what some of the programs are  that will be negatively, adversely affected by these cuts on a daily  basis.   Section 8, a program that provides rental assistance to help low- income individuals and families, more than 125,000 households in New  York City's NYCHA complexes depend on Section 8 vouchers, 39,000 of  which are administered by the city's HPD Department. Approximately half  of the voucher recipients are elderly and disabled.    Community Development Block Grants help the city enforce housing  quality standards. More than half of the city's Community Development  Block Grant allocations support housing quality standards funding;  500,000 inspections have been conducted, 8,000 emergency repairs,  16,000 housing litigation cases, and emergency shelters for 1,000  households, just in 2016.   The Low Income Housing Tax Credit, nationally, 90 percent of the  affordable housing is financed through the Low Income Housing Tax  Credit. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit and tax-exempt bonds have  helped create and preserve over 116,000 safe, quality, affordable homes  in New York City.   These programs will be compromised and lead to apartments with mold,  chipping paint, leaky pipes, dysfunctioning elevators, failing boilers,  and leaky roofs. So this is a major national crisis.   Let me share with you some of my constituents' stories. Now that we  have talked about numbers, let's talk about what these numbers mean and  who they impact.   Let's talk about, for example, a lady named Maria Pacheco, who has  lived in the UPACA 6 development for 12 years. She is retired from  working at the stock market. This is what she had to say about the  importance of making capital improvements to her public housing  building:         If NYCHA fixes the entrance doors and the walkway in front       of the development, more seniors would be able to get out of       their apartments more often. There are a number of seniors       who do not come out of their apartments because they are not       able to open the entrance doors. Those doors are really heavy       and the walkway is dangerous, and a lot of seniors fear they       will fall.    Maria Pacheco needs a better deal in housing from Congress. Seniors  are too afraid that they will fall.   During Secretary Ben Carson's listening tour--by the way, Mr.  Secretary, New York City is still waiting for you to see our public  housing complexes and the conditions that they are in--during his so- called listening tour, this is what he had to say to a development in  Columbus, Ohio, that is partially funded by HUD: ``Compassion means not  giving people a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to  say: `I'll just stay here. They will take care of me.' ''   Mr. Secretary, ``a comfortable setting,'' you said. Public housing  often lacks consistent heat and hot water. That is far from being  comfortable.   Public housing elevators often break down. That is far from being  comfortable.   Public housing often has no heat and hot water and mold on the wall.  That is far from being comfortable.   I think my constituent Birdie Glen, age 78, who lives in the Jackie  Robinson Development with her husband and great-grandson would disagree  with you, Mr. Secretary. She is retired from the Department of  Education, and this is what she had to say:         If they fix the boilers in the Jackie Robinson Development,       the residents would be more grateful and appreciative. The       lack of consistent heat and hot water has caused a lot of the       residents to get sick. Adults as well as children have been       visiting the doctor's office more frequently due to getting       sick because of no heat and hot water.    This has become a public health crisis as well. During the winter  months, residents experience more illnesses in the Jackie Robinson  complexes because the boilers need to be replaced.   Another resident, Felicia Rodriguez, 70 years old, who lives in the  Gaylord Houses, says:         In my 2 years living at Gaylord, I have experienced severe       flooding, water damages in different areas of my apartment.       If we had repairs and upgrades in our development, we will       value our homes and neighborhood. We need to ensure we get       the repairs completed in a timely manner to avoid further       damages to our infrastructure.        Gaylord has significant leaks due to the pipe damage, brick       gaps, roof damage. These problems affect our health, our       hygiene, and  [[Page H8650]]       economic issues for many seniors in Gaylord development. By       making major roof and brick repairs at Gaylord White Houses,       we will eliminate leaks, flooding, and damage to the top       floors of these apartments.    This is a public health crisis.   Let's talk, Mr. Speaker, about public health and mold.   In every city, there is an aging public housing development complex,  and a lack of investment for decades means that many buildings pose  great, great health risks to the residents. In New York City, a  majority of NYCHA buildings are more than 60 years old. Public housing  authorities have endured decades of Federal disinvestment. For many, a  lack of affordable funds means that repairs have spiraled out of  control. Some units are so damaged that they cannot be lived in.   Citywide, there are 2,300 NYCHA units that are vacant, and many need  extensive renovations to become safe homes again. Not only is the lack  of Federal investment hurting the number of public housing units  available, but vacant units almost always make public housing less safe  for current residents.   Speaking to DNAinfo, Jisele Hearne elaborates how vacant units make  the Harlem River Houses less safe: ``Of course, we are worried. Anyone  can come in and you don't know what they are going to do. They can . .  . leave the gas on. It's not safe living someplace where nobody is  monitoring.''   Harlem River Houses has been plagued with mold for many years, and  units on the top floors have remained uninhabited.   Mold affects 328 NYCHA properties, and the situation has only  worsened after Hurricane Sandy. That was in 2012. We need capital  investment not just to eradicate the appearance of mold; we need to  address the root cause of that. We need to replace leaky roofs,  crumbling pipes, and all ventilation systems to make sure the mold is  gone forever, for good.                                time  1815    The health of children, families, and seniors is at stake. The CDC  reports that exposure to mold can lead to coughing, wheezing, eye and  skin irritation in otherwise healthy people.   For small children, exposure to mold may lead to asthma, leading to  absenteeism in the schools. For vulnerable residents, such as seniors  or small children, mold may lead to much more serious medical  conditions.   The government is the landlord of public housing complexes across the  country, and we cannot expect public housing residents to deal with  conditions that would be deemed unacceptable in the private market. It  is our solemn duty to make sure that public housing residents have  homes that allow them to lead healthy and productive lives.   If we can afford to spend $1.75 million remodeling one unit in public  housing--that is the White House that I am referring to, which is  public housing. If we could spend $1.75 million to renovate the most  expensive public housing unit, the White House, then surely, Mr.  President, we can afford to guarantee safe homes for public housing  residents.   If President Trump can spend $291,000 on office walls, then America's  1.16 million units of public housing should have walls free of mold,  like the one we see right here, and other safety hazards. Unlike the  White House, residents of public housing cannot afford lavish  renovations. They depend on us, and we must not fail them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), my  distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  [[Page H8651]]  the State of California for her eloquent words.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight another factor that  contributes to the problem of the lack of affordable housing, and that  is the decreasing affordability crisis in New York City.   Historically, New York City was built on inclusivity, and it is here  that people from all walks of life come in and they coexist. It is this  diversity that contributes to the success of this great experiment  called America, this great experiment called New York City. It is young  people moving here from Tennessee and immigrant families from the  Dominican Republic, like my family, for their own American Dream right  here in New York City. And New York City's success is one piece of the  national picture of urbanization.   This enormous change in cities across the country includes an influx  of more people, often young and from diverse backgrounds. This means we  need the visionaries in expanding our housing supply, especially our  affordable housing supply.   Mr. Speaker, that is why we are here today, to highlight on this  national crisis of a lack of affordable housing. America has a housing  crisis--an affordable housing crisis. Working and middle class New  Yorkers have felt the brunt of fewer options available on the market.   Countless middle- and low-income families cannot afford to live in  the neighborhoods they have known their entire lives. They must give up  living close to jobs, schools, familiar neighbors, and everything else  that defines their community.   The very foundation of our city is threatened when households must  make difficult choices between basic necessities and rent. That is  truly a fight for the soul of our neighborhoods, our cities; and they  are often forced to leave these houses and communities.   This is not a crisis that affects only a few. It impacts many New  Yorkers. Sixty-nine percent of New Yorkers rent their homes, and nearly  half of renters struggle to pay rent every month. Many are one  unexpected bill away from debt or eviction.   While this situation is dire for those struggling to pay rent in  their apartments now, there are virtually no options for low-income New  Yorkers. Minimum-wage workers will need to have three full-time jobs or  work at least 119 hours per week to be able to afford a two-bedroom  apartment at market rate.   Not only is it physically impossible, but we should not ask that of  workers in our city. The crisis of affordability nationwide will not  vanish if ignored. So long as New York's economy is thriving, rents  won't plateau or fall on their own. Developers will continue to eye  aging buildings for redevelopment and build new luxury apartments.  Rather than leave the creation and preservation of affordable housing  up to chance or whims of the market, we must be intentional about  funding affordable housing.   We already have a housing stock of 176,000 units of public housing in  New York City alone. That is the lifeline of hundreds of thousands of  residents, but it is in dire need of investment.   If we care about diversity and care about inclusion, we must put our  money where our mouth is and we must repair and preserve public housing  for a future of increasingly expensive cities.   Another aspect of the lack of affordable housing and the income gaps  affecting New York City is the dynamic of gentrification. Mr. Speaker,  I have the distinct honor of representing Harlem, which recently was-- there was an attempt to change its name to SoHa by speculators, people  who want to turn Harlem, a traditional iconic neighborhood of New York  City, into something else.   There are Harlems in every State across the country. There are  Harlems in every country around the world. Harlem is a personality. It  is an attitude. Harlem is for those who feel that perhaps they don't  have a voice but they want to fight to get to another level. That is  Harlem. It is a spirit.   Harlem, which, during the latter half of the 20th century, was  plagued with crime and abandonment, is now falling victim to its own  success. Rents have risen and many long-term residents have been  displaced.   The same is happening in Washington Heights, Inwood. Neighborhoods  that saw over 100 homicides every year and that now are down to low  single digits are seeing a dramatic increase in rent and affordability;  and many folks who have been living there for decades, like my family,  are now having to make tough choices of whether they remain in the  neighborhood that they love or have to move somewhere else.   Even among those who remain, they still face additional challenges  because the neighborhood they have known for so many years now feels  unfamiliar. For many, the fear of displacement is ever-present.   Mrs. Gwen Walker, a resident of the General Grant Houses in  Morningside Heights since the 1950s, was speaking to The New York Times  when she shared her thoughts on displacement, saying the following:  ``But the feeling is, `What am I going to do? Where are we going to  go?'''   Gentrification was a frequent topic of conversation among Mrs. Walker  and her neighbors.   So I continue to highlight the fact that not only do we have a public  housing crisis, not only does that lead to a public health crisis, but  also the skyrocketing cost of living has created gentrification, has  made it very difficult for working people--the engine of the economy of  the city--to make ends meet.   These residents are worth protecting, and low-income New Yorkers  should not be pushed aside every time a speculator or developer thinks  that a building, a block, or a neighborhood could be worth more money.   For neighborhoods that have already gentrified, public housing is the  only standing thing between them and displacement. They are the  lifeline for many tenants, and unlike market rate housing, they will  not raise rent on their residents when the neighborhood improves.   This is paramount. This is paramount for many low-and fixed-income  New Yorkers because they are not further burdened for not abandoning  their homes.                                time  1830    And the displacement continues to occur in New York City, Madam  Speaker. It is a harsh reality after tenants on the private market are  evicted, bought out, or cannot afford a rent increase. After losing  their home, families have few choices. Some families end up in  overcrowded apartments, if they are lucky, living with another family  member or living with a stranger.   David, who is a Mexican immigrant, lives in Washington Heights. He  lives with 12 other people in a 750-square-foot section of the  basement. Another 14 people live in the other half.   He explained, speaking to New York Magazine, that, for $100 each,  they get 40 square feet, a children's bunk bed, and a refrigerator  salvaged from the trash. Their basement is hard to move around in and  impossible to walk anywhere but to the leaking bathroom down the  cramped hall or to the small living room with the scavenged sofa. The  basement costs David and his 27 roommates almost $3,000 a month.   This is not an uncommon experience. Citywide, two-thirds of all  Mexicans live in overcrowded conditions. David described his journey  and realization of what living in New York City would be like for him:         From the airport, I went to my brother's place in       Washington Heights. He was living with his child and pregnant       wife, along with another couple and their kid--six people. I       was the seventh. In only one room.    America should know this: there is a public housing and affordable  housing crisis across the country, and HUD proposes to dramatically cut  the programs that guarantee the services for this housing.   David also experienced the loss of his home and an understanding that  his place in the city is always vulnerable.   This is all happening, Madam Speaker, while Republicans continue to  devise, to plan, premeditatedly, to plan their tax reform that will  give the rich, the 1 percent, a handsome tax cut while punishing the  middle class and working class sectors of America.   There is only one unit of public housing that is worth over $390  million, Madam Speaker, and it is the White House. The White House does  not have mold. The White House does not have crumbling pipes. The White  House does  [[Page H8652]]  not have severe water damage or asbestos because the White House is not  plagued by disinvestment.   President Trump does not pay rent, and he is not in danger of being  priced out of his neighborhood. And yet President Trump and  congressional Republicans are proposing to strip cities of their  ability to create and maintain affordable housing for those who most  desperately need it.   The Ryan-McConnell tax bill is a lie that is being sold to the  American people as a promise, a promise that claims that everyday  Americans will benefit and see more dollars in their pockets. But it is  a scam; it is a shell game; and it will make richer the rich and leave  everybody else behind.   The proposed tax plan eliminates funding for low-income housing tax  credits, which are responsible for many affordable developments. The  need for affordable housing is ever growing, and the low-income housing  tax credit must be expanded, not eliminated, to keep up with demand.  For New Yorkers, every dollar in their paycheck matters when it comes  to being able to pay rent.   Removing the State and local tax deduction, called SALT, places an  unfair double tax on State residents. States who choose to provide  high-quality services through taxation will be unfairly punished. This  unjust punishment will be felt mostly by those who live paycheck to  paycheck.   In some neighborhoods in New York City, residents spend as much as 80  percent of their income on housing and transportation. Removing the  State and local tax deduction means that families who already make  tough decisions about food, rent, and other bills now have fewer  dollars in their pockets to make those decisions.   For families that have saved up enough to participate in the American  Dream of owning their home, they no longer will be able to use the  mortgage interest tax deduction to help them finance their homes. For  many hopeful families, eliminating the mortgage interest tax deduction  closes the door to that opportunity.   The low-income housing tax credit, the State and local tax deduction,  and the mortgage interest tax deduction are the foundation from which  we can build affordable communities. We will not give in to the GOP tax  scam; we will not play in a shell game; and we will not give  billionaires even one more dollar. America deserves a better deal.   Madam Speaker, I close by saying that, in my home State of New York,  the Empire State, and particularly in my district, for the last 75  years, it has been represented by two giants: first, by the late and  great Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., who made history right here in these  Chambers; and for the last 46 years, by the ``Lion of Lenox Avenue,''  Charles B. Rangel.   Underfunding of affordable housing in that district starves public  housing and is compromising the health of public housing residents.  HUD's capital backlog of $26 billion cannot be added to. We must be  responsible and take hold of this challenge.   For the public health of our constituents, to preserve the American  Dream, I urge my colleagues to vote and make affordable housing a  priority.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
