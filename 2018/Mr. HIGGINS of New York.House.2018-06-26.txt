 Mr. Speaker, the communities I represent in  Buffalo and western New York have a long, proud tradition of welcoming  immigrants and refugees from all over the world. We are a city of good  neighbors in a Nation of immigrants.   The Trump administration's imposition of a Muslim travel ban,  proposals to build a wall, and egregious policy to terrorize kids and  tear families apart appeals to the tribal instincts of the weak and the  paranoid among us.   Americans respect the rule of law, hard work, and hard truth. We are  measured as a Nation by power and strength, certainly, but equally by  goodness and compassion.   These are the values that made America great again, again, and again.                            ____________________
