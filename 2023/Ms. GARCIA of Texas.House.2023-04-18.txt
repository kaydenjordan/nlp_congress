 Mr. Speaker, across the country, State  legislatures, including my home State of Texas, have advanced  legislation seeking to ban transgender kids from participating in  sports. Very sadly, this bill here today in Congress is seeking to do  the same.   The so-called Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act up for  consideration today is nothing more than another extreme MAGA  Republican political stunt, taking away the focus from the real issues  affecting American people.   It would stipulate that Title IX compliance ban gender and intersex  girls and women from participating in sports.   Denying children access to a place where they can gain mental and  physical benefits does not protect women in sports. It harms women in  sports.  [[Page H1780]]    This bill sanctions discrimination against transgender students,  which is mean-spirited and just plain bullying. This is not the role of  Congress.   I have heard directly from trans and intersex constituents in my  district. They are worried every day about what political stunt and  what political attack will come next. No one should live in fear just  for being who they are.   I strongly oppose the rule and strongly, strongly oppose final  passage of this bill.
