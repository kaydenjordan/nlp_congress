 Mr. Speaker, for 75 years, America has been  the greatest nation in world history. America's standard of living is  envied by most. America's military is unmatched. America is a beacon of  freedom for all.   Unfortunately, America's foundational principles are under attack-- not by a foreign foe, but from within our own country.   Socialist Democrats oppose the rule of law that is essential to peace  and prosperity by supporting open border policies that consume hundreds  of billions in tax dollars and kill tens of thousands of Americans each  year.   Socialist Democrats' spending sprees put America $22 trillion in  debt, thus risking a debilitating national insolvency and bankruptcy.   Socialist Democrats support dictatorial and guaranteed-to-fail  socialism over the free enterprise economy that has created our  prosperity.   If the Mueller report is accurate, for 2 years, socialist Democrats  and fake news media allies used the big lie propaganda tactic to  undermine our elections' legitimacy and falsely accuse President Trump  of colluding with Russia.   History's most famous evil and horrific use of big lie tactics is by  the National Socialist German Workers' Party, or Nazis, for short.   Not surprisingly, socialist Democrats and their fake news media  allies recently objected to my quoting Adolf  [[Page H2944]]  Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' to explain what the big lie propaganda tactic  is and how horrific the consequences can be for those seduced by it.   Germany's Socialist Party's big lie killed tens of millions of people  in the Holocaust and World War II, making it the most horrific and  deadly big lie in history.   Also, not surprisingly, today's socialists tried to revise history by  falsely claiming the Nazis were not socialists. Bunk.   Mr. Speaker, America can either learn from history or be doomed to  repeat it.   By way of background, freedom and liberty are the essence of free  enterprise, wherein supply and demand market forces determine which  goods and services are offered and at what prices. Citizens who produce  goods and services better, faster, or cheaper thrive, and everyone  benefits from that.    Conversely, socialism is the mortal enemy of free enterprise.  Socialist economies reject liberty, freedom, and market forces,  artificially dictate economic activity, and determine which businesses  and industries prosper and which do not. In a fully socialist economy,  government owns and controls all means of production.   So was Germany's Socialist Party socialists? The founders thought so  because they called themselves socialists. They certainly acted like  socialists.   Germany's Socialist Party's foundational 25 point platform stated, in  part:   Plank 13: ``We demand the nationalization of all previous associated  agencies, trusts.''   Plank 14: ``We demand a division of profits of all heavy  industries.''   Plank 16: ``We demand the . . . immediate communalization of the  great warehouses.''   Plank 17: ``We demand a land reform . . . for the free expropriation  of land for the purposes of public utility.''   Communalization, land seizure without compensation, nationalization  and government ownership of industry--those are all socialist policies.   Further, the German Socialist Party hated capitalism and free  enterprise. Nazi propaganda posters stated: ``The maintenance of a  rotten industrial system has nothing do with nationalism. I can love  Germany and hate capitalism.''   Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels wrote: ``In the final  analysis, it would be better for us to go down with Bolshevism than  live in eternal slavery under capitalism.''   Mr. Speaker, Germany's socialist Nazis are a heinous example of the  marriage between big lie propaganda tactics and socialism, but they are  not alone. Soviet Union and Chinese-style socialism also subjugated or  exterminated tens of millions of people.   Mr. Speaker, America must learn from history. Socialism must lose and  free enterprise must win if America is to remain a free, prosperous,  and great nation.                            ____________________
