 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the burden that  healthcare costs put on American families. No one should have to choose  between putting food on the table and affording their medication.   Nearly 3 in 10 American adults take prescription drugs each day and  say that they have skipped doses. They have cut pills in half or they  have not filled prescriptions. This is dangerous.   In the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats made major progress in  lowering drug costs and making healthcare more affordable. We capped  the out-of-pocket costs for seniors. We capped the cost of insulin at  $35, and we finally gave Medicare the power to negotiate prices.   Let's build on this. Let's cap the cost of insulin at $35 for every  American. Let's continue to lower the cost of medical expenses and  insurance premiums for every American.   American families are struggling while Big Pharma continues to reap  the benefits. Let's build on the progress in the Inflation Reduction  Act and provide working families with the help they so desperately  need.                            ____________________
