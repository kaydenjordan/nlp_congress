 Mr. President, I rise in support of the package of bills  on the Senate floor.   But first, I want to share a brief update on the situation on Maui.  We are now a month on from the devastating wildfires that killed 115  people and leveled the town of Lahaina.   After a weekslong search and recovery effort for remains, we have  entered a new phase of the response. The Environmental Protection  Agency has begun removing toxic household materials and waste so that  residents can return to their homes safely. It is a painstaking process  that is likely to take several months to complete.   Life in Lahaina is still not normal. Forty-two people are still  missing. That is down from an initial count of nearly 3,000. More than  7,000 people are living in temporary housing like hotels and Airbnbs.  Three thousand students are displaced from their schools.   And the local economy is reeling without tourism. Small businesses  are struggling to stay afloat. Hundreds of people--restaurant workers,  hotel workers, helicopter tour operators--are being laid off.   More than 10,000 people filed for unemployment in the 3 weeks  following the fires. In total, the economic impact of the fires is  estimated at nearly $2 billion through next year. That is not counting  the damage. That is the economic impact.   It is hard to overstate how much help the people of Maui need. To  date, more than 15,000 survivors have applied for FEMA assistance. That  is just a narrow snapshot into what is needed now and in the months and  years to come.   People urgently need basic items like phones and new IDs. Long term,  they are going to need permanent solutions for housing and schools. In  the meantime, damaged infrastructure like roads, highways, schools, and  healthcare centers will need to be rebuilt.   The road to recovery will be long, and it will require billions of  dollars in Federal aid to get the job done. Congress has a  responsibility to provide relief and to deliver it quickly.                                Appropriations    Mr. President, now, I want to turn to the appropriations bills under  consideration. These bills make critical investments to advance our  Nation's health and safety by ensuring affordable housing for 10  million people, protecting the integrity of our food supply, supporting  the readiness of our Armed Forces, and more. And so it is vital that we  pass them.   Each of these bills was developed through a collaborative, bipartisan  process, and each bill was unanimously passed out of committee by a  vote of 29 to 0--unanimously passed out of committee by a vote of 29 to  0.   I want to thank Chair Murray, in particular, and Vice Chair Collins,  as well as Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell, for  their leadership in helping to restore the appropriations process to  regular order.   I am looking at the Presiding Officer, my good friend from  Connecticut. We entered the Senate, I think, only 13 days apart from  each other. And people have been talking about regular order for a long  time, to the point where it actually sometimes results in an eye roll:  We should do regular order. We should do regular order. Easier said  than done. But it took the two women chairs--chair and vice chair--of  the Appropriations Committee to get us onto the floor to have not an  omnibus but a minibus, to have just a couple of bills that were  actually marked up on a bipartisan basis and then to have amendments.  And so this is a significant moment for the Senate in trying to restore  its reputation as the world's greatest deliberative body.   The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related  Agencies, T-HUD, portion of this minibus package, where I am the chair  and I work so closely with my friend and vice chair, Senator Hyde- Smith, provides $99 billion for affordable housing and homeless  assistance, infrastructure development, the operations of the FAA and  Amtrak, and safety oversight of our transportation systems.   While it does not include everything we wanted because it was  negotiated to be in line with the spending caps set by the debt ceiling  budget agreement, it still makes meaningful investments to improve  housing access and the reliability and safety of transportation  nationwide.   So I want to thank again my counterpart on the T-HUD Committee,  Ranking Member Cindy Hyde-Smith, who has been a collaborative partner  throughout this process. And I want to thank the committee members and  our staff on both sides of the aisle--the subcommittee staff, the whole  committee staff, the leadership staff, our personal office staff. We  come out here and it is our name on the door and it is our name on the  bumper sticker and we are going talk about the work that has been done,  but anybody who knows the legislative process knows that we are not the  ones actually executing. We are not the ones drafting the legislative  text. It doesn't mean we don't play a role, but there are dozens and  dozens of people who make personal and professional sacrifices to be  here and do this work and produce an incredibly strong bill.   It is no secret that we have a housing crisis in America. It affects  millions of Americans in every State. And day by day, more and more  people are falling into homelessness. The homeless population is also  aging with more complicated medical conditions that make it harder to  serve. That is why we are protecting existing rental assistance  programs and increasing efforts to reduce homelessness. Specifically,  we are targeting resources to improve coordination between housing and  health services, building the capacity of communities and service  providers, and creating more permanent supportive housing  opportunities.   The bill also maintains funding levels for the HOME Investment  Partnerships and Community Development Block Grant Programs. Both of  these are popular and important tools that enable State and local  governments to support the construction of more housing and the  community needs around it.   And in the second year of the Yes In My Backyard Program, we are  incentivizing jurisdictions to remove regulatory barriers and unlock  private investment to increase housing stock. We need to continue to  use every tool at our disposal to address this national housing  shortage.   One more thought on the Yes In My Backyard initiative: There is no  amount of money that we could put in this bill that will solve our  housing problem unless we deal with the barriers. We are creating  shortages of housing at the State and county level.  [[Page S4436]]  We are creating shortages of housing. It is the only thing I have ever  thought of in the government where the government creates a shortage  and then the policymakers sort of stroke their chins, going, What  should we do about this shortage? Well, you have made it harder to  build housing for people. And so the YIMB Program is designed not to  control but to incentivize jurisdictions to try to figure out how to  unleash private sector investment and increase the supply of housing.  Yes, LIHTC is important; yes, permanent supportive housing is  important; yes, the housing voucher program is important; yes, HFA is  important; yes, HUD-VASH is important. All of that matters, and we  should fund it at as high of a level as we can possibly stomach. But  the truth is, even that won't be enough until we allow people to do  what they wish with their property and build more housing.    We have included record-level funding for Native American housing  programs--something I am particularly pleased about, as the Senator  from Hawaii and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.  Native residents are nearly twice as likely to live in poverty and  three times more likely to live in an overcrowded condition compared to  other U.S. households. Given the scope of this challenge, this funding  is just the start, and we are going to need a lot more to address it  fully.   And for transportation, the bill is focused on supporting the  operational needs of the FAA. We have fully funded the FAA's budget  request on operations, staffing, facilities, and equipment in order to  restore hiring and modernization efforts that were frozen during the  pandemic.   My colleagues and I are separately working to reauthorize the FAA,  and this funding is complementary to those efforts. This bill also  maintains our commitment to building on the historic investments in the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, to improve our aging  transportation systems across America. For instance, it aims to address  the rail safety deficiencies identified in the East Palestine, OH,  train derailment by fully meeting the request for rail safety  inspectors and research into wayside detection technologies.   Tens of millions of Americans across the country, including our  veterans, will benefit from the investments that we made in these  bills, in terms of where they live, how they get around, and the food  that they eat. It is critical that we pass these bills.   I yield the floor.
