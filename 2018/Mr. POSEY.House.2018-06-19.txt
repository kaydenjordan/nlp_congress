 Mr. Speaker, my return flight to Washington, DC was  delayed due to inclement weather, and I was unable to attend the  legislative session on June 19, 2018. Had I been present, I would have  voted ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 269, ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 270, and  ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 271.                            ____________________
