 Mr. President, I want to speak for a couple of minutes  about the Supreme Court.   A year ago, we lost one of the greatest legal minds to ever serve on  the Nation's highest Court. For nearly three decades, Justice Antonin  Scalia fought for individual liberty and defended the integrity of the  Constitution.   No Justice in recent memory has so fundamentally influenced the  trajectory of the Supreme Court. From his landmark decision that  protected our Second Amendment right to bear arms to his staunch  defense of limited government and enumerated powers, Justice Scalia  stood as a bulwark against any erosion of our constitutional rights by  an activist judiciary. He did this with his unshakable commitment to an  originalist interpretation of the Constitution. Through this lens, he  did not read words that were not there or infer intent that did not  exist. Instead, Justice Scalia simply understood the Constitution, as  the Founders understood it.   Judge Scalia's passing marked a watershed moment for the future of  our country. Suddenly, in the midst of the last Presidential campaign,  voters were empowered to determine the philosophical balance of the  Supreme Court at the polls. By entrusting Republicans with the  stewardship of our Federal Government, voters signaled their desire for  change and for the values that our party embraces. From strong  separation of powers to a commitment to federalism, to religious  freedom, people in Arizona and around the country wanted to restore  these foundational principles. Now, President Trump's nomination of  Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court will help usher in that change  and solidify those values on the Court for a generation to come.   Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to attend the ceremony at  the White House and listen to Judge Gorsuch accept his nomination. I  was impressed by his humble respect for the law and for his commitment  to service. I was particularly struck by his recognition that ``it is  for Congress, not the courts, to write new laws'' and that a Justice  should make decisions based on what the law demands, not the outcome  that he or she desires.   I also appreciate his experience as an appellate court judge. This  experience has given him a firm understanding of a properly functioning  Federal circuit. As someone who has tried to reform an oversized and  overworked Ninth Circuit, I really appreciate that insight.   Judge Gorsuch is an accomplished, mainstream jurist with a judicial  philosophy worthy of Judge Scalia's seat. We can be confident that he  will read the law as written and not attempt to legislate from the  bench, but if we allow rigid partisan and ideological calculus to seep  into our confirmation process, I fear that no President will ever be  able to get a Cabinet or Supreme Court pick confirmed.   A favorite line of our former President is that ``elections have  consequences.'' Indeed, they do. Like it or not, the winning party  governs. That is democracy, and we have a responsibility now to govern.   My hope is a return to the longstanding traditions of bipartisan  cooperation on this Supreme Court nomination. Judge Gorsuch is  experienced. He is qualified, and he deserves a fair hearing. He  deserves an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. I am confident that  when he receives that up-or-down vote, he will fill the vacancy on the  Supreme Court.   I yield back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.    Mr. President, one of the most important elements of the  rule of law is the promise of swift access to the courts, but that  promise has been broken in my home State of Arizona. That is because  Arizona falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the Ninth Circuit, a circuit that is both oversized and overworked.   With the jurisdiction encompassing 13 districts spread across nine  States and 2 U.S. territories, the Ninth Circuit covers 1 in 5  Americans. It hears roughly 12,000 appeals each year. The next busiest  circuit doesn't even hear 9,000, and for the thousands of cases under  its consideration, the average turnaround time exceeds 15 months.   Now, if excessive delays weren't bad enough, it turns out the Ninth  Circuit is overturned by the Supreme Court 77 percent of the time when  the Supreme Court grants cert--77 percent of the time. That is  obviously higher than any other court. So not only is the court  excruciatingly slow, but in many instances it is simply wrong.   The court, itself, is unusually large. It has 29 authorized  judgeships. That is 12 more than the next largest circuit.   The Ninth Circuit is so big that it can't even rehear cases as a  whole body, like every other appeals court does. Instead, cases are  reheard with limited en banc; these are panels of 11 judges each. That  means that only one-third of its judges are deciding law for the entire  court--only one-third.   Of the States suffering under the weight of the Ninth Circuit's  crushing backlog, Arizona shoulders a uniquely heavy burden. Per  capita, Arizona has the busiest Federal docket in the circuit. That  puts Arizonans at the back of an already long line just to get their  day in court.   As if the deluge of cases continues to fill the Ninth Circuit's  docket, the line keeps getting longer and longer if you happen to live  in Arizona.   With problems like these, we are left to ask: Is the Ninth Circuit  simply too big to succeed? If you are an Arizonan, the answer is  unquestionably yes.   Arizonans deserve better, and that is why today I am introducing a  bill to break up the Ninth Circuit.   With the support of my colleague from Arizona, John McCain, and the  support of Gov. Doug Ducey, I have introduced the Judicial  Administration and Improvement Act. This bill would create a new  Twelfth Circuit by moving Arizona, as well as Alaska, Idaho, Montana,  Nevada, and Washington, out of the Ninth Circuit. Doing so would create  two smaller appellate courts where one dysfunctional court stood, all  the while establishing stronger local, regional, and cultural ties.  This would help alleviate the Ninth Circuit's enormous caseload and  ensure a more timely and accurate judicial process for both circuits.   Now, importantly, the bill would also free the new circuit from the  Ninth Circuit's precedent. That means States like Arizona would be able  to chart their own legal course, consistent with their local needs and  traditions.   A fair and functioning judiciary is one of the pillars of our  democracy. Geography shouldn't limit a citizen's access to the courts.   The Judicial Administration and Improvement Act will right this wrong  by restoring faith in our judicial system and securing the access to  Justice that Americans deserve.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself and Mr. Warner):   S. 278.
