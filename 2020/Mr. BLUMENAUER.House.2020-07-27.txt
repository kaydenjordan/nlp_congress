 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy  and her courage, and I welcome this commission's coming forward. It is  part of a dynamic that is playing out across American cities. In my  community, the cries for racial justice and the recognition of the  challenges that have been faced by Black men and boys in this  commission is a step in that direction.  [[Page H3876]]    But I would say this Congress can take another step. We have the MORE  Act which would legalize cannabis. The selective enforcement of the  prohibition of marijuana against Black men and boys has been a tragedy.  It has ruined hundreds of thousands of lives.   This Congress can take action. The bill has already passed out of our  Judiciary Committee with a bipartisan majority. We ought to include  that in our next package and start to right the wrongs and pry away the  cold hand of Richard Nixon's misguided war on drugs that has had such a  vicious impact on Black men and women.   We ought to start with that now.
