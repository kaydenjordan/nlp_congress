 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. On  February 1, south Mississippi tragically lost Hancock County Sheriff  Deputy Lieutenant Michael Boutte in the line of duty. His end of watch  was Monday, February 1, 2021.   Madam Speaker, Boutte was a passionate servant in our community, and  he will be greatly missed by many. He is remembered for his service not  only as a distinguished law enforcement officer, but also as an Air  Force veteran who served in Operation Desert Storm. In everything he  did, Boutte wore his smile with pride and compassion.  [[Page H315]]    A tireless leader in his community, Boutte was responsible for  organizing the Silver Alert system and National Crime Night Out for the  city of Diamondhead. He was also honored with the Lifesaving Medal and  awarded the Officer of the Year Award by the Waveland Community Unity  Organization in 2018.   Boutte made our community and his loved ones immensely proud. Our  State and our Nation owe him and his family a debt of gratitude for his  service and sacrifices. Let us go forth and carry his memory and  service in our hearts and prayers.   Madam Speaker, I ask that Members in the House Chamber please join me  for a moment of silence to honor the life of Lieutenant Michael Boutte.                            ____________________
