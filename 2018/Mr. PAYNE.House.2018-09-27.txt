 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Laura Wooten for  her dedication and service to America's voters.   Ms. Wooten has been a poll worker in New Jersey for 79 consecutive  years. She has dedicated her life to helping people vote, regardless of  their party or position.   Ms. Wooten is the longest serving poll worker in New Jersey. She is  likely the longest serving poll worker in our Nation. In fact, she has  helped administer elections through the administration of 14  Presidents, from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Donald J. Trump.   Ms. Wooten is 97 years old, and she will once again perform her  duties as a poll worker in New Jersey in November with her  characteristic pride, grace, and smile.   Ms. Wooten is a role model for all people and a reminder that every  vote counts. And, as she likes to say, voting is important.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Laura  Wooten by reminding all Americans, regardless of party or position, to  just vote.                            ____________________
