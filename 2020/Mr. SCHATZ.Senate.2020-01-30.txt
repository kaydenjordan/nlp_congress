 Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question on behalf of myself  and Senators Whitehouse and Heinrich, and this is for the counsel for  the President and the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Question from Senators Schatz, Whitehouse, and Heinrich for both  parties:         Can the White House really not admit that Senator King's       hypothetical would be wrong?    We begin with the House managers.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senator, we have no trouble recognizing just how  wrong that would be, but more than that, it is the natural extension of  Professor Dershowitz' argument that if the President believed that kind  of quid pro quo would help his reelection, then it is perfectly fine  and nonimpeachable. There was a reason, of course, why they didn't want  to address that hypothetical.   Let me go back also to the question that was asked about the other  written reports that Ambassador Bolton and Attorney General Barr were  concerned that the President was intervening in cases in which he had  business investments, like Turkey. Under the theory of the President's  lawyers, that is perfectly OK, too. If the President thinks somehow  that that is in the United States' interest because it is in his  interest, that is perfectly fine. It is unimpeachable.   Now, is it a crime to give preference to autocrats, to give special  consideration to autocrats where your business investments are? That  may not be criminal, but it is impeachable. It certainly should be  impeachable if we are going to sacrifice the national security of the  country, if we are going to withhold military aid, if we are going to  bestow favors in U.S. resources to countries where the President has  investments. Is that what we want driving U.S. policy? But that is the  implication of what they have to say.   I agree with counsel about one thing they said: If we have a trial  with no witnesses, that will be a new precedent. We should be very  concerned about the precedent we set here because it will mean  heretofore--that when a President is impeached, that one party can deny  the other witnesses, and that will be the new normal, that we have  trials without witnesses, and I don't think that is the precedent we  should be setting here.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, thank you for the  question.   Let me just begin by noting I think it is a little bit rich for  Manager Schiff to say that one party--i.e., the President--is going to  deny them witnesses. It was the President who was denied any witnesses  throughout this process up until now.   But to get back to the question on Senator King's hypothetical, if  the President insisted that a foreign leader come here and lie about  someone else and he was holding up military aid or a package of  congressional aid and saying ``You have to go out and lie about this,''  that would be wrong. But that is not this case, and it has nothing to  do with this case.   But I would like to address something that Manager Schiff said  because he immediately pivoted now to the next thing. What is in the  newspapers? What else can we bring in from the newspapers? There is an  allegation that the manuscript says something about conversations that  Ambassador Bolton had with Attorney General Barr. Well, Attorney  General Barr has issued a statement saying that allegation, that  assertion, is not accurate, that that is false. And there are other  allegations that are made about what might be in this manuscript. Mick  Mulvaney has issued a statement saying that is not true.   So to sort of play the game of, there is going to be another leak;  somebody might write a book; there is something else--and that is,  again, turning this body into the one doing the investigation because  the House didn't pursue the investigation. That is not prudentially a  wise move for this Chamber to take on that task.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Louisiana.
