 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support continued United States  support for the people of Ukraine in their fight for freedom from  Vladimir Putin's terrible invasion.   In a despicable act of cruelty, Vladimir Putin invaded a peaceful and  democratic nation. He is single-handedly responsible for unthinkable  suffering: 70,000 Ukrainians killed, 13 million people forced from  their homes, civilians shot in the streets, and children separated from  their parents, all to fuel the ego of a dictator in Moscow.   Putin's aggression is a threat to the security of the United States  and our citizens as well. He has made no secret of the fact that his  goal is to undermine the NATO alliance which has kept our Nation safe  and like-minded democracies around the world safe for the past seven  decades. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, if Putin succeeds in his  invasion of Ukraine, he will not stop there.   Like all dictators, he sees democracy anywhere as a threat. He does  not want his own people to know that nations with free elections and  civil rights for their citizens can be strong.   This is the Ukrainians' war to fight, and they are fighting it. The  Ukrainians are fighting for their families and fighting for their  freedom with incredible bravery. The United States will not send troops  to Ukraine, but they do need our help.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the supplemental  budget request for aid to Ukraine. Let's show the world that America  stands with democracies, not with dictators, and reaffirm our  commitment that we will stand with the people of Ukraine in their fight  for freedom for as long as it takes.       Paralyzing Military Nominations Poses Risk to National Security     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support today of our Nation's  military servicemembers whose lives are being put at risk by the  shameful actions of a Senator from Alabama. For months, the Alabama  Senator has blocked more than 300 qualified officers in our military  from receiving the promotions that they have earned and from assuming  the posts that our country needs them in.   Aside from the Senator himself, who seems to love being in the center  of attention, the people who are most excited by his grandstanding are  America's enemies.    No one is happier with the Senator from Alabama's antics than  Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, and our Nation's other adversaries. By  undermining our military, he is doing their dirty work for them.   Don't take it just from me. The Secretary of the Army has stated that  the Senator's actions are eroding the foundations of our military and  putting our national security at risk.   The House Foreign Affairs chairman, Mr. McCaul, who is a member of  the Senator's own party, has said that the Senator's hold on military  nominations is paralyzing and a national security problem.   The Senator has stated that he will continue blocking the promotions  of these experienced and courageous military officers until the  military adopts policies to make it harder for women in the military to  have access to abortion. I disagree with the Senator on abortion, as do  most Americans, but one thing we all ought to agree on is that whatever  our disagreements may be, using our military servicemembers as  political props is just plain wrong. It is an inappropriate tactic, and  it must end now.   Military personnel, from the most junior to the most senior, dedicate  their lives to protecting us and protecting our Nation and the ideals  that we hold dear. We should be supporting them, and they deserve  better than the Senator's antics.   The Senator must lift his hold on these promotions, and if he  doesn't, then the Senate should change their rule so that no one  individual has power to block these promotions and jeopardize our  Nation's security.                             Blockade of Artsakh     Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn Azerbaijan's blockade  of the Lachin corridor, which has created a humanitarian crisis that is  threatening the lives of 120,000 ethnic Armenians who call the Artsakh  region home.   Today in Artsakh, thousands are suffering from shortages of food,  medical supplies, and other basic necessities. Many fear that as winter  approaches, the population could face starvation.   The United States and our allies cannot stand by in the face of this  cruelty. As a member of the House Armenian Issues Caucus, I have  cosponsored legislation to support the people of Artsakh's independence  and safety.   This past June, I joined many of my colleagues urging the  administration to enforce restrictions on U.S. military assistance for  Azerbaijan until the blockade is ended.   I stand with the Armenian people and will continue to support  legislation to  [[Page H4275]]  oppose these human rights violations and call on Azerbaijan to end the  blockade.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do so as well.                            ____________________
