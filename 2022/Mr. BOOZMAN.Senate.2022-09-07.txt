 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of Sevier County Judge Greg Ray, who passed away on August  30, 2022, at the age of 61.   Judge Ray was a beloved member of his community and a fearless  advocate for his constituents about whom he cared deeply. Those who had  the chance to work with him remember his sense of humor, determination,  and kindness.   Since 2010, Judge Ray served as a county leader and was intimately  involved in a number of county and State organizations, including the  County Judges Association of Arkansas--CJAA--where he served as first  vice president and developed close relationships with county judges  across the State. CJAA Chief Legal Counsel Mark Whitmore reflected that  Judge Ray ``was a dear friend, full of life and always had a big smile  and happy disposition. He was a pillar of the CJAA and a leader in his  community.''   Judge Ray was an instrumental figure in establishing the new Sevier  County Medical Center, which is set to open at the end of this year. At  the ground-breaking ceremony, he praised the residents of Sevier County  for the high voter turnout in support of the new medical facility.  ``The citizens didn't just show up. They showed out,'' he said.   Thanks to his leadership and advocacy, the new hospital will bring  much needed assistance to the people of rural southwest Arkansas, a  legacy his loved ones and the citizens he served will be proud to  reflect and carry on for years to come.   Outside of his role as county judge, he enjoyed fishing and served as  a key organizer for the Sevier County Chamber of Commerce's annual Tri- Lakes Big Bass Festival. He also hosted the annual Senior Citizens Day  celebration on the Sevier County Courthouse Square.   I join Judge Greg Ray's family, friends, and all Arkansans in  mourning his passing. He set a worthy example for his hard-working  staff and county judges across the State to emulate, and the people of  Arkansas are grateful for his dedication to better our lives and  communities.                            ____________________
