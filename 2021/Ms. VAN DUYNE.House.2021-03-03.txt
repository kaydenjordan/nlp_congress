 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's amendment,  and I will be supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, the underlying  bill, the ``destroy election integrity and centralize all power in  Washington, D.C., act'' that Democrats are, once again, pushing because  they never have and never will believe in the rights of our States and  the limited power of Federal Government.   Some of my colleagues who took every opportunity to emphasize that  democracy was on the ballot in this past election have returned to  Congress eager to change election laws in their favor.   H.R. 1 is wholly about control--control of free speech and control of  how elections are conducted. And when they exercise this control, their  purpose is to crush opposing views, because opposing views will not be  tolerated when there are Democrat majorities at stake.   America's strength lies in its free speech and decentralized  elections, and we must continue to make our election system more  resilient to natural challenges and foreign actors. H.R. 1 fails to do  this on all fronts.   Mr. Speaker, I was elected by the people of the 24th District of  Texas to stand up for freedom, the rule of law, and limited government.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this vile new form of tyranny in  H.R. 1.
