 Mr. President, I wish to speak on recent legislation  extending the National Flood Insurance Program on a short-term basis.   The National Flood Insurance Program, NFIP, was created in 1968 in  response to the lack of flood insurance available at the time. The  program's intent was to encourage folks to protect their homes and  communities to adopt sound floodplain management standards.   I would like to reiterate the findings of the 1966 Presidential Task  Force on Federal Flood Control Policy: ``A flood insurance program is a  tool that should be used expertly or not at all. Correctly applied it  could promote wise use of flood plains. Incorrectly applied, it could  exacerbate the whole problem of flood losses. For the Federal  Government to subsidize low premium disaster insurance or provide  insurance in which premiums are not proportionate to risk would be to  invite economic waste of great magnitude''   In less than a year, we have extended the program seven times, most  attached to must-pass bills, without any needed reforms. The program is  over $20 billion in debt, even though we forgave $16 billion of that  debt just last year. With our Federal debt now above $21 trillion, we  need to address the solvency of the NFIP as soon as possible.   We can begin doing that by bringing some meaningful reform to the  program, including moving towards more risk-based premiums. More  importantly, interest from the private flood insurance market is  growing. Their involvement means more flexible flood policies,  integrated coverage with other insurance policies, and lower-cost  coverage for some customers. Increasing private insurance's  participation in flood insurance markets would reduce the financial  risk obligations of this program for the Federal Government. I hope  Congress will further clarify private insurers' role in the flood  insurance market. As it stands, the NFIP cannot stand on its own feet,  and it requires significant reforms to put it on sound financial  footing. I urge my colleagues to find bipartisan, sustainable reforms  to this program. We must stop kicking the can down the road on the  necessary reforms needed to make this an effective program.    Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague and his  committee for their efforts to address these concerns. I am hopeful  reform is just around the corner, and I encourage my colleagues to  continue to support reform of the National Flood Insurance Program.                            ____________________
