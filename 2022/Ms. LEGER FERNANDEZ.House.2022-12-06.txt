 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the  hundreds--no, thousands of DACA recipients and Dreamers who inspire us  every day with their art, resiliency, and strength.   Their stories of success, hope, and dreams are the stories of our  country and those who truly believe in the American Dream.   Last week, I went to the Kennedy Center, one of the world's most  prestigious performing arts venues, here in this very city, to see the  Ballet Hispanico.   There, I saw Hugo Pizano Orozco, an artist, a dancer, and a Dreamer.  He is a constituent of mine from Espanola, New Mexico.   Hugo and his family are originally from Guanajuato, Mexico. He came  to the United States before he was 2 years old.   After moving from Mexico to Espanola, he fell in love with the art  that is dance. He attended the New Mexico School for the Arts, which is  a very prestigious school in New Mexico dedicated to the arts.   But like many others, his future remained uncertain because of his  immigration status. As a senior, he didn't know if his DACA status  would be granted.   Once it was finally approved, though, he applied and was accepted to  Juilliard, one of the world's most prestigious performing arts schools.  Today, he is a renowned dancer and on tour with Ballet Hispanico.   I have a picture of him here because he does inspire with his art  form. He inspires me. He soars across the dance floor at the Kennedy  Center.   I was moved, so I asked him for his permission to highlight his  story, his inspiration to our community and to America of what our  Dreamers can do when we let them live their dream, when we let them  accomplish what they are capable of doing in our beautiful country.   His story reminds us of the inspiring stories of thousands of  Dreamers across our country. His family brought him to the United  States in search of a better life, and he found his American Dream.   His story reflects the best of us and what the American Dream is  truly about: hopes and dreams for a better future. Like so many others,  his story inspires me, gives me hope, and is why I stand here today.   He soars from New Mexico and graces America with his stunning  performances, but we find Dreamers in every State and every community.   I want to echo his words today. He said: ``Don't think because you  are from a small town in New Mexico, you can't go out there and do the  thing you want to do.''   We need to remember that small places can do big things. Yes, small  places can do big things.                                time  1700    Our Dreamers come from all walks of life--small towns, big cities,  the rural areas, suburbia, everywhere. They believe they could do more,  and with DACA they have done more.   Like Cindy Nava, a fellow New Mexican who came from Chihuahua,  Mexico, seeking a better life. Now, as a 35-year-old, she is actually  the first-ever DACA recipient to achieve a presidential appointment to  work in the Biden administration as a senior policy advisor to the U.S.  Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. She now works for Marcia  Fudge.   Hugo and Cindy are two of the more than 5,000 DACA recipients who  make New Mexico a more vibrant place to live.   None of this would have been possible if we didn't have DACA. With  the recent court rulings, however, DACA is in immediate danger. We need  our Senate Republican colleagues to rise to the moment.   We passed out of this House in the spring of 2021 the American Dream  and Promise Act. We now need the Senate to act and work with us to pass  bipartisan legislation before the end of the year because it is now or  never for our Dreamers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Garcia. We  know that Americans want DACA to be codified. They want our Dreamers to  live here.   Indeed, in the United States we know that a bipartisan poll conducted  in October 2022 found overwhelming support,  [[Page H8784]]  Democrats, Independents, and Republicans all support this. Democrats  support it at 93 percent, Independents at 75 percent, and our  Republican neighbors, they also support it at 71 percent.   This needs to happen. This needs to happen for us to truly live up to  the promise that we could be.   The Congressional Hispanic Caucus is holding this Special Order hour.  I welcome all of my colleagues who have come to speak before us here  today.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz),  the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who has come with his  two daughters, to share with us his thoughts on Dreamers.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Ruiz for  bringing Sky and Sage to the floor of the House today, because as we  look at these beautiful, intelligent, curious children--and curious is  one of the best things to be, you know, because that means you are  curious about the world around you--they are the age of many of our  DACA recipients who came with their parents. Their parents made the  choice and the children came with them. This is the only home many of  the DACA recipients have ever known.   What have they done in this home?   They have brought so many of us joy. They have helped make our  schools vibrant. They are caring for our children, for your children,  as doctors, teachers, nurses, and accountants. They are in all walks of  life. Some of them choose to go into accountancy.   We have the stories here, numerous, from every State and every  district, of those who chose to apply for DACA protections.   Right now we know that because of the Fifth Circuit decision that  declared DACA unlawful, that these hundreds of young Dreamers and  families are afraid for their futures. We must act.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  bringing us the story of such bravery and sacrifice, because across  this country Dreamers are participating in every single aspect of our  lives, whether it be defending our country in the United States or  abroad.   They are firefighters. I have a story here of an amazing firefighter  who is from Sacramento, California, and was one of the first Dreamers  who became a firefighter. He has now moved on and is pursuing  additional studies so that he can pursue a career in health to serve as  a PA.                                time  1715    We know that in so many of our areas, we don't have enough doctors  and nurses and PAs and nurse practitioners and, yet, this Dreamer is  engaged in that very area of study.   Over and over again, if we deny the Dreamers their ability to  continue to contribute to our country, we will suffer, whether that be  in the area of health, as we just heard from one of our speakers, from  our chair, or the area of the arts, or as the numerous teachers, the  numerous Dreamers have chosen as their area of expertise and their way  of giving back to teach our youngest.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia) to  share with us what he knows is happening in Illinois with the numerous  Dreamers that live in both his city and in his State.  [[Page H8785]]     I thank the gentleman for sharing the economic  impacts of DACA recipients because we need to highlight that; that any  opposition to the American Dream and Promise Act is not based on the  benefits it brings to our country because the economic benefits are  amazing, so I appreciate the fact that the gentleman raised it.   The gentleman said how much taxes are paid. Households with DACA  recipients pay $5.6 billion in Federal taxes and $3.1 billion in State  and local taxes every single year. They create lots of after-tax income  that leads to economic activity in the communities that they come from.   In fact, the importance of DACA and our Dreamers is so great that on  October 20, 80 major businesses and trade associations wrote to  congressional leaders in support of a bipartisan American Dream and  Promise Act. The letter was signed by, among others, the National  Association of Manufacturers, the National Retail Federation, the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, Microsoft, Amazon, and many, many more because we  know that Dreamers are essential to our economy.   What would happen if we let DACA die? If we let DACA die, an average  of 1,000 Dreamers will lose their jobs each week in labor markets  already experiencing shortages, such as healthcare, education, service  industries, food production, and more because they would lose their  jobs as their ability to renew would disappear. So every week, we would  lose that.   It is like a drum, a drum, a drumbeat toward financial trouble when  we already need to address the need for more workers in our country. We  would lose the benefit that they develop for our economy; $400 billion  in economic benefit if we pass the American Dream and Promise Act,  because we need to say, we are not just trying to save DACA, we  actually want DACA to end because we are going to replace with the  American Dream and Promise Act. We are looking for the American Dream  and Promise Act because that ends DACA the way it should; not by death  to a core that doesn't understand the benefit of this, but to the  codification to give our Dreamers the path to citizenship they deserve.    That is why we are calling upon the Senate. We are asking to have-- all of the Democrat Senators presently support the American Dream and  Promise Act. So what we are looking for is 10 Republican Senators to  join with the Chamber of Commerce, to join with the trade associations,  to join with the people across this country, to join with their own  constituents, with their own constituents.   I think we need to remember the amount of Republicans who supported  the Dream and Promise Act in the 1970s. It is what our constituents  want us to do. It is what the Senate constituents want them to do, from  whatever State you are in.   We must ask the Senate to take action now. Let's codify this. Let's  not punt down the road any more times. Let's actually pass the American  Dream and Promise Act. Everybody wants it because we know without it,  the consequences are dire.   I also want to remind everybody that many of these Dreamers are in  mixed-status households, as we say. The Dreamers live with their  children, if they are old enough, who are citizens; they live with  spouses who may be citizens and legal residents; and they provide for  the families at the same time that they are providing for our  communities. They are providing for their families.   They come from many, many countries, not just Latin American  countries. If you will notice up here, I cannot read it, but Koreans-- we have many, many DACA recipients who speak Korean.   We have DACA recipients who speak all of the different languages of  our world because they come from the many countries of our world to the  United States. They have been brought here; and, once here, we have to  remember the Dream and Promise Act has been introduced time and time  again.   The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, was put in place as  a placeholder so that we could pass the American Dream and Promise Act.  The placeholder is calling upon us now to act. The placeholder must be  replaced with the American Dream and Promise Act so that our children,  those who will lead us up and will lead great lives in our community  can find that path to citizenship.   So that is what we are asking our colleagues in the Senate to do. We  sent you this bill months and months ago. You saw this bill in the  115th, 116th, and 117th Congress, and now it is time to pass it; now or  never because we cannot wait. We cannot wait for the courts to act  because Congress' duty is to act. Our duty is to see a problem and take  action to correct it.   In Jeremiah 29:11 God's plan for us is not to suffer, but to have  prosperity, hope, and a future. Our job in Congress is to create that  prosperity, hope, and a future. This bill, the American Dream and  Promise Act, has accomplished that plan to create prosperity, hope, and  a future for those who have come and lived in our communities from the  youngest of age. So, we call upon the Senate to act.  [[Page H8786]]    On behalf of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I am proud to stand  with my colleagues who stood here and spoke in favor of passing the  American Dream and Promise Act because, make no mistake: The DACA  program is the result of the failure of Congress to live up to its  obligation to create that prosperity, hope, and a future.   We need the DACA kids to continue their education. We need those who  have been in this country from a very young age to be able to assert  and have the protections of those who are presently enrolled in DACA.   Dreamers have been raised and educated here. They work in our  communities. They raise their families. They attend our colleges. They  serve in our military. They die for the country and the home that they  have known.   We now ask Congress, we ask the Senate Republicans to hear those  dreams and to pass the American Dream and Promise Act in whatever  vehicle it must be. We urge them to consider including it in the  omnibus, to include it in the NDAA, but to pass it.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
