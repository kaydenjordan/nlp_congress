 Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a  faith leader and community activist from my home State of Maryland who  has recently stepped down from his post as senior pastor at Union  Baptist Church: Reverend Alvin C. Hathaway. I would like to honor his  service to the people of Maryland and enter the details of his journey  into the Congressional Record so that current and future generations  may learn from and study his inspiring career.   The story of Reverend Hathaway's life is deeply bound to the story of  Union Baptist Church. Alvin Hathaway grew up on Druid Hill Avenue in  West Baltimore in a family that believed deeply in combining education  and service--four doors down from the church itself--and he came of age  in a neighborhood shaped and nurtured by faith. That community had  cradled other great leaders too--leaders who,  [[Page S8909]]  like Reverend Hathaway, bent the arc of history toward justice.  Thurgood Marshall had lived along the same avenue where he grew up. The  late great Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings was one of his high  school classmates. And at an early age, Reverend Hathaway was mentored  by another legendary son of Baltimore City and civil rights champion,  Reverend Vernon Dobson, with whom he helped organize and found BUILD,  Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development. That organization has  been serving the people of Baltimore City for over 40 years, helping to  improve affordable housing, create jobs, revitalize neighborhoods, and  so much more.   Through BUILD, Reverend Hathaway left his mark on Baltimore City  early in his career, and his legacy of good works will continue to  endure through that powerful organization. But he has never been one to  rest on his laurels, and Reverend Hathaway continued throughout his  life to find new ways of serving at the intersection of faith and  social justice--and of giving back to the church and the community that  raised him. After earning a B.A. from the McKendree University School  of Religion and an M.A. from Saint Mary's Seminary and University in  Baltimore, Reverend Hathaway pursued a Ph.D. at the United Theological  Seminary in Ohio, and he chose the history of Union Baptist Church as  the focus of his academic study. Through his deep research into the  narrative and legacy of that church, Reverend Hathaway became a steward  of the church's culture, traditions, and values. I submit that no one  knows Union Baptist Church better than Reverend Hathaway.   He then returned to Baltimore City, becoming senior pastor of Union  Baptist in 2007, and he channeled his efforts in that role toward  renovating the very traditions of the church that he had studied and  lived for so many years. Reverend Hathaway marshalled the full force of  his religious wisdom and oratorical gift to guide the West Baltimore  community forward, through both good times and bad times. His swelling  sermons moved a generation--and grew the faith.   But Reverend Hathaway learned early that the duties of a faith leader  don't end at the bricks of the church walls. He took the values of his  religious devotion and aimed them at the ongoing fight to realize the  full promise of civil rights and equal opportunity. His efforts have  spanned issues of health equity, civil rights, wages, and employment,  but perhaps his greatest fight of them all has been waged through his  dedication to expanding access to education. As senior pastor, Reverend  Hathaway was deeply committed to bolstering the church's Head Start  Program so more children from the surrounding area could receive high- quality early education. I have had the privilege of visiting the Union  Baptist Head Start with him to see, firsthand, the impact his work has  had on the community. Reverend Hathaway's legacy can be seen in the  wide smiles of the children who benefit from that initiative--and who  benefit from his efforts to grow and strengthen that vital program.   While senior pastor at Union Baptist, Reverend Hathaway also served  as a longtime leader of Promise Heights, an organization committed to  improving outcomes in West Baltimore's Community Schools. He has helped  guide the course of higher education through his role on the board of  the University of Maryland Medical Center. He was an early and  outspoken advocate for bridging the digital divide and narrowing the  homework gap so more students could access the internet. And even now,  after his retirement, he is leading the fight to transform the now  vacant lot of P.S. 103 in West Baltimore into the Justice Thurgood  Marshall Center, which will focus on programs supporting education,  justice, and ethics.   He has done all this, and more, over the course of an extraordinary  career marked by a commitment to his faith, a dedication to the people  of Baltimore City, and a belief in the power of community. Though he  has retired as the leader of Union Baptist Church, I know that he will  carry on in the work that has defined his tenure as senior pastor--and  defined his entire life. I am proud to call him a full partner in the  work of building a more perfect union, and I will continue standing  shoulder-to-shoulder with him in our shared endeavor to invest in the  success of all.                            ____________________
