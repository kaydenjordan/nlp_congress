 Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans donate blood each  year.   Every 2 seconds, someone in America needs blood, and one person's  blood donation can save as many as three lives in a crisis. A single  car accident victim could require as many as 100 pints of blood. But it  can't be manufactured; it can only come from volunteer donors.   Blood donors help patients of all ages, whether they are burn  victims, cancer patients, or transplant recipients. My friend and my  colleague  Steve Scalise needed as many as 20 pints of blood on the day  that he was shot nearly a year ago.   In fact, he is hosting a blood drive this week, and I would encourage  all those who have the opportunity to donate blood this week. He is  doing it in honor of World Blood Donor Day on June 14.   Mr. Speaker, I would encourage all of those as well who are eligible  to make an effort to donate blood to do so yourselves, because blood  donors are lifesavers.                            ____________________
