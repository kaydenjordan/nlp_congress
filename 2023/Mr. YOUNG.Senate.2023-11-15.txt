 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 40th  anniversary of the Center for Excellence in Education, CEE.   When Admiral Rickover and Joan DiGennaro founded CEE in 1983, they  set out on an ambitious mission to nurture high school and university  scholars towards esteemed careers in the fields of science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics--STEM. Since its founding, CEE's renowned  Research Science Institute has collaborated with brilliant scholars  from all 50 U.S. States and an impressive 61 countries. Further  showcasing CEE's impact, the USA Biolympiad competition has had over  10,000 students participate, with the U.S. team achieving many gold  medals. Additionally, the Teacher Enrichment Program and STEM Lyceums  provide transformative learning opportunities for teachers, especially  those in underserved and rural areas.   As an honorary trustee of CEE, I am consistently impressed with the  organization's unwavering commitment to advancing STEM education.  Through my lens as a legislator, I recognize the critical importance of  STEM education as we navigate the challenges posed by global  competitors in domains spanning advanced mathematics, artificial  intelligence, and biosecurity. STEM will undeniably shape the future  economy, and I wholeheartedly commend CEE's efforts to inspire and  equip our youth with the necessary skills for a flourishing future.   It is my honor to recognize and congratulate the Center for  Excellence in Education on its 40th anniversary.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we are back here again on the floor of the  U.S. Senate. It is early in the morning. Why are we down here?   We are down here to keep faith with those officers in the military,  members of their families, and those who will follow them--that when  members of our military spend their entire professional lives building  up experiences--leadership experiences, experiences in battle-- obtaining multiple degrees, making countless sacrifices back home, that  their careers won't be interrupted by politics that they have got  nothing at all to do with.   Let me go through five areas: first, areas of agreement with my good  friend--and he is my good friend, Senator Tuberville. I sit right next  to  [[Page S5562]]  him, and I have a lot of respect for Senator Tuberville. He and I share  agreement on pro-life principles. We are both, in every respect--our  policies, our convictions, our public statements, our past history-- strongly pro-life. I don't think anyone questions that.   We also believe that the President's actions as it relates to these  policies--the ones that he and I find objectionable--to transport our  servicemembers out of State to obtain abortions using taxpayer money is  patently illegal. We think it should be challenged.   Second point: We do have disagreements on this, but they are tactical  disagreements, not grounded in principle--tactical disagreements that  we are trying to find alternatives to. The reason I don't think this  current approach is even constructive is because, as many of my  colleagues have already stated, it punishes those brave servicemembers  who didn't develop the policy and can't change it, and that, therefore,  breeds a lot of frustration and even cynicism about our elected  officials.   Fourth, this is a dangerous time, something I underscored last time I  was down here to talk about this. It is a time of war. The United  States blessedly is not involved in that war actively. We don't have  boots on the ground, but we have been actively resourcing our friends  and partners. It is a dangerous and precarious time for our friends.  God forbid, some sort of escalation occurs. We don't want to get pulled  into that. We have a porous southern border. We need our best team on  the field.   And the last point I really want to emphasize tonight is that this is  personal to me. This is personal to this U.S. Senator. I proudly  represent the people of Indiana in this institution, but I have a  history serving in other areas, serving with other individuals.   I proudly graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1995, and, this  evening, I will be calling to the floor from the Executive Calendar the  names of seven individuals who have been nominated for the rank of rear  admiral (lower half).   They were classmates of mine. Our class is really proud of these  individuals. I think there is broad acknowledgment that they have  earned this opportunity to lead at the highest level in the best  military that ever was, and I want to do my part to give them that  opportunity. I am asking Senator Tuberville to do his part.    ``Non sibi sed patriae.'' It is the motto of the class of 1995. ``Not  self, but country.'' ``Non sibi sed patriae.''   So I am asking an exception to be made for my classmates here, these  seven individuals and seven patriots of whom I am quite proud.   So, Mr. President, with that in mind, I call to the floor Executive  Calendar No. 104, CAPT Kurtis A. Mole, to the grade of Rear Admiral  (lower half).   Captain Mole enlisted in the Navy in 1988, becoming a cryptologic  technician and attending the prestigious Defense Language Institute, or  DLI, in Monterey. Captain Mole went on to attend the Naval Academy,  earning a commission in 1995 as a surface warfare officer.   After his redesignation as a cryptologic warfare officer in 2000, he  went on to serve in many positions, including the senior cryptologist  for the USS Kittyhawk Strike Group, the information officer for the  commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, the information warfare commander  for USS Ronald Reagan Strike Group, and the commanding officer of NSA/ CSS Hawaii.   Captain Mole has been deployed multiple times to the Arabian Gulf and  the Western Pacific--an amazing career.   And we can confirm this nomination by voice vote right now.   And, therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session for the consideration of the following nomination:  CAPT Kurtis A. Mole to be Rear Admiral (lower half) in the U.S. Navy,  under Calendar No. 104; that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I do hope the President of the United  States and Secretary Austin heed the entreaties of my esteemed  colleague representing the State of Utah.   With that, I call to the floor Executive Calendar No. 105, CAPT  Thomas J. Dickinson to the grade of Rear Admiral.   Captain Dickinson was also a classmate of mine at the U.S. Naval  Academy. He was commissioned in 1995 and became a surface warfare  officer.   He has held numerous positions, most with a high level of expertise.  These include his time as a weapons officer and combat systems officer  aboard the USS The Sullivans and commanding officer aboard the USS  Barry. Most notably, during his command tour of the USS Barry, he  completed a 9-month ballistic missile defense deployment in the eastern  Mediterranean Sea and earned the Battle Effectiveness Award, being  recognized for its crew's high levels of sustained proficiency and  readiness.   Captain Dickinson is currently serving as the commander of the Naval  Surface Warfare Center and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in an  acting capacity until his promotion is processed.   We can confirm this nomination by voice vote tonight, right now.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive  session for the consideration of the following nomination: CAPT Thomas  J. Dickinson to be Rear Admiral (lower half) in the U.S. Navy under  Calendar No. 105; that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; that, if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, there are now tens--tens--of Americans  watching us on C-SPAN2, captivated, I know, by the presentation this  evening. I think they are perhaps divided. Some may look upon these  proceedings and think: What a functional U.S. Senate. Every voice must  be heard. Every perspective must be delivered. Every phrase must be  uttered.   Others will say, perhaps, it is dysfunction, perhaps there is an  effort to obfuscate.   I don't know what they will conclude, but I do know that I intend to  continue reading through these brave patriots' class of 1995 U.S. Naval  Academy graduates who have been nominated to the grade of Rear Admiral  (lower half). And we are very proud of it. And I hope they can be  confirmed later this evening.   So I will be proceeding and reading each of their biographies, fused  together, indeed, in a strength, without any intervening parliamentary  request which might be seized upon for C-SPAN viewership.   Navy CAPT Neil Koprowski to the grade of Rear Admiral. Captain  Koprowski has served in the U.S. Navy since receiving his commission in  1995. Did I say it? 1995. He has held numerous operational assignments,  including commanding officer post of the USS San Antonio and the USS  Kearsarge. Captain Koprowski currently serves as the commander for U.S.  Naval Forces Korea and U.S. Navy Region Korea, a posting that handles  the highly competitive regional challenges we face today.   Captain Koprowski has also received many awards in his career,  including the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, and the  Joint Service Commendation Medal.   CAPT Lincoln M. Reifsteck to the grade of Rear Admiral. Captain  Reifsteck has served his country since graduating from the Naval  Academy in 1995.   Did I mention he and I were classmates?   He has held numerous assignments, including as the commanding officer  of the USS Hampton, the division chief of the Nuclear Operations  Division for the Joint Staff, and commodore of Submarine Development  Squadron 5.   Captain Reifsteck currently serves as the branch head of the Undersea  Warfare Division in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations.   CAPT Frank A. Rhodes IV has also been nominated to the grade of Rear  Admiral. CAPT Frank Rhodes has been serving in the Navy since 1995. He  graduated from the Naval Academy. We were classmates. He served in  numerous positions, including commanding officer of Strike Fighter  Squadron 81 and the air wing commander of Carrier Air Wing 3.   Captain Rhodes has been serving in the Office of the Chief of Naval  Operations for over 4 years, where he has been the Carrier Strike  Aircraft and Weapons branch head and the executive assistant to the  Chief of Naval Operations.   Then we have CAPT Forrest O. Young, also nominated to the grade of  Rear Admiral. Captain Young served in the Navy for almost 30 years. He  graduated from the Naval Academy. We were, of course, classmates. And  he thereafter became an accomplished fighter pilot. He held operational  commands around the world, including time as commander of Strike  Fighter Squadron 105, commander of Carrier Air Wing 5, and time as an  instructor as a Navy Top Gun.   Captain Young most recently served as director of Aviation Officer  Career Management and Distribution Division, Navy Personnel Command.   CAPT Craig T. Mattingly, also nominated to grade of Rear Admiral.  Over Captain Mattingly's 28-year career, he has led squadrons on  deployments supporting EUCOM, AFRICOM, and CENTCOM, areas of  responsibility as commander of multiple task groups.   His major command tour was commander of Patrol and Reconnaissance  Wing 11. During his tenure as commodore, CPRW-11 supported global  initiatives to include the inaugural INDOPACOM deployments of the MQ-4C  Triton Unmanned Aerial System and P-8A Poseidon Advanced Airborne  Sensor, as well as the P-3C Littoral Surveillance Radar System.   Mattingly's most recent assignment was serving as senior military  adviser of the Secretary of the Navy. He has accumulated more than  3,900 flight hours in the P-3 Orion and P-8 Poseidon aircraft and  served on teams that have received various awards and recognition.   He, too, was a classmate of mine, class of 1995.   And I am most hopeful each of these individuals can, ultimately, be  confirmed, as my good friend and respected colleague, with whom I share  deep pro-life convictions, Senator Tuberville contemplates a more  constructive policy.   We have visited in that regard. He is working hard toward that end. I  know he wants to accomplish that.  [[Page S5568]]    Having offered that thought, I am going to yield to Senator Ernst of  Iowa.
