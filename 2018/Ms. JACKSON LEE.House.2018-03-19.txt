 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5074,  the DHS Cyber Incident Response Teams Act of 2018.   The ``DHS Cyber Incident Response Teams Act of 2018,'' codifies DHS'  National Cybersecurity and Communications Coordination Center (NCCIC)  hunt and incident response teams which the Department currently deploys  to provide intrusion analysis, identify malicious actors, analyze  malicious tools, and provide mitigation assistance to entities  requesting assistance after a cybersecurity incident.   The DHS' Hunt and Incident Response Teams play an integral role in  improving the cybersecurity posture of critical infrastructure owners  and operators, from energy and nuclear power firms to state and local  governments administering elections.   The bill requires the NCCIC to submit information to Congress  regarding metrics for the teams, at the conclusion of the first four  years after enactment.   In 2016, Russian actors targeted U.S. election infrastructure,  hackers escalated efforts to  [[Page H1663]]  breach the domestic energy sector, and WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware  wreaked havoc on public and private infrastructure around the world.   According to Symantec, a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions,  said that ``The world of cyber espionage experienced a notable shift  towards more overt activity, designed to destabilize and disrupt  targeted organizations and countries.''   These threats to cyber security are not new.   In June 2015, it was reported that the Office of Personnel Management  lost personal information on 21.5 million current and former federal  employees and their families.   In 2017, the following were reported attacks and breaches:   WannaCry ransomware that infected millions of networks worldwide; and  the   Equifax hack exposed millions of American's credit information to  cyber-thieves;   Our nation's critical infrastructure and civilian government agencies  depend on the cybersecurity talent and resources that the Department of  Homeland Security can provide on the frontline to defend against  attacks.   As cyber threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, so  must U.S. efforts to confront them.   The Department of Homeland Security plays a central role in the  federal government's cybersecurity apparatus and in coordinating  federal efforts to secure critical infrastructure.   DHS is charged with coordinating agency efforts to secure the  (dot).gov Domain, while also serving as the hub for cybersecurity  information sharing between and among the private sector and federal  government.   Earlier this Congress, I introduced H.R. 3202, the Cyber  Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, which was passed by the full  House and is now in the Senate.   H.R. 3202 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a  report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber  vulnerability disclosures.   The report will include an annex with information on instances in  which cyber security vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures  were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing  systems that or digital devices at risk.   The report will provide information on the degree to which the  information provided by DHS was used by industry and other  stakeholders.   The reason that I worked to bring this bill before the committee is  the problem often referred to as a ``Zero Day Event,'' which describes  the situation that network security professionals may find themselves  when a previously unknown error in computing code is exploited by a  cybercriminal or terrorist.   As with other threats that this nation has faced and overcome, we  must create the resources and the institutional responses to protect  our nation against cyber threats while preserving our liberties and  freedoms.   We cannot accomplish this task without the full cooperation and  support of the private sector, computing research community and  academia.   This level of engagement requires the trust and confidence of the  American people that this new cyber threat center will be used for the  purpose it was created and that the collaboration of others in this  effort to better protect computing networks will be used only for  protection and defense.   There are people with skills and those with the potential to develop  skills that would be of benefit to our nation's efforts to develop an  effective cybersecurity defense and deterrence posture.   It is my hope that as we move forward the Committee on Homeland  Security will continue in a bipartisan manner to seek out the best ways  to bring the brightest and most qualified people into the government as  cybersecurity professionals.   With this policy objective in mind, I look forward to working with  the Committee on H.R. 1981, the Cyber Security Education and Federal  Workforce Enhancement Act.   I urge my Colleagues in the House to join me in voting for H.R. 5074.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior Member of the Committee on  Homeland Security, a former chairman of the Transportation and  Protective Security Subcommittee, and an original co-sponsor, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 4176, ``Air Cargo Security Improvement Act of  2017.''   H.R. 4176 will strengthen the nation's air cargo security networks by  requiring the Transportation Security Administration to establish an  air cargo security division within the agency.  [[Page H1665]]    Within 120 days of enactment, TSA would conduct a feasibility study  on the expanded use of computed tomography for air cargo.   Following the study, TSA would be required to initiate a pilot  program to achieve enhanced air cargo security screening through the  use of new or emerging technologies.   Within 150 days of enactment, TSA would be required to report to  Congress on actions to improve the effectiveness of the Certified Cargo  Screening Program.   The Government Accountability Office is tasked with reviewing the  effectiveness of DHS' approach to addressing the air cargo security  risk, including the risk-based strategy for examining air cargo and  ensuring compliance with air cargo security rules.   TSA would be required to request that the Aviation Security Advisory  Committee's Subcommittee on Air Cargo conduct a comprehensive review of  TSA's Known Shipper Program.   Mr. Speaker, thirteen years ago, the U.S. National Commission on  Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (9/11 Commission) expressed  concerns ``regarding the screening and transport of checked bags and  cargo.''   The Commission called for called for more attention and resources to  be directed to reducing or mitigating the threat posed by explosives in  vessels' cargo holds.   Today, the threat of a terrorist attack using air cargo is  significant.   In fact, in July, then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly  identified cargo-based aviation attacks as a major concern, explaining  ``there are people out there, very smart people, very sophisticated  people who do nothing but try to figure out how to blow up an airplane  in flight.''   Secretary Kelly also said ``There is a fair amount of cargo, what we  would attribute to just cargo flown on passenger airplane on space  available. Terrorists are constantly looking for ways to do this.''   This increase in the air cargo security risk comes at a time when the  volume of goods being moved by air cargo has increased, with 2016  volume back to approximately 98.4 percent of pre-recession levels with  airlines transporting 52 million metric tons of goods.   In response to this security risk, H.R. 4176 directs the  Transportation Security Administration to take a number of steps to  enhance its responsibilities for air cargo and require the agency to  aggressively move towards addressing current and future threats to air  cargo.   Specifically, H.R. 4176 clarifies air cargo security responsibilities  at TSA, encourages further technological developments for screening air  cargo, directs a review of existing air cargo programs, and requires  the Department of Homeland Security to make the Air Cargo Advance  Screening Program permanent.   The threat posed by terrorists' abilities and desires to exploit  vulnerabilities cannot be understated and they have demonstrably set  their targets on air cargo.   We need to be timely and precise in addressing air cargo security, as  we cannot afford, nor should the American public tolerate, otherwise.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 4176 so we can  make Americans more secure from the threat of an air cargo-based  terrorist attack.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5131, the  ``Surface Transportation Security Improvement Act of 2018,'' which  would increase the nation's readiness to deal with national security  threats.   H.R. 5131 requires the Government Accountability Office to review the  effectiveness of the Transportation Security Administration's Biennial  National Strategy for Transportation Security.   H.R. 5131 would also require the Department of Homeland Security to  develop risk-based priorities across all transportation modes.   This would be informed by analysis of terrorist attack scenarios for  each mode of transportation.   The work directly under this will also include cyber-attack  scenarios, which poses an increasing threat to the well-being of our  public and private infrastructures.   H.R. 5131 requires DHS to explain overdue surface transportation  security rulemakings and the Inspector General to review DHS's  explanations, and report on its findings.   It directs DHS to conduct a feasibility assessment of introducing  next generation technologies to detect threats to surface  transportation systems.   DHS would also disseminate best practices for enhancing  transportation security against the threat of vehicle-based attacks.   The bill also requires DHS to conduct and report to Congress on a  survey of surface transportation stakeholders regarding resource  challenges, including the availability of Federal funding and specific  unmet needs.   It authorizes a TSA task force to identify and develop innovative  technologies and capabilities to enhance transportation security,  including surface transportation security.   It also directs DHS to assess the threats posed by the use of  security technologies developed or manufactured by firms owned or  closely linked to the governments of countries known to pose cyber or  homeland security threats.   This is extremely important given the ongoing threats to our  democracy from a rising number of malevolent global actors, including  North Korea and Russia.   Finally, the bill requires the TSA to develop a strategy to guide  surface transportation security inspector operations, which would be  subject to GAO review.   In sum, H.R. 5131 enhances TSA's surface transportation security  operations across a range of activities, while taking into  consideration the role of computers in the modernization of our  nation's transportation systems.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I rise as a member of the House  Committee on Homeland Security, subcommittee on Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Protection to speak in strong support of H.R. 5089,  ``the Strengthening Local Transportation Security Capabilities Act of  2018.''   Thank you Representative Barragan for introducing this important  measure, as former Chairwoman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on  Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection I understand the  value and importance of this bill.   I have long supported bolstering our Nation's transportation system  security through improving coordination of local jurisdictions with  federal law enforcement agencies.   H.R. 5089 does just that by requiring the Department of Homeland  Security to prioritize the detailing of personnel from the  Transportation Security Administration and the DHS Office of  Intelligence and Analysis to be stationed with participating state,  local, and-regional fusion center in jurisdictions with a high-risk  surface transportation asset.  [[Page H1675]]    In 2013, the Port of Houston which receives over 200 million tons of  cargo a year was the 8th busiest container port in the nation.   Houston, also home to George Bush International Airport, the 14th  busiest airport in the nation, will benefit directly from the resources  provided in H.R. 5089.   Our transportation system facilitates economic growth through  creating jobs, transporting goods, and connecting communities to one  another.   This bill requires officers and analysts to participate in the  generation and dissemination of transportation security intelligence  products.   Additionally, H.R. 5089 directs TSA to make available to public and  private sector stakeholders a framework for establishing integrated and  unified operations centers responsible for overseeing daily operations  of transportation facilities to promote coordination for responses to  terrorism and other serious incidents.   Finally, it authorizes DHS to develop, through Federal Law  Enforcement Training Centers, a training program to enhance the  protection, preparedness, and response capabilities of law enforcement  agencies with respect to terrorism and other serious incidents at  surface transportation assets.   Taken together, the bill's provisions enhance the capabilities of  local transportation security stakeholders to prevent and respond to  terrorist attacks and other serious incidents.   We should support this effort to improve our National security and  transportation capabilities against terrorism.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5089.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained on the vote  on H.R. 835. If I had been present, I would have voted ``aye.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, so many of us, when we go home, get the  question of what is going on in Washington and why this behavior  continues.   I think it is important for the American people to know that we have  the responsibility of oversight. And I believe, as a senior member on  the Judiciary Committee, that we need to address the question of the  firing of Andrew McCabe. We understand there may be a report, the IG  report. I don't challenge it, but it has not been rendered or made  public. The precipitous and heinous, unfair firing, in the manner that  it was done--I think that our Nation is better than that. I believe it  is important for the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings.   And we should also hold hearings on the Cambridge situation. As a  member of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee  for Homeland Security, Judiciary should hold and find out why the  private information of millions of Americans through Facebook has been  utilized to skew the election of 2016. No, I am not complaining, Mr.  Speaker, about the results. What I am saying: The American people are  owed a fair and just election, and the responsible people are the  Members of the United States Congress to determine how their private  information has been skewed and used and  [[Page H1683]]  is still being used without their permission.   It is time for us to exercise our oversight, Mr. Speaker. Let's do it  now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership and tenacity, and that of her coanchor, the Honorable Brenda  Lawrence. They are so correct. This is the year of Black Woman Rising.   I can't help but celebrate the quote from the Honorable Shirley  Chisholm, whom I had the privilege of introducing more than once as a  younger woman. One will never forget that experience and never forget  the experience of just being around the Honorable Shirley Chisholm and  the Honorable Barbara Jordan. They both came from similar stock on  opposite sides of the Nation, but they were strong, stern, committed,  and ready to serve; and serve, I like to think, without foolishness.   So I love the quote of Congresswoman Chisholm that said: If there is  no chair for you at the table, then bring a folding chair.   I am paraphrasing.   What a celebration. Let me be very clear, it can go for Black women  today in the 21st century.   I do want to acknowledge and to thank all women in this Women's  History Month for their leadership and service. I want to particularly  take note of our lost, late colleague, the Honorable Louise Slaughter,  and say that if there was ever a mighty woman of great leadership,  tenacity, and strength, it was our dear friend, Louise Slaughter. We  honor her now and as well in the months to come.   As we talk about women of color, and in this instance, Black women,  let me tell my colleagues that was about 400 or 500 of my sorors on  Saturday. I must make mention of Marsha Penn, our president, and we  were talking about the famous number 98.   Let me make sure I note all of the sorors in different sororities.  For those of you who are not familiar with the sorority, that is a  particular unique and special part of Black women's lives. I know there  are other sororities, but we take it very seriously. You can be many  colors. I happen to be pink and green, but there are many colors. I  call them all my sorors. They are my sisters.   But we were talking about the power, and I use the number 98. I used  that same number when I spoke with Stacey Abrams in Georgia just a few  weeks ago. She may, in fact, be the first African-American woman  nominee for Governor. She is running for that position in Georgia. She  may be one of the great leaders coming forward.   But the 98 number is, as my colleagues know, 98 percent of African- American women cast their vote that catapulted Senator Doug Jones into  the United States Senate. They are change makers and tree shakers. That  is what I want to say about Black Woman Rising. They are, in fact,  those tree shakers.   Might I say and pay tribute to Ivalita Jackson, my mother; Valerie  Bennett; Sarah Jackson; Sybil Gooden; Olive Jackson, my grandmother;  Vannie Bennett, my grandmother; Mrs. Simms, my great-grandmother;  Audrey Reed, my aunt; Vickie Bennett, my aunt; along with Valerie  Bennett, my aunt. All of these women surrounded me and gave me the kind  of tenacity and strength that I can be proud of.                                time  2100    I also want to acknowledge women like Dr. Alexa Canady, the first  African-American woman neurosurgeon; Oprah Winfrey, a Mississippi  native who has turned into a multi-multimillionaire and upwards of a  billionaire; and the story of Sojourner Truth, who was left off of the  suffragette statue; but women like myself gathered together. Senator  Clinton carried the legislation, but C. Delores Tucker was the  inspiration. She did not rest until Sojourner Truth found her place in  the United States Congress.   There was Rosa Parks, who now sits in Statuary Hall in tribute to  many members of the Congressional Black Caucus. I certainly thank our  chairman, Mr. Richmond, for creating these opportunities for us to have  this kind of experience.   Let me now get to the crux of what we need to do to be fair to Black  women.   First of all, we need to quash, extinguish the stereotypes of welfare  queens, incarcerated women, women with children and no spouses, and  really talk about the mountains that Black women have climbed to raise  children and to create heroes across the specter of leadership, from  science to medicine, to education and, yes, to sports.   Let's make sure that we never have a President that says ``sons of a  B'' to malign the many mothers, many of them African American, who are  the mothers of sports persons who, only because of their upbringing,  had a sensitivity to criminal justice reform.   Let us always characterize the mothers of the movement for what they  are: not individuals who are against law enforcement or order, but  mothers who have lost their children in an unfair way.   We need to work toward how things should change in criminal justice  reform and improve police-community relations so we don't have mothers  who have lost their children, such as Eric Garner, Michael Brown,  Walter Scott, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, and Jordan Davis. Some of  these were not directly police issues, but they were sons who lost  their lives, African-American young men. Also, Sandra Bland. Her mother  is a dear friend of mine.   They lost their lives in ways that should not have been. There are  also the same mothers of those law enforcement officials who have lost  their lives. They mourn. What about bringing them together? Many of the  mothers of young African Americans are obviously people of color, but  we have lost many in the law enforcement in the same way.   My point is that the pain of mothers, the pain of African-American  mothers, should be treated with dignity. The idea of a mother being on  assistance to provide for her children and living in public housing  should carry no label. There should not be a definition of supplemental  food stamps as a handout, as much as it is a hand-up.   No one should be trying to save money in the United States Congress  by providing boxes of food versus a nutrition system that food stamps  allow, which is to allow someone to go and buy what their family needs  or buy the formula or what their child with allergies needs.   Let's, first of all, establish dignity. Then, of course, if young  women who happen to be African American happen to be incarcerated,  let's make sure that we are looking to end mandatory minimums so that  for these young women who are caught up in a conspiracy where the law  wraps everyone up because of some elements of a spouse or a significant  other or a boyfriend, and they get caught up in the criminal justice  system, we can respond to them as mothers and recognize that they  should be having an opportunity to not be entrapped with mandatory  minimums so that they are never able to return to their children.   What about women who are pregnant and incarcerated, many of them  Latino and African-American women?   We should be able to have a situation where those women are not  separated from those children.   I heard Mr. Payne mention the 64 cents per dollar that many African- American women make in those kinds of hourly wage jobs. Therefore, we  must have an increase in the minimum wage, but, more importantly, an  increase in wages for women working in all capacities so that the  stagnant wages that have not been impacted positively by the $2  trillion-dollar tax cut, we must ensure that.   We must ensure the ability of all persons to vote without obstruction  and without the dastardly voter ID laws that have been put in place  specifically to stymie the vote of people of color: Latinos and African  Americans. I would hope that the courts would find them  unconstitutional.   Motherhood must be promoted, as I indicated, for those incarcerated,  but also for those who are not. Also, the support of healthcare, which  is what the Affordable Care Act was all about. It was to equalize and  to give a protective system for our working mothers or our mothers who  could not afford insurance in another way. It is unfortunate, though we  have tried--the Republican Congress has attempted to unravel a very  strong healthcare system.   There are women in the United States military. First, I salute them  all, but I also salute those African-  [[Page H1693]]  American women who have served in the military and have become  generals.   I do want to take note of an organization that I have a deep  affection for, and that is NASA. I am going to make it very clear that  I want NASA to be on notice that I am still going to focus on the  precipitous removal of an African-American, well-qualified astronaut  without any explanation. The only explanation is: We did this wrong,  and we really need to fix it.   But it needs to be explained why this person is not put back on the  astronaut list and what excuse you had to remove her, other than the  fact she was an African-American woman. In this month and this time we  are honoring women, if you have a reason, you need to come forward to  discern or explain why an African-American woman with the credentials,  who is an M.D., who has been in training for a large number of years,  was precipitously removed with no explanation.   These are the kinds of challenges that we face. So, I guess my  message is: Let us give dignity to these women who are  characteristically different.    Sojourner Truth represents a powerful example of that. She was a  tall, dark, regal women. The story goes that, when she was at the  suffragette meeting in the Midwest, she either raised her hand or  attempted to be recognized, and the person in the front said: Yes, sir,  what do you want, the gentleman in the back?   She began this long statement that said: Ain't I a woman? I have born  13 children and seen most all sold into slavery. Although I may be  strong looking and manly looking, you may not have recognized that I am  a woman that has born children and had them snatched away from me.   So I think the underlying premise of what we need to do for girls is  to stop having the bias of young boys and girls who are African  American being expelled or suspended from school in larger percentages  than others. We need to make sure that the schools in our communities  that happen to be Latino and African-American neighborhoods are equal  to other schools.   We need to invest in education. We need to invest in Historically  Black Colleges and Universities. We need to invest in technology and  coding. We need to invest in giving our young people opportunity.   I want to conclude my remarks by saying that this is an amazing array  of outstanding women. I cannot recall all of their names, but I hope  that, as I call their names, you understand my singular thing of  dignity. Dignity doesn't write legislation, but it causes us to write  legislation and policies that give women of color--in this instance,  African-American women--as we honor them in Women's History Month,  dignity and whatever the tools there are that give them dignity: better  access to jobs, better access to housing, better respect for the work  they do. We had the dismissal of an astronaut without any explanation  and no explanation that they can find.   Tracey Norman is a model. Oprah Winfrey. Shirley Chisolm. Leontyne  Price. Maya Angelou. We know them for their work in civil rights.   Aretha Franklin, a historic, wonderful artist in her own right.  Hattie McDaniel. Marian Anderson. Ella Fitzgerald. Althea Gibson.  Dorothy Dandridge. Chemist Marie Daly. Sarah Goode, an inventor. We  know the wonderful movie that talked about NASA women.   Della Reece. Ms. Muhammad, an athlete. Ms. Butler, an author. Mae  Jemison, my friend, a doctor and astronaut. Tyra Banks. Whoopi  Goldberg. Loretta Lynch. Patricia Roberts Harris. Many of us are  familiar with her work as a secretary in our United States. Mary Jane  Patterson, an educator. Alice Coachman. There are so many.   I conclude by simply saying that what we want is dignity, respect,  and the ability to serve and to be Americans, as we should.
