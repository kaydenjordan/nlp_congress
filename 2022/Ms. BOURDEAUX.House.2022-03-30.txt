 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan  supply chain resilience subtitle in the America COMPETES Act.   The COVID pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in the United States'  supply chains. When disruptions occur in our supply chains, it leads to  higher prices for families and businesses.   The America COMPETES Act includes my bill to map and monitor our  supply chains and other important provisions that would create good- paying manufacturing jobs here in the United States.   Studies have found that Georgia lost 25 percent of its manufacturing  jobs since 1999. Not only is this bad for workers, it is harmful to our  national security when we are dependent on other nations to manufacture  critical goods and services.   The America COMPETES Act would address this vulnerability by making a  historic investment in our Nation's manufacturing capabilities and  would equip us to prevent and mitigate future supply chain disruptions.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to retain  this critical subtitle as we work to pass a final competitiveness bill.                            ____________________
