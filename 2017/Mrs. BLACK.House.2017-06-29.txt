 Mr. Speaker, across the country, more than 300  municipalities have adopted policies to limit local law enforcement  cooperation with Federal authorities, making it harder to keep our  families and communities safe.   Back in my home State of Tennessee, the Nashville City Council has  recently been advancing legislation to become one of these sanctuary  cities. Giving Federal funds to sanctuary cities defies logic and it  demands attention.   Yesterday, I offered an amendment to expand the bill before us today  so that sanctuary cities would no longer have access to Community  Development Block Grants and certain other economic development grants,  as well, that send more than about 300 billion taxpayer dollars a year  to local communities.   On its website, the Community Development Block Grant program says  its purpose is to provide services to vulnerable communities and  address issues that ``pose an immediate threat to the health or welfare  of the community.''   What population is more vulnerable than a 6-year-old girl in Lebanon,  Tennessee, who was sexually molested while she was sleeping? Just last  month, charges were brought against a criminal illegal immigrant for  repeatedly breaking into her room at night and making videos while he  assaulted her. The evil individual had been in police custody before.   For Kate Steinle, who has been talked about many times on the floor,  her killer had a criminal record of not one, two, or three, but seven  felonies. He had been deported not once, twice, or three times, but  five times. Is that who liberal legislators around the country want to  give ``sanctuary''?   We need more communication and cooperation between local, State, and  Federal law enforcement officers who are trying to keep our communities  safe, not less. It is time to stop giving taxpayer dollars to these  cities. I am voting for this bill today to do just that.
