 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 200th  anniversary of the Erie Canal. Construction first began in 1817 in  Rome, New York, with the first completed portion connecting two cities  in the 22nd Congressional District, Rome and Utica.   The Erie Canal was transformative in establishing New York as the  Empire State. The canal opened the interior of our Nation, allowing  westward expansion and the free flow of goods. With a drastic 90  percent reduction in shipping costs, the canal established our region  as a hub of economic activity in the early 20th century and made New  York the busiest port in the entire Nation.   In addition to the vast economic impact, the Erie Canal had an  important cultural effect. Nearly 80 percent of upstate New York's  population lives within 25 miles of the canal. From Albany to Buffalo,  today, the Erie Canal is designated as a National Heritage Area,  continuing its rich legacy.   This Saturday, a first dig celebration in Rome, New York, will  recognize this historic and monumental achievement in both New York's  and our Nation's history.   In the words of the famous Erie Canal song: ``You'll always know your  neighbor, and you'll always know your pal, if you've ever navigated on  the Erie Canal.''                            ____________________
