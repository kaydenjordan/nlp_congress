 Mr. President, this week marked the official start of  summer, and by all means, it should be a  [[Page S4760]]  season of renewal in our Nation. But as we begin to emerge from this  public health crisis of COVID-19, we find ourselves facing another  crisis: an epidemic of gun violence in America.   The gun violence we are seeing in America today is devastating, and  it is the direct result of generations of underinvestment, policy  failure, and cycles of trauma.   Yesterday, President Biden spoke to the Nation about this challenge  and laid out a clear strategy to keep our communities safe from the  scourge of gun violence. The President has called for important reforms  to crack down on gun trafficking and gun dealers who willfully violate  the law. I agree with this strategy, and I will do everything in my  power as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee to support it.   Already, the administration has worked to rein in the proliferation  of untraceable ghost guns. What are these guns? They are guns that can  be ordered on the internet. They can be made in component parts with no  serial numbers and are impossible to trace. The administration has also  worked to issue regular reports on firearms trafficking patterns and  trends and to promote model legislation to keep guns out of the wrong  hands.   These are all important steps, and so is the President's call for a  major commitment of Federal resources to support community violence  intervention programs, programs like READI Chicago, which supports  members of the community who are most at risk for gun violence with job  training and other support. These programs help save lives in our city  of Chicago, and they desperately need Federal support. President Biden  made it clear yesterday that he is committed to this.   Every Monday, as sad as it is, the people of Chicago awaken to read  the heartbreaking headlines about the toll gun violence has taken over  the weekend. What was last weekend like in the city of Chicago? Fifty- two people were shot, five fatally.   Young children and babies don't escape this violence. More than 50  children under the age of 15 have been shot in Chicago this year:  Kayden Swann, 1-year-old, shot in the head while riding in a car on  Lake Shore Drive; 7-year-old Jaslyn Adams was shot and killed at a  McDonald's drive-through on the West Side in April; 14-year-old Savanna  Quintero, who was shot and killed earlier this month by gang members in  the Back of the Yards neighborhood. These children are just a few of  the more than 1,500 people who have been shot in Chicago this year.   Our city isn't alone in facing gun violence. We are seeing it across  the Nation. And don't believe it is just a problem in blue States; red  States face it too.   While a shooting can happen anywhere, the fact is gun violence has  disproportionately claimed the lives of Black and Brown Americans  living in communities where it is often easier to find a gun than a  good-paying job.    I have visited schools across Chicago, and I have asked the students  if they know someone who has been shot. In some neighborhoods, nearly  every child's hand goes up. In fact, 90 percent of Chicago's homicides  occur in neighborhoods where 60 percent of the city's youngest kids  live and learn. And when their parents or siblings are shot, it causes  damage that, unlike a bullet wound, cannot heal with time alone.  Science shows us that trauma rewires children's brains and produces  changes that can last a lifetime.   I often ask audiences: Think about your youth. Think about one event  in your life that you still remember to this day. I hope it was a happy  one. I hope it wasn't a sad one. But think about the fact that no  matter how old you are, something that happened when you were a tiny  kid is still very fresh in your memory.   Now think about a child who has witnessed a shooting or been the  victim of a shooting. That is going to be with them for a lifetime  unless we do something. Childhood trauma can make it harder for kids to  learn and to form healthy relationships, and it can do serious harm to  a child physically, mentally, and emotionally--harm that can change  their lives.   But with the right care and support, kids and victims of gun violence  can deal with trauma and rise above it. Across Illinois, I have seen  programs in schools, hospitals, community centers, and churches that  provide the nurturing environments and treatments our children who  experience trauma need to thrive.   If we want to end the epidemic of gun violence, we need to invest in  community-based solutions that end the cycles of trauma. Last week I  joined Senators Capito, Duckworth, and Murkowski in introducing a  bipartisan bill that will invest in those solutions: the RISE from  Trauma Act. This bill would invest billions of dollars over the next 8  years in community-based efforts to support children and families who  have endured trauma.   This aligns directly with what President Biden said yesterday and  what he requested in his American Jobs Plan. It would help end violence  where it begins--in environments where kids are neglected, abused, and  left to fend for themselves.   This legislation would fund counseling for gunshot victims and expand  our trauma-informed workforce--doctors, teachers, social service  professionals, community leaders--to help kids who have experienced  trauma.   I believe the RISE from Trauma Act will help offer a long-term  solution to the epidemic of gun violence, but we also need to protect  our families and neighborhoods in the short term.   In addition to immediate steps it has taken, the administration is  asking us to address violent crime. I have been working with leaders in  my State to make additional resources available. Earlier this week,  Senator Duckworth and I sent a letter to Governor Pritzker highlighting  effective strategies for how to use more than $120 million in American  Rescue Plan funds to help support targeted violence intervention  efforts. These funds, which will help protect Illinois from violent  crimes, are available now to help the police, to help the victims, to  help the neighborhoods.   When we talk about really caring and really wanting to do something  to make a difference, I am sorry that I have to remind the Senate that  this bill, the American Rescue Plan, passed the U.S. Senate without a  single Republican supporting it, not one--not one Republican vote.   To most effectively address the spike in gun violence, the Senate  must also confirm the Director for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives.   I couldn't help but listen to the Republican leader who came to the  floor to talk about David Chipman. He is a man who will be reported out  of the Judiciary Committee and brought to the floor. He was considered  today, in the Judiciary Committee--11 Democrats and 11 Republicans  split along party lines on his vote. It was expected. But Senator  Schumer can still bring his nomination to the floor.   It is no surprise that the Republicans opposed him, but let's put it  in context for a moment. How many times have you heard a gun debate and  you heard someone say, ``We don't need any new laws, we just need to  enforce the laws we have. Don't dream up some new law that's going to  burden someone who is an innocent, law-abiding gun owner, enforce the  laws we have.''   So what Agency do we look to for that enforcement? Well, certainly,  the Department of Justice. And where do they turn? They turn to ATF.  That is the Agency that is supposed to keep an eye on how guns are  being sold and whether the wrong people are buying them.   Well, let's look at the leader of the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives Agency under President Trump. I would like to give you his  name or her name, but I can't because there was no leader. In 4 years,  President Trump and Senate Republicans never put in place any single  person to head this Agency. Was it an oversight, an accident? Far from  it. Those who are on the side of increased gun rights at the expense of  safety don't want anyone to lead this Agency. They want this Agency to  go away.   David Chipman, a man with over 20 years' experience in the field, who  worked for this law enforcement agency and risked his life in doing so,  has been nominated by President Biden to head the Agency. And the  Republicans can't stand the idea. The fact that an actual law  enforcement agency person who has this experience would lead the Agency  just drives them wild to think about it, and they are opposed to it.   Yes, it is true, he is for gun safety, and he has made it clear.  [[Page S4761]]    Let me tell you about a couple of radical ideas he had. He believes  that we should keep guns out of the hands of felons and people who are  mentally unable. Well, there is a radical idea when it comes to gun  safety, so radical that 84 percent of the American people--some say 90  percent of the American people, including a majority of gun owners-- support this idea, and so does Mr. Chipman. That makes him a radical in  the eyes of some of our colleagues. To me, he is as mainstream as they  come.   When it comes to assault weapons, for example, he believes there are  some guns that really have no place in the ordinary self-defense,  sporting, and hunting world and can only be used as machines for  killing. Over half the American people happen to agree with him. I do  too. For that reason, many Republicans oppose him. They say, ``He's a  radical, he's a zealot.'' I have heard all these words.    He is a man who has lived his life through the ATF for more than 20  years. He has the support of law enforcement and deserves a chance to  lead this Agency.   These ideas that he has--wouldn't it be wonderful if the U.S.  Senate--think about that--the U.S. Senate could pass legislation to  require background checks to keep guns out of the hands of convicted  felons? The American people want it. We can't touch it.   You ask people on the committee, on the Republican side: Well, what  should we do about gun violence? They have got an answer. What is their  answer? We need more guns in America. We need more people carrying guns  in America. Two or three of the members of the committee today on the  Republican side, Senate Judiciary Committee, were proud to speak about  this issue of concealed carry. One actually said she carries a gun. I  don't know if she does it in the Capitol Building. That is her  business. But that is how far it has come, this notion that the  solution to gun violence is more guns when 109 people a day are dying  in America from gun violence. This isn't happening in other nations  around the world. We are unique, and we should be embarrassed by this  unique situation that we have so much gun violence and gun death in  America.   President Biden made it clear yesterday as well that this notion that  he is for defunding the police is ludicrous. He called yesterday for  billions of dollars to our police to do their job more effectively, and  I support it. I want to make sure that the police who receive these  funds are well trained and administer justice in a fair way and without  the abuses that we have seen with the death of George Floyd and other  instances.   Yes, invest in that, but have the wisdom to understand that the  police need helping hands as well. The police would gladly give the  issue of domestic violence over to social workers and psychologists,  who really could get into this situation and find an effective solution  that doesn't risk lives and doesn't endanger the lives of the police.  They need a helping hand, and we should give it to them.   When it comes to law and order, I hear the Republican leader come to  the floor and talk about the need for law and order, and I can't help  but think it was just 2 weeks ago when he was given a chance to support  a bipartisan commission to look into the worst lawlessness we have seen  in the U.S. Capitol since 1813.   On January 6, 2021, thousands coming from the speech by President  Trump formed an insurrectionist mob and descended on this Capitol. I  will never forget that day as long as I live, and, yes, we ought to get  to the bottom of it. Who financed that? Who planned that? Who was  behind that? There are serious questions to be asked and answered. Who  stopped the bill with the filibuster for a bipartisan commission asking  and answering those questions? The same Senator who was coming here a  few minutes ago giving a speech on law and order. It doesn't follow.   If Senator McConnell believes we should have law and order, it should  start with the Senate Chamber and the Capitol Building. Isn't that our  first responsibility as elected Members? Of course it is. What happened  January 6 cannot and should not be swept under the rug.   It is interesting to me, as I consider the nominees of the Biden  administration and the reaction on the Republican side. Mr. Chipman was  the latest victim of their attacks. Some on the political extreme even  went so far as to doctor films so that it reflected the presence of Mr.  Chipman at events he didn't even attend, events he had no business with  as a member of ATF. That is the extent they will go to undermine the  Biden administration's nominees.   And I can't help but notice that when it comes to assertive women of  color, that really drives many Republicans to a level of rage. Vanita  Gupta. Kristen Clarke. These women are extremely talented, professional  women with amazing resumes who are now luckily serving this Nation  because of a vote in the Senate, but the opposition to them went way  beyond anything that was rational or explainable.   Senator McConnell said we shouldn't make ownership of guns more  burdensome. I think that is generally right, but if making sure that  convicted felons don't own guns is a slight burden on those who are  legally entitled to own guns, I think it is not too much to ask.   I am all for people exercising their Second Amendment rights to use  guns safely, respectfully, follow the law, and store them, as well, in  that same fashion, and to ask them to go through a background check to  make sure they are qualified is not too much, and it saves lives in the  process.   The gun lobby tries to stop the Senate from confirming the Director  of the ATF, but we are going to move forward and do it. There wasn't a  Senate-confirmed Director under President Trump. In fact, there hasn't  been one since 2015. This man, Mr. Chipman, is extremely well  qualified--25 years of experience. He worked in the field in Virginia,  Texas, and Michigan. He knows the Agency inside and out. He is the  right person.   Background checks--is that too much to ask? I don't think so. We  should pass the bill. In March, the House of Representatives passed  H.R. 8, a bipartisan bill to close the gaps in the background checks  system. We ought to do the same.   Addressing gun violence is a top priority of the Senate Judiciary  Committee. In fact, the committee has already held four hearings on the  topic. The first was the day after the mass shooting--the most recent  mass shooting in Boulder, CO, that left 10 people dead. Sadly,  unimaginably--listen to this number, Mr. President--that was just one  of 299 mass shootings in America so far this year. That is more than  one mass shooting every single day. What is going on? How can we  tolerate that situation in our country?   Yet, during the first hearing on gun violence in our committee, one  of the Republican members of the committee described the hearing as  ``ridiculous theater.'' Ridiculous theater. Do you want to know what  ridiculous theater really looks like? It is filibustering a piece of  gun safety reform like universal background checks supported by 90  percent of the people. It is calling for an enforcement of gun laws  already on the books and blocking anyone from being confirmed who will  do it. Ridiculous theater is tweeting slogans in response to a spike in  gun violence rather than coming up with solutions.   The Presiding Officer knows as well as I do and maybe even better  that there have been too many funerals, too many lives lost to the  scourge of gun violence. Can we get serious for one moment on a  bipartisan basis and dedicate ourselves to reducing gun violence and  saving lives in America? We have a President who is ready to lead us in  that direction. I hope my other colleagues on the other side of the  aisle will join Democrats in enacting legislation to keep America safe.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       To the Secretary of the Senate:        PN274, the nomination of David H. Chipman, of Virginia, to       be Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and       Explosives, having been referred to the Committee on the       Judiciary, the Committee, with a quorum present, has voted on       the nomination as follows--        (1) on the question of reporting the nomination favorably       with the recommendation that the nomination be confirmed, 11       ayes to 11 noes.        In accordance with section 3, paragraph (l)(A) of S. Res.       27 of the 117th Congress, I hereby give notice that the       Committee has not reported the nomination because of a tie       vote, and ask that this notice be printed in the Record       pursuant to the resolution.  [[Page S4763]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, as we celebrate Pride Month, I want to  take a moment to acknowledge some of the trailblazers and pioneers in  the LGBTQ+ community who have led the fight for equality.   Our Nation--and the world--has come a long way since the first Pride  parade was organized more than half a century ago. But that progress  didn't come about on its own. It demanded sacrifice, from activists  like Marsha P. Johnson, who led the Stonewall Uprising in New York  City, and leaders like Harvey Milk, who gave his life to advance LGBTQ+  equality. And it also demanded courage, courage that we see on display  every day.   Just this week, a defensive lineman for the Las Vegas Raiders, Carl  Nassib, became the first active NFL player to come out as gay. In a  video he posted, Mr. Nassib said he hopes that ``one day videos like  this and the whole coming-out process are just not necessary . . . but  until then I'm going to do my best and my part to cultivate a culture  that's accepting, that's compassionate.'' That is really what Pride  Month is all about, joining together to embrace our friends and loved  ones exactly as they are and cultivating a culture that is more  accepting and compassionate.   Carl Nassib's announcement this week is yet another reminder of how  far the movement for LGBTQ+ equality has come, in my lifetime and even  during my time in Congress. The year I was elected to the U.S. Senate,  Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act, a shameful piece of  legislation that outlawed same-sex marriage. But less than two decades  later, the Supreme Court corrected that mistake by making marriage  equality the law of the land. The sixth anniversary of that decision,  Obergefell v. Hodges, is coming up this Saturday, the same day as  Chicago's Pride in the Park festival in Grant Park. It is a remarkable  trajectory, and it is one nobody could have predicted when I first  entered Congress. It also begs the question: What progress will our  Nation achieve over the next 20 years?   Earlier this year, as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I was  honored to gavel in the Senate's first-ever hearing on the EQUALITY  Act. It is a crucial piece of legislation that would strengthen civil  rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans and would explicitly prohibit  discrimination in education, employment, housing, and other facets of  everyday life. The EQUALITY Act has already passed the House, but it is  currently languishing in this Chamber. Will we allow this Senate to  once again stand as a bulwark against the tides of progress? Or will we  join Carl Nassib--and others before him--in acting with courage?   This Pride Month, I hope we follow Mr. Nassib's lead, and I hope we  do our part to cultivate a culture that embraces all of our Nation's  children, exactly as who they are.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2304         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Drug-Price Transparency for       Competition Act of 2021'' or the ``DTC Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE SENATE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription       pharmaceuticals is legally permitted in only 2 developed       countries, the United States and New Zealand.        (2) In 2018, pharmaceutical ad spending exceeded       $6,046,000,000, a 4.8 percent increase over 2017, resulting       in the average American seeing 9 drug advertisements per day.        (3) The most commonly advertised medication in the United       States has a list price of more than $6,000 for a one-month's       supply.        (4) A 2021 Government Accountability Office report found       that two-thirds of all direct-to-consumer drug advertising       between 2016 and 2018 was concentrated among 39 brand-name       drugs or biological products, about half of which were       recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.        (5) According to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office report,       pharmaceutical manufacturers advertise their products       directly to consumers in an attempt to boost demand for their       products and thereby raise the price that consumers are       willing to pay, increase the quantity of drugs sold, or       achieve some combination of the two.        (6) Studies, including a 2012 systematic review published       in the Annual Review of Public Health, a 2005 randomized       trial published in the Journal of the American Medical       Association, and a 2004 survey published in Health Affairs,       show that patients are more likely to ask their doctor for a       specific medication and for the doctor to write a       prescription for it, if a patient has seen an advertisement       for such medication, even if such medication is not the most       clinically appropriate for the patient or if a lower-cost       generic medication may be available.        (7) According to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office report,       the average number of prescriptions written for newly       approved brand-name drugs with direct-to-consumer advertising       was 9 times greater than the average number of prescriptions       written for newly approved brand-name drugs without direct-      to-consumer advertising.        (8) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is the       single largest drug payer in the United States. Between 2016       and 2018, 58 percent of the $560,000,000,000 in Medicare drug       spending was for advertised drugs, and in 2018 alone, the 20       most advertised drugs on television cost Medicare and       Medicaid a combined $34,000,000,000.        (9) A 2021 Government Accountability Office report found       that direct-to-consumer advertising may have contributed to       increases in Medicare beneficiary use and spending among       certain drugs.        (10) The American Medical Association has passed       resolutions supporting the requirement for price transparency       in any direct-to-consumer advertising, stating that such       advertisements on their own ``inflate demand for new and more       expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not be       appropriate''.        (11) A 2019 study published in the Journal of the American       Medical Association found that health care consumers       dramatically underestimate their out-of-pocket costs for       certain expensive medications, but once they learn the       wholesale acquisition cost (in this section referred to as       the ``WAC'') of the product, they are far better able to       approximate their out-of-pocket costs.        (12) Approximately half of Americans have high-deductible       health plans, under which they often pay the list price of a       drug until their insurance deductible is met. All of the top       Medicare prescription drug plans use coinsurance rather than       fixed-dollar copayments for medications on nonpreferred drug       tiers, exposing beneficiaries to WAC prices.        (13) Section 119 of division CC of the Consolidated       Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260) requires the       Secretary of Health and Human Services to increase the use of       real-time benefit tools to lower beneficiary costs. However,       there still remains a lack of available pricing tools so       patients may not learn of their medication's cost until after       being given a prescription for the medication. A 2013 study       published in The Oncologist found that one-quarter of all       cancer patients chose not to fill a prescription due to cost.        (14) The Federal Government already exercises its authority       to oversee certain aspects of direct-to-consumer drug       advertising, including required disclosures of information       related to side effects, contraindications, and       effectiveness.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) a lack of transparency in pricing for pharmaceuticals       has led to a lack of competition for such pharmaceuticals, as       evidenced by a finding by the Department of Health and Human       Services that ``Consumers of pharmaceuticals are currently       missing information that consumers of other products can more       readily access, namely the list price of the product, which       acts as a point of comparison when judging the reasonableness       of prices offered for potential substitute products'' (84       Fed. Reg. 20735);        (2) in an age where price information is ubiquitous, the       prices of pharmaceuticals remain shrouded in secrecy and       limited to those who subscribe to expensive drug price       reporting services, which typically include pharmaceutical       manufacturers or other health care industry entities and not       the general public;        (3) greater insight and transparency into drug prices will       help consumers know if they can afford to complete a course       of therapy before deciding to initiate that course of       therapy;        (4) price shopping is the mark of rational economic       behavior, and markets operate more efficiently when consumers       have relevant information about a product, including  [[Page S4781]]       its price, before making an informed decision about whether       to buy that product;        (5) providing consumers with basic price information may       result in the selection of lesser cost alternatives, all else       being equal relative to the patient's care, and is integral       to providing adequate competition in the market;        (6) the WAC is a factual, objective, and uncontroversial       definition for the list price of a medication, in that it is       defined in statute, reflects an understood place in the       supply chain, and is at the sole discretion of the       manufacturer to set;        (7) there is a governmental interest in ensuring that       consumers who seek to purchase pharmaceuticals for purposes       of promoting their health and safety understand the objective       list price of any pharmaceutical that they are encouraged       through advertisements to purchase, which allows consumers to       make informed purchasing decisions; and        (8) there is a governmental interest in mitigating wasteful       expenditures and promoting the efficient administration of       the Medicare program by slowing the growth of Federal       spending on prescription drugs.       SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT THAT DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISEMENTS                     FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS                     INCLUDE AN APPROPRIATE DISCLOSURE OF PRICING                     INFORMATION.
