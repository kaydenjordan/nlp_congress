 Mr. Speaker, here in America, we are changing the world  with our ingenuity and technological advances.   It is our creative and innovative spirit that allows us to continue  to be a leader in the world economy and raise the quality of life of  the human race. We know that jobs of the present and the future will  require many new students and retrained workers to pursue STEM  degrees--those in science, technology, engineering, and math.   While many politicians have talked a good game about encouraging  students to pursue these degrees, it is time to put our money where our  mouth is. Today I introduced the ASPIRE Act, H.R. 926, the American  Science Principal and Interest Reduction and Employment Act. This act  would grant a 25 percent reduction in student loans for any student who  graduates with a STEM major.   According to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, one million new  STEM jobs are projected to come online between 2012 to 2022, for a  total of 9 million, 13 percent growth over the decade. This means we  must act now to meet these needs, and I encourage all of you to  cosponsor this important legislation.   It is time to create real incentives to encourage our students to  aspire to new heights and create the jobs of tomorrow today.                            ____________________
