 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute as in morning business.    Mr. President, the minority leader is so committed to  his campaign rhetoric, calling the Senate a political graveyard, that  he is killing the House-passed appropriations package that funds our  national defense and pays our troops.   Leader McConnell has twice moved to take up the House bill that funds  the Pentagon, as well as the Departments of State, Health and Human  Services, Energy, Education, and others, but the majority leader has  been constantly blocked by the Democrats.   The minority leader claims to be shocked and outraged that the Senate  isn't taking up partisan messaging bills from the House when it is very  normal for both Houses not to take up every bill passed by the other  Chamber. That doesn't apply to appropriations, however, because one  thing is very certain: We have to fund the government, and those bills  absolutely have to come up and be passed by both Houses.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
