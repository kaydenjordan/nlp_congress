 Mr. President, I call up my motion to instruct, which  is at the desk.    Mr. President, we are about to go into conference on  what we are basically calling the China bill, but this bill does not  address China's practice of purchasing and stockpiling sanctioned  Iranian oil on the black market.   This procurement spike by China is directly correlated with the spike  in terrorist activities by Iran and its proxies in the Middle East.  Iran is laundering these petroleum products and illicitly transferring  the oil at sea to Iranian tankers and foreign-flagged vessels. Three- quarters of this oil is ultimately exported to China, which purchased  310 million barrels of oil from Iran last year. All of this is  happening while China is actually negotiating directly with Iran on our  behalf in Vienna.   This particular motion to instruct goes straight at this illicit  activity from Iran that is facilitating the terror activities and also  addresses the designation that Iran is asking if they are going to  negotiate with the Biden administration on the Iran nuclear deal. Iran  is specifically asking that they get a lift of the ``foreign terrorist  organization'' on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. That is the  group that was attacking our troops in Iraq and facilitating their  death.   We need to address this and take it off the table so that Iran does  not get by with this and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps does  not.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on my motion to instruct.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
