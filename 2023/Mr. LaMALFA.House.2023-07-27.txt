 Mr. Speaker, soon the House Committee on Rules will  begin its consideration of this year's farm bill. This is a bill to  include some of the top priorities for not only northern California,  but the whole country, as my own district is home to some of the most  productive agricultural regions in the world.   We are the second largest rice-growing region in the Nation, and we  grow over half of all the dried plums, also known as prunes, produced  in the world. Our farmers are international leaders in almond and  walnut production, among other crops.   The farm bill gives farmers the tools they need to manage their risks  during a difficult economic year or a natural disaster with the  insurance that has been so successful over the recent years. It  strengthens incentives for our next generation of farmers, as our  farmers' average age is well into the sixties now.   Beyond agriculture, it allocates resources to programs that are vital  to the economic well-being of our area, and all rural areas that have  agriculture, by funding rural health projects that help our communities  address a growing opioid addiction issue and other substance abuse  disorders.   It provides funding to close the rural and urban digital divide by  improving broadband connectivity in rural areas.  [[Page H4060]]  It is really important that we get onboard with the farm bill this fall  and pass it on time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow.
