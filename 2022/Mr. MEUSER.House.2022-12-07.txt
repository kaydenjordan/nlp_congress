 Mr. Speaker, as today is Pearl Harbor Day, may we all  give thanks to those before us who fought and gave their lives for our  freedom.   Mr. Speaker, come next year, Americans who receive $600 or more on  their third-party payment systems like Venmo will receive a tax form  thanks to a provision put into the American Rescue Plan.   For instance, if you sold an old couch and received payment for it of  over $600, you could trigger an IRS audit. This reporting requirement  will not be targeting the wealthy, as it was designed for, but middle  class Americans who often send and receive money via Venmo and other  services.   The new 87,000 IRS agents hired through the Democrat plan will be  very busy. We were told last year the IRS agents would only be  targeting those making more than $400,000 a year. I think we all  remember that. The SNOOP Act introduced by my colleague Michelle Steel  would reverse the reporting threshold back to $20,000,  ensuring everyday Americans are not subject to this IRS intrusion and  overreach, and I ask my colleagues to support it.                            ____________________
