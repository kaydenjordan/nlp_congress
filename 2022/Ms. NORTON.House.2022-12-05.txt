 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3875) to require the President to develop and maintain  products that show the risk of natural hazards across the United  States, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3875         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) National Risk Index Funding.--Nothing in section 206 of       the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency       Assistance Act, as added by subsection (a) of this section,       shall be construed to prohibit the Administrator of the       Federal Emergency Management Agency from using amounts       available to maintain and update the National Risk Index       until the earlier of--        (1) the date on which those amounts are transferred to       another source; and        (2) 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act.        (c) Applicability.--The amendments made by this Act shall       only apply with respect to amounts appropriated on or after       the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 3875.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Community Disaster Resilience Zones Act, led by  Congresswoman Sharice Davids in the House, will enable the Federal  Emergency Management Agency to identify the communities most in need of  mitigation projects and to help them access the necessary funding and  support to complete such projects.   Climate change and development in high-risk zones has created a  never-ending stream of disaster impacts that cause billions of dollars  in damage around the country, which taxpayer  [[Page H8744]]  dollars must cover. This legislation will help protect communities and  reduce the financial burden on taxpayers by targeting mitigation  investments to communities that have the fewest resources to invest in  resilience and are expected to incur the greatest amount of disaster  damage.   By directing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to publicly  designate the most in-need and at-risk census tracts as Community  Disaster Resilience Zones, stakeholders can effectively target  mitigation investments to these communities and make them more  resilient. This legislation also authorizes Federal cost share  flexibility for Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant  project applicants in designated Community Disaster Resilience Zones.   I ask my colleagues to support the Community Disaster Resilience  Zones Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support  for S. 3875 signed by 32 organizations.                                                  December 5, 2022.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves: We, the       undersigned organizations, write to express support for S.       3875, the Community Disaster Resilience Zones (CDRZ) Act of       2022, which the Senate passed by unanimous consent and is       nearly identical to the bill (H.R. 7242) your committee       passed. Collectively, our organizations represent a wide       variety of constituencies, including business, conservation,       emergency managers, housing, infrastructure, local       government, public safety, science, and taxpayer       organizations. We commend the CDRZ Act bill sponsors,       Representatives Sharice Davids and Garret Graves and Senators       Gary Peters and Rob Portman, for their bipartisan, bicameral       leadership and thank them for introducing the CDRZ Act bills.       This legislation is a critical, foundational step toward       prioritizing and directing a whole-of-nation focus on the       most vulnerable communities facing the risk of potentially       life-threatening and economically devastating climate and       natural disaster events.        The CDRZ Act would amend the Stafford Act to establish a       statutory structure to identify and designate CDRZ       communities that are the most in need and most at risk to       natural hazards, such as hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes,       and wildfires, to increase public and private sector       investments in housing, infrastructure, and community-wide       resilience. Building smart, modern, resilient infrastructure,       including nature-based infrastructure, has long been among       our top priorities. We support the CDRZ Act, which would:        Amend the Stafford Act by adding a requirement that FEMA       maintain and update products and tools that define natural       hazard risk across the U.S. and use that dataset to identify       and designate CDRZ communities that are the most in need and       most at risk to natural hazards;        Authorize the President to provide CDRZ-designated       communities with assistance and funding for pre-disaster       mitigation planning and projects to increase resilience       against the identified hazards; and        Help prioritize and attract additional public and private       sector funding (including public-private partnerships) for       resilience projects in or primarily benefitting CDRZ-      designated communities.        Thank you for your leadership. We look forward to       continuing to work with you and Congress to ensure our       communities most threatened by climate and natural disaster       risk and most economically vulnerable have the support,       resources, and opportunities they need to improve their       resilience.

This bill will also help my district, which was built on the rivers  and where disaster resilience is most needed.   In closing, we know that investments in mitigation measures save up  to $11 for every $1 spent. This legislation will save taxpayer dollars  by investing in mitigation and protecting vulnerable communities.   I thank my colleague, Sharice Davids, for her work on this issue, and  I support this targeted, data-driven approach. I urge my colleagues to  do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3499) to amend the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform  Act of 2006  [[Page H8745]]  to repeal certain obsolete requirements, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 5, 2022, on page H8745, in the first column, the  following appeared: to repeal certain obsolete requirements, and  for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the  bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 3499      The online version has been corrected to read: to repeal certain  obsolete requirements, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the  title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 3499    ========================= END NOTE =========================                                    S. 3499         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPEAL OF OBSOLETE DHS CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS.         The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006       (Public Law 109-295; 120 Stat. 1394) is amended by striking       section 692 (6 U.S.C. 792).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 3499.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will repeal a section of the Post-Katrina  Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to conform the act with  government-wide Federal acquisition regulation changes to  subcontracting limits.   The National Defense Authorization Act of 2009 directed the Federal  Acquisition Regulatory Council to institute a government-wide  limitation on excessive subcontracting. This change put the Department  of Homeland Security-specific requirements established by the Post- Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act in conflict with government- wide rules. This bill simply repeals the Department of Homeland  Security's obsolete requirement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   S. 3499 is a simple example of good governance with bipartisan  support. I support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
