 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 1259. Let me be clear that I rise in  opposition not after serving this Nation in uniform for 24 years; not  after serving on this committee longer than anyone else on the  committee; and not with serving honorably with my friend, the chairman,  who--I want to be clear, first of all, where the commonality lies  around this issue, about 95 percent of it, you are not going to find  daylight between us.   The idea that anyone would put a special interest ahead of the care  of a veteran is not only distasteful, it is wrong to assume that. There  are legitimate differences on how to get accountability in the VA, and  we have come to some conclusions that get us pretty close. This piece  of legislation--and I do not condemn the committee because this is  truly a bipartisan committee, but, for whatever reason, for the first  time in the decade-plus that I have served on this committee, we have  brought a bill to the floor without a hearing.   We held a markup and brought it to the floor. The majority has the  right to do as they please. What that deprives us of is the ability to  build consensus around issues we know we share. I know the chairman's  heart is providing absolute best care to every single veteran. I also  know the chairman's heart is to make sure that every employee who is  doing their job is respected the way they are supposed to be. There is  not disagreement on that.   This piece of legislation, and framing it as a false choice between  veterans and the employees, the majority of whom are veterans, in many  cases, serving other veterans, is a false choice. The chart that was  put up, I belong to half those organizations. There is also an  organization that is on there that differs from the others because it  is a 501(c)(4) with the sole purpose of political attack ads on Members  of the opposing party. Leave them off the sheet. The other ones I agree  with. The others are 501(c)(3)s advocating for veterans, but for us to  pretend this isn't a  [[Page H2116]]  proxy fight for outside groups on something bigger is disingenuous and  moves us away from the place we should have gotten.   To show you the comity, my friend from Tennessee gave an impassioned,  logical, and, in my opinion, correct assessment on the Veterans 2nd  Amendment, H.R. 1181. I agree with the chairman on this. I believe we  could have built consensus by bringing that through the committee, but  it doesn't change the fact that I think the chairman eloquently got to  the heart of that. I know what the heart of that was because the  majority side used the term over two dozen times, ``due process.'' It  matters. These are veterans working in the VA who should have due  process to their Second Amendment rights and to their employment  rights. It ensures that the working environment attracts and retains  the best and brightest.   So let's go through a little bit of what is here. One of the things  is, we talk about going back and breaking a sacred pledge. You can  disagree what is in the collective bargaining that was done between the  administrations, Republican and Democrat, and those employees who work  there, but to go in and arbitrarily change that from Congress, how is  that due process? How about in the next bargaining agreement you make  the case that those things need to be there. I will stand there with  you and tell you this: The public sector unions need to give more,  because you know what happens if they don't? They get painted with  those examples.   I hear some people say there are 350,000 employees in the VA, and  they gave five examples of five bad people. You should give those  examples. That is unacceptable, horrid, and should never be agreed to.  This is a zero sum proposition. If one bad employee gives substandard  care, Mr. Chairman, to one veteran, that is a failure, and the majority  and the minority are in absolute agreement on that.   But here is what I fear. We have had legislation--and I will offer up  an amendment to do this--that has bipartisan support, that has Senate  support. We will see if I am right or wrong on this, but I am almost  certain--and it is our responsibility in this House not to message  things for those outside groups to run attack ads, it is to get things  that actually get through.   I am saying today--and I will be the first to come back and tell you  I was wrong on this--the process of getting legislation into law to be  enacted by the agencies means compromise must be there. I think we come  back here in October, this isn't done yet. Why don't we give on the 5  percent that is not agreed upon and get the 95 percent right so we can  act to enact it? This is going to be the perfect getting in the way of  the good, and I would argue the zeal to get it done in the way of due  process.   I do not question the heart of any of my colleagues to get this  right. I do not question--I hope it would not come back to me--the  outrage I feel when I hear the story--and I know when the chairman  tells me it, it is true--of someone showing up intoxicated trying to  provide care to a veteran. How in goodness name is that person not  done, not removed, and not moved forward? I will have to tell you this:  I have been there on this. I am a public schoolteacher. Do you know who  hates a bad public schoolteacher the most? A good public schoolteacher.  What really angers me is when management doesn't do their dang job,  follow the law and remove those people, and give the due process to  them.   The same thing happens in the VA. Management needs to do their job.  We have issued subpoenas for Phoenix, we have issued subpoenas for  Philadelphia, we have issued subpoenas for St. Paul of people doing  egregious things, not caring for veterans. They should come here, and  they should lose their jobs. In some cases, they did. Do you know what  they all did have in common? None of them were part of a collective  bargaining agreement. They were the management. My fear on this is you  have bad managers making bad decisions, and if someone speaks up, Mr.  Chairman, who is a lower ranking member, their only protection to  improve the system is by collectively bargained grievance processes to  make sure their due process is heard. That is all we are asking for.   I do not deny there are going to be proxy fights on this. I will not  deny that I believe the public sector unions need to be in a  partnership with this. I believe we should have had them in a hearing  and set those union members down there and asked them: How in God's  name can you justify this? Ask them and say: What would help so that we  can do this?    I have witnessed this as a public schoolteacher. Beating up on public  schoolteachers all the time is not the best way to entice good people  to go into public school teaching. I ask people, whether it be teachers  or the veterans--go ask your veterans, how many have received quality  care at the VA? How many really appreciate that floor nurse who did  what he or she was supposed to do? How many are grateful that their  cardiac surgeon is one of the best in the world and is choosing to make  less money to serve there?   But I won't deny this. We have managers who are unaccountable. This  piece of legislation does not get at the heart of it because the teeth  are saved for the rank-and-file members. I agree. I think the gentleman  is exactly right.   I want to read something. You tell me if this is okay. We had a VA  employee who was written up and subsequently fired because they were  practicing medicine without a license. That is outrageous. Outrageous  that you would go there and you don't have the license, and you are  practicing medicine. That person was fired. If we pass this piece of  legislation, they are done and they are not coming back.   But there is a little bit different story to this. This was a Navy  veteran in Arkansas, and you know what they got it for? Not picking up  a scalpel and doing something that a doctor should do, not writing a  prescription for an opioid and trying to steal medicine, which does  happen. What they did was, they entered the wrong code on a chart, and  that got them for practicing medicine without a license.   When they went through the approved negotiated grievance process, not  only did they find out that this was wrong to this combat Navy veteran  trying to serve other veterans who was discharged by a manager, it  turns up the lack of management oversight. It was the entire system was  flawed and the chart was wrong. So the grievance process not only  returned the employee back to their rightful job, it fixed the system  guaranteeing better care for veterans going forward.   So I don't disagree. When we try and make it, the big scary thing is,  oh, we have unions that don't care about veterans, don't care about  what the care is, and what we need to do is fire those people  immediately. Well, you know what? Some of them do need to be fired. But  if there is not a process in place--this Navy veteran caring for other  veterans was released without due process--we don't find out about a  broken system putting veterans' care at risk. That is what is at stake  here.   My point is not to disagree. The chairman has insights into veterans  that I think are second to none. The committee works together on this.  Once again, when you gain the most votes, you get the majority, and I  respect that. But I would also say that if we want to build consensus  around this, I am going to offer up a piece of legislation that was  written by a Republican Senator that has the ability to pass, be signed  into law, and will get at the heart of this by going after the  managers.   Mr. Chairman, it is important to me, and I know it is important to my  chairman, a Vietnam veteran himself, it is important to the staff  sitting behind, veterans ourselves, that we not allow what has happened  in this country to get into the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, to  divide us over talking points when our goals are exactly the same.   When we have legitimate differences, again, I don't think it is fair  to me, as a veteran and a union member, to put something up that says  you are choosing sides. I am not choosing sides. We are all in this  together. What I disagree with is it is my opinion--and I wish I would  have had experts testify to this, employment law people, bring the  union folks in there, have us have this debate so that we can say: you  know what, these changes are good, these won't make a difference.   I respectfully oppose the way this legislation is written. I  respectfully totally associate myself with the chairman on why he wants  to do it and why he believes that this is best. I only ask,  [[Page H2117]]  take a look at some of the improving amendments that can get us all to  the same point, and give us the benefit of the doubt that we are not  assuming the worst. And I don't--as some have said, this is an attempt  to bust unions or bust the civil service system. That is the farthest  thing from the chairman's mind. I know that because never, in my  experience, has he done anything to disprove that veterans' care comes  first, quality of care at the VA comes first, and accountability must  go with that. My concern is, this doesn't get us there nor does it have  a chance to become into law. With those things, let's come back at it,  let's approach it a little differently, and let's find the common  ground that is there.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my good friend, the distinguished minority whip.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my good friend, the distinguished minority whip.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my good friend, the distinguished minority whip.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my good friend, the distinguished minority whip.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), my good friend, the vice ranking member of the  full Committee on Veterans Affairs.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Poe of Texas). The gentleman from Minnesota has  10 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Poe of Texas). The gentleman from Minnesota has  10 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, you are hearing it here, and these are folks, we work  together. This idea of accountability matters deeply to all of us. We  know when you are in any business, this business--we have had  colleagues of ours in here be arrested for buying cocaine from  undercover police officers in Washington, D.C.   Well, that brings great discredit to every single one of us, but I  certainly don't think it requires all of us, then, to go through the  same thing that person is going through or deprive us our rights of  where we are at. This idea of due process, and what we are asking  about, is not something meant to protect a bad employee. In fact, it is  just the opposite. It is meant to improve the workforce.   My plea on this is--much of this bill, there is agreement on, Mr.  Takano was right--it went a step further. Having been a rank-and-file  person in a collectively bargained unit, my goal was to provide the  best quality education so our students could learn--an environment,  quality teachers, and all of those things.   I am at a loss for the desire to come here and decide that, and  again, we say it in passing: Well, I don't want to deride all of those  really good employees who are there. I just want to take away their  collectively bargained right that was there.   Even though we can give example after example, like Robert. He was a  [[Page H2120]]  service-connected disabled Navy veteran with over a decade of  experience at the Veterans Benefits Administration. He was demoted  after consistently, every single year, receiving highly satisfactory or  top-rated performance reviews. Robert volunteered to be part of a  quality review team to get rid of the backlog, and he had the audacity  to tell his manager that there were better ways we could do this.  Perhaps all of this overtime pay and consolidating all of these claims  to one place was not in the best interest of that. That manager, on the  way out the door, demoted and tried to remove Robert from that  position.   Now, keep in mind, that same manager, all of those years before, had  rated him well. Well, maybe something happened. Maybe Robert started  doing something wrong. Maybe Robert wasn't that good an employee.   But again, under this piece of legislation, Robert's collectively  bargained right--which he used and grieved it and got back his job, and  subsequently, the manager had problems on their performance reviews,  where it came from.   So again, don't set this up as if everything is wrong.   And I would make note of this: We are doing our best to attract the  best and brightest to the VA. Nobody is defending the bad. But when I  hear folks come to the floor and it is nothing but what a horrific  place this is, I leave this for you, Mr. Chairman.   I also have the privilege of representing America's premier medical  institution in the Mayo Clinic, and I look at what they do. Folks at  Mayo Clinic will tell me some of the finest cardiac surgeons in the  world are at the Minneapolis VA.   I will also tell you this. If you, in America, go to any hospital-- Dr. Roe can attest to this--the thing that you should probably be most  worried about and the thing that kills most people--over 90,000 a  year--is hospital-acquired infections.   Do you know who does it better and has the lowest rate, better than  Mayo Clinic, better than Johns Hopkins? The VA. So somebody among those  rank-and-file members who is cleaning the operating rooms and cleaning  the equipment is doing so in a manner that is better than any other.   What message are we sending them today? If a manager doesn't do their  job and decides they want to fire you, we are going to lump everybody  together. I just ask, once again, to my colleagues, to this body, these  are things that should have been debated in a hearing. We should have  brought in the experts.   Here is what I think. I think you would build a broader coalition-- because I have to be very honest with you. I think our public sector  unions could help us and step up and say: What was the real situation  here? How do you respond to this egregious breach of trust? And what do  you think would be a better way?   I am not saying they would give us a suggestion. I want to be very  honest and not disingenuous. They may not answer us. We should have at  least asked them: What would you do to make this better? What could  speed it up, and what could protect them?   We didn't do that because we didn't have a hearing, and I think that  stops building the consensus. I think it makes it harder to get this.    I will tell you this. The bill I keep referencing that was over in  the Senate had 45 Senate cosponsors. Good luck getting 45 of them to  agree today. It is Thursday, and we did it on an accountability plea  that also had the support of every single one of those groups on there,  except one, to support that piece of legislation.   So we went a step further. We didn't have a hearing. We tried to let  outside groups frame this as a veterans versus public sector union  folks, who were also veterans. That is not what it is. We just need to  get it right.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, we are not going to find a lot of disagreement.   I will tell you what a good first step would be: hire some surgeons.  There are openings there. This is our first salvo at trying to fix the  VA. We have an appeals bill that every single veterans service  organization agrees: appeals modernization. We have worked that thing  through. We have had the language. It is not here.   We have a Choice bill that is expiring August 7. We have had a  hearing with the VA Secretary, and that is the way it should have been.  It is not here today.   What we have is a bill that did not go through regular order, a bill  that obviously didn't build a consensus, and this is very unusual to  have a bill from the VA Committee. I bet you 90 to 95 percent of the  time when one hits this floor, it gets 300 to 400 votes up on that  board, but this one is not.   So, again, if the contention is that Members of this House don't care  if there is a bad employee working there, that is disingenuous and  wrong. But if we do believe, putting it in place--and again, the  example I gave, the chairman is right. It took Robert 6 weeks to get  all of the information gathered together because the manager who left  was holding on to it and had to get the union to force the release of  that information. His 14 days would have come and gone, and that is it.   This is why, sometimes, I am not going to defend 400 days. That is  ridiculous. I am not going to spend--if they are dragging their feet.  But this guy got fired by a manager, got demoted down, wanted to get  the information. The outgoing manager said, ``It isn't my problem.''  The union had to go--and had to go, in this case, almost to court--to  get the information back to them so he could present a case that said  exactly what was ruled upon: You got fired illegally by a bad manager.   I am telling people, if you are angry when things go wrong at the VA,  you have got 330 million Americans who are with you. We have subpoenaed  them. None of them were collectively bargained. The problem is in  management and middle management not doing their job.   Do your work.   You know what would be great is if the management actually did what  they are supposed to do and improved bad performance before it gets to  a point where it causes problems and you actually improve that  employee, which saves us money from having to go out and hire someone  else and you have the system working better. But to watch something go  wrong, not do your due diligence, not follow the law, then fire someone  and then complain that it takes too long to fix it, how about we figure  out what really gets, keeps, retains, and makes the VA better?   There are other places that we could work on. Ninety percent of it,  you have got my agreement. I think you are going to see that 10 percent  is going to ensure this does not get into law; and that, in itself, is  simply wrong because  [[Page H2121]]  no one disagrees. We could make this system work better.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, after the gentleman finishes with his speakers,  I will close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would say that I am pleased that the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) is going to use the Oversight and  Government Reform Committee to provide oversight of this  administration. I welcome it. I have some suggestions for some other  oversight of the administration, and I would be glad to share them.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota has 1 minute  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I am glad we got an opportunity to debate this,  which is what we should do. There is no disagreement that we need to  hold folks accountable. We need to get the best people at the VA. We  need to commit to improving the VA the best we can.   My respect and admiration for the chairman is as it has always been,  the highest it can be. I know his heart and his intellect is aimed at  that. We have some legitimate differences on this. I don't believe they  are so big they can't be overcome. I do believe we should try and keep  this away from the partisanship that so often engulfs this House.   My commitment to Chairman Roe of Tennessee is to do the best I can to  continue to try and improve upon these. We have a lot more work to do  that will be happening together to improve the care of our veterans.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am  not opposed to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Minnesota is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is just a simple technical  correction. It does not change my concerns with the underlying bill on  H.R. 1259, but I am not opposed to the technical corrections.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Strike section 3 and insert the following new section 3:       SEC. 3.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Roe of Tennessee and  Chairman Sessions of the Rules Committee for making this amendment in  order. I have voiced my concern with the regular order. I think it is  important to note that we are given the opportunity here to offer  amendments in good faith, and I am grateful for that.   This amendment to H.R. 1259 would replace sections 3 and 9 of the  underlying bill with bipartisan legislation from the Veterans First Act  that was first introduced by Senator Isakson last Congress. This is a  piece of legislation I have been talking about.   It is supported from both sides of the aisle, as well as those  veterans service organizations, with the exception of one, that was  shown earlier.   If we hope to reach any compromise with the Senate on accountability,  I believe this amendment could be made in order, be voted on, debated,  and passed into it.   The amendment specifically targets senior executives. It has been the  senior executives, not the frontline employees, who we have subpoenaed  before our committee, and who the VA has failed to hold accountable.   Like H.R. 1259, it provides an expedited process for the VA Secretary  to hold senior executives and VA employees accountable.   For a senior executive employee, the employee would get 10 business  days' notice. The employee subject to an adverse action would be able  to grieve the action through an internal grievance process that would  take no longer than 21 days. The employee would also be permitted to  appeal an adverse action to court. It would also require the VA  Secretary to develop a performance management system for SES employees.  Do your job. Have the management do their job.   For VA employees, the employee would be removed from misconduct or  poor performance that took place within the previous 2 years before the  proposed removal. The employee would get 10 business days' notice. The  employee would get 10 business days to respond to the charges. The VA  Secretary would be required to provide the employee a decision in a  reasonable period of time, and the employee would have 10 days to  appeal the decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board. This takes a  little time.   The Merit Systems Protection Board would have 90 days to issue a  decision. During that time, the employee would receive no pay and no  benefits.   My amendment would also leave in place sections 4 through 8 of H.R.  1259 because I agree employees convicted of felonies connected to their  jobs should not receive pensions, and poor-performing employees should  not receive bonuses. No disagreement.   Most importantly, my amendment provides a fair process that protects  whistleblowers. By allowing our frontline employees to use arbitration  and grievance procedures under collective bargaining agreements, these  frontline employees remain protected from bad managers who want to  retaliate against them for speaking out when something is wrong.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the choice is not as easy as that. Do you  want to stand with Robert, the good employee who was fired by a bad  manager who used the process to get their job back, or do we want to  just hurry it?   It is better to get it right than get it done. And I will point out,  AFGE, the union you keep hearing about, Mr. Chairman, does not endorse  my amendment. They do not endorse my amendment, nor do I care about  that.   What I do believe is that this amendment has the opportunity to  improve upon on a bill that we 90 percent agree upon, taking out the  piece that is going to make it difficult and not improve care for our  veterans. And I guess the thing that I would hope matters, I believe-- and we will come back here and see. We will see. That is the good part  about this place. If this piece of legislation is passed by October, by  Halloween, we should have this bill through and it should be done, and  we should be seeing changes.   If we don't, perhaps we do this exercise again, through regular  order, taking some of these suggestions that make it possible to get it  done.   I encourage my colleagues to support this change that makes sure we  can get accountability. Let's agree where we know we agree. It is not  picking one over the other. It is deciding how you give due process,  encouraging good employees to have the rights that they have earned to  improve that care and workplace while at the same time removing those  that don't.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    This is not the Veterans First Act. It is pieces from the  Veterans First Act, but changes.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota  will be postponed.   The Chair understands that amendment No. 3 will not be offered.            Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Kuster of New Hampshire    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4  printed in part A of House Report 115-39.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 8, line 20, insert ``or section 733(c) of this title''       after ``title 5''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentlewoman  from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, today I speak on behalf of  my amendment, Kuster amendment No. 4. I firmly believe that my  amendment will improve accountability at the Veterans Administration.   One of my concerns with the bill before us is that it will  inadvertently hurt whistleblowers through retaliation and other  discriminatory practices. Whistleblowers are vital for our mission to  ensure accountability at the VA.   As the ranking member of the Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee, I know that whistleblowers provide the VA and our  committee with information of misconduct before it goes too far or  before those responsible can deflect blame or otherwise hide  incriminating details. We must ensure that these folks are protected in  any bill that seeks to streamline the VA's ability to release  employees.   I appreciate the inclusion of whistleblower protections within  section 3 of the bill. We understand the importance of protecting  whistleblowers, and my amendment would improve upon this language.   Last year's MILCON-VA appropriations bill included what is now  section 733 of title 38. This title clarifies and further specifies  prohibited personnel actions as they relate to VA whistleblowers. For  example, section 733 explicitly prohibits the denial of an otherwise  meritorious promotion because that employee filed a whistleblower  complaint. The bill currently only references more generic protections  found within title 5.   Section 733 was added because of concerns that title 5 was not  specific enough to the issues that face the VA. This amendment will  ensure that an employee is protected if they help the GAO or the VA  Office of Inspector General in any investigations.  [[Page H2128]]    This language is bipartisan in nature, and my amendment is supported  by the Project on Government Oversight, an independent nonprofit that  seeks to improve accountability.   My amendment aligns with the spirit of this bill. It protects those  who virtuously serve our Nation's veterans, and punishes those who do  wrong by them. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment,  Kuster No. 4, because it is common sense and the right thing to do.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, although I am not  opposed to the amendment and, in fact, I am enthusiastically supportive  of the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Minnesota is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for bringing this  forward. This amendment addresses an issue that we dealt with in our  committee last Congress, where senior executives are transferred to  different positions around the country, receive pay increases and  relocation incentives.   We subpoenaed two senior executives. In fact, the first subpoenas  ever issued out of the VA Committee, I asked for them to get there; and  they were backed by Mr. Roe, backed by our chairman and ranking member.  And to refresh people's minds, these were folks that took positions of  lesser power, used their positions to negotiate to get there, and then,  in some cases, took $129,000 moving expenses.   You cannot find anyone more outraged than me. And I will tell you,  because it was not done correctly, and we didn't focus on this, I still  work with some of those very same people. They have their jobs back.   Now, the debate that the gentleman may have heard earlier is we don't  disagree at all that we should get rid of these people. This amendment  will focus on the right things, that is what we have been making the  case of.   So I applaud the gentleman. I am glad he is here. His military  service is greatly appreciated. The statistics he gave on veterans  shows that he will be there. I support this amendment, and I certainly  believe that my colleagues should all support it.   It is this type of work that improves upon a bill, as I say, once  again, 90 percent of what is in this bill is in absolute agreement.  This just makes the bill better.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I am not  opposed to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Minnesota is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I am not only not opposed, I am  enthusiastically supportive of the gentlewoman's commonsense,  absolutely important piece of legislation. It improves upon the bill. I  am glad we had a rule that brought it here, something we have worked on  in our committee. I will make note of this.   The gentlewoman is absolutely right. The people we just talked about  in the last amendment received bonuses also, but the bulk of this bill  also deals with kitchen staff, janitorial staff, and rank-and-file  members on the floor that we are working to go after their agreed-upon  grievance process to keep their jobs. So this amendment is absolutely  something that will get total approval from certainly, I believe, all  Members of the House. This should be in the bill and will be in the  bill.   This is how bills get better, address real issues, and take on the  issue of accountability in a bipartisan manner. Mr. Chairman, I would  encourage all my colleagues to support the gentlewoman. We have more  work, as the gentlewoman said in this, but this is how it is done to  get it right.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1367. I would like to  thank the gentleman from Ohio, first of all, as an incredibly important  Member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, a doctor himself and,  as important, a colonel in the United States Army and the United States  Army Reserve. An incredible insight into the very issues we are  addressing and, I think, bringing this bill right now, we had a very  good debate on fixing the VA, moving them in the right direction. And  this piece of legislation is incredibly spot-on about another piece of  that accountability.   Dr. Wenstrup's bill will help the VA better understand its staffing  shortages, and I think this is important. We all say 45,000 openings or  whatever; it is important for us to know, do we need to hire all 45,000  of those; which ones are critical; which ones can be done faster. So  that piece is common sense.   It develops an executive management fellowship program that will  allow the VA to send its leaders to the private sector to learn best  practices and vice versa; again, incredibly smart, welcome change.   It will allow the VA to develop technical advancements, so employees  who are in a specific field can advance in title and salary, without  moving to a management role.   Quality hiring, training, and retention starts with a good HR  department. This legislation will provide critical research into best  HR practice and then provide the training to VA HR managers. These  provisions, along with other hiring authorities, will help the VA get  the right people in the door.   Currently, as the gentleman said, the process is slow, cumbersome,  and, quite honestly, I think it just burns people out before they get  there. And these are really dedicated folks who want to serve.   I have a gentleman I have become acquainted with who is a nationally  renowned cardiac surgeon who left a very lucrative private practice to  go to the VA after his son was wounded in the current conflicts in Iraq  and Afghanistan, and chose to do his part by going back into the VA  system.   He mentioned how cumbersome it was. He mentioned some of the  bureaucratic troubles that he had, and all he wanted to do was bring an  incredible skill set to serve those who served us; and Mr. Wenstrup's  bill does exactly that.   I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and ask that  consideration in support of the amendments be brought forward, be  considered. Each of these amendments will improve on a really good  piece of legislation, improve the Secretary's ability to recruit,  train, and retain a quality workforce.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, before I yield to the gentleman from Florida,  I would like to point out, as a new Member bringing new vitality and  new blood to this, how encouraging it is, both to me and, I would hope,  to his constituents. Seeking out ways to serve veterans, coming to try  and work on legislation in a bipartisan manner speaks volumes for his  commitment.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto).    Mr. Chair, before I reserve the balance of my time, I would  like to point out to the gentleman from Florida that he has a  podiatrist right here in Dr. Wenstrup, so we can just solve the problem  as we stand.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers and will be  prepared to close after the gentleman is done.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers and will be  prepared to close after the gentleman is done.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I can't thank the gentleman enough--smart  legislation combining many good ideas, willingness to incorporate those  best practices, and then, I think, forcing VA to start moving in that  direction.   This is an example, I think, of where the VA is at. And while we may  disagree, and you saw a little bit of it today, it is not because there  is any disagreement on what the final outcome is.   Dr. Wenstrup's bill is smart. It will improve care; it will get good  people in the VA; it will retain them; and it will improve HR practices  to make sure that happens.   I encourage my colleagues to support the bill and some of the  amendments that will work to improve upon a very good piece of  legislation.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.
