 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 998) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of  1968 to expand support for police officer family services, stress  reduction, and suicide prevention, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 998         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting and Treating       Officers In Crisis Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. EXPANDING SUPPORT FOR POLICE OFFICER FAMILY SERVICES,                     STRESS REDUCTION, AND SUICIDE PREVENTION.         Part W of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe       Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10491 et seq.) is amended--        (1) in the part heading, by striking ``family support'' and       inserting ``support for law enforcement officers and       families'';        (2) in section 2301 (34 U.S.C. 10491)--        (A) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``, including any       research and reports developed under the Law Enforcement       Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-113;       131 Stat. 2276)'' after ``interested parties''; and        (B) in paragraph (4), by inserting ``, psychological       services, suicide prevention,'' after ``stress reduction'';        (3) in section 2302 (34 U.S.C. 10492), by inserting ``and       mental health services'' after ``family support services'';       and        (4) in section 2303 (34 U.S.C. 10493)--        (A) in subsection (b)--        (i) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``officers and'' after       ``law enforcement''; and        (ii) by amending paragraph (4) to read as follows:        ``(4) Evidence-based programs to reduce stress, prevent       suicide, and promote mental health.''; and        (B) in subsection (c)--        (i) in paragraph (5), by inserting ``, mental health       crisis, and suicide prevention'' after ``family crisis'';        (ii) in paragraph (6), by striking ``the human       immunodeficiency virus'' and inserting ``infectious       disease'';        (iii) in paragraph (8), by inserting ``, injured, or       permanently disabled'' after ``killed''; and        (iv) by striking paragraph (10) and inserting the       following:        ``(10) Specialized training for identifying, reporting, and       responding to officer mental health crises and suicide.        ``(11) Technical assistance and training to support any or       all of the services described in paragraphs (1) through       (10).''.       SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR SUPPORTING LAW                     ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND FAMILIES.         Section 1001(a)(21) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control       and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10261(a)(21)) is       amended to read as follows:        ``(21) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out       part W, $7,500,000 for each of fiscal years 2020 through       2024.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 998, the Supporting and  Treating Officers in Crisis Act of 2019, also known as the STOIC Act.  This bill would provide important mental health and suicide prevention  services to law enforcement officers and their families.   Specifically, it would modify an existing, but expired, authorization  providing support to law enforcement officers' families to add mental  health and suicide prevention programs directed at officers themselves.  Additionally, S. 998 would also reauthorize the family support  provisions and would appropriate up to $7.5 million for each fiscal  year from 2020 to 2024 to carry out both the family and law enforcement  officer mental health programs.   The law enforcement officers this grant program would assist all too  often face dangerous and horrific challenges, which takes a hard toll  on them and, often, their families. Too frequently, local resources are  not readily available or accessible for these purposes. S. 998 would  bridge this critical gap.   Seeking help is often the hardest step to take to address one's  mental health issues. It can be especially difficult for law  enforcement officers because of the stigma against it within the law  enforcement community and, too often still, in society as a whole. The  aim of this legislation is to help overcome this reluctance by  destigmatizing mental health treatment in the law enforcement  community.   Provisions in this legislation encourage recipients of grant funding  to set up suicide prevention hotlines. These lifelines are a critical  step for getting those officers who need it the assistance they require  and thereby help address the nationwide tragedy of officer suicide.   The impact of on-the-job stress is not limited to law enforcement  officers, however. The underlying expired grant program, which this  bill reauthorizes, permits recipients of grant programs for marital and  adolescent support groups. This ``whole family'' approach to mental  health services is essential for retaining officers. It is often said  that departments recruit officers and retain families. Family support  programs, such as those authorized in S. 998, provide critical support  that keeps officers on patrol.  [[Page H5330]]    Lastly, included in the reauthorization is the ability for recipients  of this grant to provide child care on a 24-hour basis. This provision  furnishes much-needed support to single parent officers, many of whom  are women. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that there are over  100,000 female law enforcement officers nationwide. Child care  programs, as authorized in this measure, help promote family-friendly  workplaces and facilitate the employment of more female officers.   S. 998 is identical to H.R. 2368, a bipartisan measure sponsored by  our House Judiciary Committee colleague, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, Representative Guy Reschenthaler, with the support of the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, Representative Madeleine Dean. I should  also note that the Judiciary Committee passed the House bill by voice  vote last month.   Accordingly, I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the tragically high number of law enforcement  professionals who take their own lives each year is a serious problem  that must be addressed.   According to Blue H.E.L.P., an advocacy organization that works to  reduce mental health stigma in the law enforcement community, 167 law  enforcement officers committed suicide in 2018. By comparison, in the  same year, 144 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty.   S. 998 will help provide critical mental health and suicide  prevention assistance to law enforcement officers in need. I therefore  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important measure, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 744) to amend section 175b of title 18, United States Code, to  correct a scrivener's error.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 744         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Effective Prosecution of       Possession of Biological Toxins and Agents Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON THE POSSESSION OF BIOLOGICAL TOXINS                     AND AGENTS.         Section 175b of title 18, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) by striking ``(a)(1) No restricted'' and all that       follows through the end of paragraph (1) and inserting the       following:        ``(a) Offense.--        ``(1) In general.--It shall be unlawful for a restricted       person to--        ``(A) ship, transport, or possess in or affecting       interstate or foreign commerce any biological agent or toxin       described in paragraph (2); or        ``(B) receive any biological agent or toxin described in       paragraph (2) that has been shipped or transported in       interstate or foreign commerce.        ``(2) Agents and toxins covered.--A biological agent or       toxin described in this paragraph is a biological agent or       toxin that--        ``(A) is listed as a non-overlap or overlap select       biological agent or toxin under part 73 of title 42, Code of       Federal Regulations, pursuant to section 351A of the Public       Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262a); and        ``(B) is not excluded or exempted under part 73 of title       42, Code of Federal Regulations.''; and        (B) by striking ``(2) Whoever'' and inserting ``(3)       Penalty.--Whoever'' and adjusting the margin accordingly; and        (2) in subsection (d), in the matter preceding paragraph       (1), by inserting ``Definitions.--'' before ``In this       section:''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 744, the Effective Prosecution  of Possession of Biological Toxins and Agents Act of 2019, a bill that  would correct an error that has unintentionally resulted in an  incomplete list of biological toxins and agents prohibited under  current law.  [[Page H5332]]    This legislation will help ensure the safety of our citizens and the  security of our Nation. S. 744, which the Senate passed by unanimous  consent earlier this year, is identical to H.R. 1986, which the House  Committee on the Judiciary recently approved by voice vote last month.   In 1990, Congress imposed criminal penalties with respect to the  development, production, stockpiling, transfer, acquisition, retention,  or possession of any biological agents, toxins, or delivery systems  intended for use as a weapon.   Thereafter, Congress in 2001, added section 175b to title 18 of the  U.S. Code, criminalizing the possession by unregistered individuals or  restricted persons of certain biological agents, termed ``select  agents,'' as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  A person found guilty under section 175b can be imprisoned for up to 10  years.   As originally enacted and thereafter in subsequent amendments  thereto, section 175b referred to specific sections of the Code of  Federal Regulations that listed various biological agents and toxins.   That provision was last amended in 2004, but subsequently, the  Department of Health and Human Services reformatted some sections of  the Code of Federal Regulations and inadvertently rendered the  references in section 175b incomplete.   For example, one of the select agents inadvertently eliminated from  the list of prohibited substances is ricin, a poison found in castor  beans. Ricin is inexpensive, easy to make, and highly toxic.   This result, the consequence of a drafting error, is clearly not what  Congress intended. Unfortunately, there have already been real-life  consequences for this error.   Last September, for instance, the District Court for the Northern  District of Georgia, dismissed the indictment of William Christopher  Gibbs, a self-avowed white supremacist who was charged with the  unregistered possession of ricin. In dismissing the Gibbs indictment,  the court stated it:         Appreciates the potential dangers associated with       individuals possessing potentially hazardous agents and       toxins without permission to do so. Equally, though, the       Court takes very seriously the principle that citizens ought       to have fair and clear warning of the conduct for which they       can be held criminal responsible. It falls to Congress to       write criminal laws, or to amend them if they yield unfair or       unwanted results. The role of the courts, on the other hand,       is limited to fairly reading and applying the laws Congress       writes; not to change them.    As we consider S. 744 today, it is important to recognize and commend  the sponsor of the House companion bill, the gentleman from Texas and  our Judiciary Committee colleague, Representative   John Ratcliffe; and  Judiciary Ranking Member Doug Collins; as well as the gentlewoman from  New York, Representative Kathleen Rice; and the gentleman from Texas,  Representative Will Hurd, for their bipartisan efforts to address this  critical problem.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, without question, Congress should do everything within  its power to ensure the safety of all Americans. Clearly, the  possession and distribution of ricin is dangerous and should be  included among the various biological toxins prohibited under current  law, as Congress had intended.   S. 744 corrects this technical error and addresses the serious  consequences presented by this oversight. For these reasons, I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting S. 744, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 677) to amend gendered terms in Federal law relating to the  President and the President's spouse.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 677         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century President       Act''.       SEC. 2. MODERNIZATION OF TERMS RELATING TO THE PRESIDENT AND                     THE SPOUSE OF A PRESIDENT.         Section 879(b)(1)(A) of title 18, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``the wife of a former President during       his lifetime, the widow of a former President until her death       or remarriage'' and inserting ``the spouse of a former       President during a former President's lifetime, the surviving       spouse of a former President until the surviving spouse's       death or remarriage''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there will be a time in this country when the President  of the United States will have a husband and not a wife. In preparation  for that day, I urge the House to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 677,  the 21st Century President Act, which removes gender terms from current  law criminalizing threats against former Presidents and their families.   Currently, we have a law that makes it unlawful to threaten to kill,  kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon a former President, President- elect, Vice President-elect, or a major candidate for President, or  Vice President, or their immediate family member.   The statute, however, defines immediate family with terms such as:  ``wife,'' ``her,'' and ``widow,'' which makes presumptions that will  not stand the test of the future of this country.   At present, one member of the LGBTQ community and six women have  declared themselves to be candidates for the Presidency. Whether or not  any of these candidates is nominated or elected, it is clear that the  terminology in our law is outdated and should be changed to refer to  the spouse of a former President.   The words we use shape the world in which we live. We should act  accordingly. I support H.R. 677, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is essential that we update our statutes when  necessary. H.R. 677 does exactly that. It simply amends current law so  that it is more inclusive and reflective of our society.   I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin, Representative Mark Pocan, for  identifying this problem in the law and for introducing this bill to  rectify it. H.R. 677 will indeed take this law into the 21st century,  as the title suggests.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.
