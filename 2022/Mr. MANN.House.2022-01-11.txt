 Mr. Speaker, I want to take the opportunity today to speak  directly on behalf of my constituents and their concerns.   Each year I make a point to host a townhall in all 63 counties of the  Big First District because visiting with and listening to Kansans, who  I have taken an oath to serve, is one of the greatest joys of my work  as a Member of Congress.   So far in 2022, I have hosted seven of these townhalls. At each  meeting, I heard the same concerns echoed: government spending, labor  shortages, vaccine mandates, and the next farm bill.   Kansans believe that government spending is out of control, and I  agree with them. One of our country's fastest growing expenses is just  the interest payments on our national debt, which is estimated to be  $562 billion for fiscal year 2021 alone. You could fund the entire  Department of Agriculture more than twice over for that amount.   Given this situation, this administration's spending, as we have seen  in the bloated Build Back Better plan, is shortsighted and dangerous.  Wild discretionary government spending has weakened our great country  and, not only that, spending on some programs during the pandemic has  incentivized staying at home instead of returning to work.   Kansans believe that labor shortages are hurting Americans, and I  agree with them. People can't find bus drivers to take their kids to  school or sanitation workers to pick up their trash. Meanwhile,  inflation is at a 40-year high; grocery store staples are up over 12  percent; and people's essential goods, like car parts and  refrigerators, are still stuck on cargo ships. We are in an economic  crisis, and this administration has yet to act meaningfully to combat  the effects.   Kansans believe that vaccine mandates are unconstitutional, and I  agree with them. Anyone who wants to get a vaccine should be able to  get one in this country, but it is not the Federal Government's job to  dictate personal healthcare choices of the American people. Vaccine  mandates are a terrible idea for the present situation in this country,  as they will only continue to strip the workforce of even more people.   Kansans are also worried about the next farm bill, particularly as it  relates to crop insurance and the Livestock Indemnity Program, and I  share these concerns. The 2018 farm bill did not include any major  changes to Federal crop insurance, which provides a robust and strong  safety net for farmers across the country.   I also want to ensure that the Livestock Indemnity Program remains  intact, as it offered critical support to folks in my district after  natural disasters like the recent wildfires that we saw last month.   Farmers and producers are rightfully concerned that the 2023 farm  bill could see significant changes. However, given that fact, House  Democrats have held zero farm bill implementation hearings so far.   My goal is to do everything within my power for my constituents to  ensure that no significant changes are made to reduce either of these  essential components in the next farm bill.   The new year, which has just begun, brings with it a hope for change  and growth. If we have been dissatisfied with the course of our lives  or that of our Nation, January ushers in a fresh start. It gives us an  opportunity to examine ourselves and to reassess our goals and  ambitions. Most of all, the new year reminds us of the greatest  privileges we have, living in a free nation where we have the right to  life and to liberty and to pursue happiness as we see fit.   As we begin the second year of the 117th Congress, I want to  reiterate my dedication to serving my constituents in the Big First. I  am fighting to preserve the foundation of our free Nation and to  protect your values.   Kansas is still the pilot light of freedom for America. As long as it  continues to burn, I believe that our brightest days are yet to come.                    Creating the Congressional FFA Caucus     Mr. Speaker, I stand today to invite all of my colleagues  to join me and 30 other Representatives from both sides of the aisle in  the newly formed Congressional FFA Caucus. Representative Panetta and I  established this caucus to serve as an informal group dedicated to  issues affecting the next generation of agriculture leaders and  students pursuing careers in agriculture, food, natural resources, and  related sciences.   As a past FFA chapter president from Quinter, Kansas, and a member of  the House Agriculture Committee, I am dedicated to raising awareness  [[Page H16]]  about school-based agricultural education, FFA, and the next generation  of leaders who will feed, fuel, and clothe the world.   The National FFA Organization is a congressionally chartered school- based national youth leadership development organization that plays an  integral role in preparing the next generation of leaders who will  change the world.   I sincerely hope my colleagues in the House will consider joining our  caucus to support agriculture and the students who are passionate about  it.                            ____________________
