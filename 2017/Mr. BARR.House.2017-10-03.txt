 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to act  quickly to reauthorize the Community Health Center Fund, which expired  last week on September 30.   Community health centers provide cost-effective and accessible  primary care, mental health counseling, and substance abuse treatment  for over 27 million patients nationally, including over 200,000 of my  constituents in Kentucky's Sixth District.   The upfront Federal investment in community health centers leads to  savings down the road by fighting the cycle of opioid addiction,  preventing more complex health conditions, and diverting patients away  from higher cost centers of care, such as the emergency room.   I have visited community health centers in my district, including  White House Clinics, Sterling Health Solutions, Family Care of  Bluegrass, and HealthFirst Bluegrass, and I have witnessed firsthand  what a difference these organizations make in providing much needed  care to at-risk Kentuckians.   Without the support of the Community Health Center Fund, these CHCs  may soon be forced to cut back services, lay off staff, or even shut  down clinics.   Mr. Speaker, admittedly, there is a robust debate in this country and  a wide diversity of opinion about healthcare reform, the ACA, and what  repeal and replacing the ACA should look like, but we should all agree  that community health centers are part of the solution.                            ____________________
