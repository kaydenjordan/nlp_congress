 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in whatever  order you choose, Senators Crapo, Baldwin, and Whitehouse each be given  a minute, then I be allowed to speak in leader time, and the vote come  immediately after that.    Mr. President, I am on leader time.                           Forced Family Separation    Mr. President, as the purposeful, cynical, and shameful humanitarian  crisis of family separation at the border continues to unfold, the vast  majority of Americans are looking to President Trump's administration,  which started this practice, to end it.   The Associated Press recently reported that the Trump administration  has been sending babies and young children to what they call tender age  facilities. It is unconscionable--unconscionable--that the Government  of the United States is warehousing babies and toddlers alone in an  institutional setting.   The crisis was willfully and purposefully created by this President  through his zero tolerance policy at the border. It can and should be  ended by the same mechanism. With the simple flick of a pen, the  President can end this policy. If the President wants to borrow my pen,  he can have it. He can do it quickly and easily if he wants to. It is  on his back.   The administration must end this gratuitously cruel and  counterproductive policy that has brought such pain to innocent  children and so much shame on this Nation. No law requires the  separation of children from their families, no law says you must send  babies to detention facilities, and no law is required to end it.   Nineteen Republicans in the Senate have already called on the Trump  administration to reverse or suspend this policy administratively,  without any congressional action. If our Republican colleagues and the  Republican leadership in particular want to solve this problem, they  ought to be directing their attention to the other side of Pennsylvania  Avenue, to the White House, because that is where it can get done, done  well, and get done quickly. This is at the administration's doorstep to  stop or sustain. This is President Trump's responsibility. He could fix  it this morning if he actually wanted to fix it. Instead, he points  fingers of blame, he prevaricates, and he makes things up because he  doesn't even want to own this policy. He knows how unpopular it is with  the American people, but at the same time, he sort of wants to tell his  base: I am with you. I am with you.   It is awful.   There is this idea that Congress could step in and pass legislation  to deal with family separation. That is highly, highly dubious and  unlikely. When has this Congress ever successfully passed immigration  legislation in the last few years? Never. It is an illusion. Color us  dubious that Congress--the House and Senate, with Republican majorities  and strong rightwing elements who hate any change in immigration--could  successfully pass legislation. Here are the problems:   First, would Speaker Ryan agree to pass and put on the floor a narrow  bill that just deals with this issue? Has he ever done that before?  Never. Never. Even if the Senate passed something, in the House, it  would be dragged into a morass.   Second, would the President sign something that--it was reported in  the newspaper that Sarah Huckabee Sanders said he would not sign the  bill that Senator Cruz is talking about. So what is the point? We want  to solve this problem.   Third, will both Republican leaders, House and Senate, guarantee that  a narrow bill will not have poison pill riders that are unacceptable to  large percentages of this body added to any legislation?   Let's get those guarantees--no poison pill riders, Senate leadership  and House leadership agree, and Speaker  [[Page S4256]]  Ryan has the votes to pass something before we move on a legislative  path, when there is such an easy alternative path available, which is  the President taking his pen and undoing what he has done.   The bottom line, my colleagues, is that there is only one real  solution, as much as we would dream for another; that is, for the  President to solve this problem. The odds of any legislation being able  to pass--without poison pill riders--the House and Senate and be signed  by the President is just about zero, while the percentage that the  President could solve this problem if he wants to is just about 100  percent.   I have to say one other thing. Ted Cruz--a leading anti-immigration  advocate--must be feeling the heat. He has never been for modifying our  immigration laws in any way that helps immigrants. Read some of his  past statements.   I ask the question, Is something cynical going on with some people?  They want to get this off their backs because they feel the heat, but  they really don't want to solve the problem, because if they did,  Senator Cruz and the others would do what 19 Republicans have correctly  done: Ask the President to solve the problem himself.                                    Trade    Mr. President, on a different subject entirely, our trade  relationship with China. For too long, China has taken advantage of  America's unwillingness to strongly confront its rapacious trade  policies. For too long, China has dumped artificially cheap products  into our markets, stolen the intellectual property of blue-chip  American companies, and denied our most profitable companies access to  its markets.   I am heartened that President Trump, after making a debacle of a deal  on ZTE, has taken a tougher approach to China in recent days. His  instincts to be tough on China are right on the money.   President Trump needs to stay strong. If he backs off at the first  sign of trouble, after the first company calls to complain, after  President Xi calls to complain, then China will know we are weak and  unserious.   China is waiting to see if it can ride this out. We need to show  China that America means business because the stakes are too high.   Business relocations to China have costs too many American jobs. The  theft of our intellectual property has been called ``the greatest  transfer of wealth in history'' by a four-star general and commander of  U.S. Cyber Command. The lifeblood of the American economy is on the  line. I urge President Trump to stay strong on China.   Don't mistake my support on this issue for what the President is  doing with our allies. The tariffs leveled against Canada and our  European allies are misguided and counterproductive. China is the real  threat. And China should be the President's focus.                             Republican Tax Bill    Mr. President, 6 months ago today, the Republican majority jammed  through a partisan tax bill that lavished tax cuts on big corporations  and the wealthiest few. It is an appropriate time to look back on how  the tax bill is fairing.   While the Republican leader, on a daily basis, celebrates vague  statistics about business confidence, here are some cold, hard facts.   Since the beginning of 2018, corporations have announced plans to  repurchase more than $475 billion in stock buybacks--a record pace.  Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor statistics report that real average  hourly earnings have dropped by 0.1 percent.   According to a recent analysis by Just Capital, only 6 percent of the  capital allocated by companies from the tax bill's savings has gone to  employees, while nearly 60 percent has gone to shareholders.   Remember, President Trump promised that the Republican tax bill would  give a $4,000 raise for the average American family. In reality,  American families are not seeing close to that figure. A recent  Washington Post headline sums it up best: ``The Republican tax bill's  promises of higher wages and more jobs haven't materialized.''   The truth is, the tax law has failed to deliver for American workers  and American families. Corporations are reaping record profits as a  result of the tax bill and are refusing to pass much of those savings  onto their workers. And whatever benefits American families are getting  from the tax bill--if they are getting benefits at all--are starting to  get wiped out by skyrocketing health care costs, the result of  Republican sabotage.   All in all, that is why that today, 6 months since it passed, the  Republicans' signature legislative accomplishment remains deeply  unpopular.   I yield the floor.                   Vote on Amendment No. 2943, as Modified
