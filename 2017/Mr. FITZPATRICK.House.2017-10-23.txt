 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of two amazing Bucks Countians, Elly McNelis and Bobby  Heenan.   The Bucks County Central Labor Council has awarded the Trish Coyle  Award to Elly McNelis, a member of AFSCME Local 1598, and president of  the Neshaminy Bucks Coalition of Labor Union Women. Elly serves as a  Bucks County crossing guard and is committed to strengthening the role  of women in unions and increasing the involvement of women in the  legislative process.   The Bucks County Central Labor Council has also awarded Bobby Heenan  with their Man of the Year Award. Bobby serves as the business manager  for the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 542. Bobby and  his team are committed to producing the most skilled and efficient  heavy equipment operators in the industry.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize these distinguished  individuals for their service to their fellow working families and to  our entire Bucks County community.                        Breast Cancer Awareness Month     Mr. Speaker, as the son and brother of breast cancer  survivors, I understand the impact of this disease on families  throughout our community. Each year, about 200,000 women are diagnosed  with breast cancer, and more than 40,000 American women will die of  this disease.   It does not have to be this way, Mr. Speaker. This Breast Cancer  Awareness Month, I am proud to be working with my colleague  Congresswoman DeLauro in advocating for increased access to information  about breast cancer that allows women and their doctors to make the  best decisions possible.   The fight against cancer is one that transcends politics. By working  together, we can pass commonsense legislation that increases the  quality of life and care for patients and, ultimately, put an end to  this awful disease.                      Prescription Pain Medication Abuse     Mr. Speaker, nearly 70 percent of individuals who  abuse prescription pain medication get them from their friends or  family.   As our community continues to grapple with the devastating effects of  the opioid epidemic, it is crucial we take every step possible to stop  prescription medications from falling into the wrong hands, including  the collecting and safely disposing of unused or expired prescription  drugs.   My community in Bucks County has collected over 40 tons of unused  medications, the most in Pennsylvania, as part of our successful  Prescription Drug Take Back program. This collaborative effort between  local government, law enforcement, and community leaders is crucial in  the battle against this crisis.   I commend those involved and urge all residents to participate in our  next Take Back Day and to utilize the permanent drop boxes that are  located throughout our region.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the  [[Page H8058]]  bill (H.R. 2142) to improve the ability of U.S. Customs and Border  Protection to interdict fentanyl, other synthetic opioids, and other  narcotics and psychoactive substances that are illegally imported into  the United States, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2142         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``International Narcotics       Trafficking Emergency Response by Detecting Incoming       Contraband with Technology Act'' or the ``INTERDICT Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Chemical screening device.--The term ``chemical       screening device'' means an immunoassay, narcotics field test       kit, infrared spectrophotometer, mass spectrometer, nuclear       magnetic resonance spectrometer, Raman spectrophotometer, or       other scientific instrumentation able to collect data that       can be interpreted to determine the presence of fentanyl,       other synthetic opioids, and other narcotics and psychoactive       substances.        (2) Commissioner.--The term ``Commissioner'' means the       Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.        (3) Express consignment operator or carrier.--The term       ``express consignment operator or carrier'' has the meaning       given that term in section 128.1 of title 19, Code of Federal       Regulations (or any similar successor regulation).       SEC. 3. INTERDICTION OF FENTANYL, OTHER SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS,                     AND OTHER NARCOTICS AND PSYCHOACTIVE                     SUBSTANCES.         (a) Chemical Screening Devices.--The Commissioner shall--        (1) increase the number of chemical screening devices       available to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers over       the number of such devices that are available on the date of       the enactment of this Act; and        (2) make such additional chemical screening devices       available to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers as       the Commissioner determines are necessary to interdict       fentanyl, other synthetic opioids, and other narcotics and       psychoactive substances that are illegally imported into the       United States, including such substances that are imported       through the mail or by an express consignment operator or       carrier.        (b) Personnel to Interpret Data.--The Commissioner shall       dedicate the appropriate number of U.S. Customs and Border       Protection personnel, including scientists, so that such       personnel are available during all operational hours to       interpret data collected by chemical screening devices.       SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         There is authorized to be appropriated to the Commissioner       $9,000,000 to ensure that U.S. Customs and Border Protection       has resources, including chemical screening devices,       personnel, and scientists, available during all operational       hours to prevent, detect, and interdict the unlawful       importation of fentanyl, other synthetic opioids, and other       narcotics and psychoactive substances.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as communities across my district and across our Nation  continue to deal with the crisis of opioid abuse and addiction, it is  incomprehensible to imagine a synthetic drug up to 50 times stronger  than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine.   Fentanyl is a manufactured opioid which, in its illicit versions, has  contributed to tens of thousands of deaths. This fact is especially  concerning, given that this drug can be ordered online and delivered  via mail or express consignment couriers from places like China.   Fentanyl is highly potent in trace amounts, and this problem is  exacerbated due to fentanyl being extremely difficult for our  authorities to detect. That is why Congresswoman Tsongas and I  introduced the INTERDICT Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that  provides U.S. Customs and Border Protection access to the most  effective chemical screening devices and scientific support to detect  and intercept synthetic opioids before they can cause more harm.   Mr. Speaker, the INTERDICT Act will ensure that CBP will have  additional portable chemical screening devices available at ports of  entry and mail and express consignment facilities, along with  additional fixed chemical screening devices available in CBP  laboratories.   It also provides CBP with sufficient resources, personnel, and  facilities, including scientists available at all hours, to interpret  screening test results from the field and authorizes, based upon  professional expertise, the appropriation of $9 million for hundreds of  new screening devices, laboratory equipment, facilities, and personnel  for support during all operational hours.   Combined, the additional chemical screening devices, scientists, and  other resources will help safeguard CBP field personnel from exposure  to fentanyl and other deadly synthetic opioids and narcotics and  prevent their unlawful importation.   As an EMT and former Federal drug prosecutor, I have seen firsthand  the devastating impact of addiction in our communities and understand  the increased danger added by synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Illicit  fentanyl being trafficked into the United States poses a continued  threat to the American people.   By passing this legislation, this body can follow through on its  promise to the American people and align our policy with the  President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid  Crisis, which has prioritized regulating the flow of fentanyl in its  interim report.   I urge all of my bipartisan Members of this House to join me in  supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. If the  gentlewoman from California has no other speakers, I am prepared to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 2142, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
