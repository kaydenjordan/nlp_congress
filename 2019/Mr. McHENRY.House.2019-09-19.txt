 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to first start by taking just a few minutes  to recognize a dear friend of mine, a member of the Financial Services  Committee, Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin.   Sean has been a good friend of mine since the very beginning of when  he started running for Congress, and I have had the pleasure of serving  with Mr. Duffy since he came to Congress in 2011.   As we say on the committee, known for his punctuality, it is kind of  amazing that he is here now. This might be the first time he has been  on time in all his 9 years of service in the House.   Sean has been a huge asset for the Financial Services Committee and  his constituents in the Seventh District of Wisconsin. He has worked on  national issues of importance, like flood insurance; large issues, like  international regulation of insurance agreements; as well as important,  smaller issues that are very important to people's lives, like mold and  lead-based paint remediation and providing better options for residents  of public and assisted living or assisted housing. He has been a great  advocate for his constituents, and I have been honored to work with him  as a colleague.   He has led three separate subcommittees on the Financial Services  Committee. He has had a meaningful impact on public policy. He has  developed meaningful relationships on both sides of the aisle in this  institution and has been willing to have some of the bigger debates on  policy that, perhaps, were divided in the party. He has always done so  with a joyful heart and a fantastic capacity for communicating.   At some points, to the dismay of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle, including the chairwoman of the committee, the debate can  sometimes get rough-and-tumble, but he always does it with a smile  on his face; and you can have a conversation with him afterwards, no  matter how difficult or challenging the conversation or debate.    While Sean has been a colleague, I have counted him as an adviser and  a friend and somebody I knew I could talk to even in the toughest of  times.  [[Page H7798]]    Sean is leaving because of his family. He has made a decision that it  is the right thing for his family, to depart our institution and our  schedule and the challenges of public life at this time in his family  life. He has got a beautiful family, some of whom are here behind me  today.   So we wish Sean and Rachel Duffy the best, and we will keep them,  certainly, in our thoughts, but forever in our prayers and in our  hearts.   I thank Sean so much for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 239, the Christa McAuliffe  Commemorative Coin Act of 2019.   I would like to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the  dean of the Michigan delegation, who has the bill here in the House,  H.R. 500, and who has gathered more than 309 cosponsors on this bill to  see it across the line.   We know the story of Christa McAuliffe. In fact, one of my first  memories of understanding what NASA did was to see the tragedy of the  loss of the shuttle and the human tragedy of somebody who is such a  dedicated public servant, dedicated to her classroom, to teaching, but,  also, her willingness to put herself on the line to be a greater  advocate for teaching and for education.   Christa McAuliffe had a meaningful impact on people's lives, and this  is a representation of that. It is a fantastic undertaking that we have  had here today. Due to the great work of Congressman Upton, we have  wide, bipartisan support for this important and meaningful act before  us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if I may inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the dean of the Michigan  delegation.  [[Page H7799]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   It is amazing how a teacher can touch lives. Christa McAuliffe  touched lives, not just for the students in her classroom, not just in  her community, but by what she means to the American people and how her  contribution is marked in the American psyche of what teachers are and  what they represent in such a significant way.   The Challenger tragedy was a massive loss for us as Americans in  terms of human life, certainly. But it is marked in American history,  and it is marked in American history in a very special way and has a  quite different feel because of Christa McAuliffe.   The work put in to bring a coin bill to the floor is extraordinary,  and I have to say this: The challenge to get a coin bill to the House  floor is enormous under our rules. Under a bipartisan understanding, we  have a massive hurdle in order to get here. It is not a normal process  to bring a bill to the floor. It is an onerous and difficult one. That  is why we have so few bills to strike new coins that come across the  House floor and get enacted into law. It is a proper thing to make it  onerous and difficult because, when it happens, it shows what we are  trying to represent with that coin, whether it is a person, a  community, an action, that what they did was so pure, so perfectly  American, and that what they did, that person, that group, what they  did should be noted in American history and should be noted in a  meaningful way, a meaningful enough way that it was how the Romans  marked who their emperors were.   This is our way of saying in a very special way that Christa  McAuliffe was a wonderfully special human being who made a significant  mark as an American.   I thank Congressman Upton for the massive amount of passionate work  that he put in to make this day possible. I thank my colleagues across  the aisle for this process and for the outcome that we have here today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise to speak on H.R. 3625, the PCAOB Whistleblower Protection Act.  I thank the Congresswoman from Texas for her leadership on this bill  and for her work on the committee.   Madam Speaker, businesses have a self-interest in detecting and  eliminating illegal activity as swiftly as possible within their  organizations. As such, businesses, including audit firms and clients  of audit firms, generally strive to comply with the law because,  ultimately, violating the law hurts investors and, thereby, hurts their  business and hurts their reputation.   Violating the law is bad for business, right? It hurts the company's  reputation, its value. It keeps business partners away. It breeds  distrust in the marketplace. We know all of these things.   However, sometimes, businesses need someone to call out bad behavior  or illegal activity. Whistleblowers play an important role in rooting  out bad behavior that harms the markets, that harms Mr. and Mrs.  401(k), average, everyday investors, which most of us are.   Moreover, it is important to appropriately incentivize whistleblowers  to either report potentially unlawful activity internally or to  appropriate government authorities. That is why we have whistleblower  statutes. That is why this is a good piece of legislation.   To that end, I am glad to see that this bill, which will establish  rewards for certain whistleblowers whose tips lead to PCAOB--or  Peekaboo, as we call it on the Financial Services Committee--monetary  sanctions.   This builds on the structure of the SEC's whistleblower program in a  recent bill that we passed out of the House in the month of July that  protects internal whistleblowers as well.   Additionally, I want to note that the provision in this bill that  states that, to the maximum extent possible, the PCAOB shall coordinate  with the Office of the Whistleblower at the SEC in carrying out the law  under this bill.   The SEC whistleblower has been around for quite a while. They have  the good regard of both parties, I think, in terms of how they respond.  We want to make sure that experience is well coordinated with this new  whistleblower authority at PCAOB.   I hope that, where possible, the SEC's Office of the Whistleblower  can provide significant assistance to the PCAOB, if not handle all  these whistleblower claims itself. They have that type of experience. I  think it would be proper for that agency to do that and to ensure that  it is done in the most cost-effective manner for the taxpayer and for  the investors as well.   This legislation is good, in that it provides flexibility for that  best delivery system as the SEC and Peekaboo go about this.   Again, I thank my colleague from Texas for her hard work on this bill  and for bringing an important piece of legislation that is good for  taxpayers, good for investors, and really good for the stability of the  markets and the belief in the stability of the markets. I urge a  ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague from Texas-- though new to this legislative body, she has shown experience in how  she has legislated here--and the willingness of the Democrat majority  staff on the committee to work with my staff to ensure that we have a  bill that is functional and right and can get wide support, as it  should. So I thank the gentlewoman for this, which it may be her first  legislative undertaking through the committee, and I want to commend  her for the work that she has done.   I address the Chair in saying that, but I think it is important that  this body understands that there is good legislating that happens on  our committee, and bipartisan legislating.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the ranking member of the Investor  Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Subcommittee, and my  friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his comments.  Certainly, there is a diversity of thought among our colleagues on this  bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Whistleblowers provide an important function. We want to make sure  that there are legal constraints on this, obviously. The Securities and  Exchange Commission have shown themselves good actors in terms of  implementing the whistleblower law that we currently have on the books,  and I anticipate, with the capacity for implementation, that there  could be that like kind of coordination between PCAOB and the SEC in  order to implement this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3619, the Appraisal Fee  Transparency Act of 2019.   In June, the Financial Services Committee held a hearing on a variety  of issues relating to the appraisal process. The issue of appraisal  industry reform might not be an exciting headline, but honest,  educated, and, importantly, independent appraisals help ensure the  safety and soundness of mortgage lending.   We know how the last financial crisis happened, and it started with  mortgages, so it is really important that appraisals are accurate and  true.   As neutral parties, appraisers help determine the fair market value  of assets for both lenders and purchasers.                                time  1630    Yet, much of the current appraisal framework remains an antiquated,  confusing maze of overlapping and conflicting State and Federal rules.  These inefficiencies harm appraisal quality, lower competition, and  inhibit market innovation. Building a 21st century housing finance  system requires us to do better.   The bill we are considering today is a good first step in that reform  process. It makes the necessary improvements to the fee structure and  to the appraiser registry. These reforms will help increase  transparency and clarity for consumers in an already complex regulatory  scheme.   The bill also allows the Federal Appraisal Subcommittee to set up a  less arbitrary fee schedule for appraisal management companies. These  management companies are intermediaries lenders sometimes use to  provide certain appraisal-related services. This new schedule will help  increase competition and employment within the industry. Its proceeds  will be used to improve appraiser complaint investigations and  enforcement activities.   The bill would also, for the first time, allow trainees to be listed  on the subcommittee's national registry for appraisers. This will help  meet appraisal needs, as well as help those trainees receive the  valuable on-the-job experience they need to gain further accreditation.  That is just the nature of the apprenticeship process that the  appraisal industry has in order to get licensure in most States.   The bill also provides for greater transparency under the Real Estate  Settlement Procedures Act, or what we commonly call RESPA. If you have  ever had a mortgage, you understand what RESPA is. You may not  understand RESPA, but you know what it is, is probably the more  accurate way to say it. This is an important transparency measure for  the disclosure of  [[Page H7805]]  the fees to the management companies when one is used in a transaction.   Finally, the bill adds a representative from the Veterans  Administration to the current seven member Federal Appraisal  Subcommittee, along with HUD, the Fed, the OCC, FHFA, FDIC, NCUA, and  the CFPB. If you are listening at home, don't worry about the details  of it. It is basically every Federal regulator in Washington has a seat  at the board. We are now putting the VA on there because the VA  Administration does mortgages as well for veterans. So let's get them  all at the table and let's have them all communicate. That covers the  national mortgage market that we currently have. This is good  legislating. That is basically what I am saying.   I think it is a welcome thing to add veterans to the mix on the  subcommittee. They currently make up roughly 10 percent of mortgages  annually, so it is really important they have a seat at the board and a  seat at the table, especially, around this important issue.   Their input will help the subcommittee promote greater uniformity in  its supervisory role. Taken together, these reforms will help sort out  some of the antiquated, confusing, and overlapping appraisal rules.   This bill was reported out of the Financial Services Committee  unanimously. I commend its sponsor and cosponsor. Chairman Clay of the  Housing, Community Development and Insurance Subcommittee has done  great work. He will work with Republicans where he can, but he tries to  beat us on most days. But on this one, he worked with Ranking Member  Duffy in order to have this bipartisan bill before us today.   Representative Clay is a tough Democrat, who represents his State  well, and is a tough negotiator. What we have before us is a really  good bill because of the quality of legislating--not easy legislating,  but tough legislating--that Representative Clay is about on the  Financial Services Committee and here in Congress.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this meaningful reform, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Federal employees  impacted by the government shutdown and express my support for Federal  regulators and financial institutions supporting consumers in need of  assistance in the event there is a lapse in Federal funding.                                time  1645    We just passed a continuing resolution to keep the government open  earlier today. So the good news is, this fall does not look like storm  season for Federal employees, and, hopefully, the contents of this act  won't have to be used. I think that is a good thing. I think we can all  agree that is a good thing. On a bipartisan basis, we should agree that  it is a good thing.   Whether it is a missed credit card payment or an unexpected medical  expense, government shutdowns can leave Federal employees, contractors,  and other individuals facing economic hardship through no fault of  their own.   Madam Speaker, if you look at the government shutdowns under the  Carter administration, the Reagan administration, and the Clinton  administration, the lapse in funding impacted people's lives, and we  don't want Federal employees to be held hostage due to the inability of  Congress and the executive branch to come to terms on Federal funding.   H.R. 2290 requires Federal financial regulators to issue guidance  encouraging institutions to work with individuals impacted by a  government shutdown. It also requires the regulators to provide  Congress with a report analyzing the effectiveness of that guidance. It  is proper.   I remind my colleagues that guidance does not constitute a formal  rulemaking. Unlike a rule, guidance is nonbinding. This bill sets out  best practices for both regulators and financial institutions, and they  should take that guidance seriously.   I also want to reiterate that this legislation conveys no new  authority on Federal financial regulators. Let's make that clear. I  know that many financial institutions and financial regulators are  already implementing the best practices contemplated by this  legislation.   Six months or 7 months after the Federal Government shutdown, I think  we have already seen that the regulators have taken action.  Institutions have historically been cognizant of the needs of consumers  who find themselves in these types of unforeseen situations. In fact,  last fall, more than 100 banks took it upon themselves to offer loan  modifications, payment deadline extensions, payroll advances, or low-  or zero-interest rate loans, among other accommodations, to those  impacted by  [[Page H7807]]  the shutdown. Those are positive actions. We know that those positive  actions made a difference during that period of uncertainty.   Federal financial regulators have also played an important role in  ensuring fair treatment for consumers affected by a shutdown. In  January of this year, the FDIC, the OCC, the National Credit Union  Administration, the Federal Reserve, the CFPB, and the Conference of  State Bank Supervisors partnered to encourage institutions to work with  consumers who were negatively impacted. They took it upon themselves to  do that, and they had the authority to do so.   In a related financial institution letter, the FDIC encouraged all  supervised institutions to consider prudent arrangements that would  increase the potential for creditworthy borrowers to meet their  obligations.   While I agree with my colleagues across the aisle that we should  encourage banks to work proactively with consumers affected by a  shutdown, we must also encourage financial regulators to provide some  type of clarity as well. This bill ensures exactly that.   I think this bill is sufficient. It deals with the four walls of  governance and the data held within government, and I think it is a  good piece of legislation that codifies existing practices.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I think this legislation puts to rest the  need for the Financial Services Committee to legislate around the  government shutdown. I am glad we were able to put that to rest, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bill, H.R. 550, the Merchant  Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019.   For the last two Congresses, Congresswoman Susan Brooks from Indiana  has taken this measure on. We passed it out of the House last Congress.  It didn't make its way through the Senate.   Madam Speaker, I commend the hard work that my colleague Mrs. Brooks  put into legislating around this really important recognition of those  who served and fought valiantly in their own way during World War II.  So many lives were sacrificed by merchant mariners during World War II.   I thank my colleague Mrs. Brooks for her work to make this day  possible, and I thank my colleague Mr. Garamendi for his work this  Congress to take this across the line for a really nice, bipartisan  piece of legislation recognizing the unsung heroes of World War II.   In World War II, merchant mariners sailed across the Atlantic. They  traveled abroad, delivering precious cargo to support the war. In the  moment of most severe crisis for the United Kingdom, it was our  merchant mariners who fed the island nation of Great Britain. It was  our merchant mariners and our foodstuffs that fed Europe post-World War  II, as well.   It was our merchant mariners who risked their lives in treacherous  seas, before the concept of a convoy was invented in World War II, to  protect the lives at stake, cargo at stake, the ships  [[Page H7809]]  at stake, and to ensure a better opportunity to make it across from the  United States and Canada to Great Britain to save that island nation.                                time  1700    They were treacherous times, and the stakes of our actually providing  support for the Soviet Union in the worst point of the ravages that  they were suffering under Germany in their fight with Germany were  substantial as well. The icy seas of the north to bring cargo in to  save lives for our Soviet Allies during World War II were substantial,  and there are massive numbers of stories of the lives put at risk in  order to bring important food to save lives.   It is merchant mariners who were--we use the word ``bravery,'' but  when we think about somebody doing their job of hard labor to make a  ship go that is carrying cargo, we don't think of that as bravery. It  is fortitude, the will to keep doing something that is really  important, even against tough odds. It shows who merchant mariners are.  At sea today, the risks that they take in order to make our global  economy work is real. But during World War II, it was on a knife's  edge, and the number of lives that were lost was extraordinary.   By one statistic, 1 out of every 26 merchant mariners was killed  during that time period of World War II. Their ships sailed from port  to port, and many never reached their final destination. Especially the  German Operation Drumbeat targeted these ships in transport in a  massive way, knowing that they were traveling mostly unarmed and  unescorted.   Just off the North Carolina coast, there are 80 cargo ships that were  targeted and 1,600 lives that were lost. That is just off one portion  of our East Coast.   There are stories of heroic acts by these folks who were just, in  peaceful times, doing a normal trade--an extraordinary trade, but a  normal trade--but at war were the number one target in that early stage  to break the will of the British and our support of them and then again  trying to snuff off the Soviet Union from supplies, food, and weaponry.   So this is a fantastic recognition of the important work that  merchant mariners provided, the vital work that they provided during  World War II, and a recognition of a trade, a craft, a skill, and the  hard work of those folks who did make the cargo go.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   Madam Speaker, on a personal note, on my team on the House Financial  Services Committee and when I was chief deputy whip of the House, I had  somebody work with me on my team named Phil Poe of Maryland.   Phil, out of college, was inspired by the stories of World War II  merchant mariners and inspired by a family member, as well, to get  licensed as a merchant mariner. He spent a little time as a merchant  mariner and then paid his way through graduate school as a merchant  mariner.   So I want to commend his willingness to serve, but I also want to  note that, for the Record, these stories of World War II merchant  mariners are having an impact generations later.   That inspirational story of the risks that they were willing to take,  plus the family connection and inspiration he heard from those stories,  have made a major difference for him. That work ethic that he developed  and learned on that ship really steeled him to do better in graduate  school, and by the time he came to the Hill, it was all easy compared  to what he had been through.                                time  1715    So these stories we hear from long ago of merchant mariners and their  sacrifice still have an impact today, and I am glad we have a  Congressional Gold Medal and legislative recognition around the  sacrifices that merchant mariners made during World War II.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption, and yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2613, the Advancing  Innovation to Assist Law Enforcement Act. I commend the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez), my colleague, for his work on this important  bipartisan legislation.   This--if I am not mistaken--is the gentleman's first piece of  legislation coming out of the Committee on Financial Services here on  the House floor, and it is quite a good thing. His constituents should  know, Madam Speaker, about the type of legislating that he is trying to  achieve.   The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, what we commonly call  FinCen, is tasked with receiving and maintaining financial transaction  data. This includes analyzing and disseminating data for law  enforcement purposes to safeguard the financial system from illicit  use, to combat money laundering, and promote national security. If you  think terrorism financing, if you think about laundering drug money,  this is the agency that does it. In short, FinCen is in the data  business.   This bill directs FinCen to carry out a study on the implementation  of artificial intelligence and digital identity technology to ensure  that FinCen is equipped with all the tools it needs to thwart bad  actors and protect the financial system.   And so this takes, in many respects, Congressman Gonzalez' broad  background and brings that experience here to the legislative body and  to this important law enforcement agency. This legislation takes the  first step to revolutionize the way law enforcement works to locate and  stop criminal activity in the financial services industry, including  potential terrorist threats using artificial intelligence, blockchain,  and other emerging technologies.   This a FinTech bill. This is a technology bill. I urge my colleagues  to support this measure. This bill ensures that FinCen is innovating  alongside industry and alongside other Federal agencies and law  enforcement agencies. And it drives them to utilize the most advanced  computing and advanced technology available anywhere in the world in  the best practices when it comes to data analysis and use.   The use of new technologies will always help streamline government  operations, allowing FinCen to move quicker in the face of emerging  threats.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I want to  commend the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez), my colleague, for his  hard work on this bipartisan bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez), my colleague and author of the  bill.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close if the majority  has no more speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1396, the Hidden Figures  Congressional Gold Medal Act. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Johnson) for her work on this important bipartisan legislation.   This bill awards a Congressional Gold Medal to Katherine Johnson, Dr.  Christine Darden, and posthumously, to Dorothy Vaughan and Mary  Jackson, to honor all the women who contributed to NASA's successful  race to space.                                time  1730    These women worked tirelessly to send a man to space, despite being  segregated in workrooms, bathrooms, and cafeterias in the workspace of  NASA.   They provided invaluable work, as has been outlined in a very  popular, well-received, highly regarded movie.   Without their effort, it is possible we may not have been able to  witness John Glenn orbit the Earth, Apollo 11's flight to the Moon, or  watch the astronauts of Apollo 13 return safely to Earth and land in  the South Pacific Ocean.   In fact, Madam Speaker, when Apollo 13's James Lovell and John  Swigert--who is actually here in the National Statuary Hall collection,  a statue from his home State--when they famously announced, ``Houston,  we've got a problem,'' when that message reached mission control, it  was Katherine Johnson who crunched the numbers to get our folks home.   This was at a time when everything was going wrong, and she had a  cool head and an incredibly brilliant mind to put this complex data  together. This is not hoping the computer spits out the right  information. This is the long work that we all dreaded as kids when it  was simple math, and this was of the longest, most complex nature, the  type of math that they had to do very quickly.   These women deserve the Congressional Gold Medal. They deserve this  recognition.   Madam Speaker, I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to pass  this piece of legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Greg LeMond Congressional  Gold Medal Act.   First, I thank my colleague from California (Mr. Thompson) for his  work on this important, bipartisan legislation.   I support the Greg LeMond Congressional Gold Medal Act. I support it  because Greg LeMond is a legend, one of the cycling world's best, and  the only American ever to officially win the Tour de France.   When fans of cycling think of LeMond, they think of firsts. In 1983,  LeMond was the first American to win an elite world road championship.  In 1984, LeMond was the first cyclist to sign a million-dollar  contract. In 1986, he was the first American to win the Tour de France.   Finally, in 1989, he was the first cyclist to appear on the cover of  Sports Illustrated as Sportsman of the Year.   Madam Speaker, Greg ``LeMonster'' LeMond recovered from a near-fatal  hunting accident in 1987 to go on to win two more Tours de France. He  won those two with buckshot that was lodged in the lining of his heart.   What an incredible athlete. What an incredible physical specimen,  what a tenacious spirit, and what an icon that is a fantastic  representation for our children to understand that you can be an elite  athlete and do so abiding by the normal human constraints by which we  are all bound.   Doing it with intensity, with training, with focus, with practice,  and with such a great deal of success over his amazing career, Greg  LeMond is an icon in the sports world and is deserving of the  Congressional Gold Medal. He represents some of the finest qualities  that we have as Americans.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1830, the National Purple  Heart Hall of Honor Commemorative Coin Act.   I would like to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick  Maloney) for his work on this important bipartisan legislation. I thank  him for his hard work and sincere advocacy for Purple Heart, those that  our Nation honors with the Purple Heart and who have sacrificed to  honor us as a nation.   The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is a New York State facility  that is dedicated to collecting, preserving, and sharing the stories of  all Purple Heart recipients from all branches of service and across all  conflicts.   Enrollments at the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor are voluntary  and are made by Purple Heart recipients, their families or friends.  Currently, there are 1,095 Purple Heart recipients enrolled from the  great State of North Carolina, representing World War I, World War II,  Korea, Vietnam, Somalia, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation  Iraqi Freedom.   These courageous men and women are recognized by the National Purple  Heart Hall of Honor because, surprisingly, there is no comprehensive  list of recipients maintained by the Federal Government. That is a  separate issue we can deal with at a separate time.   But I think it is important, the work that Congressman Maloney has  taken upon himself and the enormous labor it takes to get a bill like  this to the House floor.   In fact, the only award for which there is no list is the Medal of  Honor.   Madam Speaker, the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is an  organization that deserves the recognition and the commemorative coin  that this bill will strike. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  It is another good piece of bipartisan legislation.   Again, I want to commend the author of the legislation, Mr. Maloney,  for his hard work and advocacy on behalf of those who have received the  Purple Heart.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
