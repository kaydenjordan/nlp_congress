 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1063) to amend title 44, United States Code, to  require information on contributors to Presidential library fundraising  organizations, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1063         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts       otherwise authorized.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Cummings and Representative Meadows for  sponsoring this legislation.   Former Representative  John Duncan from Tennessee first sponsored a  bill to improve Presidential libraries 19 years ago. A bill identical  to the one before us passed the House in the last Congress with  bipartisan support. I hope we now can finally get this important reform  enacted.   The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act would make the process  for building Presidential libraries more transparent. Presidential  libraries have become increasingly expensive as they have evolved into  multipurpose centers.   The costs for building a Presidential library must come from private  funding, and modern libraries cost millions--in some cases, hundreds of  millions--of dollars to build.   The George W. Bush Presidential Center, for example, cost an  estimated $250 million to build, and President Bush raised  approximately $500 million for the building and an endowment for his  library, museum, and institute.   Although President Obama has raised hundreds of millions of dollars  for his Presidential library, he has voluntarily disclosed the names of  those who have donated $200 or more.   We should not, however, rely on such voluntary disclosures. Under  current law, there is no requirement to disclose the identities of  those who donate to a Presidential library, and a President, while  still in office, is able to raise an unlimited amount from private  donations.   There is no limitation on who can donate to a sitting President for a  Presidential library, or how much they can donate, and their identities  remain secret.   This bill would require organizations that raise money to build  Presidential libraries to disclose the identity of any individual who  donates more than $200. The National Archives and Records  Administration would then be required to post the donation information  online.   The bill would also create criminal penalties for individuals who  report false information on donations and for fundraising organizations  that omit donation information.   A group of 15 good government organizations, including Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the Sunlight Foundation,  sent a letter last Congress urging the House to support this bill.   Here is what they wrote: ``Under the current opaque system,  Presidents raise funds privately to establish their Presidential  libraries. These efforts, which often begin long before they leave  office, are unregulated and undisclosed, creating opportunities for,  and/or the appearance of, influence peddling. Improved transparency  would help reduce the appearance of impropriety and help deter  inappropriate behavior.''   This bill had bipartisan support and passed the House last Congress  without opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member of this body to support this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1063, as  amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1065) to provide for a study on the use of social  media in security clearance investigations.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1065         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Social Media Use in       Clearance Investigations Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. STUDY ON USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN SECURITY CLEARANCE                     INVESTIGATIONS.         Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget       shall submit to Congress a report on the examination of       social media activity during security clearance       investigations, including--        (1) the current use of publicly available social media in       security clearance background investigations;        (2) any legal impediments to examining publicly available       social media activity, and whether those impediments are       statutory or regulatory in nature;        (3) the results of any pilot programs to incorporate social       media checks in such investigations, including the       effectiveness and cost of such programs;        (4) options for widespread implementation of the       examination of social media activity during such       investigations; and        (5) estimates on the cost for such options as part of--        (A) all Top Secret investigations; or        (B) all Secret and Top Secret investigations.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressmen Lynch and Hice for their work on  this bill. This bill would require the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget to issue a report to Congress on the use of  social media checks in background investigations for security  clearances.   In recent years, a number of agencies have begun pilot programs to  help develop the best methods for incorporating social media into  background checks. For example, the Army initiated a pilot program that  found that, while checking social media is a valuable tool, it can be  costly and may raise legal issues.   This bill would require that OMB conducts a comprehensive study on  these issues and report back to Congress. This one-time report would  describe the current uses of social media postings for investigative  purposes and any legal concerns or impediments to their use.   In addition, the report would summarize the results of any pilot  programs on the use of social media conducted to date and provide cost  estimates for implementing their widespread use in the background  investigation process.   This report would greatly assist Congress in determining whether  further legislative action is needed when it comes to the Federal  Government's use of social media in background investigations. An  identical measure was approved by the House last year without  opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member of this body to support this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).    Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1065,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1064) to amend title 5, United States Code, to  allow whistleblowers to disclose information to certain recipients, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1064         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. RECIPIENTS OF WHISTLEBLOWER DISCLOSURES.         Section 2302(b)(8)(B) of title 5, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``or to the Inspector'' and all that       follows through ``such disclosures'' and inserting ``the       Inspector General of an agency, a supervisor in the       employee's direct chain of command up to and including the       head of the employing agency, or to an employee designated by       any of the aforementioned individuals for the purpose of       receiving such disclosures''.       SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I introduced this bill, along with the distinguished Congressman from  North Carolina, Mr. Mark Meadows, to make it easier for whistleblowers  to disclose wrongdoing. This bill would protect whistleblowers who  report waste, fraud, or abuse, to their supervisors at a government  agency.   Under current law, an employee would not be protected from  retaliation for disclosing information to a supervisor, even if the  employee reasonably believes it is necessary to expose a violation of a  law, rule, or regulation. A whistleblower is currently only protected  by law if they make their disclosures to the Office of Special Counsel,  an Inspector General, Congress, the head of the whistleblower's agency,  or an employee designated by the head of the agency.   Under this bill, an employee who is covered by the Whistleblower  Protection Act could report alleged misconduct to any supervisor in  their direct chain of command. This sensible change in law would allow  employees to provide evidence of wrongdoing to a supervisor instead of  requiring employees to report all the way up to the head of an agency  or an inspector general.   This change in the law would protect employees who use the proper  channels at their agency to report waste, fraud, and abuse. Employees  in the intelligence community already have these whistleblower  protections as a result of a Presidential policy directive issued in  2012. This bill would ensure that all federal employees have the same  protections as whistleblowers in the intelligence community.   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1064, as  amended, and I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 995) to amend chapter 3 of title 5, United States  Code, to require the publication of settlement agreements, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 995         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Settlement Agreement       Information Database Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. INFORMATION REGARDING SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS ENTERED                     INTO BY FEDERAL AGENCIES.         (a) Requirements for Settlement Agreements.--Chapter 3 of       title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end       the following new section:       ``Sec. 307.

SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I support this commonsense measure. The Settlement Agreement  Information Database Act would create a database of settlement  agreements entered into by Federal agencies that relate to alleged  violations of Federal, civil or criminal law.   The Office of Management and Budget would manage this database and  set deadlines for submission. The heads of executive agencies would be  required to submit details about the types of settlement agreements,  the parties involved in the settlements, specific violations, and the  dates on which the settlement agreements were agreed to.   The information about the settlement agreements would remain public  until 5 years after the termination of the agreements. The information  in the agreements would remain subject to the Freedom of Information  Act, but if the head of the agency decided to keep an entire agreement  confidential, he or she would be required to provide an explanation of  that action.   This bill would improve the transparency surrounding settlement  agreements which, in the past, have been difficult for the public to  access.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  distinguished gentlemen from Alabama and from North Carolina for their  congratulations and in sharing my excitement over the passage of my  first bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 995, as amended, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1079) to require the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget to issue guidance on electronic consent forms,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1079         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Creating Advanced       Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents Act of       2019'' or the ``CASES Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) congressional offices provide crucial services to       constituents by acting as a liaison between the constituents       and the respective agencies;        (2) this includes assisting constituents by making       inquiries and working toward resolutions on behalf of the       constituent with the respective agencies; and        (3) this process should be simplified through the creation       of electronic forms that may be submitted under section 552a       of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the       Privacy Act), thus modernizing the process for constituents       and improving access and efficiency of Government services       and agencies in order to expedite the resolution of the       problem for which constituents sought help.       SEC. 3. OMB GUIDANCE ON ELECTRONIC CONSENT AND ACCESS FORMS.         (a) Guidance.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Director shall issue guidance that       does the following:        (1) Requires each agency to accept electronic identity       proofing and authentication processes for the purposes of       allowing an individual to provide prior written consent for       the disclosure of the individual's records under section       552a(b) of title 5, United States Code, or for individual       access to records under section 552a(d) of such title.        (2) Creates a template for electronic consent and access       forms and requires each agency to post the template on the       agency website and to accept the forms from any individual       properly identity proofed and authenticated in accordance       with paragraph (1) for the purpose of authorizing disclosure       of the individual's records under section 552a(b) of title 5,       United States Code, or for individual access to records under       section 552a(d) of such title.        (3) Requires each agency to accept the electronic consent       and access forms described in paragraph (2) from any       individual properly identity proofed and authenticated in       accordance with paragraph (1) for the purpose of authorizing       disclosure of the individual's records to another entity,       including a congressional office, in accordance with section       552a(b) of title 5, United States Code, or for individual       access to records under section 552a(d).        (b) Agency Compliance.--Each agency shall comply with the       guidance issued pursuant to subsection (a) not later than 1       year after the date on which such guidance is issued.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Agency; individual; record.--The terms ``agency'',       ``individual'', and ``record'' have the meanings given those       terms in section 552a(a) of title 5, United States Code.        (2) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of       the Office of Management and Budget.       SEC. 4. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to carry out the       requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried       out using amounts otherwise authorized.       SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, the CASES for Constituents Act,  introduced by Representatives Garret Graves and Joe Kennedy. This bill  would modernize the way Federal agencies process Privacy Act waivers  and make it easier for Members of Congress to help constituents get  assistance from Federal agencies.   Our constituents are required to provide Federal agencies with  written consent before our offices can obtain information from the  agency on their behalf. Some agencies have outdated policies and still  require these consent  [[Page H1503]]  forms to be mailed or faxed, which can be next to impossible in certain  circumstances, such as after a major storm or other natural disaster.   Under this bill, the Office of Management and Budget would be  required to create a template for electronic consent forms and issue  guidance to agencies requiring them to accept such forms.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the bipartisan way in which this bill was  developed, and I thank Representatives Graves and Kennedy for their  diligent efforts to address this problem.   This is a good bipartisan bill, and I urge my colleagues to support  it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will just note for the record  that I believe faxes may or may not have ended their usefulness before  I was born.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Kennedy).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to join my  colleague in thanking the staff. I was handheld through this entire  process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1079, as amended, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
