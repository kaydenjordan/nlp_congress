 Mr. President, I call up my motion to instruct, which  is at the desk.    Mr. President, this motion would establish an inspector  general at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.   As we have seen over the past several years, inspectors general are a  key way that Congress conducts oversight over our Federal Government.  Through these independent watchdogs, we prevent waste, fraud, and  abuse, increasing transparency while ensuring Federal Agencies remain  accountable to the American people. It is a model that most of the  Federal bureaucracy has adopted because it works.   When it comes to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, it  remains an outlier--one of the only Cabinet-level Agencies without this  key oversight tool. An Agency led by a Senate-confirmed appointee,  tasked with carrying out decisions affecting every worker, business,  and consumer in this country, is currently operating without one of the  most effective guardrails we have against overreach. Just a few years  ago, Congress saw how two negotiators for USMCA were using their  positions to solicit consulting work on the regulations they had  written. We saw how the Agency's opaque tariff exclusion process was  beset by inconsistent decision making and political favoritism.   This is an amendment that has been sponsored by over 53 Senators,  Republicans and Democrats alike. It passed in USICA originally with a  91-to-4 vote. I urge my colleagues to support it. I am happy to take a  voice vote.                                Vote on Motion     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
