 Mr. Speaker, I am a single mom. When I ran for Congress  last year, I spent thousands and thousands of dollars on childcare.   Running for Federal office requires 60- to 90-hour workweeks, and I  worked every single day, including every single weekend. I also worked  challenging hours, normally starting my day at 6:45 a.m. and ending  with campaign events stretching late into the evenings.   I juggled dozens and dozens of childcare providers for nearly 2  years, without whom I would never have made it to Congress.   I have three children, Betsy, who is 7; Paul, who is 10; and Luke,  who is 13. Leaving them alone while I was on the campaign trail was not  an option. Bringing them along on the campaign trail was often  impossible or inappropriate and sometimes could even have been  dangerous for them.   For the past two centuries, Congress has written many, many laws  about what women may and may not do. But until this year, women's  representation in Congress was less than 20 percent. With the election  of my historic class, we hit 23.4 percent--102 women.   But, Mr. Speaker, that number is still very low. There are even fewer  moms in Congress and even fewer single moms, as in nobody but me. A  major barrier to women running for elected office is their inability to  afford the amount or type of childcare needed in a campaign.   That is why I worked to include language in H.R. 1, the For the  People Act, and introduced an identical standalone bill, the Help  America Run Act. It explicitly allows candidates for Federal office to  use campaign contributions to pay for childcare.  [[Page H2508]]    Right now, candidates can use campaign funds for a whole range of  expenses, from pizza for exhausted staff to cybersecurity for digital  devices, but the law does not make it clear that childcare is among  those allowed expenses.   Like so many laws, there is an assumption of a female caregiver  behind every male elected official. In part because of that, moms who  continue to shoulder the majority of childcare responsibilities also  struggle to run for Congress.   Until women are fully and equally present in Congress, women's  perspectives will continue to be underrepresented. The result is a  weaker democracy for the people.   Mr. Speaker, I very much look forward to the enactment of H.R. 1 and  the Help America Run Act.                            ____________________
