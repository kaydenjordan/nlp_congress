 Mr. President, we commend Senator Hatch for his efforts  on this most important bill. We would like to ask for confirmation on a  question that will be of considerable importance to millions of seniors  housing residents, including those living in assisted living and memory  care residences and in continuing care retirement communities, CCRCs.   As you know, capital for seniors housing, including assisted living  and memory care residences and CCRCs, essentially comes from the same  lending sources that fund other types of real estate. HUD, Fannie Mae,  Freddie Mac, and commercial banks finance seniors housing through their  respective housing related programs. Seniors housing competes with  other real estate based investments for both equity and debt and it is  critical that our tax law treat these seniors housing units in a manner  that is comparable to other housing.   Provisions relating to the deduction for business interest and to the  deduction for depreciation in the bill include rules governing a ``real  property trade or business,'' as that term is currently defined in the  tax law. Under these rules, the conferees stated that they intended  that a real property operation or a real property management trade or  business includes the operation or management of a lodging facility. We  would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Committee on  Finance if he agrees with us that the operation or management of  residential rental property housing the elderly, such as an assisted  living residential facility, memory care residence, or a continuing  care retirement community, are not excluded from the definition of a  ``real property trade or business'' merely because they provide  necessary supplemental assistive services that meet the needs of aging  seniors.
