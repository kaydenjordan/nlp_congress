 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership  on the very important elements of the rule that will be brought to the  floor today. I thank him, and I thank all the members of the Rules  Committee. I particularly want to acknowledge the leadership of  Chairman  Jim McGovern for his leadership in bringing so much  [[Page H5985]]  policy to bear in this one rule as we proceed with the week's  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in what is a momentous week for our House  Democratic majority as we carry on our work to defend Americans'  health, security, and freedom.   The rule includes five pieces of landmark legislation, which the  gentleman, Mr. Morelle, has very clearly explained. I thank him and Mr.  McGovern for their skilled leadership in assembling this rule and  steering this crucial legislation to the floor.   First, this week we will have our version of the NDAA. It supports  our Nation's servicemen and servicewomen, it strengthens our national  security, and promotes national leadership in the global arena.    Our majority is delivering new pay raises for heroic men and women in  uniform, while securing more investments in next-generation defense  technology to keep us strong and qualitatively superior.   We are strengthening the security of DOD supply chains, while  advancing new and fundamental research and development at HBCUs and  MSIs.   We are further supporting the Ukrainian people in their fight for  democracy with $1 billion in additional security assistance.   I salute Chairman Adam Smith and the Armed Services Committee for  their persistent patriotic leadership in assembling this legislation,  which will help ensure that Americans are safe and our democracy is  secure.   Again, when we are talking about our security, we have to talk about  our veterans. As we have said, we promised them when they fight for us,  we will protect them when they come home. This bill, the PACT Act,  takes another monumental step to care for our brave men and women in  uniform--who risked their lives to fight the enemy, but now face the  deadly threat of exposure to dangerous toxins.   The legislation in this bill, I believe, will be strongly bipartisan,  deliver access to VA healthcare to millions of veterans suffering from  dangerous diseases caused by their exposures.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Mark Takano for making and addressing  toxic exposure as a top priority in Congress--the PACT Act.   Next, the Active Shooter Alert Act, which the gentleman from New York  very clearly spelled out. We will pass the Active Shooter Alert Act-- Mr. Morelle described it very well--and I agree, it is a step, and we  must have what he said he supports, and I do, too--the ban on assault  weapons and other lethality.   This Federal legislation that we are doing today will quickly warn  communities when a gunman opens fire. It is a commonsense, lifesaving  measure widely supported by law enforcement.   Let us recognize Congressman   David Cicilline, a longtime champion  in the fight against gun violence, for spearheading this legislation,  and also being the author of the assault weapons ban.   The fourth and fifth bills that our Democratic majority will pass  this week take strong action to defend women's health and freedom.   Our Caucus has been hard at work assembling a robust and resolute  legislative response to the Supreme Court's assault on reproductive  rights. We passed this legislation before, the WHPA, the Women's Health  Protection Act, which will enshrine the essential protections of Roe v.  Wade as the law of the land.   And with our Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act, we  will reaffirm the constitutional right to travel and have access to the  abortion pill.   Let us salute Congresswoman Judy Chu for her leadership. We passed  this bill in the fall and we need to pass it again. We thank  Congresswomen Fletcher and Strickland and Congressman Raskin for their  tireless, determined leadership on the Ensuring Women's Right to  Reproductive Freedom Act.   Madam Speaker, this legislation that the House Democrats will pass  this week is the latest in our work to defend Americans' health,  security, and freedom. Our majority will never relent in this fight-- now and in the future.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong ``yes'' vote on the rule today and  ``yes'' votes on the five bills that we are considering in the days  ahead.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his leadership as chair of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee. I am grateful for the bipartisan support that the bill is  receiving here.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the landmark  Honoring our PACT Act. As you know, PACT stands for Promise to Address  Comprehensive Toxics Act, now named after Sergeant First Class Heath  Robinson. I am going to talk about him in a moment.   This bipartisan legislation honors our duty to deliver healthcare  that millions of veterans need and that they have certainly earned.  This is the second time the House has voted on this important bill, and  we are proud that after the Senate passes this version, we will finally  send it to the President to be signed into law.   For their relentless leadership on this legislation, let me salute  Chairman Mark Takano and his ranking member as well who made addressing  toxic exposure a top priority in this Congress; Congressman Raul Ruiz,  whose experience as a physician informed a key provision of this bill  establishing presumption of exposure; and Congresswoman Elaine Luria, a  Navy veteran who authored a provision expanding health benefits to  veterans exposed to burn pits.   Also included in this legislation--and I am so pleased about it--is  legislation by Congressman Matt Cartwright, author of the Camp Lejeune  Justice Act, to allow veterans or their loved ones to seek damages  related to injuries incurred while serving at Camp Lejeune.   We have had many people come from the area. The legislators from  North Carolina,   David Price and others, have been relentless in their  pursuit of this legislation. Families would come here and tell their  stories of their loved ones' service at Camp Lejeune where the water  supply was causing serious health problems not only for the  servicemember, which would be horrible enough, but for their family  members as well. This is corrected in this legislation and is a very  important improvement.   From the deserts of Iraq to the mountains of Afghanistan and on the  bases and military theaters around the world, a generation of  courageous Americans have donned the Stars and Stripes to protect our  freedom. These heroes have put their lives on the line to fight the  enemy. Yet, tragically, many of them have confronted another deadly  threat: exposure to burn pits and toxins which have taken a severe toll  on their health.   Make no mistake: burn pit exposures are pervasive. Eighty-six percent  of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans report having been exposed to  these toxic fumes. I don't want to go into what is in these pits. It is  so disgusting.   They are deadly. The VA has seen over a 60 percent increase in rates  of cancers tied to toxic exposure in the last 20 years. But when these  veterans come home, they are forced into a convoluted claims process  which cruelly saddles them with the burden of proof, and nearly three- quarters of burn pit-related claims are denied. Think of the injustice  of that.   Tragically, this problem is not new to our Nation. Many veterans of  the Vietnam war were forced to wait four long decades before their  exposure to Agent Orange was recognized and they could claim benefits.  This was, of course, addressed with the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Act  that was passed by the Congress in 2019. Some Agent Orange provisions  have been in subsequent NDAA legislation.   I know this issue well. Before I was in Congress, I was participating  in sit-ins with hunger strikes for Vietnam vets in the early eighties.  More than one time we were joined by Dick Gregory who had experience in  hunger strikes for civil rights reasons, and he was instructing the  veterans on how to hydrate, et cetera, so that they could survive the  hunger strikes hopefully in time to make a difference. But it took  decades. We cannot and will not let that happen to another generation.   There are potentially up to 3.5 million veterans deployed after the  attacks of September 11--3.5 million deployed since September 11--who  may have been exposed to toxic fumes and substances, and we must act  now to save lives.   The PACT Act is a comprehensive bill--others have discussed what it  does--that meets the challenge of toxic exposures for veterans in three  ways. First, it expands access to VA healthcare to post-9/11 combat  veterans exposed to toxins. Second, it grants presumptions of exposure  for veterans with rare cancers, COPD, and other debilitating diseases.  Third, it creates a permanent, streamlined process to ensure that  future Secretaries will review and approve new exposure swiftly.  [[Page H6023]]    Why do we have these burn pits?   We always keep saying here that on the battlefield we leave no  soldier behind and when they come home, we leave no veteran behind. And  yet, they come home with hidden injuries--whether they are  psychological or exposures to a burn pit--the consequences of which do  not show up for a while.   We have spent more than $6 trillion recruiting, training, and  deploying our servicemembers overseas during the last 20 years. But  let's be clear: This is only part of the price tag. When we send our  troops into conflict, we have to understand that we are responsible for  the consequences. Burn pit exposure is one of them. Toxic exposures are  a cost of war, and we must treat it as such. This is not a question of  dollars. It is a matter of values.   In all of the Congress' work for veterans, it is imperative that  veterans' groups, our veterans, their families, and the veterans  service organizations, the VSOs, are not only at the table, but they  are also leading the way. Mr. Takano has been a leader at that table  for years.   The overwhelming support of VSOs, especially a group now called Burn  Pits 360, was absolutely crucial to crafting this bill, steering it  through the legislative process, and securing its passage in the House  today.   I have quoted Lincoln over and over again. Lincoln said: ``Public  sentiment is everything. With it, nothing can fail; against it, nothing  can succeed.''   Well, our veterans caused public sentiment to be aroused to such a  point that here we are getting this done. They enlisted Jon Stewart and  John Feal, two people who had been there with us on the 9/11 health  benefits for people exposed at the time of 9/11. And they had been real  champions in the public visibility of this issue; not only to help  mobilize support for us to pass it, but to give hope to people who have  been affected to know that there is a chance that this can be  accomplished.   So I thank Jon Stewart, and I thank John Feal.   At the same time, it is with great pride and patriotism that the PACT  Act has strong bipartisan and bicameral support worthy of our heroic  veterans. This Congress is also grateful to Secretary McDonough, the  VA, and the entire administration for their support.   Mr. Speaker, I thank President Biden for making this a priority in  his State of the Union Address, especially when he talked about his  beloved son, Beau.   Madam Speaker, since we passed the PACT Act, it has been renamed. It  has a new name of a veteran we lost from toxic exposure.   Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson was exposed to burn pits while  deployed to Kosovo and Iraq, and afterward he battled a rare, deadly  lung cancer. Sadly, he died in 2020 at just age 39, leaving behind his  wife and daughter. Today, in his memory, we redouble our efforts to  ensure tragic stories like his can never happen again. He is  representative of so many other stories and the toll that this has  taken.   Again, we say that when our troops go to war on the battlefield, we  leave no soldier behind. When they come home, we leave no veteran  behind. Our PACT Act is an historic victory for our veterans and for  their advocacy that honors that pledge now and for the future.   Madam Speaker, I urge a bipartisan vote on the Honoring our PACT Act.  I hope it will be almost unanimous. I look forward to seeing it swiftly  passed by the Senate and signed into law by the President.   Madam Speaker, again, I am grateful for the leadership of Mr. Takano.                                time  1445
