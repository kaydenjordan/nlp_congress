 Madam Speaker, I am against all forms of violence,  including violence against any one of the majority of Americans who  support abortion rights.   The statistics are absolutely clear. Since 1977, there have been 11  murders, 42 bombings, 196 arsons, 491 assaults, and thousands more  illegal attacks on people who support abortion rights.   Let's include everyone in here when we talk about no more violence.  We have to make sure that people who are pro-life and people who  support abortion rights--and we support life--are included in opposing  violence.    Madam Speaker, born alive has nothing to do with  abortion. Providers are already required, by law, to provide  appropriate medical care. Infanticide is murder.   What we heard earlier is just not true. It is a lie that should not  be repeated.   As our chairman has said, not only is it illegal to not care for a  born infant, but the law that you have provided on the Republican side  actually can create more harm. It requires immediately taking a  struggling baby to a hospital. That hospital could be hours away and  [[Page H185]]  could be detrimental to the life of that baby.   This is nothing more than a part of the effort to make abortion  illegal nationally in this country. I object, and I urge a ``no'' vote.
