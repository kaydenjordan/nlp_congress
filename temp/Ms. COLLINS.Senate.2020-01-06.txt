 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Native  Plant Species Pilot Program Act. I am pleased to be partnering with  Senator Cantwell on this initiative. Our bipartisan bill supports a new  pilot program at the National Park Service (NPS) to support the use of  native plants. This legislation also encourages the Park Service to  review existing data and study the cost-effectiveness of using native  plants.   Native plants are species found naturally in regions and can provide  valuable functions to our National Park System. Benefits range from  using less water and pesticides, purifying the air, and recharging  groundwater in wetlands. By using native species, the Park Service can  also improve habitat for wildlife and restore important species of  birds and butterflies to their natural habitat.   In Acadia National Park, native plants are an important part of the  ongoing conservation work. I commend Superintendent Kevin Schneider and  all those who work on these issues at the park for their work to  encourage the use of native plants. Acadia National Park protects more  than 900 plant species, including some that are globally, nationally,  and locally rare.   Native plants, however, face many threats such as non-native pests,  non-native plants, diseases, and a changing climate. Today, almost one  quarter of Acadia National Park's species are non-native to the park.  The tree species of Acadia, the red spruce, is projected to lose a  substantial amount of its habitat in coming decades as a result of  climate change. In addition, invasive pests, such as Emerald Ash Borer  and the hemlock woody adelgid are impacting northern forests, and the  emerald ash borer has already been identified in Maine.   This bill will ensure that we preserve Maine's cultural history and  natural heritage. Acadia's native plant communities includes many  iconic species such as the blueberry barrens near the mountain summits,  the towering white pines in older forests, and the cranberry bogs along  Northeast Creek that contribute to Maine's iconic landscape. Other  native plants in Maine are the wildflowers that bloom in August and  September, such as asters and goldenrods, helping to attract the more  than 3.5 million visitors a year to one of the seventh most-visited  national parks in the United States.   I am pleased to report that our bipartisan bill has earned the  support of the Garden Club of America, and I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation to help protect the natural landscapes at our  national parks and keep native plants thriving for years to come.   Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________
