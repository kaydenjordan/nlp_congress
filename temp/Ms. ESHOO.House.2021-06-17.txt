 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for recognizing me and  yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution to repeal the AUMF  resolution of 2002. Here we are, in 2021.   Mr. Speaker, I voted against that AUMF, and to this day, I believe it  produced one of the worst foreign policy disasters in U.S. history. It  was built on a lie; it claimed the lives of over 4,400 Americans and  countless Iraqi civilians; and it cost our Treasury trillions of  dollars.   The Iraq war ended 10 years ago, but this AUMF is still on the books.  It is a blank check, and we need to get rid of it. We run the risk that  administrations will misuse it to justify future military action and  directly undermine Congress' Article I war powers authority.   The House has voted three times to repeal this AUMF, and today, it is  time to pass it. Let us have a victory here on the floor--and celebrate  another victory that the Supreme Court has upheld the Affordable Care  Act.
