 Section 9:   ``The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States  now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by  the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight,  but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten  dollars for each person.''    Mr. Chairman, our Founding Fathers intended for us to  have a limited government. If they saw what we have today, they would  be appalled. Our government has gotten huge. It is out of control, and  an alphabet soup of government agencies and unelected bureaucrats are  writing the laws. They call them regulations, but they have the effect  of laws.   I am going to disagree with my friend and colleague from Tennessee,  any power these agencies have to write regulations was delegated to  Congress. We are pulling some of that power back, back to Congress,  back to people elected by the people; in fact, to where the Founding  Fathers put it in Article I of the Constitution.   That is why I am here today, to support the REINS Act. It says that  if an agency enacts a regulation that has an economic impact of more  than $100 million, that has to come back before Congress for a positive  vote before it takes effect.   Now, quite frankly, because the Constitution vests all of the  legislative power in Congress, I think every single regulation that one  of these agencies does should have to come back before Congress, but  the REINS Act is a great start.   Throughout President Obama's administration, a flood of regulations  has put extreme pressure and burdens on American job creators and  American families. Take, for example, the EPA's waters of the U.S.  rule. It is a power grab by the EPA attempting to regulate any body of  water on a private land basically that is any bigger than a bathtub. It  goes way beyond what the Clean Water Act says they can do.   Using its new interpretation of WOTUS, the EPA has full authority to  bully land-owning American citizens like Wyoming rancher Andy Johnson  who got a permit from the State and local government to build a stock  pond so his cattle could have something to drink. Well, guess what, the  EPA said, nope. They came in after the fact and said: if you don't take  that out, we are going to hit you with $37,500 a day in fines. Finally,  after drawn-out litigation, the EPA was slapped back and Johnson's $16  million in fines was erased.   This is just one of the many examples of the huge power grab these  Federal agencies are doing.   We need people who are elected and answerable to the American people  writing the laws, not unelected bureaucrats. That is why we need the  REINS Act, and that is why we need to restore the constitutional power  granted to this body in Article I. The REINS Act is a great start, and  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.
