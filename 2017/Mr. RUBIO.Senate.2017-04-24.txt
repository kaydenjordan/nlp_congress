 Mr. President, as a part of my office's ``Expression NOT  Oppression'' initiative, I come to the floor today to highlight once  again both a good news story with regard to human rights and a  continuing challenge.   First let me begin by highlighting the good news. Aya Hijazi, whom I  have spoken about before on the floor, is an American-Egyptian citizen  whom Egyptian officials had imprisoned on trumped-up charges almost 3  years ago. She was released, and she was able to return home to the  United States last week. I am pleased that she was set free, as are  many of my colleagues in the Senate who had been calling for the  Egyptian authorities to release her. I know this was a topic of  conversation during Egyptian President Elsisi's visit to the United  States 3 weeks ago.   I want to also take this moment to thank the Trump administration for  working to ensure her freedom. They were instrumental--in fact, they  were key in this being possible. They made it a priority in their  private engagements with regard to President Elsisi.   Sadly, there are still many more political prisoners who remain  jailed in Egypt. We here in Congress as well as the administration  should continue to raise these issues with the Egyptian Government  until all of them are released, regardless of their citizenship status.   As the leader of the free world, the United States must work to  safeguard the freedoms and liberties of all people. We must speak  frankly with our allies, with our partners around the world, and we  must work with governments to improve their human rights records.   It is ultimately in America's national security interests to have  stable democracies that observe the impartial rule of law and that  respect the rights of their people.
