 In hurricane-ridden places, DREAMers are  extraordinarily scared for their families, for the ability to recover  from damages; and I see it every day.   It is imperative that Republicans sign this bill to save and protect  our DREAMers, who are, in fact, Americans. Do it for all of those who  are suffering.   Then, Madam Speaker, let me explain to you that FEMA needs to address  the poverty of my constituents, individuals who are calling me in their  apartments when their 84-year-old mother and themselves have lost  everything, and they cannot get a FEMA inspector to that apartment.   I will be addressing this with FEMA Director Brock Long, but we  cannot go this route. People are still in uninhabitable housing. Over  the weekend, seniors were evicted from their housing with no place to  go.   I am engaged with our public housing authority, but we have got to  have a system that is orderly for those who are living in uninhabitable  housing. And, FEMA, you have got to enhance the inspectors. These  people are waiting for over a month for you to come to their apartment  or home to inspect, because they have no resources at all, and they are  depending upon the FEMA dollars based upon your inspection for the loss  of personal items.   The hurricane is still on for my friends in Puerto Rico and Florida  and the Virgin Islands and Texas.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for guiding us and providing us an opportunity to really  speak from the heart.   I, likewise, want to acknowledge the chairman of the Congressional  Black Caucus for his leadership as well, Chairman Richmond, and, of  course, Congressman Evans, Congressman Veasey, and Congresswoman  Beatty, who are conducting this CBC Special Order.   I would also like to ask for them to beg my pardon for I wish to  start with a commentary on those who are suffering and to bring  attention to our friends in the Virgin Islands and in Puerto Rico.   Before I came on the floor, the cable news was reporting again the  kinds of vision--or the kinds of visions and scenes that we had in the  early stages of Hurricane Harvey: Come help me; but also a reminder of  those in Katrina with the big, large sign: Is somebody going to help  me? Now, in Puerto Rico, where I am understanding in many parts of  Puerto Rico, no government help has come, probably the same in St.  Croix.   The picture I have here is a picture in my congressional district  where we were attempting and did rescue about 60 people who were  surrounded by water and certainly concerned, as others were, having to  flee for their lives and looking for high ground.   I am going to leave this picture up, because I would not want my  comments going forward to suggest in any way that we are not concerned  about those who are unhoused in Houston, Harris County, Port Arthur,  Beaumont, and beyond; of course, in Florida; of course, in the Virgin  Islands; and the cry for help in Puerto Rico.   So I want to simply say that we in the government have to do our job.  We have got to move faster, and we cannot move by Republican proposals  for tax relief. We have to do this Democrats and Republicans. Work with  us to craft the kind of language and relief that will provide these  people with immediate housing resources. These are people without  liability insurance. These are people in apartments where apartment  owners are moving slowly to restore their apartments.                                time  2015    They need cash. They need the distribution of the millions of dollars  that all of this representation of people raising money. There needs to  be a pool for housing. We need to give a cash allotment so that someone  can get into a clean apartment or they can begin to get their items out  of the stores--I don't want to call names--that you go and get wood and  begin to fix your homes.   This becomes a race issue. My colleagues in the Congressional Black  Caucus are really the ones who are going to be--along with a bipartisan  effort, and our leader and our whip in the Democratic Caucus and  working with the Speaker and the whip and the majority leader, let's  get on with it. They actually need direct funding.   This is a backdrop of the words that I want to be able to speak of as  I talk about the tragedy of which brings us to the floor. Here is  another example of people under water. This is happening all over in  these storm-ravaged places.   Yet we have to come to the floor to speak about an unnecessary  distraction. While there is a fast-moving target toward North Korea by  the boisterous words that have been coming out of the White House so  that we might enter into an accidental war with North Korea, all I will  say about that is: I don't know if the White House, the Commander in  Chief, has been to the DMZ, but I have. I have looked a North Korean  soldier in the eye, and that is what our soldiers do every day on that  DMZ standing in the gap. Boisterous attacking and credulous language  only will lead us into an accidental war.   I further want to indicate that if there is ever a bill among others  that continues to speak to Americans from all backgrounds, minorities  in particular, that you are not prepared to address the healthcare of  people who are in desperate need who have preexisting conditions. It  is, though well-meaning, the Graham-Cassidy bill, another false attempt  to undermine the Affordable Care Act.   Having met with health professionals today, I will tell you: between  diabetes, sickle cell anemia, kidney disease, and prostate cancer, they  cannot afford the Graham-Cassidy bill.   Get on with it. Support the Affordable Care Act, because it becomes a  race issue. The predominant number of individuals impacted by prostate  cancer and diabetes are African American.   So I want to ask: What is going on in this atmosphere of the  Commander in Chief?   I try to understand it because, from my perspective, this is  dangerous ground. It is particularly dangerous in setting the tone on  the whole issue of race in America.   Who is the guiding force of setting the tone for race in America?   It is, in fact, the leader of this country. It is disappointing that  the words that were said by the White House, this President, does not  recognize that African Americans have been in the United States  military. It does not recognize that, in fact, we are the most  patriotic group. And in being patriotic, we take no backseat to the  respect we have for the flag.   I came down to the floor so that I could be standing behind the flag.  My back is to the flag.   Am I protesting the flag? Am I burning the flag?   I abhor burning the flag. I abhor the destruction of the flag. But I  respect silent protests.   It bothers me that the one who is so boisterous would have top  advisers and Cabinet picks that have histories of prejudice. A person  who leads the country denied responsibility of racist incidents that  followed his election.   He launched a travel ban on targeting Muslims. He attacked the Muslim  Gold Star parents. He claimed a judge was biased because he was a  Mexican American. The Justice Department sued his company twice for not  renting to Black people.   This is not a mirage. This is not a rumor. These are facts. In fact,  discrimination against Black people has been a pattern throughout this  leader's life. He refused to immediately condemn the White supremacists  who advocated for him. He questioned whether President Barack Obama was  born in the United States not for 1 year, but year after year after  year, to the point that I was embarrassed for the former President of  the United States, not him.   He treats racial groups as monoliths. He trashed Native Americans and  encouraged the mob anger that resulted in the wrongful imprisonment of  five young minority boys in the tragedy of the Central Park rape. They  were not guilty. He took out a full-page ad in The New York Times  wrongly and asked for their execution, the death penalty to those who  are not guilty. He condoned the beating of a Black Lives Matter  protester. He called supporters who beat up a homeless Latino man  passionate. He stereotyped Jews and shared an anti-Semitic image  created by supremacists.   So now we defend him even more. Now we suggest that he is playing to  his base, that it is okay, and that there are people who believe in  what he is saying. There is a percentage of Americans who believe that  we should not kneel during the national anthem. These are nothing but  things that represent democracy. Democracy is living  [[Page H7482]]  and breathing. It is in your heart, your mind, and your soul. I am an  American because of her values. The national anthem was written by a  man, and we sing it with pride. But it is not God. The flag is not God.  It is a symbol of the democracy, the Constitution, and the freedom of  speech that is given.   Let me be very clear: none of those football players and others  desecrated the flag. They did not spit on it. They did not burn it.  They did not desecrate it.   So I came tonight to suggest that there are still two Americas,  because it does not seem that there is any understanding of the heroism  of people of color. And I have to talk particularly about African  Americans who served in the United States military.   Crispus Attucks was an iconic patriot engaging in a protest in 1770.  He was shot by royalist soldiers in the Boston Massacre.    Does the White House know Crispus Attucks? Does he know those who  have come through the ages, who fought for the Union in the Civil War?   Yet, in doing so, the treatment of African Americans continued to be  dastardly violent into the lynchings of the 1900s. Yet we remain  patriotic. All we ask is the doors of opportunity be opened and that  our leaders respect us.   So let me say to those who don't understand that the First Amendment  does not in any way define ``do not stand for'' or ``do stand for the  national anthem and the flag.'' There is nothing in the law that  indicates that these individuals are desecrating the flag.   I join with the statements of Commissioner Roger Goodell. I join with  the statement of the Texans by Bob McNair. I join the Seattle  statement--the most potent statement--that talks about the facts that  these individuals have a right to express themselves.   But I do not join with the President, who would say: Wouldn't you  love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our  flag, to say, Get that son of a B off the field; out; he is fired; he  is fired?   I join with our NFL.   Do you know what you are saying?   You are talking about African-American mothers. You are calling them  a son of a B. You are calling those children's mother--single mothers  sometimes; mothers who have fought to overcome to get their children  where they could be--and these boys--and I'm going to call them that-- who have gone out to the community and tried to be of good conscience,  you have said that their mother is a son of a B. That is racist.   If you don't understand that that is racist--as a mom, I come to this  floor and I say to the mothers of those children: I love your sons.  Thank you to the NFL and the owners who stood up. Thank you to those  who are not African American, who joined with their fellow brothers on  the field and knelt--not in desecration of the national anthem, not in  desecration of the blood that was shed by the soldiers who are on  battlefields; some of them supporting and shouting for those NFL in  terms of the brotherhood.   We will never dishonor our military. How can we? We are the military.  We are everything. We are integrated into the American society. We  simply ask for the dignity of respect to not call our mothers a son of  a B. If they kneel--I heard a young man who is an NFL player say that  he will kneel from now on, and the only reason he is doing it is  because someone has the lack of judgment to provoke the situation and  call their mothers a name.   I refuse to accept that as a standard of leadership for the highest  office in the world. Even if you never understand it, sir, if you think  you are playing to your base, if you are not the unifier, then we will  continue to stand in the gap, and racism is going to be under our foot.   Do you know where else it is going to be?   It is going to be under our knee because we in the Congressional  Black Caucus have always stood for what is right.   There is no basis in the First Amendment that says that you cannot  kneel during the national anthem or in front of the flag. Congress  shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of press.  Prohibition against abridging freedom of speech applies to Congress and  State and local governments through the Due Process Clause of the 14th  Amendment. Speech may be abridged in two distinct ways: directly by  regulating content of speech; indirectly by regulating time, manner,  and place.   So you cannot abridge by standing up with tweets. You cannot abridge  without law and regulation. There is no regulation that says that these  young men cannot stand against the dishonoring of their mothers by  saying: Fire the son of a B.   You tell me which of those children's mothers are a son of a B. That  is racism. You cannot deny it. You cannot run from it.   I kneel in honor of them. I kneel in front of the flag and on this  floor. I kneel in honor of the First Amendment. I kneel because the  flag is a symbol for freedom. I kneel because I am going to stand  against racism. I kneel because I will stand with those young men, I  will stand with our soldiers, and I will stand with America.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committees on the  Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee; Ranking Member of the  Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and  Investigations, and the Congressional Voting Rights Caucus, I rise  today to express my views regarding the President's most recent  racially inflammatory statements and actions.   On Election Night the President-Elect pledged to the nation that he  would be a president to all Americans.   The President has failed spectacularly to keep that promise and his  pledge rings hollow to tens of millions of Americans.   Last Friday, in Huntsville, Alabama, a state that was a capitol of  the Confederacy, and the locus of some many seminal events in American  history and the Civil Rights Movement, that one of his fondest wishes,  saying:         Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when       somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ``Get that son of a       bitch off the field right now. Out. He's fired. He's fired!''        You know, some owner is going to do that. He's going to       say, ``That guy that disrespects our flag, he's fired.'' And       that owner, they don't know it. They don't know it. They'll       be the most popular person, for a week. They'll be the most       popular person in this country.    The President's remarks are wrong and display a shocking lack of  understanding of the U.S. Constitution, the role of non-violent civil  disobedience in bringing about social change, and the latest example of  him falling short in upholding the honor of office.   These are the subjects I will address in my remarks this evening.   Trump Racial History   1. African Americans in military;   2. Name Trump called NFL players is offensive   3. Non-violent protest is protected speech under the 1st Amendment   Graham-Cassidy Is Worst Obamacare Repeal Attempt Yet   Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me share with our colleagues 5 Ways the  Graham-Cassidy healthcare repeal bill puts Medicaid Coverage At Risk  and is a disaster for Americans.   The Graham-Cassidy proposal goes beyond the American Health Care Act  (AHCA) passed by the House in May and the Better Care Reconciliation  Act (BCRA) that failed in the Senate in July.   The Graham-Cassidy proposal revamps and cuts Medicaid, redistributes  federal funds across states, and eliminates coverage for millions of  poor Americans as described below:   Ends federal funding for current ACA coverage and partially replaces  that funding with a block grant that expires after 2026.   The proposal ends both the authority to cover childless adults and  funding for the ACA Medicaid expansion that covers 15 million adults.   Under Graham-Cassidy, a new block grant, the ``Market-Based Health  Care Grant Program,'' combines federal funds for the ACA Medicaid  expansion, premium and cost sharing subsidies in the Marketplace, and  states' Basic Health Plans for 2020-2026.   Capped nationally, the block grant would be lower than ACA spending  under current law and would end after 2026.   States would need to replace federal dollars or roll back coverage.   Neither the AHCA nor the BCRA included expiration dates for ACA- related federal funds or eliminated the ability for states to cover  childless adults through Medicaid.   Massively redistributes federal funding from Medicaid expansion  states to non-expansion states through the block grant program  penalizing states that broadened coverage.   In 2020, block grant funds would be distributed based on federal  spending in states for ACA Medicaid and Marketplace coverage.   By 2026, funding would go to states according to the states' portion  of the population with incomes between 50% and 138% of poverty; the new  allocation is phased in over the 2021-2025 period.   The Secretary has the authority to make other adjustments to the  allocation.  [[Page H7483]]    This allocation would result in a large redistribution of ACA funding  by 2026, away from states that adopted the Medicaid expansion and  redirecting funding to states that did not.   No funding is provided beyond 2026.   Prohibits Medicaid coverage for childless adults and allows states to  use limited block grant funds to purchase private coverage for  traditional Medicaid populations.   States can use funds under the block grant to provide tax credits  and/or cost-sharing reductions for individual market coverage, make  direct payments to providers, or provide coverage for traditional  Medicaid populations through private insurance.   The proposal limits the amount of block grant funds that a state  could use for traditional Medicaid populations to 15% of its allotment  (or 20 percent under a special waiver).   These limits would shift coverage and funds for many low-income  adults from Medicaid to individual market coverage.   Under current law, 60 percent of federal ACA coverage funding is  currently for the Medicaid expansion (covering parents and childless  adults).   Medicaid coverage is typically more comprehensive, less expensive and  has more financial protections compared to private insurance.   The proposal also allows states to roll back individual market  protections related to premium pricing, including allowing premium  rating based on health status, and benefits currently in the ACA.   Caps and redistributes federal funds to states for the traditional  Medicaid program for more than 60 million low-income children, parents,  people with disabilities and the elderly.   Similar to the BCRA and AHCA, the proposal establishes a Medicaid per  enrollee cap as the default for federal financing based on a  complicated formula tied to different inflation rates.   As a result, federal Medicaid financing would grow more slowly than  estimates under current law. In addition to overall spending limits,  similar to the BCRA, the proposal would give the HHS Secretary  discretion to further redistribute capped federal funds across states  by making adjustments to states with high or low per enrollee spending.   Eliminates federal funding for states to cover Medicaid family  planning at Planned Parenthood clinics for one year.   Additional funding restrictions include limits on states' ability to  use provider tax revenue to finance Medicaid as well as the termination  of the enhanced match for the Community First Choice attendant care  program for seniors and people with disabilities.   Enrollment barriers include the option for states to condition  Medicaid eligibility on a work requirement and to conduct more frequent  redeterminations.   Much is at stake for low-income Americans and states in the Graham- Cassidy proposal.   That is why I strongly urge our Senate colleagues to reject this  latest attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record articles, statements, and tweets  regarding this topic.            1st Amendment Freedom of Speech Clause in a Nutshell         ``Congress shall make no law'' . . . abridging the freedom       of speech, or of the press''--United States Constitution,       Amend.

Speech may be abridged in two distinct ways:        a. directly, by regulating content of speech        b. indirectly, by regulating time, manner, and place        3. A law or regulation may be invalid on its face or       invalid in its application to specific facts        a. facial invalidity: vagueness or overbreadth        b. examples of invalid as applied: parade and protest       permits        4. Prior Restraints'' are presumptively invalid (e.g.       Pentagon Papers case)      B. Regulation of Speech Content        1. Advocacy of Illegal Conduct can be punished if the       speech advocates action and amounts to incitement of       immediate and probable lawful conduct        2. Defamation: public officials and public figures cannot       sue for defamation unless statements are false and made with       ``actual malice,'' which requires proof of knowing or       reckless disregard of statement's falsity. (New York Times v.       Sullivan)        3. Obscene Speech is not protected by the First Amendment.       Examples: National Endowment for the Arts funding, ``gangster       rap'' music and lewd lyrics, etc.). To be considered obscene,       speech or material must satisfy multi-part test:        a. an average person, applying contemporary community       standards, would find        b. the material, taken as a whole,        c. appeals to prurient interests, and        d. lacks redeeming social, educational, political, or       artistic value        4. Symbolic Speech is protected by First Amendment.       Examples of symbolic speech:        a. Flag Desecration (Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397(1989)        b. Draft Card Burning (U.S. v. O'Brien, (1968))        c. Arm Bands in school to protest Vietnam War (Tinker v.       Des Moines School District (1968))        d. Campaign Finance Laws (Buckley v. Valeo, (1976))        5. Commercial Speech may be regulated much more easily and       extensively than political speech to protect public health       and safety. Examples of advertising that can be banned        a. Tobacco products        b. Distilled Spirits and Alcohol products        c. Handguns and assault weapons        d.

Divisive comments like these demonstrate       an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game       and all of our players, and a failure to understand the       overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent       in our communities.

The vast       majority of players in the NFL--especially those who have       worn and continue to wear the Horseshoe--have donated       millions of dollars to charities, raised money for  [[Page H7484]]       those affected by recent hurricanes, created charitable       foundations, visited schools, mentored students, worked in       homeless shelters, cleaned up parks, and put in hours of       their personal time toward improving their communities and       the lives of those around them. That's the spirit in which       this nation was founded, and we all need to work tirelessly       to bring people together to take on the challenges that face       us and give back to the people of our communities.

Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump        The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is       about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL       must respect this! 7:39 AM--Sep. 25, 2017.        Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump        So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't       put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag--they said       it loud and clear! 7:25 AM--Sep. 25, 2017.        Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump        Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand       proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should       change policy! 6:25 PM--Sep. 24, 2017.        Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump        If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop       disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take       place fast. Fire or suspend! 6:44 AM--Sep. 24, 2017.        Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump        If a player wants the privilege of making millions of       dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be       allowed to disrespect . . . 2:11 PM--Sep. 23, 2017.        Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump        . . . our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand       for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something       else to do! 2:18 PM--Sep. 23, 2017.        Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump        Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to       justify the total disrespect certain players show to our       country. Tell them to stand! 6:25 PM--Sep. 23, 2017.
