 Madam Speaker, I was very encouraged with today's  reports that the Republican leadership is planning to teach their  Members about how the debt ceiling works. This is a very good sign,  especially after the embarrassing first week with 15 votes to elect a  Speaker, and the House leadership ending up exactly where it started.  Unfortunately, the leadership is hallowed out, but they have empowered  the exact same element or any other faction who want to hold the  Speaker hostage.   But there is a key difference going forward. They are playing games  with the full faith and credit of the United States, which is  underpinning the global economy. Note, the debt ceiling is not just a  way station on the way to a full government shutdown. While government  shutdowns have real costs and consequences, the debt ceiling has  massive ramifications that you cannot unwind.   This game of chicken with the global economy is very much more  consequential. You can recover from the shutdown. But the Trump attacks  on professionals, for example, drove thousands of people out of  government service, and it is going to take years and millions of  dollars to repair. These implementations of political slogans have real  consequences.   In the end, I suspect we will be right where we started. The only way  to reduce the deficit, to balance the budget books, is to actually  reduce government spending, which they refused to do in the Trump  administration when they were in total control of the government. They  instead had a huge increase in the deficit. There were, of course, tax  cuts that were a part of that, unfunded, and there was a major spike in  military spending.   My friend, Hal Harvey, a leader in climate science, is fond of saying  that you can't refute science, math, and economics. That is exactly the  situation that my Republican friends are facing with this game of  chicken with the debt ceiling.   There is no gimmick, there is no commission, and there is no slogan  that avoids the painful truth that you actually have to reduce  spending. There are real things we could do.   I would suggest any Member could avail themselves of a secret weapon  that is in each and every one of our districts. There are amazing young  people who are involved with civics, with leadership congresses, with  the efforts to understand how government works. I think we ought to  employ them. They understand the dynamic: Cut spending, raise taxes, or  just collect the taxes that are due and owing, which would be hundreds  of billions of dollars. Unless and until we do this, all the rest is  simply meaningless slogans and posturing, unfortunately with real risks  of threatening the full faith and credit of the United States.   My friends have no alternative to the borrowing, and I am afraid that  we are going to end up going through this meaningless exercise,  agitating ourselves, confusing the public, and losing an opportunity to  make real progress, improving the budgeting process, and making the tax  system more effective to just collect the taxes that are already due  and owing, which we are ignoring.   I strongly encourage the process that my Republican friends are  involved with in terms of educating Members about the impacts of the  debt ceiling, and I hope that we are able to come together to deal with  the realities of what that implies.                            ____________________
