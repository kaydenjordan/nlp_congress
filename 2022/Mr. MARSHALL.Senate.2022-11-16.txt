 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the  150th birthday of our home, Great Bend, KS.   Anticipating the westward expansion of the Atchison, Topeka and Sante  Fe Railroad, D.N. Heiser and E.J. Dodge made the first settlement in  the Great Bend Township in 1871. The railroad reached the township in  July of 1872, and Great Bend was soon incorporated as the permanent  county seat for Barton County, named after the great bend of the  Arkansas River--pronounced Ar-Kansas--that the town sits on. Later,  this great bend on the river became the crossing point for settlers and  supply wagons traversing the Santa Fe Trail. Great Bend would go on to  be a premier shipping point for cattle, as well as a center of regional  trade and commerce for western Kansas. The oil and gas industry arrived  in Great Bend soon after, with the county bringing in more than $30  million annually from the petroleum industry by 1930. From its  beginnings, Great Bend has been pivotal in the development of Kansas's  economy, and today, our agriculture and oil help feed and fuel the  world.   I had the privilege of raising my family in Great Bend and delivering  some 5,000 babies in the community. Thanks to investments of hard work,  innovation, and determination, as well as great pride in our schools,  Great Bend continues to serve as an economic driver for central Kansas.  The city of Great Bend plays such a vital role in telling the story of  Kansas, so it is my honor to celebrate the city's 150th birthday.   I would like to thank and honor everyone living in Great Bend and our  predecessors for the pride they have in our city and especially thank  everyone who helped organize the sesquicentennial celebration.   I now ask my colleagues to join the residents of Great Bend in  celebrating the city's 150th birthday and recognize them all for their  contributions to the city's 150 years of history.   I am humbled and proud to call Great Bend home.                            ____________________
