 Madam President, I would like to thank my colleagues for  their work on the Legislative Branch portion of the appropriations  package because, for the first time in nearly a decade--a decade--the  Legislative Branch bill received floor consideration outside of the  year-end omnibus.   Because it is our job to ensure the timely funding of our government,  returning to regular order on the Legislative Branch bill and all our  other appropriations bills is a much needed change.   The Legislative Branch appropriations bill is good news for  transparency, for accountability, for taxpayers, and for security of  the Capitol.   This bill will increase public access to campaign filings. It will  strengthen accountability in how government property is used. It will  also make investments that will help meet security needs on the Capitol  campus.   I thank Senator Murphy, my ranking member, for working with me, in a  bipartisan manner, on amendments to the Legislative Branch division.  The resulting bill makes sound investments in numerous priorities and  will help ensure the operations of the legislative process.   I also very much appreciate the leadership and efforts of Chairman  Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy on returning to regular order. I thank  Senators Alexander, Feinstein, Boozman, and Schatz for their work on  the other two bills in this package.   I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this package of  appropriations bills.   Thank you.
