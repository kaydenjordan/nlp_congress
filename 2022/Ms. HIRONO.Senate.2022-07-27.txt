 Madam President, as we focus on contraception rights this  [[Page S3725]]  afternoon, listen to some of the comments made by my Republican male  colleagues:         They are not going to change the law on contraception.        There is zero threat of contraception being taken away.        Pure hysteria.        I have no reason to believe these precedents are going to       fall.    These are some of the statements made by my Republican colleagues-- all of them male, by the way--have made regarding contraception. ``Pure  hysteria,'' they say. This is not pure hysteria to the millions of  women across the country who woke up one morning in June and no longer  had a constitutional right.   When it comes to this far-right, agenda-driven Supreme Court, nothing  is off the table and nothing is ``pure hysteria.''   Last month, the far-right majority of the Supreme Court overturned  nearly 50 years of precedent and took away the constitutional right to  get an abortion. This decision was the result of a decades-long effort  by far-right Republicans and rightwing groups to pack the courts with  politicians in Roe.   And they are just getting started. For this MAGA majority,  controlling women's bodies doesn't stop at forcing women to give birth.  They actually want to ban contraception. We know this because, in this  concurring opinion to overturn Roe, Justice Thomas wrote that the  Supreme Court should reconsider--reconsider--the rulings that protect  same-sex relationships, marriage equality, and, yes, contraception.   This kind of signaling by a Justice of a Supreme Court should be  taken seriously.   So my Republican colleagues saying they have no reason to believe  precedent will be overturned is resorting to magical thinking that no  one should believe. After all, the Supreme Court just overturned a  nearly 50-year precedent that women in this country relied on for  nearly half a century--half a century. That is two generations. In  fact, radical MAGA Republicans in State legislatures across the country  are gearing up in Ohio.   House Republicans introduced a bill that would effectively ban all  abortions from the moment of conception and, potentially, other forms  of birth control, like IUDs.   Other Republicans have refused to rule out banning certain forms of  contraception. We are living in a post-Roe world where our rights are  on the chopping block. So, no, this is not ``pure hysteria.'' The  American public knows this. Democrats know this.   So I say to my Republican colleagues, if any of you object to this  bill, come down to the Senate floor and tell the American people the  truth. Just be honest that you do not support guaranteeing the right to  contraception because, in this post-Roe world, any suggestion that this  Court won't overturn precedent is no longer something to hide behind.  But if my Republican colleagues do support the right to contraception,  then they should have no problem with supporting our bill, which would  create a statutory right for individuals to access contraception,  protect the right to healthcare providers to provide contraception to  their patients, and empower individuals by extending a private right of  action against any State or government official that hinders these  rights.   Today, my Republican colleagues have a choice. Do they support the  right to contraception and an individual's right to make decisions  about our bodies and our healthcare? Or will they allow the government  to tell millions and millions of women what to do?   I yield the floor.
