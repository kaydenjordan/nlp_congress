 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Judge Harry Walker Wellford, who passed away Saturday, April 17.   Judge Wellford was a third-generation Memphian, who dedicated his  life to serving his community through the  [[Page H1958]]  justice system, and also dedicated his life to his family.   Judge Wellford started serving his community in our great country at  a young age. Like so many of his generation, the Greatest Generation,  Harry served our Nation fighting in the Pacific theater during World  War II. After serving our Nation overseas, Harry Wellford returned to  his home State of Tennessee to obtain his law degree from Vanderbilt  University.   In the 1960s, a turbulent time for our Nation and for Memphis, Harry  Wellford was an active member of the biracial Memphis Relations  Committee, serving for the betterment of the Memphis community.   It was during this time that Harry Wellford became politically  active, leading the west Tennessee efforts for Howard Baker's campaign  for the United States Senate; and then, in 1970, managing the Statewide  campaign for his good friend, Winfield Dunn, to become Governor of  Tennessee.   Harry had a good and successful law practice and was well-regarded in  the legal community. It was for these reasons that Harry was nominated  for a Federal judgeship in 1970 by then-President Richard Nixon. Judge  Wellford was unanimously confirmed as district court judge. Later,  President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Wellford for the Sixth Circuit  Court of Appeals, to which he was confirmed.   Judge Wellford had a long and distinguished career on the bench. A  good friend of Judge Wellford was Judge Julia Gibbons, who currently  serves on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and, in 1982, replaced  Judge Wellford on the district court when he was elevated to the  appellate court. Commenting on him yesterday, Judge Gibbons said: Harry  Wellford was one of the people we most admire to become; he was my  friend; his touch with people emanated in everything he did in life.   Madam Speaker, Harry and his wife, Katherine, were members of  Idlewild Presbyterian Church before she passed away. They loved to  travel, and he enjoyed spending his free time playing tennis and golf.  Despite being a well-distinguished judge and a political reformer for  the State of Tennessee, what mattered most to Harry was his family.   Judge Wellford's favorite song was ``Eternal Father Strong to Save,''  more commonly known as ``The Navy Hymn.'' So appropriate for him and  for his generation.   Indeed, Harry Wellford will be sorely missed by all who knew him.  Today, Roberta and I are thinking about Harry and his five children:  Harry, Jr.; Beasley; Buck; Kate; and Allison.   Harry Wellford, thank you for your service to our great Nation.                            ____________________
