 Mr. President, I am honored to join the senior  Senator from Oregon in support of this important resolution.   As I think everybody on this floor has observed, there is a rot in  our American democracy, and there is a shadow over the Halls of  Congress. The rot is dark money, and the shadow is special interest  influence empowered by that dark money.   A lot of this goes back to the extraordinarily misguided decision of  the U.S. Supreme Court--or, I should say, five Republican appointees to  the U.S. Supreme Court--in Citizens United, which took the astonishing  position that the integrity of our elections should receive a value of  zero in their calculus and their solicitude should be exclusively for  the wealthiest forces that bring their power to bear on American  democracy, because, after all, if what you are doing is unleashing the  power of special interests to spend millions of dollars, by definition,  you are only powering up the group that has millions of dollars to  spend and a reason to spend it.   That is, perhaps, the segment of the American population entitled to  the least solicitude in our great American debate. Yet it was the  exclusive interest of the five Republican appointees on the Court. It  was an evil balancing of priorities but, sadly, part of a long  tradition--going back to the Bellotti decision--of Republican  appointees to the Supreme Court expanding the role and influence of  corporations and special interests.   In their foolishness, the five Republican judges who gave us the  Citizens United decision claimed that the spending they unleashed was  going to be transparent--not so.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to append to my remarks at the  end with an article pointing out that secret political spending in  elections in the United States of America is on track to hit a $1  billion milestone.   Not only is the secret spending a menace, but once you allow  unlimited spending--particularly, if you allow unlimited secret  spending--there is another dark problem, which is that if you are a big  special interest that is able to spend unlimited money, and perhaps  secret unlimited money against a candidate, what else have you been  given the power to do? You have been given the power to go to that  candidate and say: We are coming after you unless you do what I tell  you.   It opens threats and promises that are always going to be secret. So  even were there not these evil channels for dark money to pollute and  influence our democracy, Citizens United would still be misguided with  respect to the darkness of the threats and promises that it empowered.   Of course, when you remove accountability for the advertising and the  sleazy campaigns that this supports, you get a lot more negative  advertising. That is why one of the consequences of all of this has  been described as a tsunami of slime.   Whether you want to rid dark money channels, whether you want to  diminish secret threats, or whether you want to combat the tsunami of  slime, there is every reason to take a stand against what has become of  our democracy. If you think this is just an academic pursuit, take a  look at the climate change dispute.   In 2007, 2008, and 2009, when I was a new Senator, we did bipartisan  work on climate change every one of those years. We had bipartisan  hearings. We had bipartisan bills. I think we had four of them in the  Senate.   Along comes Citizens United in January of 2010. From that moment  forward, bipartisanship was dead because the fossil fuel industry that  asked for the Citizens United decision and that got the Citizens United  decision from the five Republican appointees was instantly ready to  bring that new power to bear. They went to the Republican Party, and  they said: Anybody who crosses us on climate is dead. They took  representatives like Bob Inglis and put him out of his job to  demonstrate their seriousness.   From that moment, from the day the Citizens United decision was  announced, there has not been a serious piece of climate legislation  that any Republican has been willing to sign onto.   If you doubt the effects of dark money, take a look at where we are  on climate change. In this weird way, the pollution of our democracy is  directly connected to the pollution of our atmosphere and oceans.   And, of course, once you open a channel for a dark money influence-- an American dark money influence; ExxonMobil, the Koch brothers, Big  Pharma, you name it--when you open a dark money channel for that  influence to wreak its power, you can't control who comes through it.  Dark is dark. And there is every reason now to believe that foreigners  are taking advantage of our dark money channels to exert influence in  our elections.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the end of  my remarks an op-ed in Politico entitled ``Foreign Dark Money is  Threatening American Democracy,'' written by former Vice President  Biden.   Today's Congressional Review Act measure is a small step. It won't  provide much public disclosure; it will only require that companies and  entities that are using these dark money channels continue to report to  the IRS. So there is not going to be an enormous difference made here,  but there is an enormous difference in which side this body will choose  to be on in this vote today on Senator Tester's resolution. It is a  very simple and a very stark choice. We can choose, one by one. Each  one of us will make this choice today. We can choose to be on the side  of dark money. We can choose to decide to be on the side of special  interest influence, we can choose to decide to be on the side of  whispered threats--I will tell you that dark money and special interest  influence  [[Page S7463]]  and whispered threats have a disgraceful force in this building right  now, thanks to Citizens United and the dark money channels that it  empowered--or we can choose to be on the side of America as a city on a  hill. Why do we call America a city on a hill? Because everyone can see  it. And a city on a hill does not do its business through the dark  money sewers that run under the city; it does its business in the plain  marketplace and open spaces of that city, and that is what we should be  for.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a report on  this issue by a terrific bipartisan group, called ``Issue One,'' as a  third appendant to my remarks.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From MarketWatch, Nov. 26, 2018]      Secret Political Spending on Track to Reach $1 Billion Milestone                            (By Victor Reklaitis)         So-called dark money, which came into being after a Supreme       Court ruling, soon may reach a ten-digit milestone.        That term refers to election-related spending by groups       that don't disclose their donors. This type of political       outlay remains far from becoming dominant, but it keeps       spooking researchers, lawmakers and activists, as it nears a       big round number.        ``We see dark money flowing into this process from both       liberal and conservative sources, and in 2020 we will be       reaching this milestone where $1 billion will have been spent       by dark-money groups since Citizens United,'' said Michael       Beckel, manager of research, investigations and policy       analysis at Issue One.        He was referring to the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in       Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that struck       down a ban on political spending by corporations. Beckel,       whose nonprofit organization aims to reduce the role of money       in politics, was speaking at a recent event focused on dark       money.                     Far from the biggest source of funds         Getting to $1 billion shouldn't be a big stretch, given the       current estimates for how much has been spent in the shadows.       More than $800 million has been shelled out to date since the       court decision eight years ago, according to Anna Massoglia,       a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, who also       spoke at the event.        While it would be significant to have dark-money groups hit       $1 billion in spending since 2010, that amount is far below       what's spent in just one election cycle by all groups. The       2018 midterm races, for example, sparked an estimated $5.2       billion in outlays alone, mostly by Democratic and Republican       candidates, rather than dark-money groups or other outside       organizations.        The $800 million spent to date by groups that don't       disclose their donors in the past eight years represents       about 18% of all political spending by outside groups during       that period, said Massoglia from the Center for Responsive       Politics, a campaign-finance watchdog.        Dark money's rise has been rapid, but it's hard to predict       if it eventually could make up 100% of all outside spending,       Massoglia told MarketWatch. She noted some organizations want       to publicize their spending, rather than hide it: ``There are       advantages to doing that, in terms of getting credit for what       you're spending on.''                          The trouble with dark money         Dark money is a growing problem for candidates and voters,       according to Issue One Executive Director Meredith McGehee.        ``Talking to members of Congress--whether they be       Republican, Democrat or independent--one thing they all fear       is dark money, because it's money that they have a hard time       anticipating, responding to, understanding,'' she said.        ``And it's really a big question for the American people,       because when you don't know where the money is coming from,       it's hard to do what the Supreme Court said you should be       able to do as an American citizen--and that is to judge the       message partly by who the messenger is.''        Other campaign-finance activists have said secret money       encourages corruption and threatens democracy.        On the other side of the issue, former commissioner for the       Federal Election Commission Brad Smith, known for opposing       campaign-finance regulations, once wrote that dark money is       ``a term used not to enlighten, but to scare Americans into       approving of sweeping new laws, invading privacy in ways       never before seen in American politics.'' Supporters of       anonymity in politics have noted Thomas Paine's famous       ``Common Sense pamphlet was published anonymously in 1776.       They also have said that throughout history anonymous       political speech has been attacked by entrenched powers but       has helped challengers, and they've stressed that disclosures       can chill speech and lead to the harassment of donors.                       The big spenders and key vehicles         The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been the biggest spender       of dark money with an estimated $130 million paid out,       according to Issue One's recent ``Dark Money Illuminated''       report. It's followed by Crossroads GPS, which is tied to       Republican operative Karl Rove and has spent about $110       million, and Americans for Prosperity, which is funded by       conservative billionaire industrialists Charles and David       Koch and has shelled out $59 million. The Democratic-leaning       spenders of dark money include Patriot Majority USA, with its       $18 million in outlays.        Issue One said it was able to reveal some dark-money       through back-door methods such as analyzing tax returns,       looking at lobbyists and labor unions' filings and examining       other data sources.        There are three main vehicles for putting such money in       play, according to Issue One. They are ``social welfare''       groups organized under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code,       trade associations established under Section 501(c)(6), and       limited liability companies.        The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which lobbies for big       business in Washington, didn't respond to a question about       whether it agreed with Issue One's $130 million figure. ``As       a 501(c)(6) organization, the chamber complies with all       applicable lobbying disclosure laws as we advocate for       policies that grow the economy and create jobs,'' the trade       association said in a statement.                 An FEC creation that looks set to stay alive         After the Supreme Court opened the door for corporate       spending in elections, the FEC said existing disclosure laws       weren't a good fit for this new category of outlays, said       Adav Noti, an attorney with the Campaign Legal Center, an       ethics and campaign-finance watchdog. The regulatory agency       then created a new disclosure rule that was ``extremely       narrow'' and led to dark money's rise, he said.        ``Although it gets conflated with Citizens United pretty       frequently, it's not a creation of the Supreme Court,'' Noti       said at the Nov. 14 event. ``Dark money is a creation of the       FEC.''        You don't need judges to overturn Citizens United to end       secret political spending, and you don't need Congress to       make a move, he added. You just need action by the FEC, but       that is ``simply not going to happen, at least not as the FEC       is currently constituted,'' said Noti, who worked as an FEC       attorney for a decade. He doesn't sound upbeat about seeing       an imminent end to dark money.        ``The courts may intervene at some point. Congress may       intervene at some point. Otherwise we'll see what the FEC       does,'' Noti said.        The U.S. Supreme Court in September let stand a lower       court's ruling that required dark-money groups to reveal some       secret donors, but then new guidance in October from the FEC       was viewed as limiting that development's impact.        FEC Chairwoman Caroline C. Hunter and Commissioner Matthew       S. Petersen, both Republicans, blasted the lower court's       ruling in a joint statement, saying it had ordered a new       expenditure reporting regime just two months before the       midterm election and caused confusion. Commissioner Ellen       Weintraub, a Democrat, had praised the judicial actions as       ``a real victory tor transparency,'' but then after the       October guidance described the overall progress on the matter       as ``not as broad as some people had hoped.'' Hunter,       Petersen and Weintraub didn't respond to requests for       comment.        This report was first published on Nov. 20, 2018.                                   ____                        [From POLITICO, Nov. 27, 2018]            Foreign Dark Money Is Threatening American Democracy                   (By Joseph Biden and Michael Carpenter)         Here's how to put a stop to it.        Whatever Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation       ends up revealing about Russia's efforts to subvert our       democracy, one thing is already clear from the media       attention this topic has received: America's democratic       institutions are highly vulnerable to foreign influence.        Foreign powers use three basic tools to interfere in       democratic politics: cyber operations, disinformation and       dark money. Thanks in part to Mueller's indictments of       members of Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) and       the St. Petersburg troll farm known as the Internet Research       Agency, we have begun to address election-related cyber       attacks and foreign disinformation. But when it comes to       foreign dark money--money from unknown foreign sources--we       remain woefully unprepared.        The lack of transparency in our campaign finance system       combined with extensive foreign money laundering creates a       significant vulnerability for our democracy. We don't know       how much illicit money enters the United States from abroad       or how much dark money enters American political campaigns,       but in 2015, the Treasury Department estimated that $300       billion is laundered through the U.S. every year. If even a       small fraction of that ends up in our political campaigns, it       constitutes an unacceptable national security risk.        While foreign funding of campaigns is prohibited by federal       statute, the body that enforces campaign finance laws--the       Federal Election Commission (FEC)--lacks both teeth and       resources. Sophisticated adversaries like Russia and China       know how to bypass the ban on foreign funding by exploiting       loopholes in the system and using layers of proxies to mask       their activities, making it difficult for the FEC, the FBI,       and the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement       Network to follow the money.  [[Page S7464]]         One of the key loopholes is the ability of so-called super       PACs to accept money from U.S. subsidiaries of foreign       corporations. And while super PACs are required to file       financial disclosure reports, non-profit 501(c) organizations       (for example, the National Rifle Association or the U.S.       Chamber of Commerce) are not. So if a foreign entity       transfers money to a 501(c), that organization can in turn       contribute funds to a super PAC without disclosing the       foreign origin of the money.        The last time Congress took on dark money was after 9/11,       in the Patriot Act, when we made it illegal for banks to be       ``willfully blind'' to money laundering and requiring them to       verify their customers' identities. But the lack of any       requirement to disclose the beneficial (i.e. ``true'')       ownership of limited liability companies (LLCs) makes it easy       for foreign entities to establish shell companies in the       United States. These shell companies can then contribute to a       501(c), invest in real estate or channel money directly to a       super PAC. Fortunately, there are steps we can take to secure       our system and shine a light on these murky transactions.        In August, two dozen state attorneys general asked Congress       to pass legislation to disclose the beneficial owners of       LLCs. A federal solution to this issue is necessary because       individual states compete for incorporation revenue and       therefore have little incentive to reform on their own. In       Nevada, for example, the process of registering a company has       been described as ``easier than getting a library card.'' A       federal requirement to disclose the true owners and       controlling interests of LLCs would allow law enforcement to       scrutinize the ``ghost corporations'' that pop up overnight       in states like Nevada or Delaware--and that could be used to       funnel dark money into our politics.        Real estate deals are also susceptible to foreign money       laundering because they are largely exempt from the ``know       your customer'' rules that apply to the banking industry.       This allows foreign entities to use shell companies to park       their wealth in the United States or to channel that money to       U.S. political interests (for example, by purchasing real       estate at above-market prices). Implementing more       comprehensive disclosure requirements in high-end real estate       and prohibiting all-cash sales above certain thresholds would       help create transparency in this sector.        The fact that we don't know exactly how much foreign dark       money is being channeled into U.S. politics is precisely why       we need to reduce our vulnerabilities. There is ample       evidence of dark money penetrating other democracies, and no       reason to believe we are immune from this risk. In 2004, for       example, Lithuania's president was impeached after the media       disclosed that a Russian oligarch who contributed to his       campaign later received Lithuanian citizenship. Just this       past January, in Montenegro, a local politician was charged       with laundering Russian funds to support a pro-Russian       political party. In Australia, an intelligence report leaked       in 2017 exposed pervasive Chinese financial influence in the       country's domestic politics. Similar allegations recently       surfaced in New Zealand.        As we take on the threats posed by cyber attacks and       disinformation from foreign actors, we can't ignore the       threat posed by foreign dark money. With a new Congress about       to be sworn in, there's an opportunity to finally end the       permissive environment for foreign dark money in this       country. Campaign finance reform is certainly a necessary       part of the solution, but so too is disclosure of beneficial       ownership and greater transparency in real estate       transactions. As matters of national security, these are       issues that should be of interest to both Democrats and       Republicans who want to reduce our vulnerability to foreign       corrupt influence.                                   ____                               [From Issue One]                           Dark Money Illuminated         Today many--if not all--politicians live in fear that       opaque dark money groups will launch 11th-hour smear       campaigns against them. If you listen closely, many members       of Congress continuously fundraise precisely to prevent this       doomsday scenario, leading some of them to even leave office       rather than try to out-raise the deep-pocketed donors       attempting to control their electoral fates.        Dark money groups hold enormous sway over what issues are,       and are not, debated in Congress and on the campaign trail.       But the donors behind these groups rarely discuss their       motivations for bankrolling these efforts, leaving the public       in the dark about who funds these increasingly prominent and       potent organizations.        Unfortunately, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy was       either ill-advised or misinformed when he--while writing the       majority opinion in the Supreme Court's Citizens United v.       Federal Election Commission case--assumed that any new       corporate spending in politics unleashed by the decision       would be wholly independent of candidates and promptly       disclosed on the Internet. In that ruling, Justice Kennedy       wrote that ``a campaign finance system that pairs corporate       independent expenditures with effective disclosure has not       existed before today.''        But let's be clear: It still does not exist today.        Issue One's new ``Dark Money Illuminated'' project--a year-      long, deep-dive analysis into the forces at play in the post-      Citizens United political world, which is accompanied by a       first-of-its-kind database of dark money donors--chronicles       just how difficult it remains to effectively ascertain       information about the true sources behind the deluge of       political dark money that Citizens United ushered in, even       for campaign finance experts. The project also offers       constitutional, bipartisan solutions to bring additional       accountability to the political advertisements from dark       money groups that are increasingly bombarding citizens across       the country.                     AN EXPLOSION OF POLITICAL DARK MONEY         Dark money groups are influential in part because they aim       to define candidates and issues before, during and after an       election. Thus, even if their preferred candidates lose, the       issues that define the election are aligned more closely with       the labor unions, corporations, mega-donors and other special       interests bankrolling these secretive groups.        According to the Center for Responsive Politics, dark money       groups reported spending more than $800 million on campaign-      related activities to the FEC between January 2010 and       December 2016 (the last full election cycle). What is less       known is that this surge of opaque spending has been       incredibly concentrated: Issue One's new analysis shows that       the top 15 dark money groups accounted for three-fourths of       this spending--more than $600 million.        The U.S. Chamber of Commerce--the nation's largest lobbying       organization for businesses--alone has spent approximately       $130 million on political advertisements since Citizens       United. That's about $1 of every $6 spent on political ads by       dark money groups between 2010 and 2016.        Other major dark money players in this top 15 list--each of       which reported spending at least $10 million on political       activities to the FEC since January of 2010 and all of which       are profiled on Issue One's website--include:        Americans for Prosperity, the flagship politically active       nonprofit of the billionaire industrialists Charles and David       Koch;        Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies (Crossroads GPS), a       Republican-aligned group associated with Karl Rove, a former       advisor to President George W. Bush;        The League of Conservation Voters, an advocacy organization       that works to elect pro-environment candidates who are       typically Democrats;        The National Rifle Association, the nation's top gun lobby       and backer of politicians who champion the Second Amendment;        Patriot Majority USA, an organization led by political       operatives with close ties to Democratic Sens. Harry Reid and       Chuck Schumer; and        The Planned Parenthood Action Fund, an advocacy group       working to elect politicians who support reproductive rights       and to thwart anti-abortion politicians.        Informing and augmenting the profiles of these 15 major       dark money groups is an exclusive, first-of-its-kind database       created by Issue One that features information about the       donors identified by obscure public records--and other       little-known sources--who are funding these organizations.        In all, this new database contains nearly 1,200       transactions spanning more than eight years--and identifies       approximately 400 unique donors who have collectively given       more than $760 million to these dark money groups in recent       years.        Each record also contains a link to the primary source       document for each transaction--constructed through       painstaking research and fact-checking by the Issue One team,       building off of work previously done by the Center for       Responsive Politics, Center for Public Integrity, Center for       Political Accountability and others.     HOW DID CITIZENS UNITED LEAD TO AN EXPLOSION OF POLITICAL DARK MONEY?         By a slim 5-4 margin, the Supreme Court held in Citizens       United that corporations--including limited liability       companies and certain nonprofit corporations--could bankroll       overt political advertisements that called on people to vote       for or against federal candidates.        While charities and foundations organized under Section       501(c)(3) of the U.S. tax code--the types of nonprofits to       which you may make tax-deductible contributions--are still       prohibited from engaging in electoral politics, the Citizens       United ruling allowed certain other nonprofits--most notably       501(c)(4) ``social welfare'' organizations and 501(c)(6)       trade associations--to spend heavily in elections.        Unlike political candidates, parties or political action       committees, these nonprofits are generally not required to       disclose their donors, meaning the public is frequently left       in the dark about who is funding the ads that are trying to       influence their votes.                          DARK MONEY DONORS REVEALED         To paint as comprehensive a picture as possible about what       interests have bankrolled the top 15 dark money groups since       Citizens United, Issue One searched obscure public records       for information that has essentially been hiding in plain       sight.        To this end, Issue One reviewed FEC filings, tax returns,       annual reports submitted by labor unions to the Department of       Labor, documents submitted to Congress by registered       lobbyists, corporate filings, press releases and other       sources. (See Appendix 2: Methodology for a more detailed       description.)  [[Page S7465]]         These methods frequently led Issue One to be able to       identify transactions--and donors--that have never previously       been associated with these dark money groups.        Here are some of the highlights of what we learned:        Companies and labor unions are among the donors identified       by this research.        For instance, while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce does not       publicly reveal its donors, Issue One found that nearly 100       blue-chip companies have voluntarily disclosed their own dues       payments to the trade association. The Dow Chemical Co. alone       has contributed about $13.5 million to the U.S. Chamber of       Commerce in recent years, while health insurer Aetna Inc. has       contributed $5.3 million and oil giant Chevron Corp. has       contributed $4.5 million.        Meanwhile, Issue One found that gun manufacturer Sturm,       Ruger & Co., Inc. has contributed more than $12 million in       recent years to the National Rifle Association, while tobacco       company Reynolds American Inc. has contributed substantial       sums to three major dark money groups in recent years:       $275,000 to Americans for Tax Reform, $61,000 to Americans       for Prosperity and at least $50,000 to the U.S. Chamber of       Commerce.        At the same time, Issue One found that labor unions       accounted for about $1 of every $8 raised between July 2009       and June 2017 by a dark money group known as the VoteVets       Action Fund--which has touted itself as the ``largest       progressive organization of veterans in the United States,''       In all, the VoteVets Action Fund raised more than $5.6       million during this time from labor unions, with significant       union donors including the American Federation of Government       Employees, the United Association of Journeymen and       Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry and the       American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees       (AFSCME).        Issue One's analysis additionally revealed that more than       two dozen of the nation's largest trade associations have       contributed to many of the top dark money groups in recent       years. Some have even contributed to three, four or five of       the top 15 dark money groups since Citizens United.        For instance, the American Petroleum Institute (API), the       Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and       Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)       each contributed to five of the top 15 dark money groups       during the past eight years.        PhRMA alone, in recent years, has contributed $12 million       to the American Action Network--a dark money group launched       in 2010 by former Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN) and GOP fundraiser       Fred Malek.        Another large donor identified on the other side of the       ideological spectrum: The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation,       a private foundation that is primarily funded by billionaire       investor Warren Buffett and that is named for his late wife.       The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation has contributed $26       million to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund since 2012,       earmarking these funds for ``the charitable purpose of       reproductive health advocacy.''
