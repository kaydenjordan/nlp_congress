 Madam Speaker, 10 years ago, the Bluffs  Restaurant, a wonderfully historic establishment on the Blue Ridge  Parkway in the Fifth District, closed its doors. Today it is reopening  thanks to over 500 donors who contributed more than $1 million for  repairs.   In 1949 the Bluffs was the first restaurant to open on the Blue Ridge  Parkway, and it served customers for more than 61 years. Generations of  families have passed through its doors, and they have returned time and  again. For them it is not just about the food, it is also about the  countless memories that have been made there.   My plan was to attend the reopening event today. Unfortunately, I  could  [[Page H4254]]  not. But I still want to thank owners Shana Whitehead and Bill Heath  for reopening and wish them the best in this endeavor.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, during my time in this  Chamber I have devoted myself to finding the truth and working toward  good governance. That requires gathering the facts and exposing the  lies. It is in this light that I rise today to oppose H.R. 8015, the  so-called Delivering for America Act.   H.R. 8015 aims to solve a made-up crisis by forcing the Postal  Service to double down on the very same activities that have caused it  to lose money consistently each year since 2006. Then they give the  Postal Service another $25 billion to lose with no strings attached.   Mr. Speaker, there is no immediate Postal Service crisis. Democrats  manufactured this crisis and are using it to create fear and advance  their agenda. The Postal Service currently has $14 billion in cash on  hand, which is enough to sustain operations through August of 2021.  This comes on top of the fact that the Postal Service has not even  touched the $10 billion loan that Congress extended to it in the  recently passed CARES act.   The Postal Service has many long-term problems, but there is no  short-term crisis. If Democrats were serious about ensuring the  longevity of the Postal Service, we would finally pass bipartisan  measures like the Postal Service Reform Act of 2017 that was championed  by former Representatives Meadows and Cummings. This bill would enact  meaningful reforms, keep mailing costs down, encourage innovation, and  not require additional taxpayer bailouts.  [[Page H4273]]    Our current Postmaster General DeJoy took the job despite being  vilified in public. He was unanimously selected by the bipartisan U.S.  Postal Service Board of Governors because the board saw tremendous  value in his decades of experience managing and growing a successful  nationwide logistics company. He certainly had the qualifications to  work with Congress and take on the task of postal reform.   Mr. Speaker, we need long-term solutions to fix the long-term  problems of the Postal Service. H.R. 8015 merely aims to score  political points on an issue that does not even exist. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
