 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2694, the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act.   House Republicans have long supported protections in Federal law for  all workers, but especially pregnant workers, and we believe employers  should provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers,  empowering them to achieve their highest potential.   I speak not only as a concerned Congresswoman on this issue but also  as a mother and a grandmother. Discrimination of any type should not be  tolerated, and no one should ever be denied an opportunity because of  unlawful discrimination.   However, there are already important protections under Federal law to  prevent workplace discrimination, including Federal laws that  rightfully protect pregnant workers.   Take the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and the Americans with  Disabilities Act, for example. These Federal laws ensure workers are  not being unlawfully discriminated against and receive reasonable  accommodations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical  conditions.   My Republican colleagues and I agree with the underlying goal of H.R.  2694. That is why Republican Members on the Education and Labor  Committee negotiated in good faith with Chairman Scott to make  important and necessary improvements to the bill, and I thank Chairman  Scott for his willingness to do so.   H.R. 2694, as introduced, did not require a pregnant worker, in order  to be eligible for an accommodation, to be able to perform the  essential functions of the job with a reasonable accommodation. This is  a sensible provision now included in the bill with additional language  that a temporary limitation, which prevents performance of an essential  function, may qualify for a reasonable accommodation.   Further, a definition of ``known limitations'' related to pregnancy,  childbirth, or related medical conditions was also initially excluded,  but the bill now includes such a definition and a requirement that  employees communicate the known limitation to the employer. This  provision will help workers and their employers understand their rights  and responsibilities more clearly.   Additionally, the original version of H.R. 2694 appeared to allow  employees a unilateral veto over offered accommodations, but the bill  now clarifies that reasonable accommodations will typically be  determined through a balance and interactive dialogue between workers  and employers, similar to the process implemented under the ADA.   The bill also now includes a provision ensuring that if an employer  makes a good faith effort to determine a reasonable accommodation  through the interactive process with the employee, the employer is not  liable for damages.   Finally, H.R. 2694, as introduced, did not limit its application to  employers with 15 or more employees, as do title VII of the Civil  Rights Act and the ADA. The bill now includes a 15-employee threshold.   These bipartisan changes were considered and incorporated in the bill  passed out of the committee in January. Unfortunately, despite the  necessary improvements made to the original bill, an important issue  remains unresolved. Namely, the legislation before us today does not  currently include a longstanding provision from the Civil Rights Act  that protects religious organizations from being forced to make  employment decisions that conflict with their faith.   To address this omission, Republicans offered an amendment to include  [[Page H4512]]  this narrow but longstanding provision when the bill was considered by  the committee. The Civil Rights Act protection, which already exists  under current law, ensures religious organizations are not forced to  make employment decisions that conflict with their faith.  Unfortunately, committee Democrats defeated this amendment on a party- line vote.   The purpose of America's nondiscrimination laws, and the agencies  enforcing them, is to give all Americans equal opportunities to  succeed. That being said, overzealous government intervention often  causes more harm than good. In the case of H.R. 2694, by failing to  include a longstanding Civil Rights Act provision, we are doing just  that. As it is currently written, H.R. 2694 will create legal risks for  religious organizations and their religiously backed employment  decisions.   Last year, a Democrat-invited witness at the committee hearing on  H.R. 2694 highlighted Kentucky's recently enacted pregnancy  accommodation law as a template for Congress to follow.   Madam Speaker, I would like to read that again. Last year, a  Democrat-invited witness at the committee hearing on H.R. 2694  highlighted Kentucky's recently enacted pregnancy accommodation law as  a template for Congress to follow. Kentucky's law includes a religious  organization protection very similar to the one found in the Civil  Rights Act and incorporated in the Republican-sponsored amendment.   At least 16 States and the District of Columbia in their pregnancy  discrimination or pregnancy accommodation laws also include a provision  similar to the Civil Rights Act religious organization protection. Even  if certain Members believe including such a provision in H.R. 2694 is  somehow unnecessary, it would do no harm to include the protection and,  in doing so, address the concerns I have raised. I remain perplexed why  Chairman Nadler and Chairman Scott continue to oppose the current law  protection.   The First Amendment guarantees all Americans the freedom of religion,  and for over 240 years, Supreme Court decisions and laws written by  Congress have maintained strong protections for religious liberty. H.R.  2694 should do so as well.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, at the sole subcommittee hearing on H.R. 2694 and at  the committee markup, Democrat members encouraged the committee to  follow the examples of States that had enacted pregnancy accommodation  laws. However, the majority of these States have laws that are  different from H.R. 2694 because they do include important protections  for religious organizations.   At least 16 States and the District of Columbia have pregnancy  discrimination or pregnancy accommodations laws that include a  religious organization protection similar to section 702 of the Civil  Rights Act. The States include Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Nebraska,  New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,  Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. It is a broad range of States in the  country.   Our attitude is the States can do this, and we already have very,  very good protections at the Federal level. Unless we are going to  follow the example of the States and include this very important  section 702 of the Civil Rights Act, then maybe we should leave this up  to the States. We should be following their example and put that  provision in this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, at the Rules Committee hearing on H.R. 2694 earlier  this week, the bill's sponsor, Chairman Nadler, said it is not  necessary to incorporate into H.R. 2694 the Civil Rights Act's  provision that protects religious organizations. He stated that because  H.R. 2694 does not repeal this provision, it will still be effective if  H.R. 2694 becomes law.   Color me skeptical; I strongly disagree. H.R. 2694 will create legal  jeopardy for religious organizations, as I have previously stated.   But for the sake of argument, let's assume the provision is  superfluous. What would be the harm in including the Civil Rights Act  provision in H.R. 2694? At worst, the provision will be duplicative  with the Civil Rights Act, causing no harm to workers or employers.   Let's remember that the Americans with Disability Act of 1990, better  known as the ADA, includes a religious organization protection similar  to the one in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ADA provision has  caused no harm.   My conclusion is that the key sponsors of H.R. 2694 are saying the  quiet part out loud in their opposition to the religious organization  protection in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   At the Rules Committee hearing this week, Chairman Scott said the  religious organization protection should not be included in H.R. 2694  because it is overinclusive and would provide too much protection. Is  the chairman saying that the existing Civil Rights Act protection for  religious organizations should also be repealed? Again, this is a  provision that has been in law for 55 years.   As I have stated previously, the longstanding Civil Rights Act  religious organization protection should be added to H.R. 2694. At  worst, it would do no harm, and, at best, it will prevent a religious  organization from being required to violate its faith.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

It is a great disappointment to me that I will be voting against this  legislation before us today. My Republican colleagues and I have long  been committed to policies and laws that empower all Americans to  achieve success, and this includes protections in Federal law for  pregnant workers. We agree that discrimination of any type should not  be tolerated, and no one should ever be denied an opportunity because  of unlawful discrimination. I will repeat that, Madam Speaker. We agree  that discrimination of any type should not be tolerated, and no one  should ever be denied an opportunity because of unlawful  discrimination.   After meaningful and necessary bipartisan improvements were made to  H.R. 2694 during the committee markup, it is unfortunate today's  legislation falls short in protecting one of our Nation's most  treasured rights, freedom of religion, the first right mentioned in the  Bill of Rights.   Democrats' refusal to include a commonsense provision that protects  religious organizations from being forced to make employment decisions  that conflict with their faith is short-sighted, disappointing, and  easy to fix.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1145     Madam Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.  [[Page H4525]]     Madam Speaker, I am in its current form.    Madam Speaker, this motion is the final  opportunity to amend this legislation and would do so without any delay  in passage.   Madam Speaker, Republicans support protections in Federal law for  pregnant workers, and we believe employers should provide reasonable  accommodations for pregnant workers.   I support the provisions in H.R. 2694, which were previously outlined  during the general debate. I also recognize that improvements to the  bill were the result of bipartisan negotiations, and I commend Chairman  Scott for his outreach in this regard.   Unfortunately, despite our agreement on these changes, there remains  an important outstanding issue that must be resolved. The bill before  us today does not include a narrow but longstanding provision from the  Civil Rights Act that protects religious organizations from being  forced to make employment decisions that conflict with their faith. The  motion to recommit adds this important protection.   This very limited provision is already in current law, and it allows  religious organizations to make religiously based employment decisions.   Without this longstanding Civil Rights Act provision, H.R. 2694 will  create confusion and legal risk for religious organizations in their  religiously based employment decisions.   At least 16 States and the District of Columbia in their pregnancy  discrimination or pregnancy accommodation laws also include a provision  similar to the Civil Rights Act religious organization protection.   In fact, a Democrat-invited witness at a committee hearing  highlighted Kentucky's recently enacted pregnancy accommodation law as  a template for Congress to follow. Kentucky's law includes a religious  organization protection very similar to the one found in the Civil  Rights Act.   At the Rules Committee hearing on H.R. 2694 earlier this week, the  bill's sponsor, Chairman Nadler, said it is not necessary to  incorporate into H.R. 2694 the Civil Rights Act provision that protects  religious organizations. He stated that because H.R. 2694 does not  repeal this provision, it will still be effective if the bill becomes  law.   At the same hearing, Chairman Scott said the religious organization  protection should not be included in H.R. 2694 because it is  overinclusive and would provide too much protection.   I strongly disagree with both of these perspectives, and I am not  sure Chairman Nadler's explanation is in line with Chairman Scott's  position.   Without the current law protection, H.R. 2694 will create legal  jeopardy for religious organizations, as I have previously stated. But  for the sake of argument, let's assume the provision is superfluous.   Madam Speaker, what would the harm be in including the Civil Rights  Act protection in H.R. 2694? At worst, the provision would be  duplicative with the Civil Rights Act, causing no harm to workers or  employers. At best, it will prevent a religious organization from being  required to violate its faith.   By adding this simple reference to H.R. 2694 from the Civil Rights  Act, we can ensure the protections in the bill are harmonized with the  protections for religious organizations found in the Pregnancy  Discrimination Act, PDA, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA.   I would also briefly like to address recent claims made by the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce--a trade association which represents few, if any,  religious employers--that, under this bill, required workplace  accommodations would not come into conflict with a religious  organization's beliefs.   The chamber acknowledges that leave, including paid leave, can be  part of a reasonable accommodation under  [[Page H4527]]  the ADA, from which H.R. 2694 incorporates the definition of reasonable  accommodation. Therefore, if a religious organization has a paid leave  policy, H.R. 2694 could require the organization to allow paid leave  for purposes that conflict with its religious tenets.   The chamber also contends that H.R. 2694 is not a bill that addresses  hiring, unlike the PDA and the ADA, which apply to hiring. This is  false. H.R. 2694 applies to both employees and job applicants, so it is  indeed a hiring statute.   Therefore, the religious organization protections in the Civil Rights  Act and the ADA are just as relevant to H.R. 2694 as they are to those  statutes.   Madam Speaker, to conclude, the motion to recommit includes H.R. 2694  in its entirety, with one important addition related to religious  organization protections. My amendment simply incorporates the title  VII religious organization protection to ensure these organizations are  not forced to violate their faith in making employment and  accommodation decisions.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this simple but  important addition to the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
