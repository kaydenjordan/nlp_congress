 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and the chairman  and the entire House Foreign Affairs Committee for knowing the  importance of this.   I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 272. With this resolution,  we are reaffirming, as a House, as an institution of the U.S.  Government, our unwavering commitment to bring Paul Whelan home.   Paul has been wrongfully imprisoned in Russia for more than 4 years.  He is a native Michigander. Representative Stevens and I now share him.  He is my constituent, but he has got two women you don't want to tick  off and are not going to stop until we bring him home.   His parents are my constituents and our entire Michigan delegation-- we don't put a party in front of it--stands united in this effort. His  imprisonment continues to be an affront to due process, international  law, and human rights.   We have witnessed increasingly bold and reckless action by Russia in  wrongfully detaining American citizens. This is unjust, it is  unconscionable, and it is unacceptable. Our people are not political  pawns.   We must pursue every avenue to secure his immediate release, and I  will work with everyone here and throughout our government to make that  happen.  [[Page H2800]]    Paul needs hope. I hope he sees all of us today. His family  desperately needs hope. This House of Representatives needs to send a  strong message to the Russians that Paul is not a pawn in international  relations, and we all want him home. The House needs to tell Paul and  his family today, we need to send a message that we aren't forgetting  you, we are fighting hard, and we will never give up.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this  important resolution. This is an opportunity for this body to once  again demand, with one unified voice, the immediate release of Paul  Whelan. It is far beyond time we bring him home.
