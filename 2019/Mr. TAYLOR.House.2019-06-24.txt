 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the service of  Frisco Police Chief John Bruce, who completed his last days as acting  chief in May.   Chief Bruce has been with the Frisco Police Department for more than  23 years. After accepting the position as police chief in 2013, he has  been responsible for ensuring the safety of more than 185,000  residents.   The Frisco community appreciates Chief Bruce's willingness to serve  those around him. His dedication to protecting his community has not  gone unnoticed.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in thanking Chief  Bruce for his service and wishing him the best of luck in his journey  ahead.                            ____________________
