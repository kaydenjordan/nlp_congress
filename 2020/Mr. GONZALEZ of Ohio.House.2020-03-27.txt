 Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 is hitting our country  hard and fast, but Americans across our country and in my home district  in northeast Ohio are rallying together to confront and overcome this  latest challenge.   In Ohio's 16th District, we have seen restauranteurs with now-empty  dining rooms making free meals for students in Green Local School  District. We have seen businesses, like Buehler's Grocers, do  everything they can to prevent layoffs and support employees who come  to work every day to ensure their shelves are stocked for those who  need it.   Our hospitals are bracing for impact, but we have seen our healthcare  providers, like at the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals,  working their hardest to innovate through this crisis by developing  their own tests and launching drive-through testing facilities.   Our great Governor, Mike DeWine, is setting the gold standard of  leadership in response to this crisis. He is taking decisive action to  flatten the curve and save lives in the Buckeye State.   This bill provides critical resources for those who need it most: our  heroic healthcare workers, our small businesses, the unemployed, and  our local leaders who are fighting this virus on the front lines.   Mr. Speaker, I vote ``yes.''
