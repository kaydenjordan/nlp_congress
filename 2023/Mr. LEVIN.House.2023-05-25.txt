 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to House  Republicans holding our economy hostage and planning to slash billions  of dollars from veterans' services and benefits in return for  maintaining the full faith and credit of the United States.   Republicans are delivering a one-two punch to veterans. First, their  default on America act would slash $30 billion from veterans' services,  eliminate housing vouchers for 50,000 homeless veterans, and cut 81,000  jobs from the Veterans Health Administration. They can say whatever  they want, but this is what they voted for.   Second, Republicans just released a bill to gut the healthcare  funding we promised to toxic-exposed veterans in the PACT Act.   How about instead of cuts to veterans' services and benefits, we  reduce our deficit by ending tax loopholes for the ultra wealthy and by  ensuring the largest corporations pay their fair share?   House Democrats are united in opposition to Republicans' veteran  funding cuts, and we will not go back on the progress we have made.    As we all head into this Memorial Day weekend, we must do better. We  must not default on our debts. Let's keep our promises to our veterans.                            ____________________
