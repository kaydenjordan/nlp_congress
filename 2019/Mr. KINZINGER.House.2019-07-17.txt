 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, just a quick point on that. We don't like when innocent  people are bombed, and when we look at Yemen, I think it is really  incumbent on us to see what is happening.   A legitimate government in Yemen was overthrown by Iranian-supported  rebels, and Iran, who has not sent one dollar of humanitarian aid to  support the people who have been killed. What we are talking about in  this specific resolution is actually UAE.   So, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 37. Since the emergency  declaration to  [[Page H5939]]  expedite arms sales to the Saudi-led coalition to defeat the Houthi  rebels, Congress has debated the President's exercise of the emergency  clause of the Arms Export Control Act.   This joint resolution of disapproval, along with 21 other JRDs,  intends to stop transfers to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,  and Jordan.   S.J. Res. 37 specifically blocks the transfer of Paveway precision- guided munitions to the United Arab Emirates. This technology converts  dumb bombs, like the ones used by Russia to kill innocent men, women,  and children in Syria, into precision-guided munitions, ones that are  intended to avoid civilian casualties.   We can debate whether shipments that aren't ready to be delivered  require an emergency declaration, but at the end of the day, some of  the munitions that we are discussing today have already left the shores  of the United States and are en route to the UAE. In fact, the first  tranche is en route now, and the second tranche will be leaving in  September.   Mr. Speaker, this JRD and the two up for debate today are not about  timelines for shipment. We have heard my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle argue that these arms could be used in Yemen to target  civilians. Yet, there are reports that the UAE has already withdrawn  from Yemen.    The UAE serves as a bulwark against Iranian aggression, the ongoing  threat of al-Qaida, and other terrorist groups wishing to harm the  United States, our allies, and our interests.   In contrast, the Iranian-backed Houthis, through missiles and UAE  strikes, are a threat to stability in the region. Iran and the forces  it supports, like the Houthis, are a threat to our national security  and the security of our allies. They are the number one contributor to  human suffering in Yemen.   We have seen the Iranian regime threaten international shipping in  the Strait of Hormuz, including ships belonging to the U.K., Japan, and  Norway. They have shot down an expensive military asset flying in  international airspace.   Prior to the President's emergency declaration, the head of Iran's  Quds Force called on terror groups to prepare for a proxy war with  United States and our allies. Since then, we have seen these proxies  become emboldened in their actions. Yet, we are here today debating  arms sales to the UAE on the basis that these arms transfers may be  used by our strategic ally in Yemen.   While there is no guarantee that these weapons will ever be used in  Yemen--will ever not be used in Yemen either--there are facts that show  exactly why we must continue to provide these arms to the UAE.   As a former Air Force pilot and a current pilot in the Air National  Guard, I am proud that our government would not send our Air Force to  fly sorties without the munitions needed to defend themselves.  Similarly, we should not have an ally flying our F-16s without the  necessary tools it needs to complete its mission.   The Iranians have shown that they have the capacity and ability to  fire upon military aircraft with no regard for whether the platform is  manned or unmanned. When our allies are in a dogfight, we can't leave  them without the means to defend themselves and our shared interests.   I also want to point out that there is a lot of discussion about  offensive or defensive weapons. A bomb can be used defensively or  offensively. I can't think of many weapons that are actually defensive  in nature because they are used to destroy an enemy. So it is all about  how you employ that weapon.   Saying that we want to send only defensive weapons, shows our allies  to be weak against an Iran that is shown that it wants to go on the  offensive continually. I can name basically every country in the Middle  East and show Iranian influences there.   On the broader picture, we have got to debate how this went out. I  fully agree with everybody on that. But we cannot leave our allies in  the lurch. We cannot leave them unprotected because our big, chief  enemy is Iran. I know there is broad-based agreement on that, and we  cannot show weakness in the eyes of that.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a senior member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend on the other side of the aisle. It is  a good debate here. The bottom line on this is, I think if the concern  is Saudi Arabia--I understand the concern, I may not share it in the  same level of depth--then vote ``no'' on the last resolution or vote  for the last resolution.   This one is on UAE, and whether it is Saudi, UAE, or Jordan, I think  it is important for us, Mr. Speaker, to constantly show that we have  our allies' back, especially an ally like UAE.   We know that Iran likes to go on the offensive. We know that the only  thing that stops Iran from broader encroachments in the Middle East is  the United States and our allies. We know that a good offensive posture  is the best defensive posture to prevent a shooting war from ever  happening.   So, again, we can all debate the process and how this went down, but  the bottom line is we must reject this resolution. This is a resolution  that I think is a result of political pressure, and we must send this  back to the Senate where it belongs, or if this passes then I am sure  the President will veto it.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the debate, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
