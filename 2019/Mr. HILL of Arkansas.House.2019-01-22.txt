 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  choir from Immaculate Conception Church and School in North Little  Rock, Arkansas, for being invited to represent our State at the  inaugural Dublin Choral Festival in Ireland later this year.   More than 240 voices from around the United States will sing together  at the festival, and Immaculate Conception is the only group from our  State of Arkansas.   The group of 48 parishioners, ranging in age from 10 to 87, is led by  Music Director Steve Guilmet.   While there, the choir will travel to Belfast, Northern Ireland,  where they will attend mass and perform during the service. Along with  their performances, the parishioners will be raising money to support  local hunger and poverty programs, and the parish there will host them.   I congratulate those parishioners on their hard work, and I join all  Arkansans in wishing them the very best as they represent our State in  Ireland.                    Arkansas Canoe Club Trash Removal Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of Cowper Chadbourn and the Arkansas Canoe Club Black Ops  Advanced Trash Removal team.   Cowper founded the black ops team in 2014 to promote water quality  and clean up trash in the watersheds throughout Arkansas.   Since the formation of the group, they have retrieved two giant  dumpsters, portable toilets, refrigerators, washers, stoves, and  countless tires out of our State's streams. In total, over the past 2  years, they have hauled out more than 2,400 tires and 124,000 pounds  from Arkansas waterways.   Mr. Speaker, I extend a hand of gratitude to Mr. Chadbourn and the  entire Arkansas Canoe Club Black Ops Advanced Trash Removal team for  their worthwhile commitment to our environment and our natural  resources.                           ASH Hospital of the Year     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize North  Little Rock's Arkansas Surgical Hospital for being awarded the  Physician Hospital of the Year by the Physician Hospitals of America.   This award recognizes a hospital with a long and exceptional record  of high-quality community service and leadership.   Arkansas Surgical Hospital was one of only 19 hospitals in the United  States, and the only one in Arkansas, to receive double five-star  status from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, CMS, and  obtained the highest rankings for both overall quality and patient  satisfaction.   The hospital opened in 2005 with 16 beds and 5 operating rooms, but  quickly outgrew its space. To meet increasing demand for patient care,  in 2006, the hospital broke ground on expansion that brought the  facility to 51 beds and 9 operating rooms.   The facility continues to grow and helps 15,000 patients on an annual  basis.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the dedicated workers at the Arkansas Surgical  Hospital for their service and leadership in patient-centered care in  central Arkansas.                       Arkansas Children's Beacon Award     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Little Rock's Arkansas Children's  Hospital. They have received the silver-level Beacon Award for  Excellence by the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.   The Beacon Award for Excellence recognizes unit caregivers who  successfully improve patient outcomes and demonstrate effective  leadership and communication. Arkansas Children's Hospital is the only  hospital and unit in the State to earn this recognition and one of only  497 hospitals that currently hold the award.   Its history of excellence in patient care dates back to its founding  in 1912.   As a former director and supporter of Arkansas Children's Hospital, I  congratulate them on their 106-year legacy of leadership in patient- centered care; this recognition of the Beacon award; and their  unqualified, wonderful service to the kids of Arkansas.

I was an original cosponsor, and I support the passage of H.R. 31,  the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. This legislation imposes new  sanctions on Syrian human rights abusers and those who facilitate the  regime's atrocities. It also authorizes the State Department to support  entities that are collecting and preserving that chain of evidence for  eventual prosecution of those who have committed war crimes in Syria  since the war began in 2011.   The world has witnessed many examples of butchering and genocide by  menaces throughout history: Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. They are joined in  the last 8 years by a new name, and that is Assad and his Russian and  Iranian collaborators.   Until Mr. Trump's strategic airstrikes, for the prior 8 years, the  world has blustered and twiddled while these modern menaces murdered  the innocent civilian population in Syria. Systematically, they  savagely bombed, bludgeoned, gassed, electrocuted, and tortured their  people. I have seen this evidence on full display in Washington's  Holocaust museum, and I urge all Americans to look at that exhibit.  [[Page H974]]    I have heard eyewitness testimony from the Syrian Emergency Task  Force. Listen to the horrors, Mr. Speaker:   A survivor of a gas attack told The New York Times in 2017:         My eyes were burning, my head was throbbing, and my throat       was blocked. I was suffocating. I tried to inhale, but all I       heard was a horrible rasping sound as my throat closed up. An       unbearable pain drummed in my head. The world began to blur.       I pounded my chest, but I couldn't breathe. I thought my       heart was going to explode.    Does this Congress need any more testimony, Mr. Speaker?   I commend President Trump for hearing these cries and his leadership  to carry out airstrikes to block Assad's mass murder, and I call on him  again to strengthen his resolve against Assad's barbarous acts and  think of these innocent Syrian people who face these terrible  atrocities nearly ever day.   Finally, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 31, and I call on the  Senate to not twiddle their thumbs any longer and act with expedition  and pass this legislation. Let's not waste any more time bringing Assad  and his coconspirators to justice.
