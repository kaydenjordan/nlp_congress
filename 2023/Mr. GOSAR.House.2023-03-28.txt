 Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy  Costs Act.   America has an abundant supply of minerals, oil, and gas, and my  State of Arizona ranks first among all States for non-fuel mineral  resource production.   While the mining industry is still thriving in Arizona, primarily due  to previously started mines, the Biden administration, and some in this  very Chamber, have purposely slow-walked the permitting approval  process, threatening this critically important industry.   H.R. 1 incentivizes domestic mineral production, unlocking resources  that are vital for national security, renewable energy, and new  technologies, like mineral processing, refinement, and concentration.  This typically has been sent overseas to China, which then, in turn,  monopolizes and holds these critical and rare resources ransom through  supply chains.   Sadly, Arizona has two of the last three copper smelters in the  United States, to which we hold to the highest environmental safety  standards.   Allowing China to process these minerals is a continual slap in the  face of the United States' stringent and responsible environmental  laws.   Not surprisingly, it takes more than a decade, sometimes even two, to  permit a mine in the United States. Canada can permit a mine in less  than 3 years.   H.R. 1 modernizes the Federal regulations that delay projects for  decades. H.R. 1 will help restore America as the global leader in  energy technology development and protect Arizona's mining industry  from the Biden administration and the leftists who want to shut it all  down.   Madam Chair, I applaud Chairman Westerman for his leadership, and I  urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1. The mantra should be: Now  mined in America. Now refined in America. Now built in America.
