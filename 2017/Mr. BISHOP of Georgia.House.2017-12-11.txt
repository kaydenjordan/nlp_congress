 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   This is certainly a very, very appropriate tribute. As a product of  Morehouse College, I know firsthand the important contribution HBCUs  have made in educating, training, and empowering outstanding leaders.   Morehouse College is celebrating its sesquicentennial this year.  Throughout its 150-year history, Morehouse College has made a  significant mark on our State, our Nation, and the world. Here, many  notable men gained the knowledge and the training that enabled them to  become some of the greatest influences of our time, including Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr.; noted theologian, Dr. Howard Thurman; civil  rights leader, Julian Bond; filmmaker Shelton ``Spike'' Lee; Olympic  gold medalist Edwin Moses; CEO of the Silicon Valley Community  Foundation, Emmett Carson; and many more.   Morehouse principles often instill a desire for public service to  benefit mankind. In the United States Congress, Representative Cedric  Richmond, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus; as well as  many staff members and former Members of Congress, hold degrees from  Morehouse College.   U.S. Presidents have relied on alumni, such as former Secretary of  Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson; former Secretary of Health and Human  Services, Dr. Louis Sullivan; former U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. David  Satcher; and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, James  Nabrit.   Around the country, State and local governments have been led by  alumni, such as Maynard Holbrook Jackson, the first African-American  mayor of Atlanta, Georgia.   I have the honor and privilege of representing these two HBCUs in the  Second Congressional District of Georgia: Albany State University and  Fort Valley State University.   Albany State University, with its rich history, dating back to the  trials and the triumphs faced by Joseph Winthrop Holley. Albany State  University was first founded as the Albany Bible and Manual Institute  in 1903. The school gained State funding in 1917, joined the University  of Georgia system in 1932, began offering baccalaureate degrees in  1943, and came back strong after severe floods in 1996 as Albany State  University, offering graduate programs and advanced degrees.                                time  1945    Today, the university has a total economic impact of $143 million and  supports 1,493 jobs in the Albany area. Its educational contributions  are significant. Albany State is the third in the Nation for bachelor's  degrees in education for African Americans. It offers 35 degree  programs in education, nursing, criminal justice, business  administration, public administration; and Albany State University has  produced doctors, lawyers, NASA engineers, military officers, college  university presidents, teachers, preachers, mayors, legislators,  business people, millionaires, and Olympic medalists.   The Fort Valley State University, which I have the honor of  representing, was founded 120 years ago. Fort Valley is Georgia's only  1890 land-grant institution charged with educating and empowering its  students and its surrounding community.   As many of you are aware, 1890 institutions, including Fort Valley  State University, were created to ensure access to higher education in  the agricultural and natural resource sciences to serve the underserved  and reach the unreached.   Fort Valley has always been known to not only train and graduate  tomorrow's talented leaders but to ensure that these leaders are as  diverse as the communities they serve in their skill sets, their  experiences, and their perspectives. Fort Valley State University has  excelled at this job. It generates an economic impact of $109 million  for its local and regional economy and generates 1,125 jobs.   In addition to the educational, social, and community benefits a Fort  Valley education provides, it is estimated that Fort Valley State  University increases its graduates' lifetime earnings by 61 percent.   As you can see, Historically Black Colleges and Universities are a  vital part of the fabric of our educational system. I congratulate them  for their contributions to our Nation, and I look forward to their  continued tutelage for generations of future leaders for this country  and the world.
