 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk,  specifically No. 26.    Mr. Chair, my amendment to H.R. 21 would exclude the  central California planning area from being leased for oil and natural  gas production.   The central California planning area extends from Mendocino County to  Monterey County and goes out about 400 miles off the coast of  California. Although much of this area is already protected by national  marine sanctuaries, my amendment, if attached to H.R. 21, would bolster  those protections from oil and gas drilling and stretch them further  from our coastline.   Having been raised there, raising my children there, and now as the  Representative for the central coast of California, I know firsthand  how important our oceans and our coastlines are for our environment,  for our economy, for our small businesses, for our communities, and,  yes, for our future.   That is why I stand here on the shoulders of so many people who have  done so many things to ensure the protection of our pristine coastline  in California. From utilizing zoning laws to limiting onshore  infrastructure and the designation of national marine sanctuaries, we  have fought and will continue to fight to ensure that oil drilling does  not happen off our California coast. That is why this amendment is so  important to me and to my constituents.   Of course, my constituents are concerned with high gas prices,  especially when there is an international conflict that causes gas  prices to go through the roof. The strategy of releasing oil from the  strategic reserve, specifically during those types of international  conflicts, has been used time and time again.   In 1991, George H.W. Bush did it during the Gulf war. In 2005, George  W. Bush did it during the second Gulf war. In 2011, President Obama did  it due to the Libya crisis. In 2022, President Biden did it due to  Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine.   Each time that oil was released from those reserves, gas prices were  reduced or remained stable. That is why I support this long-used  strategy without any types of conditions attached to it. The last thing  we want to do is restrict the types of tools used in the middle of a  global crisis so that the President, this administration, can lower gas  prices and help American families.   Let's be clear. Our families, my families that I represent on the  central coast of California, we don't need drilling; we don't want oil  drilling; and we will continue to do everything we can to prevent oil  drilling off our coastline. Our beauty and the bounty received through  our multibillion-dollar tourism and hospitality industry is worth so  much more.                                time  1545    The future. That is why I will always be against any oil and gas  drilling off the central coast of California, and why I will always be  a part of the longstanding tradition of fighting to protect our  environment and the future of the place that I, my family, and my  constituents call home.   Mr. Chair, that is why I urge a ``yes'' vote on amendment No. 26, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
