 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from the  Republic of Texas, Chairman Hensarling, for giving me this time to move  away some of the hyperbole that you may hear today and speak about the  truth of what this really simple and commonsense measure really does.   Mr. Speaker, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act is a bill that I  introduced simply to reduce the burden that outdated and unnecessary  Federal regulations place on our small banks and lending institutions  across the landscape of America.  [[Page H1385]]    I would like to start by thanking some of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle who have worked tirelessly to make this a strong,  bipartisan piece of legislation. I appreciate the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer) for negotiating reasonable changes to this bill  and for being an original cosponsor. I also appreciate Mr. Duffy and  Ms. Sinema and the others who have reached across the aisle to  cosponsor this important piece of legislation.   To fully understand this bill, Mr. Speaker, we have to go back to  1996, when Congress gave the financial regulatory agencies a useful  tool by passing the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction  Act, or, as you have heard today, more commonly known as EGRPRA. This  law directed the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal  Reserve, and the FDIC to review their regulations once every 10 years  to identify those regulations that may be outdated, unnecessary, or  overly burdensome. After that, the regulators were to send a report to  Congress and eliminate any regulations they determined were  unnecessary.   This law has been somewhat useful, and it was a good idea back in  1996 because, after all, who would be opposed to eliminating rules that  even regulators thought were unnecessary? But too often, EGRPRA has  been viewed as merely a check-the-box exercise by the agencies and the  financial sector.   Now that we have two EGRPRA reports, a 2007 and a 2017, it is obvious  that EGRPRA could have been more effective and produced more useful  recommendations to policymakers. In retrospect, we also realize we need  more direct action from the regulators to clean up outdated and  unnecessary rules. That is why it is important for Congress to revisit  EGRPRA, as this bill does.   My bill contains several reforms to the EGRPRA review process that  will breathe new life into this law, this tool for the regulators, and  make sure it is not simply a check-the-box exercise.   This bill will require more frequent regulatory reviews by moving the  review cycle from once a decade to once every 7 years. It will expand  EGRPRA to include all regulated financial institutions instead of only  depository-insured institutions. It will codify the National Credit  Union Administration into EGRPRA, since the agency participated in the  latest review voluntarily.   The bill will also add the controversial Consumer Finance Protection  Bureau, CFPB, to the EGRPRA review process. This provision is  especially important because, before Dodd-Frank, consumer financial  laws were implemented by the three banking agencies; but when Dodd- Frank was enacted, the CFPB was given the responsibility for enforcing  consumer financial laws. Since the CFPB is exempt from EGRPRA, these  laws and regulations are no longer being comprehensively reviewed.   Dodd-Frank requires the CFPB to review its regulations every 5 years  after they are enacted, but this leaves out rules which are considered  nonsignificant. It also excludes rules that were adopted before the  CFPB was created. Also, the CFBP's regulatory reviews are under a  single, 5-year look-back period.   We must ensure that each regulatory agency is comprehensively  reviewing its rules, and on a regular basis.   This bill is not duplicative because it requires CFPB to use its  findings from its existing regulatory reviews in its EGRPRA reports so  the CFPB does not waste time on rules it has already reviewed. And,  most importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill will require the agencies to  tailor rules that they find to be unnecessary based on the size and  risk profile of the bank or the credit union.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to repeat that last point because it is so  important. This bill does not require the agencies to cut regulations  with a broad brush, as it has been presented so far, nor does it cut  regulations on the payday lending industry, as some have argued. It  simply states the rules will be adjusted based on a company's risk if  the regulators determine that to be appropriate.   The bill ensures that if the financial regulators--the regulators-- determine that a regulation is important to consumer protection for  safety and soundness, the agency will still have every right to leave  that regulation completely intact.   This bill is not just about eliminating unnecessary regulations; it  is about good government and cleaning up unnecessary red tape that  inevitably hurts the consumer.   Mr. Speaker, the Treasury Secretary came to our committee for a  hearing last month, and I asked him about this very issue. He simply  said:         Rules and regulations need to be constantly looked at as       markets continually change.    He also said:         I'm not sure why the CFPB was exempted from EGRPRA, so I       agree with the change.    Mr. Speaker, this bill passed out of committee with a strong  bipartisan vote of more than two-thirds of the committee members, and I  urge my colleagues to join us in support of this bill.
