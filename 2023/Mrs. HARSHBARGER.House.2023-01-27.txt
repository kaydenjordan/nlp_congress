 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Buddy Carter from  Georgia, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because our veterans deserve better.   Our Active-Duty servicemembers and veterans chose to serve this great  Nation knowing it would take unimaginable sacrifice and precious time  away from their loved ones.   Many of them left their lives behind and were taken to far corners of  the world to face enemies of democracy. They did this for us, for our  freedom, for our ability to stand here today without fear of  persecution.   This is a sacrifice we should all feel indebted to, including those  people at Express Scripts. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the  company, it is a Cigna-owned pharmacy benefit manager, known as a PBM,  that administers the TRICARE benefits on behalf of the Department of  Defense.   Last year, the Department of Defense allowed this PBM--and this was  suddenly and without warning--to institute pharmacy network changes  that impacted 400,000 TRICARE beneficiaries by removing almost 15,000  independent community pharmacies from the retail network.                                time  1400    Most people in this country live 5 minutes from a pharmacy. They have  immediate access to a pharmacist. They don't have to make an  appointment, and they can go in and talk to that professional.   Most of those pharmacies are now excluded. They are located in rural  and underserved areas. These people are no longer able to rely upon  their local pharmacy to access needed medications and in-person  pharmacist counseling.   These TRICARE beneficiaries and their families are being forced to  drive sometimes long distances to find a corporate, in-network  pharmacy, or if they can't do that, they are funneled into an Express  Scripts mail order program, and that is unacceptable.   This abrupt change by PBM giant Express Scripts is especially  problematic for a small group of TRICARE beneficiaries who are  chronically ill, that have a disability and receive infusion  medications in their homes.   It will almost certainly delay care for those patients with chronic  conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, cancer, and  diabetes.   By the way, I am talking to oncology groups now that are absolutely  tracking that these patients do not get their medicine in time, or go  without their cancer drugs, and it causes an immediate response and a  degradation of their health based on the cancer that they have.   The department's decision to carry on with this contract despite the  grave impacts we all knew would impact our veterans and servicemembers  is reprehensible.   Veterans and Active-Duty servicemembers and their families are losing  access to quality care, and those with cancer and rare diseases are  often being faced with the impossible choice of switching to a new  pharmacy that may be far, far away or paying out of pocket to stay with  the pharmacy they have come to know and trust.   America made a promise to our veterans. We promised to take care of  those who have risked their lives to defend us. Leaving our heroes in  jeopardy to line the pockets of a multibillion dollar PBM is  inexcusable.   As a licensed pharmacist for over 30 years, I know how much a  community leans on their trusted, independent pharmacist, and  especially in rural areas like I serve and like Buddy serves.   It is true that pharmacists are still one of the most accessible  healthcare providers in the United States. Trusting the pharmacist  dispensing one's medicines has a very real impact on health outcomes  and costs for the patients.   I thank Congressman Buddy Carter for his leadership on this important  issue. Buddy and I were both pharmacists in our former careers, we  still are pharmacists, and we know firsthand just how much this policy  will hurt health outcomes.   Our veterans and Active-Duty servicemembers deserve to trust that  they can access the medication that they rely on, and they deserve to  have strong advocates against these greedy PBMs.   They deserve all our thanks and more. They deserve so much better.  The Department of Defense must reverse this grave injustice, and I  won't stop fighting until our heroes get what they have earned and what  they are owed.
