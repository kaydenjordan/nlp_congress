 Mr. President, I want to honor a very special  North Dakota resident who turned 100 years old on July 17. Margaret  Michalski Dagman has been a lifelong resident of the Nome and Enderlin,  ND, area. She and her late husband, Vernon, raised two children and  farmed for many years near Enderlin. They were active in their  community, and Margaret supported Vernon during his years representing  Ransom County in the North Dakota Legislature in the early 1960s.   Throughout the decades of her life across the past century, Margaret  has experienced great moments in North Dakota's history. She shared her  memories of attending the Nome Schoolhouse in a recent video produced  about the restored building. She recalled bringing lunch to school in  syrup pails, the many poems she and her classmates were required to  memorize, and some of her favorite teachers. Although a large  celebration did not happen on Margaret's birthday, the community of  Enderlin drove by her home and honked with birthday wishes. I hope she  will be able to celebrate this great milestone with friends and family  at other opportunities throughout the year.   North Dakota is home to more than 200 centenarians, and we consider  them among our most treasured residents. Their pioneer spirit, dignity,  and hard work have brought them through many challenges and personal  achievements. On behalf of all North Dakotans, I wish Margaret a happy  100th birthday and hope this is the start of a year filled with  happiness and joy.                            ____________________
