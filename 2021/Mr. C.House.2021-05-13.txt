 SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because  businesses are getting hammered by the destructive economic policies of  the Biden administration.   I just returned from my district in Florida, where, despite an  overall strong economy, local business owners are struggling to find  employees. Whether it is our local builders' association, manufacturers  like Tampa Armature Works, food producers at RollinGreens, hospitals,  or my favorite restaurants, this problem exists across every business  sector.  [[Page H2276]]    It defies all principles of free-market economics that we see ``help  wanted'' signs in shop windows across America the same day the Biden  administration posted one of the worst jobs reports in recent memory.   Why is that? At a time when over 150 million Americans have received  vaccinations, and we are finally emerging from the pandemic, why is the  economy going in the wrong direction at an accelerating rate?   It is simple. Biden administration policies are incentivizing people  to remain out of the workforce. Our government should be encouraging  people to work, not implementing policies that jeopardize the  livelihoods of Americans.                            ____________________     SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during  National Police Week when America joins our law enforcement community  to honor our fallen officers.   Sadly, our police force faces unprecedented attack. Last year, 394  law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty, nearly double  the amount from 2019. In only one year in all of American history,  1930, were there more law enforcement deaths.   Despite these staggering losses, some in this body are seeking to  defund the police, diminishing their ability to protect and defend our  communities and themselves.   While we must be ever vigilant to root out the bad apples, we cannot  forget the overwhelming majority who put themselves in harm's way every  day and serve with honor and integrity.   I am grateful for the efforts of the excellent law enforcement  officials in my district. I stand with these incredible sheriffs and  chiefs and the officers they lead, and I thank them for their service  on behalf of the citizens of Florida.
