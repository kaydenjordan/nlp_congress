 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  call up H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's  border crisis.    Mr. Speaker, title 42 is the only thing  keeping President Biden from fully handing our border to cartels and  smugglers already taking full advantage of his incompetence and  neglect.   Last week, the Biden administration announced that they will be  stopping Border Patrol from enforcing COVID-19 restrictions on illegal  immigrants by ending title 42.   Title 42 must stay in place. It is a matter of national security, and  my colleagues and I are calling on Democrats to act in a bipartisan  effort to  [[Page H4385]]  force a vote on the bill to keep it in place.   Biden's open border policies are an unmitigated disaster. The crisis  at our southern border is out of control and our Customs and Border  Patrol is already dangerously overwhelmed.   Ending title 42 expulsions will signal to cartels and migrants that  our border is now wide open, inciting more violence and lawlessness.   It is also being reported that the Biden administration is going to  divert resources from our veterans in order to give free medical care  to illegal migrants.   I wrote a letter to the secretary of Veterans Affairs to oppose these  efforts because we must put our heroes first and stand up for our  veterans.
