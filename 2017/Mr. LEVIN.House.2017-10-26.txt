 Mr. Speaker, the Republican budget politically paving the  way for their tax reform proposals can best be described as an elixir  of growth, a magic cure-all. Instead, it is a fake, indeed dangerous,  potion.   History has shown that a huge tax cut, primarily for the very wealthy  and large corporations, does not promote growth, and will make life  harder for the middle class and everyone else.   This budget calls dangerously for raising our debt by $1.5 trillion,  creating a future deficit tax for middle-income families; cutting  Medicare by nearly $500 billion; cutting Medicaid and other health  programs by $1.3 trillion; and assuming $4 trillion in cuts to a broad  range of programs, which could include education and health research.   Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on this budget.
