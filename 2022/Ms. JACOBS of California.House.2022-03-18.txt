 Madam Speaker, Congressman Vargas and I  rise today to celebrate the incredible life of Francine Maigue and the  indelible mark she left on San Diego.   Francine was an artist, an advocate, a journalist, a motivational  speaker, and, as so many in San Diego knew her, a public servant.   As district director in the California State Assembly, Francine made  sure that San Diegans had equitable access to the resources they needed  and deserved.   Even after her cancer diagnosis in 2019, Francine kept working to  serve our community while also becoming a powerful advocate for cancer  research.   Francine was a proud advocate for San Diego's Filipino and Asian- American communities. She served as the president of the Filipino- American Chamber of Commerce of San Diego County and proudly  highlighted the Filipino experience across the country and around the  world.   Last month, Francine passed away after her battle with cancer.   Congressman Vargas and I join so many from across San Diego in  sending our condolences to Francine's family, friends, and loved ones.  May her memory be a blessing.                            ____________________
