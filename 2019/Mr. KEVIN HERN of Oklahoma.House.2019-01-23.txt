 Mr. Speaker, just a few minutes ago, we  voted to fund Federal pay through the end of the shutdown. Republicans  voted unanimously with bipartisan support from 10 Democrats. If we had  just eight more Democrats, our Federal workers would be getting  paychecks. Now hardworking Americans are facing a second zero-dollar  paycheck.  [[Page H1161]]    President Trump has asked Democrats to work with him to find a way to  reopen the government and pay our furloughed employees, but Speaker  Pelosi didn't even listen to the President's proposal before she  rejected it this weekend.   This is ridiculous. The President offered a legitimate proposal with  the compromises that Democrats asked for, the same priorities that  Speaker Pelosi talked about just last year. In return, he wants the  funding to solve the crisis at our border.   This is bigger than partisan games. This is the lives and livelihood  of hundreds of thousands of Americans. Let's stop stonewalling, stop  the theatrics, and do our jobs.                            ____________________
