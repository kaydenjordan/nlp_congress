 Mr. President, on January 24, I was not present due  to an injury sustained on January 21 and a resulting surgery from which  I am still recovering. Had I been present, I would have voted yea on  rollcall vote 8, motion for attendance, and rollcall vote 10, Schumer  amendment No. 6. I would have voted nay on rollcall vote 9, Shelby  amendment No. 5.                            ____________________
