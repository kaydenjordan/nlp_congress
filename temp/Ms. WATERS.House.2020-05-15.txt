 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6800, the  HEROES Act. This legislation includes a number of important proposals  from the members of the Financial Services Committee and builds upon my  proposal for more direct payments to families by providing a second  round of stimulus payments for up to $6,000 per household.   I am pleased that this bill includes legislation championed by myself  and Representatives Heck and Scott to create a $100 billion emergency  rental assistance fund and a $75 billion homeowner assistance fund.   The bill also provides $11.5 billion for homeless assistance grants  and $1 billion for new Section 8 vouchers to support persons  experiencing homelessness.   The HEROES Act also suspends negative credit reporting for all  consumers. And to ensure that consumers, small businesses, and  nonprofits can weather the pandemic, the bill suspends debt collection  and requires forbearance and loan modifications for consumer and  commercial loans.    The HEROES Act strengthens the Defense Production Act to supercharge  the production of diagnostic tests and personal protective equipment to  protect our brave essential workers and help save American lives.   Importantly, the legislation also provides new funding and expands  technical assistance, government deposits, and partnerships to support  our Nation's community development financial institutions, known as  CDFIs, and minority depository institutions, MDIs, which serve our low- income communities particularly hit hard by the pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, we are obligated to protect our Nation. The HEROES Act  represents the response America needs to meet this crisis, so I urge  all Members to support this critical legislation.   We hear Members on both sides of the aisle talking about how much  they love America, how much they love their constituents. Put up or  shut up. Now is the time to do it.
