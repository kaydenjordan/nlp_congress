 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory and  incredible accomplishments of Katherine Johnson, a brilliant  mathematician whose trailblazing work was instrumental in America's  space exploration.   Ms. Johnson passed away earlier this week at the age of 101 leaving  behind a legacy not only of genius and dedication, but also of vitally  important advancement in STEM fields for women and African Americans.   Ms. Johnson's affinity for numbers was evident from an early age. She  graduated from high school early and went on to study math and French  at West Virginia State College. Later, she became the first African  American woman to attend graduate school at West Virginia University.   In 1953, Katherine Johnson accepted her first computing job with the  agency that would become NASA. Despite intense discrimination  throughout her years at NASA, she remained committed to advancing  America's space program and broke barriers where she could. Eventually,  she hand-calculated the flight path for America's first crewed space  mission in 1961 and also helped calculate the trajectory for the famed  Moon landing.   When astronaut John Glenn prepared for his orbit around the Earth in  1962, he asked for Johnson to verify the calculations in NASA's new  computer tracking system. He said: ``If she says the computer is right,  I will take it.''   The impact of Katherine Johnson's groundbreaking work in math and  science can hardly be overstated. American space exploration reached  many of its milestones when it did due to her genius and commitment.  Her perseverance also opened doors for women and African Americans in  work fields previously closed to them.   I stand with my colleagues in the House and countless Americans in  gratitude to Ms. Johnson's hard work and pioneering spirit that have  undoubtedly made America a better place.                            ____________________
