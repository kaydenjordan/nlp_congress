 Mr. Speaker, 44 years ago, because of Roe v. Wade, over  58 million children were taken from the chance to utter the words of  the psalmist in Psalm 139 when he said:         For you formed my inward parts; you wove me in my mother's       womb. I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and       wonderfully made; wonderful are your works, and my soul knows       it very well. My frame was not hidden from you, when I was       made in secret, and skillfully, wrought in the depths of the       Earth; your eyes have seen my unformed substance; and in your       book were all written the days that were ordained for me,       when as yet there was not one of them.    Mr. Speaker, those lives were lives of children that were created,  uniquely formed with a purpose that God only intended. Our Nation did  wrong. We can turn from that. We can ask Him to heal our land. And even  as the psalmist said:         Behold, children are a gift of the Lord, the fruit of the       womb is a reward.    We can again affirm that and say that they should be given a choice-- that little girl, that little boy--making a choice for life, and who  knows what that would do to impact our world for the good.                            ____________________
