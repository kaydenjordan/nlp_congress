 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring awareness to the  issue of motorcycle profiling.   This week, I joined Congressman Burgess, my fellow co-chair of the  Congressional Motorcycle Caucus, to introduce a resolution that  encourages  [[Page H2838]]  greater collaboration between the motorcycle community and law  enforcement officials to prevent instances of profiling.   There is no doubt, motorcycles represent more than just a mode of  transportation to those of us who ride them. They often signify a sense  of freedom, identity, and camaraderie. In Michigan, we have thousands  of local riders and many more who come from out of State to enjoy our  Great Lakes, scenic highways, and the great outdoors.   As an avid motorcyclist myself, I have heard from many in the riding  community who felt that they had been profiled by law enforcement at  least once, oftentimes solely because of their motorcycle-related  apparel. While I certainly support actions taken to enforce violations  of the law, we should all be concerned about profiling of riders based  on their attire and absent any wrongdoing.   To be clear, motorcyclists have a deep appreciation for our Nation's  law enforcement officers. We understand the difficulties they face on a  daily basis, and we are not disparaging that in any way. Our resolution  simply seeks to bring increased awareness and encourage a cooperative  effort to address an issue that affects many of our constituents in the  motorcycle community.   By having an open dialogue, I hope we can foster a greater  understanding of the issues surrounding motorcycle profiling and ensure  our roads and highways are safe for all to enjoy.                       Recognizing the Maitland Family     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jim and Cheri  Maitland of Jackson, Michigan. The Maitlands recently made history by  becoming the first family to visit all 418 national parks and units.  From Alaska to the River Raisin National Battlefield Park in Monroe,  Michigan, they have logged more than 300,000 miles over the span of 8  years. The Maitland children, Jamison and Gerald, each have an  impressive collection of Junior Ranger badges from learning about all  the parks.   The family earned the nickname the ``Parkbound Maitlands'' after  watching a documentary series on America's national parks, which then  sparked a desire on their part to see the beauty across our great land.    When the Maitlands are not exploring in their RV, you might find them  volunteering at River Raisin National Battlefield Park in Monroe,  Michigan. It is a wonderful park and destination in our community where  the family has spent more than 1,000 volunteer hours.   Their philosophy is to leave each park a little bit better than how  they found it.   Madam Speaker, I share the Maitlands' love of the outdoors and our  national park system. This is truly a remarkable accomplishment and one  that makes me pretty jealous.   Congratulations to the Maitland family on your incredible journey. I  am grateful for your commitment to keeping our parks in pristine shape.                            ____________________
