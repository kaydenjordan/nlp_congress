 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Hot Springs Volunteer  Rescue Squad for 60 years of serving the people of Bath County.   Since 1963, the Hot Springs Rescue Squad has provided emergency  medical services to its citizens including cardiac care, cave rescue,  vehicle rescue, search and rescue, and water rescue, along with  treatment and transport for medical and trauma patients.   With 1 paramedic, 3 intermediate, 6 advanced, 5 drivers, and 20 basic  providers, the squad responds to multiple calls for service weekly, and  each one of the team members conducts their job professionally and  swiftly.   Throughout its history, the Hot Springs Rescue Squad and its members  have been nominated and received multiple awards, including the first- place trophy at the State EMT competition in Roanoke.   The Squad's longevity stands as a testament to the civic spirit of  the town and an example we should all follow: to always lend a helping  hand.   I congratulate again the Hot Springs Volunteer Rescue Squad on their  60th anniversary, and I wish them many more years of success.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 922, I call up  the bill (H.R. 357) to require the head of an agency to issue and sign  any rule issued by that agency, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 357.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 357, the Ensuring  Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act. This bill will increase the  accountability of policymakers in the executive branch. It is a matter  of good governance that will benefit the American people.   This bill should not be controversial.   Madam Speaker, 3,168 is the number of final rules enacted by Federal  agencies in 2022. During that same year, Congress passed just 247 laws.  This statistic helps to illustrate just how much Federal law comes from  unelected officials in the administrative state and not from Congress.   Moreover, under current law, some of the bureaucrats who initiate,  enact, and enforce regulations lack direct political accountability.  For example, according to one analysis, between 2001 and 2017, more  than 70 percent of the rules issued by the Department of Health and  Human Services were issued by career employees. That number is more  than 98 percent for the Food and Drug Administration over the same  period. Ninety-eight percent of the rules issued by the FDA are issued  by career employees and not by elected officials or by officials who  were confirmed by the Senate. Nonetheless, they impose binding legal  obligations on Americans.   This is not representative government working as it should. President  Trump had a solution for reining in the rulemaking power of career  bureaucrats. Executive order 13979 generally required notice-and- comment rules to be initiated and signed by executive branch officials  who were politically accountable, not career civil servants. President  Biden, however, revoked this policy within weeks of taking office.   H.R. 357, the Ensuring Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act, would  remedy this mistake. The bill generally requires that only politically  accountable officials and not career bureaucrats initiate and issue  regulations. By codifying this limitation on agency rulemaking  authority, H.R. 357 helps to restore the accountability of the  administrative state.   The bill will increase political accountability for Federal  policymaking and restore the right of the American people to choose who  governs them.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the gentleman from New York talked about the Senate  having to waste its time confirming individuals to positions so that  they can address these regulations, but the Senate needs to do their  job. They need to advise and consent on the nominees from the  administration.   The Senate has a means by which to address whatever challenges the  gentleman raises, and the President also has the means by which to  address these concerns through the process of recess appointments. Now  that is not a very commonly used solution anymore, but the President  does have that power. So there are ways to address the gentleman's  concerns.   In addition, there is an exception to these requirements in the bill.  If the head of an agency determines that compliance would impede public  safety or security, all that needs to happen is for them to submit a  notification disclosing the reasons for the exemption  [[Page H6838]]  to the OIRA administrator in publishing the notification in the Federal  Register.                                time  1445    Finally, I would state that the $14,684 figure is the amount per U.S.  household each year that agency rules cost American families. That  $14,000 is an amount that not a lot of families have right now thanks  to the inflation that has been caused by the massive spending of the  last Congress and the Biden administration.   To my recollection, 17 percent over the course of the Biden  administration has been the cumulative inflation rate over the last 3  years.   This amount of money has hit especially hard, and we would do well to  address that and keep that in mind as we seek to reduce the number of  regulations that these bureaucracies are promulgating each and every  day. We need to try and think of the American people first as we seek  to legislate on their behalf here in the House of Representatives.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.   I want to point out that when she talks about water, we are all  concerned about safe water, and that would qualify as an exemption  under this bill if the head of the agency determined that compliance  would impede public safety or security. They would only need to submit  that notification and publish it in the Record.   I say that this bill does actually consider that circumstance. I also  state that the letter the gentlewoman put into the Record is coming  from an association of government employees who are the very  bureaucrats having their powers removed by this bill. It makes sense  that those who are being removed from the status quo would oppose the  bill. It makes sense that those whose powers are being taken away to  promulgate these regulations and impose these costs on American  businesses and families would oppose this bill. I would be surprised if  they didn't oppose the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6840]]         Madam Speaker, I appreciate the words of the gentleman and  agree we are seeking to find common ground, even though I would oppose  the motion to recommit. I would state that when the ranking member of  the committee mentioned that the rules have to be promulgated by the  senior appointee who has to be confirmed by the Senate, the initiation  of the regulation need only be done by the senior appointee regardless  as to whether they have been approved by the Senate. It is only before  the actual rule would be prevented does the nominee have to be  confirmed by the Senate. The process can begin by a senior appointee  who has not yet been confirmed by the Senate, which would address some  of the concerns about holding up nominees in the Senate.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 357,  the Ensuring Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act. As stated, this  bill requires that only politically accountable officials, not career  bureaucrats, initiate and issue regulations, the cost of which is  hurting families across this country even as it seeks to help them  through regulations.   The regulations often are meant to address health and safety  concerns. Those would be given an exemption, but those other  regulations that put costs on families, put costs on small businesses  would be curbed unless they are signed off on by a senior official who  has been appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.   This will increase political accountability for Federal policymaking  and restore the rights of American people to choose exactly who governs  them.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
