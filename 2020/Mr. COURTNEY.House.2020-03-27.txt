 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the third  COVID-19 relief package--the CARES Act. House and Senate leadership has  worked tirelessly around-the-clock to find middle ground to deliver  tangible relief to communities around the country reeling from the  impacts of COVID-19.   The final bipartisan compromise that was negotiated over the last few  days included some meaningful changes with input from the House of  Representatives, including major additional investments in the health  care sector that was missing from the original bill. These investments  include an additional $100 billion for hospitals and health care  providers, $16 billion for the production and purchase of personal  protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, and $11 billion to fund  critical, lifesaving  [[Page H1861]]  medical research so that we may better understand this virus and  someday soon, have a vaccine to stop it.   While our state and local governments are making heroic efforts to  combat COVID-19, there is no doubt they need additional support. The  revised CARES Act does just that--providing over one billion dollars at  a minimum to every state in the nation to fight this, including $1.38  billion for Connecticut. This funding will be critical to make sure we  can get the job done.   Mr. Speaker, while there is more work to be done to support our  constituents through this crisis, the CARES Act is a much-needed step  in the right direction, and I urge its immediate passage.
