 Mr. President, today I would like to recognize  AMRO Fabricating Corporation for 40 years of business in our State.  AMRO, a small family-owned business based in El Monte and Riverside,  CA, employs more than 250 people. The company has made important  contributions to NASA rocket programs, including building the large  aluminum panels for the space launch system rocket and the Orion crew  capsule. AMRO has used State and Federal grants to train high school  and college students on how to develop critical job skills, such as  aerospace welding and engineering, preparing them for good-paying jobs  in the future. Founded in 1977, AMRO marks its 40th anniversary this  year. I extend my warmest congratulations to AMRO for achieving this  milestone.                            ____________________
