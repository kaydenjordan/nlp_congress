 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2200,  H.R. 2480, and H.R. 2664, three overwhelmingly bipartisan bills curbing  and combating modern-day slavery at home and abroad.   I want to particularly thank Chairman Royce, as well as Chairman  Smith and the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Bass, the ranking  member, all who have been leaders in this area for quite some time now,  and we appreciate that very much.   As a parent, a grandparent now, and as a former teacher, I know that  education empowers children. These bills on the floor today ensure that  we are doing our utmost to allow every child across the globe the  opportunity to reach their highest potential. That is why I introduced  the bipartisan H.R. 2408, Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act,  earlier this year, along with my Democratic colleague, Robin Kelly.   By providing access to safe primary and secondary education, our bill  aims to offer educational opportunities to the approximately 62 million  girls globally who are not in school. There are 62 million girls who  are not in school.   Similarly, these three bills, and the one that we are discussing  right now on the floor today, are aimed at eradicating human  trafficking and should improve every girl's chances for a quality  education and a more peaceful and stable life, both in the United  States and abroad.   Unfortunately, there are young girls and women here in this country  who are vulnerable in the greatest country on the face of the Earth.  Obviously, the problem is much worse across the globe.   I want to thank all colleagues on both sides of the aisle for truly  working in a bipartisan fashion to at least get a handle on one of the  toughest things that we face globally, and that is child trafficking,  human trafficking, and a whole range of issues along this line.
