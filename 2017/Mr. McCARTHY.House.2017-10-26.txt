 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On  Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for  legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On  Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour  and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9  a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no  later than 3 p.m.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  tomorrow.   In addition, the House will consider H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal  Forests  [[Page H8255]]  Act sponsored by Representative Bruce Westerman.   We have all seen the devastating effects of wildfires, especially  this year. Unfortunately, the U.S. Forest Service estimates there are  still nearly 58 million acres of forest at high or very high risk of  wildfire. The bipartisan legislation builds on our recovery efforts by  giving the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management the tools  necessary to better manage our public lands.   The House will also consider H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors' Access  to Medicare Act, sponsored by Representative Phil Roe. Supported by  both Republicans and Democrats, this bill repeals ObamaCare's  Independent Payment Advisory Board--or, as most know it as, IPAB--and  gives patients more control over their healthcare and not Washington.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider legislation to extend  funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program and other important  public health priorities. Now, this was marked up earlier this month by  the Energy and Commerce Committee. This package will help low-income  children get health coverage, continue funding important health  priorities like community health centers, and do so in a fiscally  responsible manner.   I look forward to the House passing these commonsense bills next week  without delay.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   First, let me set the record straight. Yes, it did come out of  committee, and, yes, we did hold it up three times because your side of  the aisle asked us to. But the reason why we are bringing it up next  week is not because next week was the date we wanted. We wanted to get  this done long ago. But the reason why we are doing it next week is  because Minnesota is about to run out of money. And my dear friend  knows because I sat with him, even this week, trying to work something  out.   Now, we know of these health centers, and in this bill we doubled the  money for them. Of course, this bill is offset. We do it in a fiscally  responsible manner. But this is not something to play political games  with because some leadership Member wants to hold it up and go into  December. We believe committees should be able to do their work.   Now, we started out, and Committee Chair Greg Walden, three times,  was asked to delay by the ranking Democrat of the committee, even  though we know the timeline is about to hit a number of States that  cannot wait for a lack of action here.   So, yes, I am upset by this, but I am more upset about the number of  times we sat down to try to work something out. And it was only  yesterday I was told, Democrats said, no, they don't want to do  anything, so we should just go forward. That is not the way this place  should work.   If you look at this bill, I believe, if the committee had the freedom  on the other side without the leadership telling them they had to vote  ``no,'' it would have come out of the committee with a much different  vote.    Will the gentleman yield?    Right before your question, you said you had concerns  with the offsets. The gentleman knows that I reached out to him, I  don't know how many months ago, before a break, numerous times, right  over on the floor on his side of the aisle, and I said: I am very  concerned with what I am hearing on the Democratic side in the  committee; I would like to get CHIP done early. And I asked for your  assistance, and you helped.   There is one higher position on your side of the aisle who called the  Speaker numerous times and pretty much shut down your committee. So  three times we were asked to delay, and we did.   That is why, this week, I went back to all of you and said: Let's  work out if you have a difference of opinion in pay-fors.   It was not us who walked away from the table. It was the message I  was delivered from the other side of the aisle.   So I don't know why we are having this discussion. I don't know why  you are asking these questions. It is you and your side of the aisle  that have said no. It is us who said: Let's sit down and work this out.   But let me walk through a few of the pay-fors so you understand them  and so the American public can understand them, because I don't think  they are controversial.   We require health insurance companies to pay claims when they cover  Medicaid enrollees while keeping Medicaid as the payor of last resort.  Now, that saves $4 billion.   We say that individuals can't skip on their premium for 90 days and  get free coverage. That saves $5 billion.   We say if somebody wins a high-dollar lottery, those winners should  not be eligible for Medicaid.   Now, your side of the aisle voted against that in committee. So the  argument that you are making that it is not bipartisan is true. Your  side of the aisle believes that if someone wins millions of dollars in  the lottery, they should still be eligible for Medicaid.   That will save $600 million that will actually go to the disabled,  those who need this.   And what is more important, these States should not have to wait.  These States should not be put in this position. Colorado has just  announced that it will freeze enrollment. It will freeze enrollment  because you guys walked away from the table. It will freeze enrollment  because you say high-dollar millionaire lottery winners should still  stay on Medicaid.   I don't think that is where the American public believes this debate  should go. I believe that is common sense. I believe that is an area  that we can get to. Let's care for the individuals, and let's stop  playing politics with this. I am personally stunned you are even asking  about this because you know what has gone on.    Nobody did on your side of the aisle in the committee.  They all voted against that.    If the gentleman's question is if IPAB is offset, it  doesn't need to be.    No, and it doesn't need to be.    I appreciate the roundabout way of trying to get around  why you are not involved in the CHIP program, but let me explain very  easily.    I look forward to that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   CHIP is in effect; IPAB is not. It hasn't even created a board yet.  So what you are saying to me is let's offset something that hasn't even  been created.   What I am saying is the last time we had this bill on the floor, it  was bipartisan votes. Democrats voted for it as well; 43 cosponsors on  your side of the aisle.   So I don't think this question is just to me; it is probably for the  whole body. But I think the reason the majority of the body wants to  get rid of it is it hasn't even been created, and the majority of the  people think it is a bad idea. So let's get rid of it now.   And do you know what? CHIP is already in effect. What is even worse  on this process is it is in effect, but now people are freezing  enrollments.   So, if your argument why Democrats can't help us on CHIP and why they  want to defend millionaire lottery winners is somewhere that something  not created has to be offset, I don't think that is really a fair  argument.    Will the gentleman yield?    Did I hear correctly that you voted to repeal IPAB?    My question to the gentleman is: We have brought to the  floor, twice, the repeal of IPAB. Am I understanding correctly that you  voted to repeal that?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Let me repeat what happened on this floor in history.   Twice, this bill has come to the floor. Neither time--the repealing  of IPAB--has it been offset. And do you know what? Forty-three Members  on your side of the aisle joined with us. So it was the will of this  House, a majority.   But if your argument is why we cannot fund children's health, why we  cannot say that millionaires winning a lottery have to stay on  Medicaid, if that is the defense from the other side of the aisle why  they walk away from the table, I am ashamed. We are better than that,  and this House is better than that.   I told you each time--and I tell the gentleman, I know it is not you,  but there are other people on your side of the aisle who won't even  release their Members from committee.                                time  1130    I know your members on the Energy and Commerce Committee did not want  to vote ``no'' on that amendment. They don't want to defend those  millionaires for being on Medicaid and taking away from the disabled  and children. I know, in your heart, you don't want to sit back and  make CHIP have problems for States, that maybe  [[Page H8257]]  Minnesota and Colorado can't increase enrollment, that they have to  freeze it today.   We are better than this. If twice it has come to the floor without an  offset, and it is the majority of the House that voted on it and it is  43 of your members doing it, I think we should move on now. Let's get  back to the table. Let's solve this problem.    I thank the gentleman for the question, but, as the  gentleman knows, for a bill to come to the floor here, it first has to  get out of the Senate. The Senate has not voted on that bill.   I know the gentleman quotes a certain number, but I would wait to see  how many votes there are for the bill to see where it goes.   As the gentleman knows, this House has passed a bill that repealed  ObamaCare, reformed it, got us a new bill, but made those payments as  it went forward. So there is a bill sitting in the Senate that they can  take up and solve this problem at the same time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow, and  further, when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on  Tuesday, October 31, 2017, when it shall convene at noon for morning- hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.
