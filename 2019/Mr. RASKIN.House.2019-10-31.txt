 Madam Speaker, the House impeachment inquiry has  discovered a substantial body of evidence that the President of the  United States has violated the Constitution by placing his political  interests above the interests of the country, thereby putting both our  democracy and the Nation's security in jeopardy.   In light of this evidence, the House of Representatives must fully  investigate. We have sworn a sacred oath to uphold and defend the  Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and  domestic. We will honor our oath by countering all high crimes and  misdemeanors committed against the American people and our  Constitution.   Today's resolution sets the table for the next phase of the inquiry.  This phase includes open hearings, led by the Intelligence Committee,  to allow the American people to hear from witnesses who have personal  knowledge of the President's actions. Relevant materials will then be  transferred to the Judiciary Committee so we may fulfill our solemn and  time-honored duty to determine whether to recommend Articles of  Impeachment.   The majority has conducted hearings up to this point in a  scrupulously bipartisan way, giving professional staff counsel for both  the majority and the minority precisely equal time to question  witnesses and equal opportunities for members of the majority and the  minority to question them, too.    We will afford the President all the due process  protections that were afforded to his predecessors in a similar  situation. That includes the ability to attend hearings, question  witnesses, and submit evidence.   As recently as Friday, the Federal courts have reaffirmed that the  House is the sole judge of impeachment, and we set the rules here.  These rules are fair and strong and will make sure that we can and we  will defend the Constitution of the United States.
