 Mr. President, today I speak in memory of an  Alaska pioneer, a pillar of the community of Nenana, signer of the  Alaska Constitution, legendary Alaska legislator and our 6th Lieutenant  Governor, Jack Coghill, who died in February at the age of 93.   Long before statehood, the name Coghill was synonymous with the town  of Nenana. Jack's father, William A. Coghill, Sr., emigrated from  Scotland to Canada and then to Alaska in March 1907. He landed in  Valdez, hiked to the interior over the course of 10 days, and went to  work delivering the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner.   In 1916, Bill relocated about 60 miles down the road to Nenana, which  was at the time a boom town. It was home to the Alaska Engineering  Commission, which was building the railroad, a bridge, and a large  dock. Along with a partner, Bill converted an existing business into  Coghill's Store, which continues to exist today.   In the 1930s, Jack and his brothers, Bill, Jr., and Bob, began  learning the business from the ground up. They were hauling freight,  stocking shelves, assisting customers, and delivering the groceries.  Jack served in the Army in World War II. He was a staff sergeant in the  U.S. Army Alaska Command, fighting in the Aleutians. Following the war,  Jack moved home to Nenana. When Bill, Sr., died in 1947, Jack and his  brother Bob, along with their mother, took over the store. Later the  business included a movie theatre, fuel distribution, and a roadhouse.   Public service was an important part of Jack Coghill's life since the  late 1940s. He served on the Nenana School Board, and he was mayor of  Nenana for 23 years. He was elected to the Alaska Territorial  Legislature in 1952 and reelected in 1956. At age 30, he was selected  as one of 55 delegates to the Alaska Constitutional Convention. Jack  participated in the drafting of the Alaska Constitution in 1956 and was  the third individual to sign it. Post-statehood, he served in the  Alaska House of Representatives and the Alaska Senate. In 1990, he was  elected Lieutenant Governor on a ticket with Wally Hickel. Unable to  stay away from service, Jack returned to the Nenana City Council when  his term as Lieutenant Governor concluded. Until his death, Alaskans of  all generations looked to Jack for advice.   Jack and his wife Frances were parents to six children. Next to  family, Jack characterized his service on the Alaska Constitutional  Convention as his greatest achievement. Of course, that was far from  Jack's only recognition. He held an honorary doctorate from the  University of Alaska and was elected to Junior Achievement's Small  Business Hall of Fame.   One of Jack's six children is John Coghill, a friend whom I served  with in the Alaska Legislature and who serves as a member of the Alaska  State Senate today. John remembers his father as ``a firm believer in  utilizing Alaska's natural resources to build a strong economy and  provide good paying jobs for Alaska . . . He had the same passion for  Alaska, even at 93.''   With the passing of Jack Coghill, only one of the signers of the  Alaska Constitution, Victor Fischer, remains alive today. While it is  sad to part with a pillar of Alaska's history, an individual who was  instrumental in Alaska's growth from its frontier, territorial days to  today's modern State, we were blessed to have his leadership for so  many years.   It is an honor to share just a brief glimpse of the story of Jack  Coghill with my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate.                            ____________________
