 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, our economy and our Nation's workforce are  at a critical juncture. The introduction of new technology and easier  flow of people and information from one location to another have  transformed our economy and our workforce in ways that were  unpredictable and have created both benefits and risks. We need to be  careful, however, that we are not leaving Americans behind.   Several years ago, I worked with a number of colleagues to go across  the country to ask researchers and have townhalls in communities, from  California to New Jersey, what the effect on technology, in particular,  and what the future of work wages in the labor movement would be as our  work transforms.   One common theme that we heard over and over again across the  country--whether it was California, Wisconsin, Michigan, New Jersey, or  Massachusetts--was the impact that technology is having on jobs, both  good and bad, and potentially having both enormous benefit and risk.  [[Page H4534]]    Technology can be a huge benefit to workers and communities alike,  but it also has the potential to displace or eliminate jobs. California  labor unions have an impressive past of partnering with industry to  ensure that any disruption to the workforce, like technology, is done  in coordination with and in consultation with workers.   One major problem we face when trying to assess whether automation  will be good or bad for our workforce is a lack of data. This amendment  simply encourages the Bureau of Labor Statistics to start collecting  this important data on the impact that technology is having on our  workforce. We can use this data to inform policymaking to fight for  workers and the U.S. economy and create programs and policies that will  support job creation, retention, and the continued growth to our  economy, but for everyone to benefit.   Similarly, this amendment would allow for data collection on mass  layoffs. We often hear arguments that blame major job losses on  regulations, trade decisions, and other unsubstantiated claims.                                time  1615    With this data that we are asking for, we will be able to collect and  be able to clearly and honestly evaluate the effects of mass layoffs  and how we can avoid them, or at least how we can help the workers who  are affected.   The common theme for this amendment is workforce protection. It is  something we agree about on both sides, I believe. We want to create  and promote good-paying jobs for Americans and protect those jobs that  can be and should be protected.   U.S. workers deserve our best efforts to create policy that is in  their best interest. This amendment would help give us the data to do  just that, and at no extra cost.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lee), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I ask for the House's support. I think  it has been said over and over again that information is power. In this  instance, this gives us the power to protect and anticipate challenges  to the American workforce.   Mr. Chairman, I respectfully ask for support for this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the bill before us today goes a long  way to improving the health of our country. I thank the chairwoman for  her leadership and dedication to the health and well-being of all  Americans.   I am particularly pleased to see over $6 billion in funding for the  National Cancer Institute. As we all know, probably too well, cancer  affects all of us in some way. All of us have a family member, a  friend, or a neighbor who has had to go through the challenge of being  told they have cancer.   Nearly 1.8 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in 2019.  With recent advancements, however, there has never been a better time  in history to go through treatment if one has to be diagnosed with  cancer.   New treatments with ever-greater outcomes are being developed  constantly, many of them at NCI. The research done at NCI contributes  to saving countless lives each year and helps keep millions more  healthy, including myself as a cancer survivor of a form of leukemia  that, while not curable, is manageable.   Because of the groundbreaking research done at and funded by NCI, by  2016 there were over 15.5 million cancer survivors in the United States  alone. By 2026, this number will go over 20 million survivors. However,  despite the high quality of care, many patients lack the information  they need to understand their treatment and be full participants in  their care.   As a cancer survivor, I am all too familiar with the uncertainty that  follows the words, ``you have cancer.'' Doctors and health  professionals start talking at you, using terms you have never heard,  all of which matter, but little of which you understand. Research tells  us that when someone is told, and family members are told that a family  member has cancer, they only retain one in four words.   While more than two-thirds of patients surveyed are satisfied with  the care they receive, the vast majority lack knowledge about  treatment, options, and details. In fact, a recent study by NIH states  that only 45 percent of patients reported being adequately informed  about their diagnoses when told they have cancer by their physicians.   In a study in 2016, the Journal of Clinical Oncology stated that 38  percent of patients could never even remember talking with their doctor  about life expectancy.   Cancer treatment is complicated, and I can tell you it is emotional  for the people who are being treated, for their family, and for their  loved ones. Yet 73 percent of patients do not search for additional  information about their diagnoses. That is why it is so important that  cancer care providers communicate clearly and often with patients and  survivors.   This amendment will set aside $1 million for NCI to perform a study  on how to use best practices to improve communications between cancer  care providers and patients and survivors. When people have the  information they need, they can more successfully navigate treatment  and life as a survivor.   A cancer diagnosis will always come with uncertainty, but providers  can and must do more to communicate clearly to help patients, their  families and friends, and survivors to fully understand their  diagnosis, their treatment, and their lifelong care expectations. It  will allow patients to do what patients should do: fight cancer.   I thank the cosponsors of my amendment, Congressman Buddy Carter from  Georgia, who is also the co-chair of the Cancer Survivors Caucus with  myself, and Congressman Jamie Raskin, who is a member, for coauthoring  this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lee), my friend and my neighbor.    Mr. Chairman, I urge the passage of this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for the support in this  bill for the Statewide Family Engagement Center Program, and I also  thank the chair of this subcommittee for supporting the program.   This is an extremely valuable program that facilitates meaningful  family engagement for States, school districts, schools, and parents to  foster positive school environments and improved academic achievement.   Specifically, grantees are nonprofits that carry out parent education  and provide comprehensive training and technical assistance to schools  to support family-school partnerships.   Research is clear that the more involved families are in a student's  education, the better the student performs. If a parent understands the  value of the curriculum, develops relationships with teachers and  administrators at their child's school, and feels involved in the local  community as a result, the student reaps the benefits.   I was proud that a bipartisan provision I authored with Congressman  G.T. Thompson led to the creation of Statewide Family Engagement  Centers.   Unfortunately, due to an administrative oversight at the Department  of Education, a $1 million shortfall for financial year 2019 has been  created in this program. If it is not fixed, current grantees will have  to cut their budgets by 9 percent.   This shortfall will mean the 11 centers will have to cut staff or  reduce services. This will reduce the number of families, States,  schools, and school districts that these centers can serve in the 12  States across the country that have grantees.   My amendment would make these deserving grantees whole and ensure  that students and their families continue to receive the services they  deserve to help students thrive in and out of school.   This amendment truly is an easy fix to an unintended problem created  by a simple oversight. It is a commonsense amendment.   I thank my friend, Mr. Thompson, for working with us on this, and for  his support for this amendment and the program.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Chair, I just want to thank my colleague from  northern California, and I want to thank my colleague from  Pennsylvania. It has been a pleasure working with them when I was in  the minority, and it is a pleasure working with them in the majority.   This really should be nonpartisan, bipartisan. It creates a real  vehicle to improve the quality of life for children and families and  schools, and I would urge support for the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the bill before us today goes a long way  toward improving the health of our country. I commend the distinguished  chairwoman, once again, for her tireless leadership for the health and  well-being of all Americans.   One particular area where increased investments have been made in  this bill is mental health. I could not agree more on the importance of  addressing this vital component to a person's well-being.   Mr. Chairman, at a time in our history where we are having  transformative interventions and innovation in discoveries when it  comes to mental health, we have a challenge to provide more  infrastructure and more resources. I have been told that we have 75  percent more requests for services in behavioral health since the ACA  was passed with parity in it, but a 25 percent decrease in the number  of young people going into professions.   So we clearly need to do more when it comes to mental health, and  there is no place better to do more than with young people, to get them  involved in understanding that there isn't a stigma, that, like cancer,  behavioral health and mental health should be addressed with evidence- based research, and if people seek that kind of treatment, they will be  able to live full and successful lives and will get away from  generations of stigma against people who have legitimate behavioral  health issues that can be treated just as medical treatments can.   According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, approximately  one in five adults in the United States--almost 50 million Americans-- experience mental illness in a given year. Millions of children also  suffer every year from traumatic experience and mental illness.   Mr. Chair, approximately one in five young people age 13 to 18--more  than 21 percent--experience a severe mental disorder; 13 percent of  children age 8 to 15 experience a severe mental disorder at some point  in that timeframe; yet only about 50 percent of children with mental  health conditions receive the services they need.   Children who get the treatment and support they need can learn to  successfully control their symptoms, perform better in school, and have  better social and emotional outcomes throughout their lives.   When children go without treatment and support, their symptoms can  become harder to control as they grow older. In fact, adults who do not  get proper treatment as children face an increased risk of having other  chronic conditions and die, on average, 25 years earlier than others  from preventable causes--25 years because they are not getting the  treatment they need.   That is why it is so important that we address mental illness at a  young age. Children and their families must know that it is okay to ask  for help and should be taught where to look.   My amendment would improve access to mental health support for  children in a school-based environment to meet students' needs onsite.  This funding will help children who might not otherwise get mental  healthcare get the support they need in a setting they know and trust.   NIH research shows that children promoted to the next grade increases  by almost 13 percent and the average number of days children are  suspended decreases significantly as children participate in mental  health services offered at their schools.   Our teachers are already underpaid and overworked, and many teachers  report that they are the first and only support children receive for  their mental and behavioral health problems. By increasing services to  students directly in schools, we can help reduce the mental healthcare  crisis and decrease the stigma at the same time.   I urge passage of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lee), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
