 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bipartisan  amendment with Mr. Polis, Mr. King, and Mr. Ruiz.   As a former volunteer firefighter, maintaining adequate funding for  the volunteer fire assistance program is of particular importance to  me. First responders are pillars of our community, and it has been a  privilege of mine to advocate for them in Congress.   This program provides financial and technical assistance through  grants to rural communities of less than 10,000 people that are matched  by the community or State on a 50-50 basis. Grant funding for this  program can be used to obtain and repair equipment and improve fire  protection capabilities.   Ever more striking is that many of these rural fire departments often  rely on volunteers. In fact, 70 percent of all firefighters are  volunteers, over half of whom are found in rural communities.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to  provide these brave men and women the funds they need to adequately  combat wildfires and protect our communities and treasured American  landscape.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, this amendment would  reallocate $2 million to the Interior's volunteer fire assistance  program with six to eight volunteer firefighters.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
