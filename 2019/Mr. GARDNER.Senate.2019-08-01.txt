 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a giant  of Denver and Colorado's business and philanthropic community, Mr.  Roger Hutson. Mr. Hutson is the president and CEO of HRM Resources III,  which is headquartered in Denver and produces energy in Colorado,  Nebraska, Wyoming, and Kansas.   Mr. Hutson has a servant's heart. He has offered his business acumen  and leadership experience to serve others in Colorado for decades. Mr.  Hutson graduated from the Colorado School of Mines with a bachelor of  science in geological engineering in 1982, one of the Nation's leading  engineering schools. In 2004, Governor Bill Owens appointed Mr. Hutson  to the school's board of trustees, and he was reappointed in 2009 by  Governor Bill Ritter. During his two terms of service, he served as  president of the board of trustees and chairman of the finance and  audit committee. He has served on many other boards and commission at  both the State and local levels.   Because he is passionate about business, education, economic  development, and public policy, Mr. Hutson was the first oil and gas  executive asked to join the exclusive business organization known as  Colorado Concern. There, he works with top Colorado executives who are  interested in enhancing and protecting our State's business climate, a  business climate that is widely recognized as the best in the  [[Page S5308]]  Nation thanks to the work of people like Mr. Hutson.   He has no doubt touched countless lives in Colorado as he has  provided his time, talent, and resources to advance the causes he cares  deeply about. He served as a mentor for the Denver Petroleum Club in  2013 and helped a group of young industry professionals raise more than  $700,000 for the Wounded Warriors Project. He has also supported the  Children's Hospital, the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, the  Tennyson Center, and the Newman Center.   Mr. Hutson will be honored next week at the Navy Seal Foundation's  Denver Evening of Tribute. He is worthy of this recognition, and I  thank him for serving and impacting so many people in the State of  Colorado.                            ____________________
