 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am  thankful that he is back with us, but at times I wish he weren't as  healthy as he is. I am just joking.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for  morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be  postponed until 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and noon for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Last votes are expected no later than 3 p.m.   On Friday, no votes are expected in the House.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  tomorrow.   In addition, the House will consider several bills aimed at giving  Americans more affordable healthcare choices:   First, the Protect Medical Innovation Act, sponsored by  Representative Erik Paulsen. This bill would permanently repeal  ObamaCare's burdensome medical device tax. Doing so will create jobs,  promote research, and allow for innovation that could lead to the next  generation of lifesaving medical technologies;   Next, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding  Health Savings Accounts Act, sponsored by Representative Peter Roskam.  This package would expand access to lower cost healthcare options,  encourage healthcare savings, and put a 2-year delay on ObamaCare's  health insurance tax, which drives up costs of insurance for almost  every American;   Finally, the Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health  Savings Accounts Act, sponsored by Representative Lynn Jenkins. This  bill would transform and modernize health savings accounts and allow  for more innovation in healthcare delivery.   I look forward to the House passing all three of these critical bills  without delay.   Mr. Speaker, we also hope to vote on the conference report to  accompany H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 19, 2018, on page H6572, the following appeared: Mr.  Speaker, we also hope to vote on the conference report to  accompany H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act.      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. Speaker, we  also hope to vote on the conference report to accompany H.R. 5515,  the National Defense Authorization Act.    ========================= END NOTE =========================    This House is committed to rebuilding our military and ensuring our    brave men and women in uniform have the equipment and training they               need to successfully carry out their mission.   I want to thank the Armed Services Committee for their hard work on  this bill, especially their chairman, Mac Thornberry, and I look  forward to another big bipartisan vote.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in  the House. As soon as our schedule is finalized, I will be sure to  inform all Members.    Mr. Speaker, the Appropriations Committee has now  passed all 12 bills out of subcommittee. By next week, all 12 bills  will have also cleared the full committee. By passing the Interior and  Financial Services bills today, the gentleman knows the full House has  adopted for the full-year appropriations half of those, six bills,  making up over two-thirds of the discretionary budget authority.   House and Senate conferees on the first package are working to  produce a conference report, and I look forward to continuing work on  FY19 appropriations in the weeks to come. As soon as the items are  scheduled for the floor, I will be sure to inform all Members.   As the gentleman knows, this is a different year, as just last year  we were able to pass all 12. But what is different about this year is,  over in the Senate, there is action being taken, which is positive for  us. That is why we are already into conference.   I look forward to having those conference reports coming back and  moving those bills to the President's desk to be signed. I am proud of  the fact that two-thirds of all the discretionary spending will have  already passed this floor as of this day.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I do not know at this time. I know they are continuing to work. As  soon as they get their work done, I will advise the Members. I will  bring it to the floor then.                                time  1115     Mr. Speaker, there is one part of what the gentleman  said with which I disagree. The vote we just had was a motion to  recommit. We all know what motions to recommit are.   The good news about this is, last year in the omni, we fully funded  the Help America Vote Act. That vote was a different vote. That was a  vote that moved on to the President and was signed into law.   Now, of that funding that we fully funded--because we believe, just  as the gentleman does, that we want to make sure our elections are  fair, honest, and that people do not try to manipulate them--40 percent  of that money that we fully funded is still available. The challenge  here is that we have 19 States that have yet to apply.   So we should work together to make sure those States are applying,  because the money is sitting there, and the money has been fully  funded. We want to make sure, in the Help America Vote Act, that it  continues, that States apply for that money, and that the elections are  safe and sound and honest.    Correct me if I'm wrong, but you voted against the  omni, correct?    So you voted against the funding----    If I can finish, you had stated at the end of your last  statement that you voted for that funding. I was just correcting. By  voting against the omni, you voted against the funding for that.    The only reason I brought it up is your statement at  the end was that you voted for it.    At any time, if I may finish, if I state that I voted  for something that is incorrect, please bring it up.    In saying that, you just recently said you supported  CHIP, but you voted against it because you voted against the omni.  Also, is it not true, when CHIP was by itself on the floor, you voted  against CHIP there? Because we brought CHIP to the floor three times.   But if I could move on, that was the case. So you voted against CHIP  even when it wasn't in the omni, so there are other reasons to vote  against CHIP.   You had a question about a bill.  [[Page H6574]]         As we all know, America is a Nation of immigrants.  Almost all of our ancestors came from somewhere else in search of a  better life in this land of freedom and opportunity, and we want to  maintain that.   Mr. Speaker, America is also a Nation of laws. We support  immigration, but it also must be legal immigration. We must have the  security, especially, along our southern border. As we speak, our men  and women at the border are doing their absolute best to maintain both  order and decency.   Since 2014, Border Patrol has completed more than 13,000--let me say  that again, 13,000--life-saving rescues along the border, including  many children. We would be naive to think that there are not certain  individuals hoping to enter this country illegally and to do us harm.   Yesterday, when we talked about ICE, one of the elements that came up  was the thousands of gang members that they stop. We all know the most  vicious gang out there is MS-13. We know it because we know it in our  communities. We see the murders. We see the drugs. We know the hundreds  of MS-13 members that they have stopped from being a part of our  communities. That is why we had that vote.   Simply put, the entire immigration enforcement community deserves our  support because they work under very difficult circumstances. I think  everybody would agree with that, which is why, if I can be very honest  with my friend, I was upset to see many Democrats refuse to stand with  the men and women of ICE yesterday.   Why? Six individuals who work for ICE gave the ultimate sacrifice of  their life. One was murdered by the Los Zetas cartel.   The gentleman asked if I would bring up a bill. I offered to bring up  a Democrat bill, but the author of the bill who put it across the desk  and asked people to cosponsor said he would vote against it.    What was most shocking to me is the number of people who voted  ``present.'' The gentleman can argue with me all day on things I vote  ``yes'' and things I vote ``no'' on. The only time he will ever see my  vote up there for ``present'' is a quorum call, because I believe the  American public and my constituents expect me to make a decision when I  come.   I think it was very clear yesterday. You can make a decision. I know  my friend and his beliefs, but I also know his party has a new  movement. It is a socialist party, and they are gaining steam. But that  new party and that new movement in there, I still believe, would want  you to make a decision one place or the other.   Just last year alone, ICE made almost 5,000 gang-related arrests.  They seized nearly 1 million pounds of narcotics and opioids.   The gentleman knows, those 2 weeks we spent on this floor dealing  with the opioid epidemic, there will be more than 100 Americans who  will die today because of opioids, and tomorrow will be the same. That  is why we did CARA in the last Congress. That is why we came back with  billions of dollars of funding to combat the epidemic. That is why we  came back and spent 2 weeks on this floor passing more than 50 bills.                                time  1130    But think for one moment. If my friend on the other side, his  colleague, was able to abolish ICE, that would be 1 million more pounds  of narcotics. And it is more than just opioids. It is fentanyl. A small  dose will kill you.   They rescued more than 900 sexually exploited children. They stopped  thousands of predators. My friend knows that, too, when we were able to  finally stop human trafficking on the internet.   Backpage.com is no longer there because this Congress acted, and they  are being prosecuted. Seventy percent of all human trafficking happens  online. But do you know what? We can celebrate that that has changed  because of this Congress.   Now, Mr. Speaker, we want America to remain a land of opportunity,  but demeaning the individuals who keep this country safe and calling to  abolish ICE is certainly not the way to do it.   I thank my friend, and I think we have a difference of opinion, and I  think a strong difference of opinion, and that is healthy. But  sometimes when you have a difference of opinion, it is a ``no'' and a  ``yes,'' not just a ``present.'' You might come to the debate, but you  ought to participate and you ought to take a stance.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   To answer his last question first, yes, we will extend flood  insurance through November 30 as we continue to work through the other  differences we have. We do not want flood insurance to lapse, and we  will have that on the floor.   But the gentleman brought up a couple of other points. If I may, I  come from a family of immigrants. I come  [[Page H6575]]  from a family in which nobody was a Republican. I chose to be in this  party based upon its philosophy.   If you come to my office, I have two Presidents' hanging portraits:  Abraham Lincoln. The greatest challenge ever to this Nation was the  Civil War. Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican President. And the  other one is, the other reason why--both of those men--I chose to, and  that was Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan did talk about that shining city  on the hill. There was another President at the time, and I saw the  difference, and I made my selection.   But the gentleman talks about the challenges with the rule of law,  the challenges at the border. Nobody on this side wants children to be  mistreated. That is why we dealt with the issue, and we brought it to  the floor. There was an executive order that dealt with it.    But we moved two pieces of legislation dealing with immigration. Not  one Democrat on the other side worked with us. Maybe there were  problems. Maybe they disagreed with having greater security on the  border, having a wall. I understand that, but maybe that is the  difference.   But the question you brought forward was the bill on the floor  yesterday. It had nothing negative in it. It had nothing about  children. It talked about:   Do you support ICE?   Do you support the families of those six individuals who were  murdered in the line of duty?   Do you support the stopping of drugs coming across the border?   Do you stand with those children who get exploited? Those ICE agents  actually find them.   Do you stand with ICE when they stop those human traffickers, the  modern-day slavery of today, and stop those people?   Well, we had an opportunity for that. I know this other side of the  aisle and I know the new Democratic Socialist Party feels differently,  probably feels differently than my friend. They want to abolish it.  They never put a bill in to reform it. They said, ``Abolish it.''   If we were proposing a bill that said ``support it,'' I would allow  your bill to come up as well so we could have a clear choice. But when  you were given that offer, the author of the bill said, ``I would vote  `no.' '' The people you asked to cosponsor, ``We vote `no,' '' makes me  wonder.   But the most shocking part to me--I know we take tough votes on this  floor. I know there are tough decisions to be made. But at the end of  the day, you have to make a decision because that is why the American  people sent you here.   I have never been in a debate, in a primary or a general, where they  ask me: If a bill came to the floor, will I vote ``present''? I have  never been asked that by my district. Republican or Democrat or  Independent or Green Party: ``I want you to go to Washington. I want  you to be on that floor. I want you to make a strong debate down in the  well. And when you get the opportunity, you press that `present'  button,'' never, never have I heard that and never would I have thought  I would see that. I have never seen so much color on that board as I  saw yesterday.   And if you truly felt your convictions of what you said, your own  ``present'' vote made it pass, then go back to the individuals you talk  to, go back to that new Socialist Party and tell them what you did,  because I didn't see convictions yesterday. I saw you play politics.   Our issues are too important. People have lost their lives, and you  vote ``present.'' Now, we have more work to be done. We take this job  seriously.   Ronald Reagan talked about that shining city on the hill, about  everybody rising up. This is the exact same debate we had when we  wanted to pass tax reform. Not one person on the other side of the  aisle could vote with it, but there are 1 million more Americans  working today.   When I look at the last 49 years of America--because there are a lot  of people in this Chamber who are younger than that--there has only  been 7 months where unemployment has been below 4 percent. And do you  realize that 2 of those months, you just lived through it in April and  May? You have never seen the opportunity that you grasp for today.   And do you know what happens with that opportunity? More people want  to come, and that is good for America. But we should come legally.   We know our system is broken, and I know my friend knows it, too,  because we spent hours talking and trying to work something out. So,  yes, we brought a bill to the floor, and we had a pretty good idea that  probably it wouldn't pass. Why? Because nobody on the other side of the  aisle wanted to step forward.   You know the process; it would go to the Senate. Maybe it is not just  perfect, but I think this country is too important to vote ``present,''  and I am going to take risks and I am going to bring bills to the floor  that take risks.   So I thank the gentleman for the question. But what I really ask--the  election is still a ways away. Stop playing politics. Be a part. That  voting card, I don't even know why we have a ``present'' button here.   We want quorum, let's just all say it. But the idea of something so  important that people have lost their lives over, what do you think  those families felt like today? What do you think those families felt  like?   Or what do you think about that young child who got saved from being  exploited or got put back to the family and saved?   What do you think about the drugs that didn't come through, the  number of lives that continue to live today because of that?   Or what do you think about those men and women, a part of ICE, who  question does this government even support them. And every day they  risk their lives for that.   It is not a day to vote ``present.'' If you disagree, if you are part  of the Socialist Party, stand up and take a stance. Let the American  public know where you stand.    May I ask the gentleman what am I not saying correctly?  Were there ``present'' votes in that Chamber?    May I ask the gentleman--the 133 ``present'' votes, did  they not take place yesterday?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, they didn't vote ``present.''    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, then why did he vote ``present''?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I know he misspoke earlier on a couple of things, and I  think he may have misspoken again. He made a comment. He said we are  autocratic. He said we are the most closed. So I just want to go to  facts.   This Congress has a 20-year high for bills enacted with bipartisan  cosponsors, a 20-year high. Those are not my words. That is from  Quorum, a company that only deals with data and measures all. So that  means we are the most bipartisan Congress in more than 20 years.   Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman want to know something else, just on  facts? He said we close everything. There have been over 1,650  amendments. 745 of those were Democratic amendments. So I looked back  to Speaker Pelosi. She allowed less than 1,000 amendments in the entire  111th Congress.   So, I am sorry, those statements were not correct.   Now, we can have differences of opinion. He has a right to vote  ``present.'' If he gets mad about it, he can get mad about it, but that  is what the Record shows.   And he said because what were the resolved clauses. Mr. Speaker, the  gentleman knows that bill was on suspension. The rules of suspension  have a higher threshold to pass, but it also means there are no  amendments.   If you want to be fair, instead of just the bill that was coming  forward, I offered to bring a Democratic bill up that would abolish  ICE.   So, for the American people to know, let's see what the resolved  clauses say, because this made so many Democrats vote ``no'' or  ``present.''         Resolved. That the House of Representatives expresses its       continued support for all United States Immigration and       Customs Enforcement, ICE, officers and personnel, who carry       out the important mission of ICE;        Denounces calls for the complete abolishment of ICE; and        Supports the efforts of all Federal agencies, State law       enforcement, and military personnel who bring law and order       to our Nation's borders.    That is what the resolved said. That is what moved the other side to  vote ``present.'' That is what we voted on.   He may be upset. I am upset he voted ``present,'' too. But I don't  know what in this clause drove all the Democrats here, because you know  on suspension he helped it pass.   But is it because that announcement denounces calls for the complete  abolishment of ICE, because that is the bill he put across the desk? If  that is what he is asking for, he can stand with his convictions. Don't  put a bill across the desk, cosponsor it, and then when he has  something on the floor that is only positive, that is only standing  with the people of ICE, say he has to vote ``present.'' I don't know  where the courage is there.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, that is a lot less than under his  leadership.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I asked the gentleman to yield because I  just think the Record needs to be corrected.   The gentleman knows, Mr. Speaker, that we brought two immigration  bills to this floor that would solve the problem. The gentleman also  knows there was an executive order signed that stopped this action  being taken before this even went forward.  [[Page H6577]]    But I also heard the gentleman say that he voted ``present'' because  he didn't want the ICE agents to think he didn't support them, and that  he supported those things in the resolved. Prior, he said that is why  he voted against it.   I read what was in the resolved. I don't understand how anybody in  America looks at voting ``present'' with an idea you support it. That  is the only thing that I question.   Now, the gentleman also knows that this is the most productive  Congress in modern history. It has passed more bills out of committee  than any Congress in the last 25 years. It has passed more bills in  this Chamber than any one in the last 25 years. He sees the openness to  the number of amendments; and it is not just the number of amendments  to Republicans because there are hundreds upon hundreds for Democrats.   The gentleman also knows that the immigration bills that came to this  floor had an opportunity. But what is interesting to me is that people  want just one that they can support.   Earlier, I heard he voted against CHIP because it was in the omni,  but CHIP was on the floor by itself and he voted against it then.   He can vote for the post office bills and that didn't deal with the  immigration either, but he can vote for that. But then when it came to  supporting ICE, the majority of Democrats voted ``present.'' That is  not a profile in courage. That is walking away from a situation.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I can't believe that to be true.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, July 23, 2018, when  it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.
