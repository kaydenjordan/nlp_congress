 Mr. President, I am absolutely shocked that FEMA has  announced that on Wednesday it will stop distributing food and water to  Puerto Rico. Cutting this aid to the people of Puerto Rico, while still  almost a third of them do not have electricity, is unconscionable and a  travesty.   I urge the administration to reverse this disastrous decision  immediately and to continue providing the people of Puerto Rico with  the help they need as they are trying to recover from two disastrous  hurricanes.   This Senator has been speaking on the floor over and over of their  desperate needs, but here I am again to remind our colleagues that  Puerto Ricans are American citizens, that they are just like the people  of any State, including those in the States of Kentucky, Texas,  Wyoming, and in so many of the other States where needs might be  forgotten. They are our fellow countrymen, and they deserve the same  care and protection that we would provide any other citizen in his time  of need. They have supplied some of the greatest warriors of our U.S.  military in World War I, World War II, Korea, and on up to the present.   If the people of any other State were being neglected like the people  of Puerto Rico have been in the wake of this storm, there would be an  absolute outrage in this Senate. The people of Puerto Rico need help,  but they are not the only ones. Millions of people were affected by the  storms that hit last year in my State of Florida, in the State of  Texas, in, of course, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and in Puerto Rico, and  many were affected by the wildfires in California.   Right now, many of them are desperately waiting for the Senate to act  on a disaster supplemental package to help them recover. We are trying  to pass it, and it keeps getting shuffled off into the future. We are  trying to add to the supplemental--the necessary disaster aid that is  needed in agriculture, particularly for the citrus industry in  Florida--the financial assistance that is needed in Puerto Rico. I hope  our colleagues in the Senate will understand the urgency of this  matter. We cannot keep pushing this off into the future. The need to  act is now.   In addition, people in Florida are struggling. We should not neglect  what is happening on the mainland. It is true in Texas. It is true in  California. It is true in Florida. It is true on the islands. The storm  destroyed homes and damaged apartments all around Florida, but we  haven't seen any real attempt to address the housing needs of the  hurricane victims in the State--by the way, including those coming to  Florida from Puerto Rico.   Florida received about $600 million out of the $7.4 billion, which  was made available in the CDBG-DR, in the September supplemental. What  percentage is that of $7.4 billion? It is much less than 10 percent. It  defies comprehension. Florida was one of the places that  [[Page S561]]  was the hardest hit last year. Hurricane Irma virtually covered up the  entire peninsula of Florida. It wreaked havoc all across the State. Add  to that the aftereffects of Hurricane Maria, with thousands fleeing  Puerto Rico and going to Florida, and we have a real housing crisis on  our hands. The $600 million, which is to help those who have been left  bare by two of the most devastating storms to hit the country in  decades, is a drop in the bucket. We should be able to get people the  help they need in the time they need it. It is required now--not a year  later, not 6 months later, but now.   Schools in Florida have been stretched thin in their having enrolled  nearly 12,000 students who have evacuated Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands. Every child has a right to a quality education, but the  school systems cannot do it on their own, not after a natural disaster.  Dealing with such a large influx of students in a short period requires  extra resources.   The House has passed a package that includes $2.9 billion for  education funding. We desperately need it. The schools and students  need this aid now. We cannot keep kicking the can down the road. Their  educations cannot wait. You cannot keep relying on teachers to go out  and get the extra supplies for them.   I mentioned our citrus growers. The industry has already been  devastated by a bacteria called greening. When it gets into the phloem  sap of the tree, it kills the tree in 5 years. We are not going to have  a citrus industry if we can't find the cure for that. With the extra  care of the groves, they have been able to nurture back crops. So here  are all of these crops of oranges and grapefruit on the trees, and  along comes Irma. In some groves, not only have 100 percent of the  crops been blown off the trees, but the trees have been uprooted. That  is why we desperately need the money--to clean up and replant.   The farmers in Florida suffered at least $2.5 billion in losses when  Hurricane Irma tore through the State, and that included a lot of our  citrus. Citrus alone experienced $760 million in losses. That is on top  of the difficulties that they were having already with the bacteria.   The USDA is estimating that Florida growers will only harvest 46  million boxes this season. Get this: 10 years ago, there were 203  million boxes of citrus harvested. A decade before that, there were 244  million boxes of oranges harvested. For months our farmers have been  told to wait their turn. Some of them are going bankrupt. They have  waited long enough. They need the help now. We just have to act on this  disaster bill.   Additionally, it has been over 100 days since Hurricane Maria hit  Puerto Rico. Over 30 percent of the island remains without power, and  parts of the island still lack running water. Some people have running  water still, but they cannot drink it. They have to boil it.   When I was there in the little mountain town of Utuado, the source of  water about 2 weeks after the hurricane--with the roads cut off, the  only source of outside help was by helicopter, and the running water  that they had was from a pipe that was coming out of the mountain, the  mountain water draining down. I don't want to mince words here. We have  a full-blown humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico right now. My  colleague, Marco Rubio from Florida, has been there also, and he is  here to testify to the same thing.   As a result, recent estimates suggest that over 300,000 Puerto Ricans  may have moved to Florida. Some are fortunate enough to move in with  relatives, but others are living in motels that line the I-4 corridor.  Some are living out of their cars. This is absolutely heartbreaking.  How can we fail fellow American citizens like this? Yet, given the  current situation, the administration thinks that now, today, is the  appropriate time to cut off food and water for the people of Puerto  Rico.   There is no common sense here. FEMA needs to continue to provide food  and water to the island until, at the very least, all of the island has  access to potable water and electricity. They are suffering, and while  the administration is trying to abandon the responsibility of the  United States to Puerto Rico, the House aid package shortchanges  recovery efforts on the island. We must enhance it in the Senate  package.   For instance, it fails to address the current Medicaid crisis that is  just a month away. If nothing is done, Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program  is going to run out of money. Congress must act; otherwise, over 1  million U.S. citizens will be denied healthcare coverage when they need  it the most.   It has been over a month since the House passed the disaster bill. We  haven't seen any action. The longer we wait, the more people suffer. It  is clear the government is not working the way it should. We need to  turn the corner, and it needs to start with this disaster bill being  bumped up in the Senate and then quickly passed.   I beg our colleagues, and Senator Marco Rubio joins me: Let's take up  this bill. Let's fix the deficiencies, and let's pass it immediately.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the January  29, 2018, vote on calendar No. 294, motion to invoke cloture on the  motion to proceed to S. 2311, the Pain-Capable Unborn Children  Protection Act. I would have voted nay.   Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the January 29, 2018,  vote on Executive Calendar No. 622, motion to invoke cloture on David  Ryan Stras, of Minnesota, to be U.S. circuit judge for the Eighth  Circuit. I would have voted nay.                            ____________________
