 Mr. Speaker, the First Amendment to our Constitution says  that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the press. The  strength of our First Amendment is our local independent newspapers.  These papers fan the flame of American rebellion. There is no America  without a free local press.   Last week, we lost a local press newspaper in Katy, Texas, Covering  Katy News. They ceased operations. The owner and founder, Dennis  Spellman, left radio 8 years ago to get in the field and report on  stories that matter to people back home. Covering Katy News was 21st  century news, online primarily.   Dennis' family put their heart and soul into this paper, Covering  Katy News. He would stay awake from 4 a.m. to 6 p.m.--without a day off  in 5 years.   Dennis' last article was entitled, ``Time to Say Good-Bye.'' My dear  friend, that is the wrong headline. The headline should be, ``Time to  Say Good Luck.''                            ____________________
