 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life of  Otto Frederick Warmbier, who died at the hands of the North Korean  regime 6 years ago, on June 19, 2017.   Otto was a dedicated young man. He was a salutatorian of his high  school and attended the University of Virginia. He was imprisoned and  tortured by the brutal North Korean regime during a school tour.   He died just a few days after his release.   Otto experienced what no human being should ever have to go through.  While he is no longer with us, his family carries on his legacy with  their advocacy and strength.   As a proud Korean American and as chairwoman of the Indo-Pacific  Subcommittee, I will always be a loud voice for global human rights and  hold violators accountable.   Madam Speaker, we remember and honor Otto always. In Korean: ``uli- neun Otto-leul yeong-wonhi gieok-hal geos-ibnida.''                            ____________________
