 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that  today the House will consider the Timely Review of Infrastructure Act  introduced by Representative Pete Olson of Texas and myself. I would  like to thank Mr. Olson for his leadership and partnership on this bill  and commend him and his staff on their tireless efforts to get it  across the finish line.   The United States has always been a global leader when it comes to  energy development and that is just a true today as it has ever been.  However, in order to maintain and grow our energy sector, we need to  ensure that we are building the necessary energy infrastructure to do  so. Investing in our domestic infrastructure is more important than  ever as we look to get through the current health crisis and rebuild  our economy.   Indeed, just as we passed the Water Resources Development Act  yesterday, today we have an opportunity to pass a bill that, while  smaller in scale, will help hasten the buildout of critical energy  infrastructure such as hydroelectric dams, pipelines, transmission  equipment, and energy terminals. This will not only help the economy  recover but will ensure that we have a secure and strong domestic  energy system.   Unfortunately, too many energy infrastructure projects are delayed or  do not have as vigorous a review as you would expect. And that is due  to the fact that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is  responsible for reviewing proposed projects cannot hire or retain  enough qualified engineers for the simple reason that salaries in the  private sector are too high for FERC to compete with given its current  pay scale limits. This lack of engineers not only doesn't allow FERC to  fully and robustly do its work, but it is a barrier to communities  benefiting from the good paying jobs the construction of these projects  provides.   If we want FERC to ensure that the projects that come up for review,  now and in the future, are stringently but quickly reviewed, then we  must make the pay for the engineers who review the applications more  competitive. That is exactly what the Timely Review of Infrastructure  Act would do, by allowing FERC to offer higher salaries for these high  demand engineering positions, ensuring that critical infrastructure  projects can get the review and approval they need to move forward.   The bill has bipartisan and bicameral support and FERC Chairman  Chatterjee has stated his support for this legislation saying that it  would enhance the Commission's ability to recruit and compensate the  skilled staff needed to lessen the backlog of projects awaiting review  and to review future projects in a more timely manner.   Our bill would not only help get rid of the backlog of projects  currently awaiting review, but would allow FERC to have the proper  staff in place as we build out a sustainable energy system. I view it  as an important piece of getting our economy back on track and ensuring  that America remains the leader in energy production and innovation  that it has been.
