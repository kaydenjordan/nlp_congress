 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R.  7, the latest attack on women's reproductive rights.   Today's bill comes on the coattails of the new administration's  yesterday reinstating the global gag rule, which limits women's  reproductive health care outside the U.S.--and all of this after 3.2  million women and men across the country participated in the women's  march last Saturday. The march sent a clear message that this  administration should not undermine women's rights and women's health  care.   And this is the response--to undermine women's reproductive health  care?   Madam Speaker, the people of our country are watching; they are  showing up; they are paying attention; and they will not back down in  the face of attempts to move this country backwards.   I urge my colleagues to oppose  H.R. 7.                            ____________________
