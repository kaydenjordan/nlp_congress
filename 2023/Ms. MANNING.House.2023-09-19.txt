 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 150th  anniversary of Bennett College, which I have the privilege of  representing in Congress.   In 1873, Bennett got its start as a school for elementary and  secondary students in the basement of Warnersville Methodist Episcopal  Church.   Now, Bennett College, located in Greensboro, North Carolina, stands  as one of only two all-women's HBCUs in the Nation.   In the 150 years since its founding, Bennett College and its alumni  have made history. Bennett played a pivotal role in the civil rights  movement in North Carolina. Before Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gave  his famous March on Washington speech, he traveled to Greensboro, North  Carolina, in February 1958. There, he was met with an overflowing crowd  of young women, the Bennett Belles, at the Annie Merner Pfeiffer Chapel  on Bennett's campus.   This speech, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s first speech ever given in  Greensboro, had a lasting impact on the entire Triad community.    Mr. Speaker, 2 years after his speech on Bennett's campus, Bennett  Belles participated in the famous Woolworth counter sit-in, the  demonstration that ignited a movement of sit-ins for racial equality  across the South and across the country and changed the entire course  of American history.   In the years since then, Bennett's alumni have continued to make  history.   Bennett had the first Black woman president of a 4-year college in  the United States, Dr. Willa B. Player.   Former Bennett College President Johnnetta Cole went on to lead the  Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African Art.   Maidie Ruth Gamble Norman was an early Hollywood film star in the  1930s.   Dr. Dorothy Brown was the first woman to practice general surgery in  the South in the 1940s.   Carolyn Robertson Payton led the Peace Corps under President Jimmy  Carter.   Marian Tasco was Pennsylvania's first Black county commissioner.   Many more Bennett Belles have broken down barriers and have been the  first to accomplish amazing feats. Today, Bennett continues to educate  young minds and produce changemakers.   Bennett has been an influential institution in our Nation's history,  as well as a pillar of outstanding education in Greensboro, North  Carolina.   Congratulations to the Bennett Belles on 150 years of excellence.                            ____________________
