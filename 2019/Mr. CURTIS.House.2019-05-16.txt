 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about the Equality  Act.   First and foremost, I must begin by saying that I believe the LGBTQ  community is a critical part of the fabric of our country. They are  deserving of our unequivocal love and respect, and their contributions  to my home State of Utah are utterly invaluable.   As the mayor of Provo, I prioritized inclusion and love, and sought  to ensure my administration did everything possible to recognize the  intrinsic value of all of our citizens, including our LGBTQ community.   I fought hard against discrimination and was grateful for my  associations with organizations like Provo Pride, Equality Utah,  Encircle, and others, who I was honored to stand with to ensure that  our city motto of ``Welcome Home'' extended to everyone.   Perhaps even more important than that, I am grateful for the  association and relationships of my life that have helped me better  understand the experiences of the LGBTQ community, and who have been  patient with me, a conservative Utah boy raised in the 1960s, who took  longer than I am proud of to gain empathy for this important issue.   Again, I say I am incredibly grateful for the contribution of the  LGBTQ community and will always stand with them in respect and support.   With the Equality Act, we face a unique challenge: balancing the  needs and protections against discrimination with the importance of  protecting religious liberty, which is one of the fundamental rights  enshrined at the foundation of our Nation.   I believe this compromise is possible, because I have seen it before  in my home State with historic legislation called the Utah Compromise  that effectively balanced the absolute rights of both LGBTQ individuals  as human beings and religious institutions protected by the First  Amendment.   The Equality Act fails to strike that balance. Instead, these two  interests are treated as zero sum games, with no good-faith effort put  forth for both sides to win.   This bill would end longstanding religious liberties under the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a historic bipartisan legislative  victory fought for by the current Democratic leader in the Senate,  Chuck Schumer; my own Utah mentor, Orrin Hatch, a Republican; and  liberal icon, Ted Kennedy. It was also signed into law by Democrat Bill  Clinton.   I have introduced commonsense amendments that would help achieve this  critical balance of protection for both maintaining the standards  against discrimination and religious freedom, but I am frustrated that  House Democratic leaders have decided there will not be any  consideration or even debate of amendments to the Equality Act.  Instead, they have established a model of legislative gas-lighting.   In this case, they are taking issues where broad bipartisan agreement  is possible and taking the debate right off the table on issue after  issue, whether it be climate change, violence against women, and now  the Equality Act.   They disregard willing partners, such as myself, standing here hoping  to work with them, and instead, prefer to pass party-line bills that  won't go anywhere so they have issues to campaign on.   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle truly want to achieve  progress on this issue, I hope they will recognize that they have a  willing partner in me, but they must be willing to work together to  legislate and make room to protect both religious liberty and the LGBTQ  community.   Exploiting yet another group in order to pass a campaign message bill  along party lines is not in harmony with this body.   I hope they will hear me today and change course before we vote on  this bill.                            ____________________
