 Mr. President, since President Trump announced his intent  to impose tariffs on goods imported to the United States from Mexico, I  have been perplexed at the reaction from our Democratic colleagues on  both sides of the Capitol. They seem to have washed their hands of the  humanitarian crisis occurring at the border.   Again, these are President Obama's words. In 2014 he identified this  crush of humanity coming across from Central America into the United  States claiming asylum as a humanitarian and security crisis. But our  Democratic friends are simply washing their hands of any responsibility  and have not offered any solutions or any ideas on how to solve the  problem.   Perhaps they feel like this is President Trump's problem, but this is  more than just the President's problem. It is America's problem and  challenge: How do we deal with this flood of humanity?   I would like to be clear on one point. I agree with the President  that Mexico needs to do more to staunch the flow of people across its  borders and into the United States. They must do more and we must do  more to stop this mass migration, but any action must prioritize both  our country's physical and our economic security.   Tariffs are not my first choice on how to address this problem. In  fact, that is not the most responsible way to address this. The most  responsible way to address it is by taking up, debating, and voting on  bipartisan legislation that would actually fix the vulnerabilities in  our current law that are being exploited by the human smugglers who are  charging between $5,000 and $10,000 per person to smuggle people from  Central America, across Mexico, and into the United States.   Tariffs, on the other hand, would be a massive tax. The U.S. Chamber  estimates that Texas alone would face $5.35 billion in increased costs  as a result of a 5-percent tariff that could take effect as early as  Monday. This translates into about $1,000 more on a car.   I am happy that the Vice President and Secretary Pompeo are meeting  with the Mexican Foreign Minister and other officials today. Actually,  I am encouraged by the response of the Mexican Government, and I can  only hope that they come up with some sort of agreement so that these  tariffs do not go into effect.   Stronger action by Mexico would be a step in the right direction, but  it doesn't come close to solving the underlying problem. I feel like a  broken record at times, constantly reminding my colleagues here of the  challenges we are facing in Texas because of this crisis.   More than 100,000 people illegally crossed our southern border  between March and April--100,000. That is not a combined figure. It is  about 100,000 each month. The Department of Homeland Security has not  released statistics for the month of May, but I am not expecting any  good news.   As a matter of fact, if nothing changes, the pull factors--the  reasons why people would leave their homes in Central America, cross  Mexico, and make this dangerous trip into the United States--are doing  nothing but getting worse, encouraging more and more people to take  that dangerous trip.   Unlike in previous years, the vast majority of those crossing aren't  from Mexico, as I said. So far this fiscal year, 74 percent of the  Border Patrol's apprehensions across the southern border were people  coming from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.   And if you talk to the McAllen Sector Border Patrol chief, he will  tell you that last year alone people from 140 different countries--140  different countries--came across our southern border with Mexico and  into the United States. That is because they realize, if you can fly or  get any way you can--take a boat, swim, get to Central America--you can  make your way up from Central America into the United States. The  individuals illegally entering our country are overwhelmingly either  families or unaccompanied children, which means we don't have the  facilities, the resources, or legal authorities. We need to  expeditiously process them and care for them properly.    What is more, 70 percent of unaccompanied children and family unit  apprehensions are occurring in just two sectors--El Paso and the Rio  Grande Valley--making the State of Texas and its border communities the  hardest hit.   We are ground zero for this crisis. As I said, this is equated to an  all-out humanitarian crisis along the border. Our law enforcement  officials, city leaders, nongovernmental organizations--everyone who  wants to treat these migrants compassionately and appropriately is  being completely overwhelmed by the massive waves of people who are  entering our country.   We need to get to work on both short-term and long-term solutions.   First, we need to get additional funding to the departments and  agencies that are trying to manage this crisis and care for the  migrants in their custody. Without action here in Congress, funding  could dry up by the end of this month, creating an even more dire  situation. That should be our most immediate focus--getting funding to  the agencies responsible for managing this crisis. I know the  appropriators are working on this, and I hope we can come up with a  solution soon because time is not on our side. But that is not a fix;  that is a patch.   Any sort of lasting change cannot be solved by a funding bill or by  tariffs. It has to be solved by something only Congress can do--passing  legislation that addresses the root of the problem.   From what I know, there is only one bill that would address this  humanitarian crisis at the border, a bill that  [[Page S3230]]  already has Republican and Democratic support. That is a bill I  introduced called the HUMANE Act.   I have learned a lot when it comes to legislating on immigration  issues. A lot of folks are more interested in talking about it than  they are interested in finding a solution. But that wasn't the case  when I picked up the phone and called my friend Henry Cuellar, a  Democrat from Laredo, TX. Obviously, I am a Republican. Henry is a  Democrat in the House. But he understands this situation better than  most, and he has been my consistent ally in working on a number of ways  to bring commonsense reform to these issues.   We don't always agree on everything, but we do agree on some things,  and where we do agree, we work together to try to provide effective  solutions. As I mentioned, we introduced the HUMANE Act last month,  which will make targeted, long-overdue reforms to our immigration  system. Importantly, it includes provisions that both Republicans and  Democrats should be able to agree on. First, it closes a major loophole  that is often exploited by families and the human smugglers who move  them across the border illegally. This is the Flores settlement  agreement. This is a lawsuit and a settlement.   Flawed court rulings have looked at the Flores settlement and have  turned this once well-intentioned agreement into a major pull factor  for migrants hoping to game the system. They know we can't detain  children and family units for more than 20 days, and they are using it  against us to game the system, to win, to successfully place people  into the United States because we simply don't have the authorities to  detain them until they can present their claims to an immigration  judge.   Rather than single adults arriving at the border alone, we know that  the smugglers are sending children, sometimes unaccompanied, sometimes  posing as a family unit when they are not even biologically related--so  much that the Department of Homeland Security has now been giving DNA  testing to determine whether an adult is falsely claiming a child to be  their biological offspring so that they can make their way into the  country, exploiting the gaps and loopholes that I have talked about.   Children are literally being kidnapped to serve as free tickets into  the United States. Tragically, they are often abused, physically or  sexually, along the way, and many arrive at our border in critical  health.   I have shared the concern expressed by Members of Congress on both  sides of the aisle when we see children die in some of our facilities  along the border, but that is not because they got sick there in the  first place. They got ill on the way, coming from Central America,  across Mexico, into the United States, suffering from exposure, being  exposed to all sorts of infectious diseases. By the time they get into  U.S. custody, some of them simply don't survive. That is a terrible  human tragedy. But the problem is not trying to create more medical  facilities at the border; it should be to try to stop people from  making this dangerous trek in the first place.   The HUMANE Act would stop that practice by clarifying that the Flores  agreement applies only to unaccompanied children, which was the  original agreement, not family units as it was subsequently interpreted  by another court. It would provide more time for processing and  immigration proceedings to take place before families could be released  from custody.   Under the current practice, because the numbers are overwhelming the  capacity of the immigration courts to hear these cases--and there is  simply not enough time to get to these cases when you have to release  them in 20 days--they are given a notice to appear for a future court  date. Guess what. The vast majority of them simply don't show up for  that court hearing, and they remain in the United States perhaps for  the rest of their lives unless, perhaps, they get picked up for an  unrelated crime.   Our legislation would require that all accompanied children be  processed exactly the same, regardless of their country of origin.   Under current law, children from Mexico or Canada can be promptly  returned home. But the process for other countries moves much more  slowly and represents another vulnerability in our legal authorities. I  believe we should make every effort to safely return all children to  their home countries as soon as possible, regardless of what country  they are from.   This bill includes other provisions to protect children who have been  brought to our border, such as biometric screening to ensure that they  are literally the biological offspring of the people who claim to be  their parents rather than a human trafficker.   It would also place prohibitions on certain individuals who would  serve as guardians. For example, no child should be released into the  custody of a sex offender or human trafficker. We don't have that  confidence now.   The HUMANE Act would enable families to stay together. There has been  a lot of discussion about separation of children from their families.  We want them to stay together. I think we all agree that should be the  standard, but we also need to streamline the processing of those in  custody.   Consistent with the recommendations by the bipartisan Department of  Homeland Security Advisory Committee, the bill would require the  Department of Homeland Security to establish at least four regional  processing centers along the southern border to house and process these  families. They would literally serve as a one-stop shop, with  Department of Homeland Security personnel, folks from Custom and Border  Protection, ICE--Immigration and Customs Enforcement--the immigration  service, and FEMA all working together to assist migrants and working  to process their claims on a timely and respectful basis. Asylum  officers would also be required to be onsite to adjudicate claims as  soon as they could and expedite the entire process, which we hope would  begin to ease the burden of our current debilitating immigration court  backlog.   I believe that if we actually did this, people with legitimate claims  would find their claims recognized earlier, and people with  illegitimate claims would be returned to their country of origin, which  is the way our laws should be enforced.   It is important to recognize that we should not only enforce our  immigration laws; as long as they are on the books, we ought to use the  time-honored principle of deterrence. In other words, if people realize  they are paying good money to try to make their way into the United  States in the hands of a human smuggler but because of the way we have  corrected and reformed our laws, it is no longer possible to exploit  the vulnerabilities of the system, fewer and fewer of them will  actually start that trek--that dangerous trek from their home in  Central America.   So deterrence is something we need to use on our side, and right now  there is no deterrence because the smugglers know this is a money- making machine for them. They care nothing about the people involved.  They are commodity agnostic. They will just as soon traffic someone for  sex as they will move a migrant from Central America for economic  reasons or move drugs from across the border into the United States. We  need to deter all sorts of criminal activity like that.   In addition to these changes, the legislation also includes other  provisions that I think are just commonsense improvements, like  additional Customs and Border Protection personnel and training for CBP  and ICE employees who work with children.   There is one last point on what is happening at the border and its  impact on the economy and trade. In Laredo, TX alone--I think it just  surpassed Los Angeles as the largest port of entry into the United  States--there are between 14,000 and 16,000 trucks a day that traverse  the U.S.-Mexico border between Nuevo Laredo and Laredo. A lot of that  is a part of the manufacturing process, which happens on both sides of  the border. But when these trucks can't make their way across the  border on a timely basis, then that means the parts or the  manufacturing processes fall apart--and the border economies.   I would argue the larger economy in the United States is threatened  when just-in-time inventory control no longer works. If you are living  in Detroit, MI, and you are expecting that the delivery of a part  coming from Mexico will make its way to Michigan  [[Page S3231]]  in time to build a car, you can't do it. Eventually, this is going to  damage our economy and kill jobs.   So I would like to reiterate, in conclusion, that the HUMANE Act is  bipartisan; it is bicameral; and it would provide real relief for folks  in Texas and other border states who are struggling to manage the  crisis. Most importantly, it would be a much more humane way to treat  these children and families who are flooding across our southern  border.   I know most of our congressional Democratic friends have adopted the  posture of reflexively standing against the President on anything and  everything he asks for rather than standing for policies that would  actually become the law and make the situation better.   I think this is a much better solution than tariffs on Mexican goods  brought into the United States.   The President's team is negotiating the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement, the USMCA, and I am hopeful we can get that passed here in  the Congress once it is sent over from the administration. But I worry  that not only are these tariffs that are potentially being placed on  goods brought in the United States going to hurt our booming economy  and jobs here, they also are going to jeopardize the passage of the  USMCA--the successor to NAFTA, which I think we should all acknowledge  is a big, positive development for the administration. Why would we  jeopardize the passage of the USMCA? Why would we hurt our economy  while trying to punish Mexico for not doing more--which they should do  to stop the illegal passage of people across their country when there  is a reasonable and responsible alternative.   I urge all of my colleagues to take a serious look at the HUMANE Act  so we can finally do our part, which only we in Congress can do to stem  the flow of Central American migrants who are flooding our borders and  to prevent criminals and human smugglers from infiltrating our country  as they are doing now.
