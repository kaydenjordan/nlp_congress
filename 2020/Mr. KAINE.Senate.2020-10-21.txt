 Mr. President, thank you. I rise to talk about Americans'  health and the health of Virginians.   We are living through a crisis--the coronavirus crisis--that is  unprecedented in American life since 100 years ago with the influenza  of the late 19-teens, and a lot of words have been used on the floor to  describe the magnitude of the crisis. I needn't dwell on that. Now  nearly 220,000 Americans have died. A recent study that was put out  suggested that the actual toll may be closer to 300,000.   Many States in the country are experiencing dramatic spikes, with  predictions that we could see the worst levels of coronavirus in coming  months, at least until a vaccine is developed and widely distributed,  and that probably won't happen before the spring of next year.   In Virginia, we have been hit--3,515 Virginians have died of  coronavirus. My wife and I know three of them--two in Richmond and one  in Fairfax County. And 168,722 Virginians have had coronavirus. My wife  and I are two in that number.   This challenge in Virginia hit first in a tiny part of the State that  I really love, the Eastern Shore of Virginia. That is one of the least  accessible parts of Virginia. The Eastern Shore has two sizable poultry  processing plants, with thousands of workers--a mixture of White  workers, African-American workers, Latino immigrants, Haitian-Creole  immigrants.   In March, at these two plants--one run by Tyson and the second run by  Purdue Food Company--they started to see cases multiply. Many were  asymptomatic. People didn't know they had it, but that meant they could  spread the virus to others. The healthcare network in the Eastern Shore  of Virginia was dramatically taxed by this fast-moving and little- understood crisis at the time.   That was our first hot spot in Virginia. Other States had their hot  spots; that was ours.   Thank goodness, as Virginians have grappled with this crisis and as  we have grappled with it across the country, there have been some  protections, and I want to stand and talk about the protections that  have been provided to Virginians during this time by the Affordable  Care Act.   About 400,000 Virginians have Medicaid because of the Affordable Care  Act. Virginia embraced the expansion of Medicaid 2 years ago, so people  have been able to get insurance, many for the first time in their  lives, and that 400-plus thousand have been able to access care.   Virginians have been protected if they had preexisting conditions,  and now having had coronavirus is a preexisting condition, and the many  people who suffer from long-haul coronavirus symptoms have preexisting  conditions. They have been protected.   Young people have been able to stay on family policies, which has  been particularly helpful in a time of economic challenge, where a lot  of young people have lost jobs or not been able to find them. And other  people who have lost jobs in the private sector have been able to go on  the exchanges and buy insurance, and if their income isn't high, have a  subsidy that would make the premiums more affordable.   So as bad as this has been, it would have been a lot worse were it  not for an Affordable Care Act providing protections for families and  individuals.   I don't pretend to understand everything. I have been around for a  while, but there are a lot of things I still don't understand, and I  will just be candid. One thing I don't understand is why the repeal of  the Affordable Care Act is like the Moby Dick that the GOP and the  Trump administration has been searching to kill this worthy healthcare  bill that is protecting people at a critical time.   During the time I have been in the Senate, since 2013, I have seen,  during the Trump administration, numerous efforts to, via  administrative sabotage, weaken the law   I have been here as we have cast vote after vote after vote to repeal  the Affordable Care Act.   I saw a shutdown driven by a Senate colleague from Texas a few years  ago all around repealing the Affordable  [[Page S6346]]  Care Act. It was important enough to shut the entire government of the  United States down for more than 2 weeks.   I stood here on the floor at the most dramatic moment ever in my  political life. You might think it might have been, like, election  night 2016. No, the most dramatic moment ever in my political life was  the night we stood here on the floor at about 2 in the morning and John  McCain, having been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, came out of the  hospital and cast the deciding vote to make sure that millions of  Americans wouldn't lose their health insurance.   And in addition to administrative sabotage and repeated votes in the  Chamber, we have seen one court case after the next, sponsored by  Republicans, to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   And now we see sort of Moby Dick coming into sight with the  California v. Texas case to be argued at the Supreme Court on November  10.   My constituents in Virginia who rely on the Affordable Care Act and  are afraid to death for themselves and their family members are  petrified.   Let me read you some stories from four constituents of the many that  I have received.   Michelle from New Castle. New Castle is in Appalachian Southwest  Virginia. She wrote in about her 9-year-old son Evan. Michelle moved to  Virginia from Texas because Texas didn't have expanded Medicaid and  Virginia did.         I am new to Virginia. I recently moved from Texas, and [I]       am incredibly concerned with the Supreme Court nominee and       the protections given in the Affordable Care Act. My son       Evan, who is 9 years old, was born with a rare abdominal wall       defect called an omphalocele. After many surgeries, and       staying in the hospital for the first 8 months fighting for       his life, he came home. At the time, he was covered by his       father's employer-sponsored health insurance. He was       protected under the ACA. His health care, which included       ventilator support, tube feeding, and a number of surgeries,       easily came to millions of dollars.        As he has grown, he has received other diagnoses--autism,       ADHD, nystagmus and other visual impairments. I know very       well from my experience with health coverage in Texas, the       constant battle a person faces while trying to get treatment       for autism-related therapy, and to even be covered by       Medicaid. I was denied coverage for my son, because I ``made       too much.'' My income as a single mother was $35,000. I was       working sometimes 60 hours a week, paying $650 every month       for childcare. The cost of my employer sponsored health       insurance for myself and my son and daughter was $800 a       month. I could not afford that, and [I] had to choose between       having coverage for my children and being able to pay our       water and light bills. It took months to receive a decision       that we were denied for Medicaid.        Upon my move to Virginia, I was able to obtain Medicaid not       just for my son, who had been denied in Texas, but for every       household member. It took two weeks.        The ACA is protecting my son and his ability to be covered       by other insurance is so necessary. . . . I'm contacting my       Senators on subjects that affect my family frequently. . . .       My family means everything to me. My son's life isn't       something I take for granted. I fought for him, every day,       while he struggled through pulmonary hypertension, and it was       four long months before I [even] heard the words ``WHEN he       goes home'' rather than ``IF he goes home.''    Dawn from Virginia writes about her 20-year-old daughter--she is from  Vienna in Northern Virginia--who works a part-time job with no  benefits.         My daughter is 20 with multiple health conditions and has a       part time job with no benefits, but she is able to be on my       insurance. I am concerned about the upcoming Supreme Court       vote on the ACA.        What will happen to young people like my daughter if the       ACA is gone?    A veteran, Lieutenant Alvia from Hampton in Hampton Roads.         I am a 100% permanently disabled veteran. Although most of       my medical care is provided by the VA, my care is       supplemented by Medicare and the services of a Medicaid Alert       Service Dog. The latter two care services are threatened by       the abolishment of the Affordable Care Act and challenges to       the American Disability Act. . . . With the Supreme Court       scheduled to hear arguments to repeal the [ACA] soon, this       puts lives and rights at unacceptable risk.    Donna from Henrico in the Richmond area where I live writes about her  husband, diagnosed with glioblastoma brain cancer:         My husband was diagnosed with glioblastoma . . . back in       June of 2020. The insurance claims have now exceeded one       MILLION dollars and will continue to rise with doctors and       treatments. Thankfully, we have health insurance through the       Marketplace. My husband isn't able to work and my job has no       benefits.        I fear what it would be like for us if ObamaCare is       overturned by the Republicans. No private insurance will ever       accept us, so we must continue to rely on getting our       insurance through the Marketplace.    And now we are rushing a Supreme Court nominee. In 2016, I was in  this Chamber and saw many of my Republican colleagues make the argument  that they would not entertain a nomination by President Obama, not that  they would vote against the nominee--that would be consistent with  advise and consent--but that they would not let the individual in their  office, not have a Judiciary Committee hearing, not have a Judiciary  Committee vote, not have a floor debate, not have a floor vote.   And the principle that was newly announced in 2016 was ``let the  people decide.'' Let the voters vote for President and the Senate, and  then we will see about filling a Supreme Court vacancy.   And my colleagues looked me in the face and the voters in the face,  too, and they said: This precedent is a precedent we will apply equally  to a Republican President as a Democratic President.   But now that promise is being broken. Those words to colleagues and  those words to the public are being reversed.   There are some outside this body who think that is just what  politicians do. They say things and then do the opposite. They are not  surprised by that. I don't think that is true. My experience here since  2013 is when my colleagues tell me something, they do it.   I have got great relations with colleagues on the Republican side of  the aisle. When they tell me something, they do it. And if they can't  do it, they will tell me that.   This is very, very different. Changing the tune--we will not fill a  vacancy in a Presidential year. We will let the people decide--what is  the reason for the change?   And I have concluded that since people normally don't go back on what  they said--and this is a rare instance in my time here in the Senate-- the reason is a real important one, and the reason is finally we see  Moby Dick in our sight, and we have a chance to gut the Affordable Care  Act. We have one last chance it do it in a case that is going to be  argued in the Supreme Court on November 10.   And that is so important to us in a pandemic, with people dying and  sick and suffering, that we are willing to break our word to rush a  Justice to repeal the Affordable Care Act. For God's sake, why?   For God's sake, why?   I am struck by the fact I have unfairly used a broad brush to cast  aspersions at the GOP in the Senate. I am struck by the fact that two  GOP Senators said: You are right. This is wrong. We shouldn't rush the  Justice. We should let the people decide.   Who were the two Republicans who said that? Senators Collins of Maine  and Murkowski of Alaska, who, together with John McCain in August of  2017, stood on the floor in the middle of the night and cast deciding  votes to make sure that people would have healthcare instead of  millions losing their healthcare. They are sticking by their word  because they know what is at stake and they know what this rush means.   We shouldn't be rushing a Supreme Court nominee and people breaking  their word to do so. On the Court, we should hold folks to their  promises. Let the people decide. They are voting; 37 million people  have voted already in the United States. Let's let the people decide  who the next President is and who the next Senate is, and, obviously,  if it is a Republican President and Republican Senate, everyone will  understand moving quickly to voting on the nomination of Judge Barrett,  but let's at least let the people decide. That is what we should be  doing on the Court. And here's what we should be doing instead of  forcing an unprecedented rush to a Justice who can be part of  destroying the Affordable Care Act: Let's work on COVID. Let's work on  the healthcare crisis.   But I am disappointed. After good work together on four bills in  March and April to inject trillions of dollars to help people,  businesses, and hospitals, we knew we needed to do more. The House put  a bill on the table at the end of May, and then there were months of  delay here in the Senate.  [[Page S6347]]    I knew that the Senate Republican majority would not embrace the  House proposal, but I thought they would do something. But after the  House acted in May, June went by--nothing. July went by--nothing.  August went by--nothing. Most of September went by--nothing.   Eventually, a Republican proposal was put on the table that couldn't  even generate strong support within the Republican caucus. It was  dramatically insufficient, from my view, because it provided no  assistance for housing, rent, mortgage, food, SNAP benefits, State and  local government. It provided none of those things.   So Democrats and some Republicans voted against it with the hopes  that that vote would do exactly what it did when we cast a similar vote  in March: We vote down a partisan proposal. It opens the door for  negotiations. The White House gets engaged. We do something that is  good for the entire American public. Our vote did have that effect-- sort of.   The ``no'' vote on the Republican proposal in September did start a  more robust discussion with the White House about what should be done  to provide COVID relief--but not here in the Senate. Repeatedly, as  Democratic leadership has been talking to Secretary Mnuchin over at the  White House, we read in the paper that Senator McConnell, the leader,  has been telling members of the GOP: We are not doing a deal. Don't do  a deal--cold water on the deal.   Now we are having some sort of show votes on insufficient proposals  this week, but to come to the floor to cast a vote on a motion to table  a proposal when everybody knows it is not going anywhere because it is  not sufficient at the same time as we are reading headlines in the  paper that the majority leader is telling the GOP: Do not do a deal. Do  not do a COVID deal.   The PPP package that we voted on yesterday was insufficient. We  refilled the bucket for small businesses in April, as we should have,  and we have to refill it again. But the package yesterday didn't do  anything for restaurants, didn't do anything for many in the small  business sector, and it included nothing for individuals who are hit  hard by unemployment or families who need relief or people who need  testing.   The bill that we just voted on today, the ``skinny'' COVID bill, was  insufficient for the same reasons that led it to be voted down by  Democrats and Republicans in September.   As I conclude, I want to go back to the Eastern Shore. I have another  colleague on the floor who wants to talk, but I started off talking  about the Eastern Shore, where Virginia's COVID experience began with a  hot spot in two poultry processing plants.   I have a good-news story for the Presiding Officer because I was on  the Eastern Shore a couple of days ago, but I have a challenging punch  line to my good-news story.   This is where it started in Virginia--hot spots in these poultry  plants. These low-income workers--many immigrants--saw President Trump  declare that this was an essential industry, so they stood up and said:  If the industry is essential, we are not sawdust. We are not  inessential. We are not expendable. We are not throwaway. If the  industry is essential and has to sail, then we are essential too.   They stood up and asked the Governor to adopt a basic safety rule  about how to return safely to work in these plants during a time of  COVID. The Governor heard their request and said: Well, maybe, but let  me see if OSHA will do something. Won't the Federal labor agencies come  and put a safety rule in place? And OSHA did nothing.   So, in July, at the request of these poultry workers who are now in  an essential industry but are risking their health, the Governor of  Virginia enacted a temporary safety rule, not just for poultry plants  but for places of work to make sure that, as people are coming back to  work, they can be safe.   Good news, Mr. President: After that law was enacted, the cases on  the Eastern Shore declined and declined and declined, and of the 134  cities and counties in Virginia, right now, even with two of these big  poultry plants, the caseload on the Eastern Shore per capita is just  about the best in Virginia.   But the bill we just voted down, this ``skinny'' bill we just voted  down that had a liability protection component to it--it wasn't just  liability protection. I would be for liability protection. If you want  to protect someone from liability--normally we don't at the Federal  level, but you can. What you do is set a standard of care, and then you  say that everybody who exceeds the standard of care is protected from  liability.   The ``skinny'' proposal that we just voted on had liability  protection, but it didn't set a standard of care. It just excused  people from liability, and it did something even worse. It did  something even worse, and that was one of the reasons I voted against  it.   The bill that we just voted down would have wiped out the Virginia  safety rule. It would have wiped out the ability of any State to pass a  temporary safety rule to protect workers so that they could come back  to work safely in a time of COVID.   It is one thing to try to kill the Affordable Care Act in the middle  of a pandemic and take health insurance away from millions. It is  another thing to rush a Supreme Court Justice in violation of what you  said you would do to try to achieve your goal of killing the Affordable  Care Act. But trying to wipe out State safety laws that are working in  my Commonwealth to effectively protect workers whom the President has  declared essential--I have seen everything. I have seen everything   I yield the floor.
