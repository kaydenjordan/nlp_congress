 Madam Speaker, I would like to take a  moment to honor the life of my dear friend, Batta Vucijic.   Batta was a leader in our community whose contributions to North LA  County will live on for several generations. As a founding board member  at the Ministry of Life Without Limbs, he spread the good word of our  savior Jesus Christ to many, including those in prison ministries.   Batta is served by the love of his life, Rita; their seven children,  Marco, Natalie, Elena, Lara, Daniela, Dario, Ariana, and Nataliya, who  he loved as his own; their spouses; and dozens more family members.   I will always remember Batta's commitment to our community and his  friendship. We will miss him dearly. Today, he sits next to the one  true king in heaven and looks down upon us all with pride with his  warm, humble demeanor.   Batta was a dear friend, a great American, and a true believer. We  love you and miss you, my friend. God blessed us with Batta's presence  and now has brought him home.                            ____________________
