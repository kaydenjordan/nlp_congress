 Mr. Chair, I thank my good friend and  colleague for writing such an important bill, and I thank Chairman  Graves and Mr. Larsen for the great cooperation between both sides of  the aisle.   Mr. Chair, my amendment, cosponsored by Jeff Van Drew and Dr.   Andy  Harris, requires the President or his designee to certify that offshore  wind turbine projects in the North Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic Planning  Areas will not ``weaken, degrade, interfere with, or nullify the  capability of radar relied upon by the FAA or the Armed Forces.''   It would also require the DOT IG to conduct a comprehensive review of  the sufficiency of the process used to approve offshore wind projects  in areas critical to air travel and national security.   Many of us, Mr. Chair, are deeply concerned over the safety,  efficacy, and likely deleterious environmental impact of embedding some  3,400 ocean wind turbines, each the size of the Chrysler Building in  New York City, off our coast.   We have serious, well-founded concerns that offshore wind turbines  will interfere with radar capabilities and, as a direct consequence,  create a dangerous and potentially catastrophic impact on both military  and commercial aviation activities, as well as helicopters used by the  Coast Guard to save lives.    Offshore wind development will affect some of the busiest airspace in  the country, including the areas surrounding New York, Boston,  Philadelphia, and Washington, which contain major international  airports, dozens of smaller airports, and several military and Coast  Guard aviation facilities.   Mr. Chair, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's radar interference  analysis from August of 2020 stated: ``The research team found that the  proposed and hypothetical wind farms are within the line of sight of 36  radar systems, indicating that they will generate interference to these  radars under normal atmospheric conditions'' and ``future offshore wind  energy installations off the Atlantic Coast may impact land-based radar  systems.''   Additionally, in 2017, the interagency Ground-Based Coastal Air  Surveillance Wind Turbine-Radar Interference Vulnerability Study found  that: ``Offshore wind turbines may pose unique impacts to coastal radar  systems given the differences in propagation of radar signals over the  ocean versus land, as well as the larger size of offshore wind turbines  compared to land-based wind turbines.''   This particular analysis, I would point out, relied on the Block  Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island whose turbines are 589  feet tall. The turbines slated for installation off the New Jersey and  New York coast are significantly higher, approximately 1,000 feet. They  are huge, and they will affect radar.   The DOD has expressed serious concerns over offshore wind development  off the Virginia coast. How does that apply to us and to commercial  aviation, which is, again, the gist of this amendment?   I have personally, Mr. Chair, read several of the major impact  studies for these projects, and they confidently, almost arrogantly,  suggest and assert that problems that might arise can be ``mitigated.''   Really? Then support my amendment and ensure that that's the case and  that we do our due diligence.   A 2022 comprehensive study by the National Academy of Sciences found  that: ``Wind turbine generator mitigation techniques have not been''--I  emphasize ``have not been''--``substantially investigated, implemented,  matured, or deployed.''   Additionally, the NAS found that wind turbine generator returns  obfuscate even marine vessel radar. That is not the subject here, but  it is radar. Therefore, it leads to false images when vessels are  traversing our oceans.   Mr. Chair, allies, including Taiwan, Japan, Finland, and Sweden, have  halted certain offshore wind turbine projects due to objections from  their armed services. An article last year in the Taiwan News said:  ``The military has confirmed wind turbines could interfere with the  surface-to-air missile systems deployed in the northwestern coast of  Taiwan. The low-frequency noise generated by the turbines is likely to  affect the reflected radio waves that phased array radars need to  detect signals of missiles or aircraft.''                                time  0930    That is very serious. This wall will make us blind potentially. It  will inhibit our ability to see what is going on. Again, there is so  much commercial aircraft, and they need to have unfettered ability to  traverse the skies.   Finally, no matter where any of my colleagues stand on offshore wind,  a certification by the President or his designee--and the due diligence  that that will require--that offshore wind turbines do not weaken,  degrade, interfere with, or nullify the capability of radar relied on  by the FAA is both prudent and it is absolutely necessary.   Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished chairman for including this in  his en bloc amendment.
