 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the families  that are feeling the burden of ObamaCare.   Premiums have skyrocketed an average of 19 percent in our State, and  insurers are fleeing the market left and right. In fact, 73 percent of  counties in Florida only have one insurance provider, leaving people  with higher costs and less choice when it comes to their health care.  That is why the President's healthcare law has failed the people of  Florida.   Now, Republicans are offering up solid solutions to make our Nation's  healthcare system work for everyone, without pulling the rug from  anybody's feet. We are focused on a more affordable, more personalized  healthcare plan that empowers patients, not Washington.   I am proud to serve on the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee as  we begin our first steps this week to bring relief to the people of  Florida and our Nation.                            ____________________
