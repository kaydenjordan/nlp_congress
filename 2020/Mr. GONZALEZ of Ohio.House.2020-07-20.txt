 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my  amendment No. 151 that is included in this en bloc amendment.   This amendment is based on my bipartisan bill, H.R. 5051, the  Accountability for World Bank Loans to China Act that I introduced with  my colleague, Mr. Heck.   In recent decades, China has worked to take advantage of  international institutions like the World Bank, often in opposition to  U.S. interests.   Today, China is one of the largest economies in the world and is also  one of the largest creditors to developing nations. Despite that, China  still receives funding under the World Bank IBRD program, even though  China has exceeded IBRD's gross national income threshold for  graduation from the program.   In other words, the United States' contributions to the World Bank  help finance Chinese infrastructure projects, including in Zhejiang.  This has to stop.   This amendment would require the U.S. director at the IBRD to pursue  the graduation of China and, until China graduates, prioritize projects  in China that contribute to the global public good.   Additionally, this amendment requires the Treasury Department to  report to Congress on the level of indebtedness of countries receiving  assistance through the Belt and Road Initiative that are also  beneficiaries of international financial institutions.
