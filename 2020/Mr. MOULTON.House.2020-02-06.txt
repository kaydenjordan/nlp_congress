 Madam Speaker, 2 years ago, I was standing at a rally  where the father of a gunshot victim, a father who lost his son to gun  violence, spoke of all the things that he and others are doing to stop  this senseless scourge, things that they are already doing.   But then he turned to the crowd, and he said, ``But what is Congress  doing?'' And tens of thousands of people, as if they had rehearsed it a  hundred times, all said, together, ``Nothing.''   ``But what is Congress doing?''   ``Nothing.''   Madam Speaker, for too long, Congress has done nothing. We have  passed bills here in the House that take the right steps, but this  alone is not enough. The Senate needs to do their job, and we need to  make them law. Thoughts and prayers won't cut it, only action saves  lives.                            ____________________
