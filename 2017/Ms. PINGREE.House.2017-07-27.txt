 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member very much for  yielding to me today.   I rise during this en bloc amendment debate to discuss an issue that  is raised in the amendment about the importance of the DDG-51 to our  Navy. In particular, I am grateful to our committee for the clear  guidance and language that was provided in the fiscal year 2017 Omnibus  Appropriations Act that was passed in this body just 2 short months  ago.   That language called attention to the need not only to support the  DDG-51 program but to ensure we do so with a design and upgrade that is  technically mature and fiscally responsible.   It was clear in that language, and in report language that is  included in the bill before us today, that Congress continues to expect  the Navy to comply with the direction that the additional fiscal year  `16 DDG-51 ship be contracted and completed as a flight II-A ship.   Because there are concerns raised by the GAO about the new flight III  design radar upgrade for the DDG-51, there needs to be a thoughtful  process in place.   Again, I want to thank the chair and ranking member who have been  incredibly supportive of the DDG program in the past and the work that  it brings to States like Maine and across the country.
