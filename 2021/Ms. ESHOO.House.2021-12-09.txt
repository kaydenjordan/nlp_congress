 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Maloney for her  special leadership. I am so proud of my classmate.   Madam Speaker, as we gather here on the floor, it really is a somber  day here at the Capitol with the remains of the former majority leader  of the Senate, Senator Robert Dole. He was a man who fought for our  democracy, paid for it in terms of the injuries that he sustained  during the war, and came to Congress to defend our democracy.   That is what we are doing here on the floor of the House. We are  working to protect our democracy. I am proud that my legislation is  included in this. Let me say a few words about it.   Since Watergate, Presidential candidates and Vice Presidential  candidates voluntarily put their tax returns out to the public. In  2016, there were two that were running, one on each side, that did not  do that. I observed it. I was upset about it. I wrote legislation on  it.    Madam Speaker, what this legislation does is make it a  requirement for those who seek the Presidency and the Vice Presidency  to put out to the public their tax returns. Why? Tax returns contain  vital information: whether a candidate has paid any taxes, what assets  they own, how much they have borrowed, who they borrowed it from, have  they taken advantage of tax loopholes of offshore tax shelters, whether  they have foreign bank accounts, and if they have made charitable  contributions.   Truth and transparency need to be a part of the democratic process. I  am very proud and grateful that my legislation is contained in a bill  that overall is called the Protecting Our Democracy Act.   Madam Speaker, all colleagues should vote for this because we raised  our hands and pledged to protect our democracy and defend it against  all enemies, foreign and domestic.
