 Mr. Speaker, make no mistake: Our border is broken.   This administration, for over 2 years, has been unwilling or unable  to secure our southern border.   Statistics show that in FY21, President Biden set a record with 1.9  million encounters. In FY22, he broke that record with 2.7 million  encounters. In FY23, President Biden is on pace to break that record  once again.   The numbers to my left paint a grim picture of the dire situation  along our southern border, and these numbers will only grow worse as  title 42 expires.   Republicans from Homeland Security, from Judiciary, from Foreign  Affairs, have worked together to craft legislation that will combat the  border crisis, a crisis created by the failures of this administration.   This legislation will hire thousands of new agents, pay retention  bonuses to our frontline officers, invest in new technology, construct  hundreds of miles of walls and barriers, and support our local and  State partners.   Congress must fill the gap of leadership created by the inaction of  this administration. We must stop the flow of illegal drugs from  pouring into our communities. We must end the flood of immigrants that  are coming across each and every day. We must support the hardworking  men and women of law enforcement who are on the front lines of this  crisis.   We will not back down from this fight, and any veto threat by this  President be damned. We will deliver security to the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support on this measure.
