 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, every year, the Environmental Protection  Agency honors students across the country for outstanding leadership  and environmental achievements with the President's Environmental Youth  Awards. Among this year's winners is Mr. Anderson's first grade class  in Okanogan, Washington.   The students at Virginia Grainger Elementary School were recognized  for their project titled ``Make Soil Not Smoke.'' The class created a  school garden and learned about the benefits of composting leaves  instead of burning them. They decided to use their project to spread  awareness about the benefits of composting and the harmful effects of  burning leaves.   Their project is important to a community that has experienced  firsthand the destruction of wildfires. As excitement for the project  grew, the community joined in by donating compost materials, garden  tools, and worms for vermicomposting.   In one year, Mr. Anderson's students have created over 200 cubic  yards of garden compost. They use demonstrations, a parade float, and  booths at State fairs and farmers markets to continue spreading  awareness.   Please join me in recognizing the outstanding work the Make Soil Not  Smoke group is doing for their community.                            ____________________
