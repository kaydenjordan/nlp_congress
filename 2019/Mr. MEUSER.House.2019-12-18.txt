 Madam Speaker, back home people refer to Capitol Hill as  a bubble. They are right. It is as if we are completely detached from  what is going on in communities across America. Many here don't hear or  listen to what people are saying, and many here, as well, think they  know better than the people we serve.   Our communities are benefiting greatly from President Trump's agenda:  a booming economy, a secure border, better trade deals, and a stronger  military. Unfortunately, inside the Halls of Congress, Democrats'  obsession with impeachment is all consuming.   Is this how Democrat leadership chooses to represent the people of  America, by nullifying the results of the 2016 election, disregarding  the will of the American people, and doing everything in their power to  prevent the President and this Congress from doing the job we were  elected to do?   After 3 years of trying and months of unfair, politically motivated  impeachment proceedings, Democrats have delivered two weak Articles of  Impeachment.   Abuse of power?   Not according to Ukraine. President Zelensky confirmed many times  that there was no quid pro quo, no action taken, and significant  military aid was delivered without anything in return. Of course, his  words have been conveniently dismissed.  [[Page H12142]]    Obstruction of Congress?   Is this the new standard?   If this is the new standard, then every President since Jimmy Carter  and every President moving forward would and will be impeached.   Let me be clear: It is an honor to serve in the United States House  of Representatives, but today I am distraught. Today Democrats will  disregard the will of the American people and vote to impeach the duly  elected President of the United States. What should be equally  troubling is that this has eroded, if not wiped out, the trust the  American people have in the 116th Congress.
