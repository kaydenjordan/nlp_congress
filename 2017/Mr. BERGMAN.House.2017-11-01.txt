 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2936, the  Resilient Federal Forests Act. My district is home to three national  forests, Ottawa, Hiawatha, and Huron-Manistee. So when we use the term  ``in our neck of the woods,'' we mean it.   We understand how vitally important proper management of forests is  for our environment, our economy, and our special way of life in  northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. I live right in the middle  of the Ottawa National Forest, so this issue really does hit close to  home for me.   Now as we have seen the devastation from forest fires in the West, it  is more important than ever to have this debate. But it is impossible  to talk about the need for wildfire suppression without talking about  proper forest management. These two go hand in hand--or at least they  should go hand in hand.                                time  1530    All too often, we hear rhetoric that managing our forests and  removing dead or dying trees is a bad thing. This can't be further from  the truth.   When we leave these dried, rotting trees laying on the forest floor,  they become an incendiary breeding ground for fires. Those fires cost  the Forest Service billions of dollars and countless hours of manpower  to extinguish. Last year alone, we spent $2.9 billion on suppression  efforts. This leaves barely any financial resources to allocate towards  actually managing our forests.   H.R. 2936 seeks to end this cycle. Let's get at the problem now so it  doesn't become a disaster later. This is not a partisan issue. This is  a commonsense solution for our federally owned forest land.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Forest  Products Industry National Labor Management Committee and a letter from  the Intertribal Timber Council.                                                   October 31, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Subject: Support for HR 2936, The Resilient Federal Forests           Act of 2017.        Dear Congressman Bishop: As chair of the Forest Products       Industry National Labor Management Committee, I am writing in       strong support of HR 2936, The Resilient Federal Forests Act       of 2017. I urge you to vote in support of HR 2936 when it       comes to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote       on Wednesday, November 1.        The Forest Products Industry National Labor Management       Committee is a non-profit trust formed to pursue the common       public policy interests of the working men and women in the       forest products industry. Collectively, the Committee       represents more than two million workers across the nation,       including lumber and sawmill workers, woodworkers,       machinists, carpenters, and pulp and paper workers.        The balanced and sustainable management of our federally-      owned forests has been of significant interest to the       Committee since it was founded in 1990. Since that time, the       Committee has engaged on numerous pieces of federal forest       and related legislation.        HR 2936 is a bipartisan measure that will address the       growing economic and environmental threats posed by       catastrophic wildfires. HR 2936 provides a responsible       budgetary solution and targeted forest management reforms to       improve the health and resiliency of America's forests.       Adoption of these proposals will enhance federal forest       stewardship; protect forest ecosystems from catastrophic fire       and disease; and preserve rural, family wage jobs.        The Forest Products Industry National Labor Management       Committee urges you to vote in support of HR 2936, the       Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, when the measure comes       to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote this       week.            Sincerely,      Mike Draper,        Chairman, Forest Products Industry National Labor       Management Committee.                                   ____                                       Intertribal Timber Council,                                         Portland, OR, July 5, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop: The Executive Board of the       Intertribal Timber Council (ITC) supports H.R. 2936, the       Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, sponsored by Rep.       Bruce Westerman.        We wish to particularly express our strong support for       Title VII, which will enhance tribal input and involvement in       the restoration of federal forest lands. Such restoration       projects are sorely needed to improve forest health and       reduce threats to lands held in trust for Indians as well as       non-trust federal land upon which Indian tribes access for       traditional, subsistence and treaty-guaranteed purposes.        Section 701 would provide timelines for review, approval       and implementation of Tribal Forest Protection Act projects.       This new authority is needed because of the underperformance       of the TFPA authority. Thirteen years after Congress passed       the TFPA, only three projects have been fully implemented,       while others linger in years of procedural abyss. As a       result, tribal forest lands remain at high risk of wildfire       coming from adjacent federal lands. This section would give       tribes the certainty to pursue TFPA projects with their       federal neighbors and reduce the risk of wildfire migrating       from federal lands onto Indian trust land.        Section 702 would give the Forest Service and BLM a new       ability to have tribes carry out forest restoration projects       in their homelands. Improvement of forest health and       ecological functions are vital to maintain watersheds and       fish and wildlife habitat on lands that may be subject to       federally-reserved tribal rights. Acting through the Bureau       of Indian Affairs, tribes would be able to restore lands       using the federal regulatory structure used on Indian trust       lands. As the Committee has noted on several occasions,       tribal forest management is able to achieve greater results       faster and at lower costs than on federal land. This       provision would help bring that successful management       approach to federal lands sorely in need of restoration.        Section 703 authorizes pilot authority for the Interior and       Agriculture Departments to grant ``638'' contracting       authority to tribes and tribal organizations for the       administrative and management functions of TFPA projects.        The ITC is a forty-one year old association of more than       fifty Indian tribes and Alaska Native organizations that       collectively manage more than 90% of the 18 million acres of       forest land held in trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.       The ITC is dedicated to pursuing the best management and       protection of tribal forests and other natural resources. We       actively participated in the development of the National       Indian Forest Resources Management Act (PL 101-630, 1990) and       the Tribal Forest Protection Act (PL 108-278, 2004). It is       our pleasure to now support H.R. 2936.            Sincerely,                                                       Phil Rigdon,                                                         President.     Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 2936.    Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 2936.
