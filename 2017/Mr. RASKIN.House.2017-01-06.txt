 Mr. President, I have an objection because 10 of the 29  electoral votes cast by Florida were cast by electors not lawfully  certified because they violated Florida's prohibition against dual  office holding.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Debate is out of order.   Section 15 and 17 of title 3 of the United States Code requires that  any objection presented be in writing, signed by both a Member of the  House of Representatives and a Senator.   Is the objection in writing and signed not only by the Member of the  House of Representatives, but also by a Senator?    It is in writing, Mr. President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is it signed by a Senator?    It is in writing, Mr. President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is it signed by a Senator?    Not as of yet, Mr. President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. In that case, the objection cannot be  entertained.   Senator KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, the certificate of the electoral  vote of the State of Georgia seems to be regular in form and authentic,  and it appears therefrom that Donald J. Trump of the State of New York  received 16 votes for President and Michael R. Pence of the State of  Indiana received 16 votes for Vice President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. For what purpose does the gentlewoman from  Washington rise?
