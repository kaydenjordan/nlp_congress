 Madam Speaker, I stand here today after speaking with  business owners across my district and the country. I have heard story  after story of businesses struggling to get entry-level, minimum-wage  workers back to work. Why is that? Because they are actually having to  compete, not against COVID or lockdowns, but against the Federal  Government to get employees back to work.   In my home State of Texas, you can make up to $535 in unemployment  insurance, but add in the additional $300 per week payments that came  from Federal COVID relief, and that is $835 per week not to work. That  equates to nearly $21 an hour. That is exactly why Texas and 20 other  States have opted out of Federal COVID unemployment insurance benefits.  But there are still States where business owners are being forced to  compete against the Federal Government for employees.   My own brother, Tyler, who owns a construction company in Wisconsin,  told me business has picked up for him. What a blessing. Now, he is  trying to hire additional employees to grow his business. He has just  got one problem: Folks are telling him they are making more sitting at  home at $17.50 an hour. They tell him if he wants them to work, he is  going to have to pay them $25 an hour.   Situations like my brother Tyler's were hardly an unexpected  consequence of paying workers more not to work. So expected, it seems  as though when Democrats failed to get their minimum wage hikes through  the Senate in February, they used the Federal unemployment insurance  program to accomplish the same result, albeit temporarily.   While there are many who are still struggling from the effects of  COVID, whether it be from health effects or the effects of lockdowns on  their business, millions more are taking advantage of the unemployment  insurance system and sitting at home playing Xbox instead of working  and being productive members of society.   On top of a labor shortage driven by the Federal Government paying  people not to work, President Biden is proposing historic levels of  spending and raising taxes on our job creators. His multi-trillion- dollar proposals, like his $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan and $1.8  trillion American Families Plan, will cost thousands of jobs through  tax hikes amid an already struggling market.   What message does raising the corporate tax rate send to job creators  when they are trying to rebuild in the aftermath of the pandemic? It  sure sounds like we are telling them to take their business overseas or  hire less.   To bounce back from the Biden administration's dismal job reports in  April, which showed just 266,000 new jobs added, certainly  underperforming the Dow Jones estimate of 1 million new jobs, we need  to be stimulating economic opportunity and growth with less taxes and  less regulation, which will create good-paying jobs that encourage  people to get back in the workforce.   What won't fix our struggling economy is throwing money at the  problem, which seems to be all the Washington swamp knows how to do.  The liberal tax-and-spend model is failing our economy and failing the  American people. Gas prices are up, homes are more expensive, and the  per pound cost of copper is more than double what it was just 12 months  ago.   We are not going to spend our way out of this mess with $1-trillion  programs that do nothing but serve liberal  [[Page H2548]]  special interests. We do it by letting the free market flourish through  lower taxes, lower regulation, and more economic freedom.   This model worked under President Trump, who delivered record lows in  unemployment for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and women, and it will work  again, if only the Biden administration will put the American people  first and not special interests.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is time to get Americans back to work. The  vaccine is available for all. Cases are down across the country.  Businesses have openings they need to fill.   Using COVID as an excuse to stay home and collect unemployment  insurance is not healthy for our economy or workers. We should be  encouraging folks to take control of their lives and get back to work,  but the multitrillion-dollar proposals out of the Biden administration  and the continued COVID Federal unemployment insurance payments of $300  per week are encouraging folks to stay home.   We just saw the Democrats and the Biden administration deliver  266,000 new jobs in the month of May, when the Dow Jones predicted 1  million jobs would be added.                                time  1930    Why this incredible underachievement? Because the policies of the  Democrats and the Biden administration are failing our economy, failing  our business owners, and failing the American people.   Gas prices are skyrocketing across the country. The per-pound cost of  copper is more than double what it was just 12 months ago. And the  price of homes is rising. The annual inflation rate is triple what it  was in 2020 and the highest it has been in over a decade.   These are the consequences of spending trillions of dollars on COVID  relief and continuing to pay people not to work. The swamp continues to  waste taxpayer dollars on failed policies they say we can fix by  continuing to spend trillions more. When is enough enough? When are we  going to let the free market flourish?   That is the path back to our historic economy pre-COVID. The sooner  we decide to get back to lower taxes, less regulation, and more  economic freedom, the quicker we can get the American people back to  work and the economy back to health.
