 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an  [[Page S9044]]  outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize a  family-owned small business, Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q of Bowling Green, KY,  as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Kaye and Phil Huffer purchased Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q in 1999. Smokey Pig  Bar-B-Q's founder, Ned ``Smokey'' Nickerson, began serving up his  signature Monroe County-style barbecue in 1969 when he established the  restaurant. To prepare this southern Kentucky staple, the meat is  prepared with no spices before being smoked over hickory wood. The  hickory-smoked meat has a distinct flavor and is served with a vinegar- based sauce. Before his family bought the business, Phil regularly made  the 100-mile round trip from Bowling Green to his hometown to purchase  Monroe County-style barbecue. Noticing the absence of this particular  style of barbecue in Warren County, Kaye and Phil decided to run a  barbecue restaurant. They bought Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q, welcoming their  first customers in March 1999.   More than 20 years later, Kaye and Phil continue to serve up some of  the best barbecue in Bowling Green. Folks drive from all over the  Commonwealth to enjoy their delicious cuisine and family-friendly  hospitality. Kaye and Phil's care and attention to detail are evident  in every aspect of Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q's restaurant and catering  business. Even the charcoal is made on site, using hickory wood from  local sawmills. Their son Scott has also joined his parents in  dedicating himself to the restaurant's continued success.   Together, Kaye and Phil seek to give back to their community in any  way possible. Through Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q, Kaye and Phil regularly  support community organizations, including Norton Children's Hospital  in Louisville, KY. When their son, Matthew, was born preterm, they  turned to the Children's Hospital for support. Now, Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q  is a longtime supporter of the hospital, supporting their mission to  continue helping children overcome health challenges.   Over the years, Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q's unique cuisine has been profiled  by local and national media. It is currently rated as TripAdvisor's No.  1 Quick Bites in Bowling Green, and Grubwire named it the best  restaurant in Bowling Green in 2019. Additionally, the Kentucky Pork  Producers Association honored Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q as the 2018 Pork  Restaurant of the Year. For more than a decade, locals have voted  Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q as ``Best of Bowling Green'' in BG Daily News's  annual readers' choice awards. The restaurant was also featured in the  Food Network's ``Feasting on Asphalt'' series hosted by Alton Brown.   Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q is a remarkable example of how hard work and  ingenuity can turn a dream into reality. Small businesses like Smokey  Pig Bar-B-Q form the heart of towns across Kentucky and regularly step  up to support their communities. Congratulations to Phil, Kaye, and the  entire Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q team. I wish them the best of luck and look  forward to watching their continued growth and success in  Kentucky.                            ____________________
