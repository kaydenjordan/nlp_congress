 Mr. Speaker, since President Trump took office, I have  heard from hundreds of my constituents who are concerned about attacks  by this new administration on the Environmental Protection Agency and  the potential, long-term negative impacts on public health, clean  water, clean air, and our Nation's work to play a leading role in  combating climate change.   Thelma from Lowell wrote:         Without EPA and its mission to protect our water and air, I       fear that all the work done over the past 40 years will be       erased.    Ingrid from Groton wrote:         I need to be able to trust that the EPA will protect our       air, water, land, and health. But Scott Pruitt has worked so       closely with polluters, even suing the EPA more than a dozen       times, how can we trust that he will protect our health and       safety?    And demonstrating just how personal an issue this is for many people,  Katherine from Acton wrote to me:         This is my first time writing a congressional       Representative, and I am proud to be doing so now, though my       motivation is less heartening. As a mother of two precocious       young kids, I have little time to do much beyond the       essentials of daily living, much less writing a letter, so I       assure you this one is written out of a feeling of necessity.    She went on to say:         Environmental pollution is real and in our backyards. It       contaminates our air, our water, and our land. Cleanup of       these pollutants is extremely difficult, if not impossible,       and the implications for our health are astounding.    Unfortunately, the legislation before us today will do nothing to  assuage the fears of my constituents and millions of others around the  country who support independent, unbiased, science-based decisionmaking  at the EPA, which is essential to protecting public health, clean  water, and combating climate change.   Instead of promoting sound science, this legislation would weaken the  scientific expertise of the EPA's Science Advisory Board, the  independent body that reviews scientific and technical information used  in EPA decisionmaking and provides scientific advice to the EPA  Administrator.   If Congress really wants to promote sound science, I would urge  consideration of the Scientific Integrity Act, legislation that I  introduced along with Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas and  Representatives Lowenthal and Tonko. Our bill will protect scientific  research at Federal agencies from political interference and special  interests. This legislation currently has 93 cosponsors, and it  deserves debate in this House.   The majority is trying to claim that the legislation before us today  helps us achieve goals similar to those of the Scientific Integrity  Act, but my constituents aren't fooled.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1431.
