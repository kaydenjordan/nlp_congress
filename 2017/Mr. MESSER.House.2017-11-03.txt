 Madam Speaker, Hoosier families deserve a pay raise, and  that is what President Trump's tax plan is going to give them: more  jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks for working Hoosiers.   Importantly, the plan includes a provision that I have been working  on that would stop $4 billion to $7 billion in refundable tax credits  paid out each year to illegal immigrants. This is a giant step in the  right direction to protect American taxpayers and American families. In  the Trump tax plan these savings will help increase child tax credits  for American citizens by $600 each child.   Hoosiers get it. It is past time to address an immigration system  that rewards people who come here illegally. No one should get a tax  incentive to violate the law.                            ____________________
