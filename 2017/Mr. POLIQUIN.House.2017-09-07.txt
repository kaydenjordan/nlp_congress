 Mr. Chairman, I am thrilled to rise today to speak on  behalf of my amendment which will remove unnecessary, redundant, and  burdensome regulations from our sea urchins and sea cucumbers industry  in the great State of Maine.   Now, we have some of the most hardworking people, Mr. Chair, in our  State, and some of them--about 600 or so of them--along with the  processing part brave the cold, dark waters of the great State of Maine  and dive for sea urchins and cucumbers and harvest them on a regular  basis year-round. It is a process that is dangerous, but these  delicacies are sold all around the world, mostly in the Far East, and  we need to make sure our government helps these individuals work this  terrific fishery that has been doing so well in the past.   Now, I want to thank my colleague, Chellie Pingree, who represents  the First District. I represent the Second District of Maine. She has  been very helpful. We have worked together for quite some time on this  issue in a bipartisan way to make sure, Mr. Chairman, that we don't  have too many regulations that are unnecessary and expensive such that  we can make sure this part of our fishery is healthy and goes forward.   So, again, I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, very much your giving me this  opportunity to speak on behalf of my amendment.
