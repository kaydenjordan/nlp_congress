 Madam President, I rise today to honor the service of  Janet Piraino, my State director, who will retire from my office and  the U.S. Senate on July 19, 2021.   Janet has spent her professional career dedicated to serving  Wisconsinites. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin--Madison,  Janet forged a path in public service early in her career. Her first  job was as a field organizer for a race for Wisconsin Governor,  followed by nearly 10 years as a legislative policy advisor to  Wisconsin legislators in the State capitol.   Janet quickly earned recognition as a valued staff member and  committed leader. Her experiences working with both legislators and  constituents led to her assuming positions in a variety of roles, both  at the local and Federal government level.   Over the past 30-plus years, Janet has served in a variety of  capacities with many Wisconsin elected officials, including 7 years as  State director for U.S. Senator Russ Feingold; 2 years as chief of  staff for Congressman Tom Barrett; 8 years as chief of staff for  Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz; and 2 years as district director for  U.S. Congressman Mark Pocan. Outside of her roles in government, Janet  has also worked as a special assistant for State relations at the  University of Wisconsin System and as vice president for advancement at  the Overture Center Foundation in Madison, where she led the charge to  help transition this legacy performing arts venue from a city-run venue  to a privately owned facility.   Janet is also an active member of many community organizations,  including Madison's Downtown Rotary. She spends considerable time  engaged in meeting with others interested in pursuing a career in  public service and has mentored countless Wisconsinites over these many  years.   Outside of the office, Janet enjoys spending time with her partner of  20 years, J.R. Sims, their grandbaby, Titan Cairo Sims, and their  enthusiastic pandemic puppy, Sadie. Janet also enjoys traveling and  participating in organized bike rides, including the Door County  Century and the Best Dam Bike Tour on her Wisconsin made Trek Madone.  She is a devoted fan of the Milwaukee Bucks, especially Giannis  Antetokounmpo, and is always eager to host friends and colleagues on  her roof deck overlooking the Madison skyline.   I knew of Janet's can-do reputation and energetic commitment to  public service long before she joined my Senate office in 2015, and I  am delighted that she has become a valued member of our team. Along  with my entire U.S. Senate staff, I wish her all the best as she begins  a new chapter with her well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
