 Mr. Speaker, just getting ourselves set up. I was  going to yield some time to a fellow Member for a moment, but I think  that Member has disappeared.   We are going to try something tonight. And for anyone watching and  listening, if you don't like lots of geeky conversation and lots of  math, this isn't your night to watch.   We are going to try to walk through a handful of concepts. One is one  we have been discussing with our economic team.   Look, I am blessed to be on Ways and Means, but I also am the senior  Republican for Joint Economic. I have a handful of Ph.D. economists,  and we have been sort of trying to understand what the Federal Reserve  is doing on inflation and why it is becoming so difficult to crush  inflation in our society and in our economy.   Then we are going to walk through some numbers so there is an  absolute understanding of what has happened, particularly to the  working middle class in this country, demonstrate how much poorer they  are today than even a couple years ago in purchasing power and the  reality of just how devastating inflation is to people, people that  save, people that tend to have a retirement, actually people who are  just trying to make a living and survive. We are going to show some  charts just demonstrating how much poorer Americans are.   Then we are going to do some walking through Democrat policy,  particularly from the last couple of years, and sort of show the fact  that their math is not lining up with what we are seeing and their math  is not lining up with other economists. The reason for that is, at the  same time, we are going to also talk about how much debt has been  created in the last couple years, that what was demographics--we are  getting older as a society--and actually what was just spending  priorities of the left.   Much of this we are running and gunning. We got the President's  budget a couple hours ago. We are trying to assemble an understanding.  But just a demonstration of here are the tax hikes, here are the  spending priorities, and trying to also run ahead of the propaganda  mills that often what our modern media is on: ``They are going to cut  the deficit.'' No, they are not. They claim $3 billion. Well, there is  like $3 trillion over the 10, but it is a time where there is going to  be $20 trillion of borrowing. So, okay, that is if every tax hike goes  in and it does not slow down the economy.   So, first off, a concept. The Federal Reserve, when they are raising  interest rates, when they are rolling off the book of bonds, all of the  holdings they have, even mortgaged-backed paper, what are they doing?  No, seriously, I need everyone to sort of think this through. What are  they doing? They are basically pulling liquidity out of the economy by  removing the cash. Because in the previous couple of years, pandemic,  whatever excuse you want to give, this body pumped massive amounts of  liquidity.   Here are checks; we are not going to ask you to work; you don't have  to participate in the economy. All that cash is sitting out there. Then  you hit everything from supply chain issues to manufacturing issues to  people saying: I get money, I don't have to participate in the economy,  so I don't have to work.   You get inflation. Remember our high school economics classes. What  is inflation? Simplest definition: Too many dollars chasing too few  goods and services.   So why has the interest rate hikes and the pulling of liquidity out-- because, remember, the Federal Reserve is doing more than raising  interest rates. They are letting their balance sheets roll off, and by  rolling that off, that should also be stripping much liquidity--why  isn't it working? There  [[Page H1242]]  are certain things we are seeing. Commodity prices seem to be coming  down. Wage hikes are not keeping up, though, with current inflation,  which is a really bad, bad thing.   But if you look at every model we had from the second quarter of last  year, third quarter, and fourth quarter of last year, we should be much  further in the progress of knocking down inflation than we are.   I know there was some dodgier economic news today. But yesterday,  remember seeing the 2-year treasury bill going over 5 percent? Then it  fell. But just the fact that it hit, I think, one of the all-time highs  in modern times, unless you understand how much of the market thought  inflation is staying with us longer.   Our economists actually came back with a theory. So you have the  Federal Reserve trying to pull liquidity out, but on the other side of  this equation, you have fiscal policy. This Congress, when it was  controlled by the left, our Democrat brothers and sisters put so much  cash, so much money into the economy, as we start to walk through some  of the things that were happening, the American Rescue Plan, the  omnibus bills that actually raised spending. You add everything from  even the CHIPS Act and all of these other things where you are pumping  in money.    So you understand the point I am trying to make is, if you cannot  line up fiscal policy--and fiscal policy is what we do in Congress-- what happens when it is working contrary to monetary policy. Monetary  policy is what the Federal Reserve does. And we are starting to  actually see a really, really interesting--let's call it an academic  debate, except it hurts people.   You know, I am a Congress-idiot standing up here going: You  understand this and that? But ultimately, these numbers hurt people,  and I am going to show you how much poorer most Americans are today.   So how many times have you heard any Member of Congress get behind  these microphones and say: Maybe we should really think about our  spending priorities, either stripping some of the spending that  happened last year under Democratic control and saying, okay, maybe  that is the program the left will fall on their sword for, maybe spread  it out over more time so it is not working contrary to what the Federal  Reserve is trying to do in knocking down inflation.   It is an interesting thought, but it is worth thinking about, that  the financial markets, the old days of inflation is always a monetary  issue. Okay. I will make you the argument that the Federal Reserve, in  the previous years when they were buying so much U.S. sovereign debt,  they were like the uncle who keeps buying the alcoholic son bottles of  scotch. They were enablers. They made it so we didn't have a penalty.  Except now it is time for us to start going to our AA meetings, and we  don't have a driver's license anymore; we are not getting there; it is  not happening. And we are having a little trouble getting to the first  step. What is the first step? You admit you have a problem.   This one is important. Let me know--I am sure the AA references work,  but that was top of mind.                                time  1815    How much has President Biden added to the deficit in these last  couple of years? I want to be a little careful on this. There is this  running argument here. The left will say: Your incentives to grow the  economy, your tax reforms, this and that, that is all it was that added  all of it. We will, in turn, say: Democrats, it is all of your  spending.   I am partially pointing this out in reference to: Why haven't we been  able to knock down inflation more?   It is this spending. When you start to realize that it is well over  $5 trillion of additional spending that the Democrats created over the  last couple of years--you may love it. It may be a thing in your  priorities. Fine, but then understand how much poorer you are through  inflation because this works contrary to trying to slow down inflation.   It is the concept of fiscal policy crashes into monetary policy, and  then you start to wonder why the high school math we were all taught  and how this is supposed to work isn't working.   Let's walk through what we have done to working men and women in this  country. I represent the Scottsdale-Phoenix area. For most of the last  2 years, my neighborhoods have had the highest inflation in America.  When America is over here saying, ``We had 8 percent inflation, and it  is devastating,'' I am having 13.1 percent. You are that hardworking  person in my community, and you have had your teeth kicked in.   This is important. I am heartbroken we don't talk about this more.  Inflation has dramatically reduced workers' purchasing power. Let's go  all the way to 10 years. You had a 2 percent, 2 percent, 1.8, then 2.3,  and then you hit the last 2 years.   Let's say that, in 2013, you are making $60,000 a year, and you  haven't had a pay increase. You understand the baseline. You are making  $60,000 in 2013 and have kept the same salary. That is 10 years. Dear  Lord, I hope you have been paid more, but let's say you are not. That  $60,000 today would only buy $46,000 worth of goods. You have gone from  $60,000 of purchasing power in the 10 years to $46,000.   In 2021, functionally, that single year, if you are being paid  $60,000, by the end of the year, you have lost about $8,000 of  purchasing power. That is the mean. In my State and my community, it  was substantially more than this.   Do you understand where that money went? I promise you this is going  to be a little more geeky, if that is actually a word. Where does the  money go? When we devalue your salary, when we devalue your currency,  where does that money go? We take it from borrowers and those who--what  is the easiest way to say this--we took your salary, your savings, and  we devalued it and put it over here to those of us who borrow. Who is  the biggest borrower? The United States Government. So, we are going to  now pay back the debt with inflated dollars.   It is not a magical, free option. You didn't suddenly say, ``Hey, we  got $30 trillion in debt, and we are going to pay it with dollars now  that are only worth 90 cents. Isn't this neat? We took 10 cents off of  our debt.'' No, we didn't. What we did is we stripped it from you.   We taxed you, and you didn't even know it. Do you understand because  we stripped the value of your salary, the value of your savings, it was  functionally transferred to the United States Treasury and devaluing  the debt when we pay it back?   How many Americans understand that the last 2 years, I think,  statistically, may be the largest tax hikes in modern history? We made  you poor. There is even some crazy math out there, if you take a look,  that will show you debt to GDP, at least for like a month, flattens a  bit because the economy continues to grow nominally over inflation or  at inflation, and that debt, we are going to pay it back with the  inflated dollars. Hey, doesn't this look great? Except the very next  day, you need to float the next refinance of your bonds on the new  debt. It is at the higher interest rates, and boom. The little pretend  value you got is stripped away from you. You may be paying back the  U.S. sovereign debt with inflated dollars, but now you are paying a  hell of a lot more interest.   That is why I started with the comment, did you watch the debt  markets this last week? They are all over the place. We refer to that  as fragility. We are carrying so much debt, and it is about to get  dramatically worse.   How many times have I been behind this microphone walking through  showing you and showing you and showing you that, in 10 years, the  wheels come off?   The danger that I was terrified of over the last couple of days of  what happens if the debt interest rate cycle--that 2-year yesterday  being over 5 percent--what if that lasted for a year, 2 years, 3 years?  All the CBO projections we are working on are wrong.   I hope today's retrenchment in the numbers is a good thing, but it  also may be a thing because we are hurting people. This is the next  part of this moral argument. We have made you poorer.   Do you understand what the Federal Reserve may have to do to you?  They may have to take a substantial portion of this society and put you  out of work. They may have to put you out of work.   Part of it is because Congress kept spending, making it even harder  for the  [[Page H1243]]  Federal Reserve to bend the inflation curve. Yes, I understand there  are supply issues and demand issues. They pumped in too much liquidity.  The Democrats did all this spending. It got ahead of us. Policies here  are really hurting people.   Let's take a little bit more of a look at how this math works. I am  going to do it again. Your 2021 salary--so in a single year--you are  making $60,000, and its purchasing power is $52,000. If you live in my  district, it is probably about $47,000. How much did your salary go up?  If you live in my community in Arizona, if you didn't get about a 13  percent pay hike in the previous year, you are poorer today.   If you look at it from 2013 to today, once again, your purchasing  power when you used to have $60,000--let's say you were a saver, you  had $60,000 saved. You do realize today, and this is, functionally, the  very beginning of the year, you basically only have $46,000 in the  bank. You may think you have $60,000, but the purchasing power has been  lost so much.   Let's walk through one of the things I believe is another fraud that  is being committed on the American people. That is when our brothers  and sisters on the left did all of their legislation last year to  functionally subsidize--as I almost prefer to say, they soft- nationalized so much of the economy.   They did all sorts of projections on what certain things were going  to cost. I am going to use a couple of things these. There was  functionally a tax credit for battery production. The CBO, the  Congressional Budget Office, put out this score and said it is only  going to be about $30 billion--only.   We have outside economists looking at it, reading the statute, saying  that it doesn't actually say $30 billion. What it says is anyone doing  this, you get these tax credits. Then, they looked at how many people  were doing that. We are seeing articles coming in now that it may be as  high as $195 billion.   This is one of the great scams around here. They put together a piece  of legislation saying that you are going to get the tax credit but then  don't put a cap on it, so it just keeps going because, let's be honest,  who writes checks to the Democrats?   As we are dealing with budget issues, will our brothers and sisters  on the left at least work with us? You promised America that this  particular battery tax credit would not exceed $30.6 billion, so will  you lock in a cap?   Remember the fragility concept when lots of other--the statute didn't  cap the money, so it looks like it is going to cost dramatically more.  Will you work with us, and will you cap it? Do you think that is going  to happen around here?   Let's take a look at some more of this, the cost estimates on wind  production. You may love wind. Once again, the Congressional Budget  Office and the piece of legislation that Democrats did last year show  an expansion of tax credits on wind. They promised us that it would  come in at $11.2 billion. The outside economists are looking at the  legislation once again and saying there is a math problem, that they  didn't actually cap it, and it may come in as high as $68.4 billion.   Is that a fraud on the American people? Of course, it is, but that is  the way the scam here works. Produce a piece of legislation and tell  everyone it is only going to cost this much.   The point I am going at is that the Inflation Reduction Act, which is  an Orwellian name for a piece of legislation that spent money and  actually helped set off inflation, you start to understand why so many  of the big spenders, the people that get these, were just giddy. They  actually read the language.   My challenge to our friends on the left--okay, this was your promise,  $11.2 billion. Will you cap it at that? The modeling now is coming in,  and it may be as high as $68 billion. This is why we end up in so much  trouble here.   I am not going to try to read all of these to you. If any of you have  insomnia, please, go grab the President's budget.   Do you remember that Nancy Pelosi used to stand behind that  microphone over there and say budgets are your ethics, your priorities?  We are going to look at a lot of the left's priorities here.   This is just one of a couple of boards of tax hikes, tax hike after  tax hike after tax hike. I cannot wait until we try to figure out some  way to model these tax hike boards and try to understand the level that  this actually slows down the economy.   You are going to see some boards here where I am going to make the  argument that the duplicity we are seeing in the President's budget  just blows off the page with the amount of GDP, the size of our  economy, that is going to go to taxes, and then to pretend it is still  going to grow.   No, that would be cruel and unusual punishment to read through these.  Understand, this is just one board, two boards. These are all the  proposed tax hikes that are in the President's budget.                                time  1830    And then they are going to tell you this nice thing saying: We are  raising taxes enough to reduce the deficit over the next decade by $3  trillion.   They forget to mention we are borrowing 20.   So I put a little board together saying: If every single one of their  tax hikes come in, and every single one of them produces the revenue  that they scored it at--and these actually haven't been calculated.  They are just baseline scores. There is no actual analytics behind it-- and if it doesn't actually slow down the economy and doesn't actually  now create incentives for people to put their resources in other places  other than these areas that have all had the tax hikes, then it might  produce $3 trillion over the 10 years.   Okay, great.   We are heading toward a projected accumulated deficit from the 2024  budget to the 2033, so functionally 9 budget years of $20 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, if you have someone on the left running around here  saying: ``We are doing something for deficit reduction,'' something  where you basically go from: Hey, we were going to hit 118 percent of  debt to GDP in 2033, then they might bring it in if they got all their  taxes and all the revenues came in and they don't slow down the  economy, then they might get 110 percent.   So let's walk through what is being proposed here.   Remember, we are just starting. We are digging through this as fast  as we can, and we are trying to, once again, understand their  priorities.   So just some of the basic taxes, over the next 10 years, in the  budget process, an average level of taxation has been about 19.7  percent which is actually higher, I think, than the historic average.  But you basically look at higher than any 10 years--let me rephrase  that: The 19.7 percent of GDP going into taxes, that is functionally  the baseline math of the President's budget.   Mr. Speaker, you do realize that functionally it is higher than any  time in modern history. I have been here before over and over and shown  the charts that are saying: Here are really high marginal tax rates.   We get about 18 percent of GDP in taxes.   Here are really low marginal tax rates.   We get about 18 percent of GDP.   I am just wondering what magic wand the left is waving that is all of  a sudden we are now going to start getting close to 20 percent of the  economy in taxes.   Maybe they come up with some magical way to do it.   The problem here: This is the President's own budget. So you just saw  19.7 percent of the economy coming in in taxes. The new spending is at  24.8 percent of the economy. And then we are going to have people  running around here, particularly on the left, saying: Look what we did  for deficit reduction.   Huh?   Trust me, there are no saints here. The hardest thing I say over and  over and over--and I probably get more hate from this, but it is  absolutely mathematically true--from today through the next 30 years,  100 percent of future U.S. sovereign debt--100 percent of future  sovereign debt--is demographics. Baby boomers. We got old.   If you are someone who is screaming at the television or whenever you  watch things like this, Mr. Speaker--which if you are watching things  like this then I worry about you--``it is foreign aid,'' we have shown  over and over  [[Page H1244]]  and over and over the calculations that foreign aid last year would  only be like 12 days of borrowing. At the end of the decade, it is only  like 6, 7 days of borrowing.   Congressional salaries. It was 28 minutes of borrowing for a whole  year, and in 10 years from now it is like 19 minutes of borrowing.   The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, you have got to stop  pretending. The scale of the debt, once again--and I did this last week  and the week before, the Congressional Budget Office's model said that  in 9 budget years, you are can to wipe out the entire defense of the  United States, which is our constitutional obligation.   You can wipe out all of Congress. You can wipe out the White House,  and you can wipe out the Supreme Court. You can wipe out every dime of  spending. There is no FBI, there is no Park Service, there is nothing,  no discretionary dollars at all, and you still have to borrow a couple  hundred billion dollars just to maintain the baseline services of  Social Security and Medicare.   And the very next year--the punch line here is that the very next  year it gets much uglier because that is also the year the trust funds  are empty. The Medicare part A trust fund is gone. That is also one of  the other frauds we are seeing in the President's budget: We are going  to shore up Medicare.   You do understand the Medicare trust fund is only the part A. Three- quarters of the other spending of Medicare is already coming out of the  general fund.   So, once again, that previous sentence--you have to let that one sink  in--you can get rid of all discretionary spending. No more of this crap  of: Let's just get rid of foreign aid or waste and fraud. It is all  gone. You just get rid of all of it, and in 9 years--9 budget years-- you have to borrow a couple of hundred billion dollars. And that is  being optimistic that there is no recession, that all the revenues come  in in projection, there is no war, there is no other pandemic, and  everything is fine.   Mr. Speaker, do you understand how fragile--and then the Democrat  spending is approaching 25 percent of the economy.   Deficits. Now, this is with all the tax hikes and assuming that every  dime comes in and that this place is willing to vote for every one of  Biden's tax hikes, you are still borrowing an average of $1.5 trillion  a year, and at that 9th budget year I think it is like still like $2.3  trillion that year because it keeps going up.   Interest payments. This is right out of the President's budget. We  are going to basically average over the next 10 years the interest  payments on the debt will reach $1.3 trillion a year--just the  interest--so you have the interest on the borrowing.   So if we are estimating 2033, so 9 budget years from now, if under  the President's budget--forgive me, I am doing this from memory--it is  like $2.3 trillion borrowed, 1.3 of that is just interest, the other  trillion functionally is the growth in Medicare.   Remember, Mr. Speaker, the very next year the Social Security trust  fund is gone, our brothers and sisters are taking about a 23 to 24  percent cut in their check, and you have just doubled senior poverty.   That is one of things that also outrages me is: Where is the  conversation of we are going to save Social Security? We are going to  work on it together?   Instead of using it for the next campaign piece that the left is  putting together.   You are going to see also, Mr. Speaker, the left running around here  saying: We are going to raise taxes on wealthy people to save Medicare.   No, they are not.   What they are going to do is actually start to add another 5 points  on capital gains, the 3.8 percent special premium that they basically  stole and put into the general fund that was originally supposed to go  to Medicare.   Okay, let's say they now finally stop stealing it and put it all  toward the Medicare trust fund part A and now it goes up to 5 points-- that is only one-quarter of Medicare spending.   The model basically says that according to the President's budget, we  are going to go from about $661 billion of interest borrowing to a  baseline of $1.3 trillion in 9 budget years.   And now we start getting into the way we try to actually model much  of this debt. There are ways. There is hope. The markets around the  world that like to buy U.S. debt: your pension plan, your own personal  savings, your union pension plan, and the State pension plan.   When I was Maricopa County treasurer, we bought it because it was  safe and very liquid. We would buy UST bills, U.S. Treasuries.   One of the key things you always look at is what is the debt of a  country to the size of its economy?   So if my Democratic colleagues are running around here saying: If we  get all of these taxes, then we are going to lower the deficits.   It is just not true. But just even believing the top line that is  written in the President's budget before we have actually had a moment  to really dive in and see what the economic analytics are and do they  model for how much they are going to slow the economy down and what  that does to revenues, are they still just pretending they are still  getting the baseline growth, then we functionally go from 98.4 percent  of the publicly held debt to the size of the economy to 9 budget years  we go to 110 percent.   We are basically right on top of the World War II peak. So we are  basically going to line up with the highest debt to the size of the  economy in our country's history.   So here is the argument I want make. Other things you should do to  maybe bring in more receipts and more revenues, okay, fine, walk us  through this. I can find you some things in the Tax Code where I  believe some people are cheating or are using it in ways that is not  how we meant to draft it, fine, we will work with you.   But walk me through all the things you are going to do to grow the  economy and not try to control it and manage it because so much of the  legislation, particularly last year, was almost a soft nationalization  of much of the economy.   You can't get this grant--and actually I should probably explain  this--this grant unless you actually go kiss up to the White House and  you actually do their bidding, their sort of woke agenda. Fine.   Another bit of the con you need to understand, Mr. Speaker, is this  administration has advocated for what they call a global minimum tax.  Go around the industrialized world and say: Hey, we want this 15  percent global minimum tax.   If you are a country and if you give a refundable tax receipt because  you did certain activities or tax credit, those things, that goes into  the 15 percent calculation another country can tax you and tax your  operations because this country did this.   So, Mr. Speaker, do you actually understand why a bunch of the  Democrats' spending last year they made it grants?   They basically played our European allies for fools: Hey, sign up for  this global 15 percent minimum, wink wink, nod nod. But grants don't  count as subsidization for businesses, and the beauty of the grants  actually make the bureaucracy and whoever holds the White House  dramatically more powerful.   It is a soft nationalization and a way to escape their own tax  extortion.   So if I came to you tomorrow, Mr. Speaker, and said that one of our  most moral obligations is we have got to find a way to stabilize this  national debt to the size of our economy, okay, then you have to do  functionally two things. I have to bend the spending here, and I have  to grow. We have to grow.    Last week, when I was behind this microphone, I had my 8-month-old  little boy with me. The Parliamentarian wouldn't let me hold him. It  broke my heart, but the rules are the rules.   What is our moral obligation to him?   When he turns--actually it is 24 now. It is a whole year later. When  he turns 24, if we were going to maintain baseline services, then we  have to double U.S. taxes. It is demographics. We got old, and lots and  lots of our population, what is it, 67 million of our brothers and  sisters--I am one of them--will have moved into their earned benefit  years.   Okay. So you need a revolution in the cost of healthcare. I have  already been behind this microphone repeatedly talking about the fact  that we are on the cusp of not only curing but also  [[Page H1245]]  stabilizing diabetes--diabetes being 33 percent of all healthcare  spending--but lots of other great things are happening.   Go look at last week's speech if you are curious, Mr. Speaker. I  spent the last half of it walking through things that are actually  hopeful and optimistic.   I don't particularly like this pillars of growth board because it is  missing a number of things. But we are going to have to deal with the  reality of our population.   In 19 years, the United States has more deaths than births.   Do you remember your high school economics class?   How do you grow an economy when your population is flatlining or is  sinking?   You can do it through high-scale immigration. You could also do it  through automation.   Should we incentivize robots just like they are doing in China and  other places we compete with?                                time  1845    You have got to have a tax code that is all about growth. How do you  say expensing?   Remember, when we had the 100 percent expensing that we did in the  2017 tax reform, the economists said that may have been the number one  thing that helped us grow the economy, and you don't lose revenues from  it. You actually gain revenues. It is a timing effect.   If I say, hey, you get to do expensing but you have got to do it over  7 years, or you can do it all today, it is still the same deduction. It  is about the time. Because you let them do it today, it puts you in a  cycle where, hey, I am going to buy the next piece of efficiency on the  equipment sooner.   The model said, if you look at a longer horizon, you actually get  more revenues by making it so you can have 100 percent expensing today  because it forces you into a cycle where you are constantly trying to  get to the next level of productivity with your capital investments.   Ideas like that in the tax code are elegant because it raises wages.  It grows the economy. Remember, we are trying to actually stabilize our  debt to GDP.   The last one--and I probably should come back in the next couple  weeks and demonstrate--I believe we could have a revolution in  regulation. I am going to try to visualize this one, so everyone work  with me. If you get bored, I think I have a YouTube video from years  ago I put together, a little cartoon that basically says--I think it is  under Schweikert environmental crowdsourcing.   It is a simple concept. Say you want to open a motorcycle paint shop  or a bakery or whatever it is, and you need your air quality permit.  Let's do it this way.   Air quality permit: You fill out lots of paperwork, you hire a  consultant, you design your scrubbers, and then you walk into your  county air quality office and you file paperwork.   Does a file cabinet full of paperwork make the air quality in your  community better? Huh?   No. It is basically documentation so the trial lawyer can sue you.   How about if you and your community had a little sensor, had a few  thousand people driving around your community--I am from a huge  county--with a sensor, and if there are idiots over here painting  motorcycles in the back of their yard and not doing it in a booth,  okay, fine, you catch them immediately.   You crowdsource the data. You don't need an army of bureaucrats  watching the file cabinets and then hiring armies of consultants.   You can crowdsource. You basically put the sensors on, give it to the  Uber drivers, give it to the UPS drivers, and say, hey, we really care  more about where we have a problem--and if there is a problem, we will  go and fix it--than punishing everyone in our marketplace.   The people who are following the rules, the elegance of this, they  get left alone. You don't have to deal with government. You get left  alone. If you screw up, you get caught. That is the use of technology.  That is just one very simple idea, but there are dozens and dozens like  that so you could drop the size of the bureaucracy.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the tolerance. May I request how much time  I have remaining?    Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   For everyone who has been willing to give me part of their time, I am  just trying to make a couple simple points. We have a fiscal  responsibility and blame for inflation.   We could do policies on pieces of legislation that say we are going  to actually help. How about a piece of legislation--actually, guess  what, I already have this one--that basically says: How do I pull  liquidity out of the marketplace without hurting people?   How about actually give every American a SPIF for taking some cash  out of their checking account?   Instead of running out and buying a new color television--even though  the televisions are beautiful--put it in their retirement account. You  actually slow down consumption over here, you shore up their retirement  security, and it is almost the exact same thing the Federal Reserve is  doing.   There are things we can do policy wise that would help knock down  inflation. We have a handful of bills like that.   The other thing is the reality of we have been lied to on the scoring  of the Democrats' spending from last year, and we are starting to see  it now.   The third thing I want to point out are the dozens and dozens and  dozens and dozens and dozens of tax hikes, and then the White House is  pretending it is not going to change the economic velocity, they are  going to get all these revenues, and they are still going to spend like  crazy.   Within their morality of are they going to step up and help us save  Social Security, the morality of it, are they going to actually help us  grow the economy?   It is unacceptable that their big accomplishment will still be over  110 percent debt to GDP in 9 years. It is unacceptable.    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.                  Honoring the Life of Commander John Davis     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
