 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.   My colleagues again are here to talk about something that has been  over and over again changed with the whim of every administration it  seems. I have been here 10 years, and every new Congress there is a  different enforcement. The law keeps getting changed. There is no  certainty.   So how are we supposed to farm and grow the crops that people depend  on in this country?   I am glad I got to follow Mr. Duarte because his operation is  actually in my district up there where that went on. We tried to  convince them at EPA and Army Corps of Engineers that farming is a  normal activity.   I get my colleagues on the other side of the aisle when they start  talking about rivers on fire and things like that.   This is normal farming. The way we are going here, we will not have  these crops that Americans depend on, especially coming from  California.   So the definition that is being put forward by the Biden  administration is something that is undoing what the Trump  administration had trying to bring it back to reasonable.   The Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 and signed by President Nixon  with bipartisan effort. Every 50 years or so we have to go back and see  what is going on with oversight, and this isn't working. It is not  working at all because it was never intended by Congress to limit  farming and to take away the farming of food, which is what is going on  with this act.    Mr. Speaker, the Federal excise tax is a 12 percent  surcharge on the price of new heavy duty trucks, truck chassis,  trailers, and semitrailers used for highway haulage. It was first  instituted more than a century ago to pay for World War I for the  wartime mobilization.   The FET is the highest percentage excise tax on anything in this  country. The tax has really outlived its original purpose, unless you  like spending. It disincentivizes truckers and trucking companies from  purchasing new up-to-date rigs because the tax can add as many as  $20,000 to even $30,000 on a high-end rig by itself, just for the tax.   Ever-increasing Federal and State emissions regulations often make it  necessary for truckers to buy new trucks, especially in my home State  of California. This burdensome tax hinders the ability of our truck  drivers to acquire the most modern, safest, highest tech equipment.   Repealing this tax would make it easier to ship goods across the  country at lower prices for consumers, saving businesses and consumers  money. It will also allow our trucking fleet to modernize at a lower  cost to the poor folks who are just trying to do their job.   At a time when our economy is reeling from inflation and high prices,  Congress must do all it can to lower costs for small businesses and  consumers.                            ____________________
