 Mr. President, later today, the Senate will take a vote on  whether or not to move to consideration of the national security  supplemental bill. And make no mistake, this vote will fail. Not  because Republicans oppose supporting our national security interests  overseas but because Democrats are refusing to take seriously the  national security crisis here at home.   From the beginning, Republicans have made it clear that any national  security supplemental would have to address one of the biggest threats  to our national security, the out-of-control illegal immigration at our  southern border.   And when I say ``out of control,'' just look at the numbers.  Yesterday, 12,000 people were apprehended at our southern border trying  to come into our country illegally--not including the ``got-aways,''  not including the unknowns--over 12,000 people, which, I think, is an  alltime, one-day high. Most ever. In history.   And think about that annualized. We are now talking about on the  order of 4 million people annually coming across our southern border,  being released into the country, coming across illegally.   When is this a crisis? This is a crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis.  It has been that for a long time. But now--now it is a national  security crisis because among those 12,000 people are some pretty  unsavory characters.   There are people who are coming here for a better life, but there are  a lot of people who are being apprehended now at our southern border.  Some of whom are on the Terrorist Watchlist.   This is a crisis that needs to be dealt with, and it seems to be  falling on deaf ears at the White House and among my colleagues here,  Democratic colleagues in the U.S. Senate.   We have put forward meaningful ideas and solutions about how to deal  with this, and yet crickets. Nobody seems to want to confront what is a  major, major debacle at our southern border.   That is 12,000, one day--a new American record of people trying to  come into this country illegally. Why? Because this administration  doesn't seem to care or want to do anything about stopping or reducing  that flow across our southern border.   It is a staggering number. And just to put it in perspective, Jeh  Johnson, who was the Department of Homeland Security Secretary to  President Obama, once said that a thousand a day would overwhelm the  system--a thousand a day. He went on to say: I can't even comprehend  what 4,000 a day would look like.   Yesterday was 12,000. Now, if you sustain that rate, annualize that  rate, as I said, you are talking about 4 million people annually being  released into this country.   And you have heard from countless now, not just Members on my side of  the aisle or overcrowded communities on the southern border or members  of the Customs and Border Patrol who are underwhelmed and  underresourced and undermanned down there to deal with this crisis.   But you are hearing from cities in the interior of this country-- large cities--who are complaining about not being able to deliver basic  services to their constituents now because they are having to deal with  a migrant inflow into their communities--New York City being one  notable example. The mayor of New York City says he would have to  freeze hiring police officers, he would have to close libraries, and  cut education funding to keep up with this massive, massive inflow of  people who are coming into this country who need to be cared for.   So let me just say, this is not an extraneous issue, which is what  the Democrat leader suggested last week. Border security is a national  security issue, and anyone who thinks that our Nation can be secure  while we have hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants pouring over  our southern border each month needs to think again.   The month of October, 240,988 individuals were encountered at our  southern border. That was the highest October number ever recorded. But  on top of that, the month of October saw an average of 1,000 ``got- aways'' per day, individuals the Border Patrol saw but was unable to  apprehend. That is 30,000 unidentified individuals entering our country  in just 1 month--30,000.   And there is no telling how many unknown ``got-aways''--these are  known ``got-aways''--how many unknown ``got-aways'' there were during  that same period. And there is no question that some of those ``got- aways'' were dangerous individuals who should not be entering the  country.   During fiscal year 2023, there were 169 individuals on the Terrorist  Watchlist who were apprehended attempting to illegally cross our  southern border. That was fiscal year 2023, which ended September 30,  169 in 1 year.   Well, if the numbers continue to ramp up--and you look at the daily  numbers we are encountering now, you know that number is going to go up  significantly as well. Because why? People have figured out, you want  to get into the United States, come across our southern border.   And thousands of what are known as--what we call special interest  aliens, those individuals who may pose a threat to the United States,  have been apprehended trying to illegally cross our southern border  over the past 2 years.   Then there have been the criminals who are trying to make their way  into the United States, and those range from drug traffickers to child  predators. One border reporter noted last month:         Border Patrol's Del Rio Sector has arrested at least 21       child sex predators crossing illegally since the new fiscal       year began on October 1.    Twenty-one child sex predators in a single sector of our southern  border.   And, again, all of these numbers I am mentioning only refer to  individuals who have actually been apprehended. With 30,000 unknown  individuals entering the United States in October alone, there is no  telling how many terrorists, how many criminals, how many other  dangerous individuals have made their way into our country without our  knowledge.   So I think it is fair to say that the issue of border security is not  ``extraneous'' but is, in fact, fundamental to our national security  and something that the Democrat leader ought to realize.   Indeed the fact that New York City, as I mentioned, is currently  facing across-the-board cuts to its city services, including a  staggering 13.5-percent cut to its police force--to its police force-- as a result of the migrant crisis should be all the information the  majority leader needs to realize that our current situation is not  sustainable, even without the national security risk imposed by  unchecked illegal immigration.   Now, I support aid to Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine, and I believe it  is in our  [[Page S5772]]  national security interest to support these allies. So I want to see us  take up this national security supplemental, but national security  begins at home. And we can't pass a bill to advance American interests  abroad while ignoring the national security crisis at our own border.  We owe the American people better than that.   And the Democrat leader needs to understand the Republicans are  serious. We have said all along that this national security  supplemental must address the national security crisis at our border,  and we will continue to hold that principle.   And while we recognize that in a negotiation, neither side will get  everything it wants, the final border security component in this  supplemental must have real teeth. Cosmetic measures are not  acceptable. We can't afford anything less than real solutions to our  Nation's border crisis.   Ten thousand-plus individuals were encountered at our southern border  on Sunday, another 10,000 on Monday. It went up to 11,000. And as I  said yesterday, now 12,000 in a single day. Things are getting worse,  not better. We have an obligation to do everything we can to get this  crisis under control--this administration, as I said, something they  have had no interest in doing.   So I will vote against moving the supplemental while it lacks serious  border security policy changes, and I hope that today's failed vote  will clearly demonstrate to our Democratic colleagues that there will  be no national security supplemental without the kind of border  security measures that we need to keep our Nation secure.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
