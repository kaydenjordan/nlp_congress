 Mr. President, on my behalf and the behalf of Senator  Cramer, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Hawley, on behalf of himself and  Senator Cramer, sends a question for the counsel and House managers.  And following our procedure, the first one to respond after it is read  will be the counsel for the former President.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         If the Senate's power to disqualify is not derivative of       the power to remove a convicted President from office, could       the Senate disqualify a sitting President but not remove him       or her?    Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Would you read that question again, if you  would please?   The legislative clerk read as follows:         If the Senate's power to disqualify is not derivative of       the power to remove a convicted President from office, could       the Senate disqualify a sitting President but not remove him       or her?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Counsel for the former President has 2\1/ 2\ minutes.   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. No. But I can't let this rest. Mr. Castro  attributed a statement the time before last that he was up here that  Donald Trump had told his people to fight to the death. I am not from  here. I am not like you guys. I was being very polite in giving an  opportunity to correct the record, and I thought that is exactly what  he would do.   But instead, what he did is he came up and illustrated the problem  with the presentation of the House case. It has been smoke and mirrors,  and, worse, it has been dishonest. He came up and tried to cover when  he got caught, as they were caught earlier today with all of the  evidence, checking tweets, switching dates--everything they did.   And bear in mind, I had 2 days to look at their evidence. And when I  say 2 days, I mean they started putting in their evidence. So I started  being able to get looking at it. That is not the way this should be  done.   But what we discovered was, he knew what he was doing. He knew that  the President didn't say that to his people. What he said was, if it  happened to the Democrats, this is what they would do. In his speech  that day, you know what he said? He said, if this happened to the  Democrats, if the election were stolen from the Democrats, all hell  would break loose. But he said to his supporters: We are smarter. We  are stronger. And we are not going to do what they did all summer long.   So what he did was he misrepresented a tweet to you to put forth the  narrative that is wrong. It is wrong. It is dishonest, and the American  people don't deserve this any longer. You must acquit.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Representative from the House of  Representatives has 2\1/2\ minutes   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.   That was profoundly inaccurate and irrelevant to what the question  is. So I am going to get back to the question.   So under article II, section 4, a President who is in office must be  convicted before removal and then must be removed before  disqualification.   OK. But if the President is already out of office, then he can be  separately disqualified, as this President is. But these powers have  always been treated as separate issues, which is why I think there have  been eight people who have been convicted and removed, and just three  of them disqualified.   And, as you know, there is a totally separate process within the  Senate for doing this. The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote for  conviction. But for disqualification, it is a majority vote. It is a  separate thing. So people could vote to convict and then vote not to  disqualify. If they felt that the evidence demonstrated the President  was guilty of incitement to insurrection, they could vote to convict.  If they felt they didn't want to exercise the further power established  by the Constitution to disqualify, they wouldn't even have to do that.  And that could be something that is taken up separately by the Senate  and by a majority vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.
