 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Clay for convening us this  evening to discuss this very important matter.   Why is it so important?   Well, we live in a time of rampant official lawlessness and  disrespect for the Constitution of the United States.   But I am not here to talk about the Emoluments Clause or the power of  Congress to declare war, or about equal protection. I am here to join  my colleagues in talking about an incident of artistic discrimination  committed by this institution, an assault on the First Amendment.   Why is it so important?   I was thinking about a professor I had who wrote a book about broken  windows. The thesis of the book basically was that if windows are  broken in the neighborhood and nothing is done about it, it sends the  message that you can go on to bigger and better things. In other words,  petty crimes and misdemeanors unaddressed go on to become high crimes  and misdemeanors.   When we started the 115th Congress, unfortunately, within the first  week or two, we started with a broken Constitutional window, Mr. Clay,  because we allowed, we tolerated, and we countenanced an act of  vigilante discrimination and censorship by certain Members against  speech by the constituents of other Members.   So I want to tell the story to the people of America, especially the  young people of America, who have open minds and open hearts, and I am  delighted that so many young people are in the chamber tonight to hear  about what happened here because this is a very important moment in the  history of this institution.  [[Page H2884]]                                     time  1630    Now, I am a professor of constitutional law by training. I did that  for 25 years before I came to Congress, and I teach, also, the First  Amendment.   There are six rights contained in the First Amendment, and I hope all  of you learn the six rights. They are: the right to petition for a  redress of grievances; the free exercise of religion; the right of  assembly; the right of free press; the right of no establishment of  religion; and then, last but certainly not least, the right of freedom  of speech.   Here in Congress, since 1982, we have had a Congressional Arts  Competition. It is a magnificent statement of American values. We  invite Members from every district in America--there are 435 districts  here, plus five Delegates who come from territories or the District of  Columbia--so there are a total of 440 that are eligible.   Each one impanels a group of artists. They have a whole process, and  the best artwork is adjudicated and then brought to Washington. You can  find them in the tunnel connecting the Cannon House Office Building to  the Capitol Building, to the Chamber where we are right now. There are  hundreds of beautiful, extraordinary, interesting, vivacious,  controversial paintings done by the young people of America.   So what is the issue? Well, we are living in a time of political  correctness. Let's say it plain. Sometimes the political correctness  comes from the left. It happened recently at Berkeley in California,  where the college canceled a planned appearance by Ann Coulter, a  rightwing commentator whose views are totally anathema to me, but they  canceled her speech.   Now, in fairness to Berkeley, they said there had been violence there  and they thought there might be violence again. But there was such a  storm of outrage about this example of a kind of leftwing political  correctness, they reversed the decision and they said she could come.  They understood it was their responsibility to make sure that her  speech could proceed without being disrupted and broken up, so they did  the right thing.   What are we experiencing here right where you sit in the Congress of  the United States, in the House of Representatives? We are experiencing  an example of a rightwing political correctness run amok. It is  rightwing political censorship because some people didn't like somebody  else's expression. Instead of walking on to the next painting, they  decided to take it down, remove it, and return it to the office of  Congressman Clay. Not once, not twice, not three times, not four times,  but five times they took this painting down.   Congressman Clay and I wrote a letter to Speaker Ryan protesting this  act of vigilante censorship right here in the Congress of the United  States. Speaker Ryan, instead of standing up for the First Amendment,  instead of standing up for the Speech and Debate Clause, instead of  standing up for artistic expression, instead of standing up for freedom  and teaching a lesson to the young people of America, he called the  painting disgusting and then initiated an official process whereby they  censored it. For the first time in the history of this competition  going back to 1982, 35 years, they censored a painting.   Now, luckily they have made this young artist one of the most famous  artists in America now, and we can all wish him nothing but magnificent  fortune as he goes ahead to develop his skills and his artistic voice.  They were not able, I hope, to crush the spirit of this young man, but  they did something really deeply injurious to the Republic of the  United States. They engaged in an act of naked viewpoint discrimination  against a work of art.   Now, what are the constitutional values here that need to be  vindicated for artists like David Pulphus or the winner from my  district last year, Alannah Van Horn, who did a self-portrait?   Let's just be clear about one thing: these paintings hung for 6  months before the vigilante censors in the House of Representatives  decided to come and take them down. For 6 months, they didn't harm  anybody, they didn't hurt anybody, they didn't cause a riot, they  didn't cause a ruckus, nothing--until they decided somehow that this  painting ran afoul of their political correctness litmus test for what  is acceptable in Congress.   So what is really at stake here? Well, first of all, it is the rights  of the Member who sponsored this painting.   I want to say I am so impressed by the courage and the strength and  the determination of Representative Clay to stand with his constituent  and his constituency as well as with the Constitution here.   He brought a First Amendment lawsuit with Mr. Pulphus not for money,  not for damages, but for a preliminary and permanent injunction against  congressional censorship of this painting. So they went to court.   They had a very simple argument. The First Amendment says Congress  shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. That is it. That is  one of the six rights that I referenced when I opened my speech.  Congress can't sensor speech.   Congress just censored speech.   The judge in the case, Judge Bates of the United States District  Court, rendered a fascinating opinion. He found that this was indeed a  clear case of viewpoint discrimination. It was censorship based on the  views or the perspective of the artist. There was little doubt, he  said, the government was engaged in a blatant act of viewpoint  discrimination.   There are lots of cases that make clear that viewpoint discrimination  is unacceptable in the United States, like Rosenberger v. University of  Virginia, which said that UVA could not set up a program for young  journalists and newspapers and magazines at UVA and exclude those from  a religious point of view. The Court said, if you are going to set up a  forum for speech like that, you can't single out one point of view and  then suppress it.   It was the same idea in Texas v. Johnson in 1995, when the Supreme  Court said that the right to burn a flag as a political protest is  constitutionally protected. You don't have to agree with it, but other  people have the right to burn the flag if it is their flag. That is  their property.    The Court pointed out also that, in America, flag burning is the  proper mode of flag disposal. If you look at the flag treatment  protocol, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts burn flags all the time. So, if  you punish someone for burning a flag, you are punishing them for a  thought crime; you are not punishing them for an action which is done  all the time in the United States.   In any event, the Court says viewpoint discrimination is  unacceptable. Nonetheless, Judge Bates said that Congressman Clay  doesn't win. Why? It is because of where it took place. He said that  the hallway in the Cannon House Office Building leading to the Capitol  is not a public forum of any kind. It is not a traditional public forum  like a street or park. It is not a limited public forum, something that  is set up for the expression of speech, which is precisely what you  would think it is. It is not even a nonpublic forum, Judge Bates says.  Judge Bates says that the 440 paintings down there are government  speech.   Now, that doesn't make any sense. We have lots of people who are in  the gallery tonight, and I assume you passed by these paintings on the  way over. If you didn't, check them out.   I challenge anybody in America to go down to the tunnel and look at  the paintings and regard the magnificent diversity of views and  perspectives embodied in this one painting, for example, and say that  it is government speech. In fact, the reason it was censored is because  it wasn't government speech.   Yet, the court got it wrong. Now, I am not going to say really nasty  things about him. I am not President of the United States. I am not  going to say that he is a nonjudge or a so-called judger. I think that  he made a serious mistake. I think the D.C. Circuit will reverse it. I  think the U.S. Supreme Court would reverse it.   You know what? It doesn't make any difference, because everyone who  has the honor of serving in this Chamber takes an oath to the  Constitution of the United States. We have got to uphold the First  Amendment. That is a responsibility that we have got. And we can't just  say, ``Oh, we will let a court deal with it.'' We have got to deal with  the First Amendment.   And it is very clear--the court said it itself--this was viewpoint  discrimination. That is unacceptable. And we  [[Page H2885]]  should say that, yes, the Constitution applies in the Congress of the  United States. We don't hold ourselves exempt from it. We don't say, if  we set up a forum for young artists to bring their paintings in, that  we are speaking. That doesn't make any sense. They are the ones  speaking.   So where do we go from here?   Well, we are appealing to Speaker Ryan and to our friends in the  majority to back off of the regime of rightwing political correctness.  Just like it was wrong for Berkeley to try to sensor Ann Coulter, as  much as many of us abhor everything she says and stands for, it is  equally wrong for the Republican majority here to sensor Mr. Pulphus  for your subjective interpretation of what his painting means.   One of the reasons why the Supreme Court has always said you can't  sensor art is because art is polysemous. What does that mean? It means  it is open to multiple possible significances. Who is to say what this  painting means or what Guernica means?   Guernica, by the way, would certainly be censored under the  principles that are being advanced here because it is sensationalistic  or it deals with contemporary controversy. I mean, what art doesn't  deal with contemporary controversy? I mean, it just doesn't make any  sense what they are saying.   So I think that the majority should really rethink whether it wants  to be in the business of censorship. This is not Russia. This is not  Azerbaijan. This is not Saudi Arabia. This is not Iran. This is the  United States of America.   People have a right to paint the painting that they want. If you  don't like the painting, you go to the next painting. You don't take it  down, especially in the Congress of the United States where we should  be setting an example. Justice Brandeis said government is the  omnipresent teacher to the people of the constitutional values of the  whole society.   Now, we have got one other serious problem I want to mention before I  go because, you see, before they engaged in this act of censorship  against this young artist who was from St. Louis who was obviously  upset about what happened in Ferguson, Missouri, and painted this  painting which I think is actually a very interesting, captivating  painting that reminds me of Picasso's Guernica and clearly evokes  themes from George Orwell's ``Animal Farm,'' before they did that, you  didn't have to agree with any particular painting or sculpture or  artwork in the Capitol complex, right?    We have great champions of freedom and justice in the Republic who  are portrayed all over the Capitol complex, like Abraham Lincoln, for  example, like Rosa Parks, like Martin Luther King, like Lyndon Johnson,  like Sojourner Truth.   You know what? We also have people who are traitors to the country,  people who were Confederate conspirators against the United States,  like John Breckinridge, a guy who served as a U.S. Senator and as Vice  President of the United States and then defected from the Union, took  up arms against the United States of America, and was declared a  traitor and stripped of his titles as a former Vice President and a  former Senator.   There is Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy. There is  a statue of him up. Robert E. Lee, obviously the general for the  Confederacy during the Civil War. There is John C. Calhoun, who  defected from the Union and took up arms against us.   So we have these portraits, statues, and busts of great Americans who  stood for freedom, justice, and equality in America and the  Constitution. And we have people who got themselves into trouble and, I  think, brought disgrace to themselves with what they did. But they were  all up together.   Now that we are entering into a new area of authoritarian thought  control and censorship and political correctness in Congress, how can  we have a statue of John Breckinridge up in the Capitol complex? How  can we have Jefferson Davis up in the Capitol complex?   If this is government speech, now we are going to have to litigate  each one of these artistic displays to see whether or not they are  actually consistent with the values of the United States Congress and  consistent with the values of the U.S. Constitution. Is that where we  want to go?   I invite my colleagues--I beseech my colleagues--don't take us there.  Reverse this act of censorship against this young man. Don't set out to  crush his spirit. Don't step on the First Amendment. Show America that  we believe in the Constitution. Otherwise, we are going to be engaged  in some very interesting discussions about the kinds of artwork that  are found all over the Capitol campus.   I just want to salute, again, Congressman Clay for bringing us  together and all of my colleagues who have come forward to stand up for  the First Amendment tonight.                                time  1645
