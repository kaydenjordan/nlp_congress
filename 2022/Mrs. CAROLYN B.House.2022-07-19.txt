 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, between Florida's  ``don't say gay or trans'' legislation and Alabama's ban on gender- affirming care for transgender youth, LGBTQ+ rights in this country are  under attack.   Unfortunately, these attacks are not just limited to the States. Just  25 days ago, a rightwing majority overturned Roe v. Wade and indicated  that contraception and marriage equality are likely next.   That is why I was so pleased that the House passed the Respect for  Marriage Act today, which would repeal the discriminatory Defense of  Marriage Act and ensure that marriage equality is protected across our  country.   I have always been a strong supporter of LGBTQ+ rights. In 1986, I  introduced the first domestic partnership legislation in New York State  history while I was on the city council. We need to do everything we  can to protect these fundamental rights.                            ____________________
