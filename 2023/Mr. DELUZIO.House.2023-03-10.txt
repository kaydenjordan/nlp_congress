 Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss how defense industry  consolidation is hurting the American people and our national security.   A 2022 Defense Department report shows the intense constriction of  the defense industrial base. In 1990, there were 51 prime defense  contractors but since then, small and mid-sized contractors have been  gobbled up. Now there are just five--a 90 percent reduction.   At the same time, suppliers have disappeared. Tactical missile  suppliers dwindled down from 13 to 3. Satellite suppliers fell from  eight to four.   This deprives the American people of competition for key elements of  our defense, and military leaders have complained that current  contractors often deliver behind schedule, poor quality products, at  too high a cost.   This lack of competition is leaving us ill-prepared and risks our  national security and readiness.   The way I see it, a weak or, frankly, nonexistent antitrust  enforcement allowed this to happen.   We have got to step in to promote competition, to give smaller  contractors a chance to grow, and to stave off further consolidation.                            ____________________
