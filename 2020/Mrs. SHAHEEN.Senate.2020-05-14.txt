 Madam President, I am here to add my voice to the  eloquence of both Senator Cramer and Senator Schumer about the need to  recognize those people who were lost on the Frank E. Evans.   We had two sailors from New Hampshire who were lost that day: Ronald  Arthur Thibodeau of Manchester, NH, joined the Navy in 1967, and he was  assigned to the Frank E. Evans as radarman. Ron was on watch during the  collision, and he was lost at sea, leaving behind a young son.   And Gary Joseph Vigue, of Farmington, NH, was also on watch that  night during the fatal collision. Gary had married his high school  sweetheart a few weeks before he reported to the Frank E. Evans in  1968. Gary also left behind a young son and his two brothers who still  live in New Hampshire.   These two men, Gary and Ron, gave their lives for this country. These  men were supporting operations during the Vietnam war, and they were  planning to return to Vietnam waters once the training exercise was  over. So, just like all those other people who were lost in Vietnam,  they gave their lives for this country. And just because they were  outside some artificially designated combat zone doesn't mean they  shouldn't be recognized in the same way the others who were lost in  Vietnam have been recognized.   Now, this is May, the month of May. Memorial Day is approaching, a  day during which our Nation honors the men and women who have died  while serving in the U.S. military. As we recognize the sacrifices of  our fellow Americans, I think it is appropriate that the Senate take up  and pass the U.S.S. Frank E. Evans Act, legislation I am honored to  cosponsor with my colleague Senator Cramer from North Dakota because it  is legislation that will ensure the 74 men--those Lost 74--are  rightfully honored by adding their names to the Vietnam War Memorial.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure. I thank the Presiding  Officer and Senator Cramer for this effort to ensure that the Lost 74  are recognized.
