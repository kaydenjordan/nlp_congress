 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Lieutenant John White on his service to both our Nation and the city of  Savannah.   Lieutenant White served as a United States Marine in the Pacific  theater during World War II. There, he became part of the 51st Defense  Battalion, the first African American combat unit. When he returned  from war, he was recruited by Chief James Roger to join the Savannah  Police Department. On May 3, 1947, Lieutenant White became the first  African American officer in the State of Georgia, where he continued to  serve for 38 years. He is now the last surviving member of the original  nine Black police officers who joined the Savannah Police Department.   I want to thank Lieutenant John White for his monumental service,  which paved the way for other African Americans to go to work each day  and serve their communities in the State of Georgia.               Honoring the Life of Dr. Henry Herbert Cobb, III     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Dr. Henry Herbert ``Nubbin'' Cobb, a pharmacist in Athens, Georgia,  who passed away on November 20, 2018, at the age of 72.   Dr. Cobb wore many hats throughout his life as a pharmacist, serving  our Nation and the State of Georgia alike. First, Dr. Cobb joined the  United States Air Force for 5 years as chief pharmacist, serving abroad  in places like the Philippines. Upon his return, he completed a  master's degree and a Ph.D. degree from the University of Georgia  College of Pharmacy. From there, he taught college students, worked  with St. Mary's Hospital for 44 years, and practiced as a nursing home  pharmacist. His expertise and dedication will be missed in the pharmacy  profession and at the University of Georgia.   As a former student of Dr. Cobb's, I can attest to his dedication to  our great profession. His family and friends will be in my thoughts and  prayers.                  Honoring Bill Brown on his 100th Birthday     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Bill Brown as he celebrated his 100th birthday on December 3.   Born and raised in Brunswick, Georgia, Mr. Brown is a stalwart of the  community. After 100 years, though, he is not only a stalwart, but he  has also made a significant impact on the community's development and  countless individuals' lives.    During World War II, Mr. Brown joined the shipyards on the Brunswick  River to build Liberty ships for the war effort. When the war was over,  he embarked on a 60-year career selling real estate in the area. During  this time, he had a firsthand perspective of Brunswick's growth.   Although these are only a few of the many ways he served his  community throughout his life, one of his most important may be that he  rarely misses being in his pew at the First United Methodist Church. I  am glad to see the hundreds of people who came to Mr. Brown's birthday,  each with well wishes and lots of thanks for Mr. Brown and how he  helped them along the way.   Mr. Brown, happy birthday.       Honoring Brunswick Pilot John Beimler, Apprentice Pilot Gordon                   Strother, Jr., and Captain Danny Jones     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Captain  Danny Jones, pilot John Beimler, and apprentice Gordon Strother, Jr.,  for rescuing a man in danger at sea near the Saint Simons Island pier  on November 19.   The crew and their boat, the Glynn, were approaching the pier when  they noticed a crowd pointing to a person floating in the water. The  crew spotted the unresponsive man and acted swiftly, pulling him onto  the boat, applying first aid, and covering him in warm blankets.   This is truly a heroic event, and I couldn't be more proud of the  actions of these individuals in the First Congressional District of  Georgia.   In addition, thank you to the Glynn County Fire Department, Glynn  County Police Department, and EMTs, who also assisted in saving the  individual's life.                            ____________________
