 Mr. President, it is with a great deal of hometown pride  that I rise in strong support of the confirmation of Darcie McElwee to  be the new U.S. attorney for the State of Maine. Both Darcie and I are  natives of the northern Maine community of Caribou.   Since 2002, Darcie has been an assistant U.S. attorney, and she has  served as the Project Safe Neighborhoods coordinator for that office  since 2005. She primarily has prosecuted violent crime cases, including  those involving sex trafficking, interstate domestic violence, and  child sexual exploitation, as well as firearms and arson cases. Darcie  served as assistant district attorney for Penobscot County and  Piscataquis County from 1998 to 2002.   Darcie is a member of the Maine Trial Lawyers Association and a past  president of the Cumberland Bar Association. She has also served as an  adjunct professor at the University of Maine School of Law and at the  Maine Trial Lawyers College of Advocacy. Darcie received her J.D.  degree from the University of Maine School of Law in 1998, and her  undergraduate degree from Bowdoin College.   Throughout her career, Darcie has worked tirelessly to keep Mainers  safe from violent crime and to achieve justice for victims. She is an  intelligent, experienced, and highly competent law enforcement  professional. Her extensive track record as a career prosecutor makes  her ideally suited for this important position.   Based on her experience and her character, as well as her Caribou  roots, I have every confidence that Darcie will faithfully uphold our  Nation's laws and work to ensure public safety and order. Throughout  her distinguished career, she has demonstrated a strong commitment to  public service, and I know that she will serve the State of Maine and  our Nation extremely well as Maine's next U.S. attorney.   I am absolutely delighted that the Senate, without dissent, tonight  confirmed Darcie McElwee for this important position.
