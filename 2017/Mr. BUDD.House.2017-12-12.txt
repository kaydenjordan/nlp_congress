 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me this  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the gentlewoman from New  York's legislation, H.R. 3971, and I thank her for her leadership on  this very important issue.   As many of my friends here today know, Dodd-Frank and the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau have made life very difficult for many.  Luckily, the Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act will, once  again, solve a problem that they created, this time regarding escrow  and mortgage servicing requirements.   The CFPB rule regarding these accounts has done nothing more than  accelerate industry consolidation in this space, particularly causing  harm to rural consumers, leaving them with even less financing options.   This bill reverses that problem, though, and will help bring local  banks and financial institutions back into the picture. This bill  simply lets them reenter the mortgage market and directs the CFPB to  exempt them from the escrow account requirement of Dodd-Frank.   Now, though this is a bipartisan bill, some of my friends on the  other side of the aisle may claim that this bill removes consumer  safeguards, but I would argue that this CFPB rule that they support  creates an unnecessary burden on local banks and credit unions, which,  in the end, hurts local communities and people that they claim to  protect with this very rule.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad this bill remains largely bipartisan and, as I  said, returns power back to the community financial institutions and  ensures that consumers have credit through various credit choices.   I want to thank Representative Tenney for her steadfast leadership on  this issue, and I urge adoption of her legislation.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire again as  to how much time I have left.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 8\1/2\  minutes remaining.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to move now to say a word about what my colleague  is attempting to do. I appreciate my colleague from California (Mr.  Sherman), who is going to offer an amendment that would lower the  extremely high exemption thresholds in the underlying bill.   I think that, having talked to him, I do understand that he believes  that this is important to expand opportunity rather than to limit the  ability for protection for certain of our consumers who come from these  areas that I have described as rural and areas that are underserved.   This amendment that he is going to present would allow creditors,  again, with less than $10 billion in assets, to be exempted from escrow  requirements on higher priced mortgage loans if they hold loans in  portfolios for 3 years and allow servicers that service 20,000 loans or  less to be exempted from enhanced consumer protection requirements  under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.   His amendment changes it a little bit from $25 billion to $10  billion, that is still too much, and from 30,000 loans or less to  20,000 loans or less to be exempted from, again, enhanced consumer  protection requirements under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures  Act.   Although I am pleased that this amendment would tighten up the  language in the underlying bill somewhat, I remain concerned about the  impacts it could have on many consumers. The bill is called the  Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act of 2017, and the title  implies that it will relieve our Nation's smaller financial  institutions from regulatory burdens.   Now, we all know that community banking is not purely a function of  size, but when the Consumer Bureau conducted research for its escrow  requirements rulemaking, it found that none of the entities it  identified as operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas had  total assets as of the end of 2009 greater than $2 billion.                                time  1315    And when the Consumer Bureau researched mortgage service and  practices, it concluded: ``The problematic practices that have plagued  the servicing industry, particularly in recent years, are, to a large  extent, a function of a business model in which servicing is viewed as  a discrete line of business and profit center.''   However, they also found that approximately 96 percent of community  bank and small credit union services that only purchase a hold,  mortgage service, and rights for mortgage loans, they actually own or  originate service 5,000 or fewer loans. Yet this amendment would exceed  the Consumer Bureau's research base that sets that threshold by  billions of dollars and its carefully researched loan service and  threshold by 400 percent.   So if the amendment is adopted, I must continue to oppose the bill  because it would undermine the work of the Consumer Bureau and weaken  consumer protections in homeownership. Congress should not be complicit  in these acts by passing legislation that further erodes the rights and  protections of America's consumers. We must continue to do all that we  can to ensure mortgage loan borrowers are fully aware of the terms and  conditions of their mortgage loans and how much they will owe in  obtaining these loans.   If we are successful in convincing our colleagues today that they  should not support this bill, I will be happy to work with my  colleague, who I know has good intentions, to see what we can do to  address what I think are some of his concerns. But for now, I must  oppose the bill, and even with the amendment, it does not satisfy the  concerns that I have addressed here. It does nothing to protect those  in the rural communities and the underserved communities, and it does  nothing to help community banks.   So I am opposed both to the bill and to the amendment, and I ask for  a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
