 Mr. Speaker, most Americans would be outraged to learn  that hundreds, if not thousands, of veterans have been deported after  serving honorably in the United States military, but this is the  shocking truth about our broken immigration system.   These unjust deportations of veterans are still occurring. Let me  cite the case of Chong Hwan Kim, a South Korean immigrant who has lived  in this country since he was 5 years old. In 2009, he was deployed to  Iraq and was honorably discharged a year later. Legal permanent  residents qualify for citizenship if they serve just one day on Active  Duty during a time of war.   Suffering from PTSD and facing the same challenges that many veterans  face reintegrating into society, Kim broke the law, and because he  never completed the process of becoming a citizen, he currently awaits  deportation.   Veterans like Chong Hwan Kim deserve better. They deserve the dignity  and respect that we afford to all who serve, and they deserve to enjoy  the rights they risked their lives to protect.                            ____________________
