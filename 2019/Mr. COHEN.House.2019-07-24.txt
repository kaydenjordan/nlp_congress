 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Pallone for yielding.   This issue has brought everybody together. It seems to be more  popular than ice cream or even fried chicken.   It is amazing such a bill could come about, but it is important  because we get these calls that take up our time.   I have a landline, and I have two cellphones. I don't even answer my  landline anymore. When I come home from a trip, coming up to Washington  and then going home, my service is full of automatic dialers,  robocalls. Constituents who want to get through can't get through  because the answering machine has been used up.   They try to take advantage of people, scam them into buying products  they shouldn't. They waste our time. They ruin our opportunity to have  a regular life during the day.   Madam Speaker, I thank all the sponsors. I am proud to be a supporter  and a cosponsor. I look forward to voting for this. I look forward to  the day when I can pick up my phone and it will be Bear Bryant or  somebody looking to reach out to call his mama.
