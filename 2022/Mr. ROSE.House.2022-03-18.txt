 Madam Speaker, the Biden administration has a backup plan  to address rising gas prices, if their Secretary of Transportation's  comical recommendation for every American to buy an electric car  doesn't pan out. Unfortunately, the plan includes secret talks with  Venezuela, led by corrupt dictator Nicolas Maduro, about lifting  sanctions on importing Venezuelan oil into the United States.   Of course, if that doesn't work out, there is always Saudi Arabia and  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, otherwise known as  OPEC, because, surely, begging an oil cartel to make a deal to increase  oil production could never go wrong. What is next? Buying oil from  Iran, the world's leading exporter of terrorism?   This begs the question: Is this all that the Biden administration has  to offer the American people in a time of crisis? Buy oil from corrupt  dictators or buy a costly electric vehicle that you can't afford?   These are not the ideals on which America was built. Regrettably,  this is President Biden's America.                            ____________________
