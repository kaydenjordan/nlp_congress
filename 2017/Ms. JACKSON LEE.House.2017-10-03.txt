 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, before I start, I would like to congratulate the  gentlewoman from Florida for her consistent work on this legislation.  For those of us who have served, we certainly are well aware of the  work that has been done, and I have been very privileged on the  Judiciary Committee to join with her work, and I just want to  congratulate her on that.   As we begin, let me also take just a moment to acknowledge, again,  the massacre that occurred on Sunday night in Las Vegas, Nevada. As I  was pondering the actions of this body last evening with a moment of  silence, I wondered whether that--although it is of much reverence-- whether that, in fact, will heal the wounds of those who lost their  loved ones or those who are still mending--the 500-plus who were in the  hospital and have been in the hospital.   So before I speak to S. 782, I want to make it clear that I think it  is crucial that the letter that both Mr. Conyers and I signed regarding  asserting jurisdiction on the silencer bill is crucial. And as well it  is crucial that this body does more than this, in essence, a moment of  silence to heal the wounds of those who are now speechless about the  loss of their loved ones. And as well it might be time to take a knee  or to kneel, but it is time to pass legislation.   I would hope that we would pass legislation that has been offered,  the King-Thompson bill, and a number of other legislative initiatives  that many of us have.   With that, I rise in support of S. 782, the Providing Resources,  Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our Children Act  of 2017.   This legislation will reauthorize the National Internet Crimes  Against Children Task Force Program by amending the language in section  105(h) of the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008, introduced by then- Senator Joe Biden.   This bill authorizes appropriations for this program in the amount of  $60 million for each fiscal year from 2018 through 2022. These figures  are consistent with current appropriated levels.   We have a special responsibility to protect our young people. For  that reason, I support S. 782, a bill that will provide adequate  resources to help eradicate the cyber threats that continue to threaten  the lives of our children.   I support this important bipartisan measure for several reasons.  First, it will facilitate more comprehensive investigation into violent  acts perpetrated against innocent children.                                time  1530    The task force program creates a coordinated group of investigative  task forces representing 3,500 Federal, State, and local law  enforcement and prosecutorial agencies.   Second, this bill will provide support to officers that will allow  them to better identify these threats, conduct investigation and  training, and enforce the laws.   The task force is particularly important because it becomes a  specialty entity that deals with saving our children.   The task forces aid local and State law enforcement in creating and  implementing effective responses to technologically facilitated child  sexual exploitation and internet crimes against children.   As the internet becomes more sophisticated and there are those who  would want to be bad actors and utilize this very important national/ international asset, this task force is crucial. They provide law  enforcement and prosecutorial agencies with guidance on victim support,  forensic investigations, training and technical assistance, prevention,  and community education--all crucial elements to a holistic approach to  stopping the attack on our children, stopping the sexual exploitation  on our children, and stopping the internet crimes against our children.   In the Judiciary Committee today, we were dealing with another aspect  of this issue, which is sex trafficking and human trafficking.   This is an important component, again, to giving our children back  their innocence and letting them be strong in the knowledge of the love  and affection the Nation has for them and protecting them as they grow  and thrive.   Finally, this bill will provide the technological resources to detect  online threats in real time and provide a platform on which law  enforcement can operate in order to bring these perpetrators to  justice.   Just this morning, the Judiciary Committee, as I indicated, held a  hearing regarding online sex trafficking. We are all in agreement that  we must eradicate this threat to our young people and that we must take  action against other victimization of children that can occur online.  This legislation is, in fact, a key element of that. Although we still  have work to do to address these problems, this bill is a good start.   For the foregoing reasons, I ask my colleagues to support this bill.

Although we still have work to do to address these problems, this  bill is a good start, and for the foregoing reasons, I ask my  colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the ranking member of the  full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who has been a key supporter and  advocate for this important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the full committee and Ms.  Wasserman Schultz for very instructive and important statements,  particularly the plea that Ms. Wasserman Schultz made that we must  reauthorize and, more importantly, fund these task forces, because they  do, in fact, save lives.   Let me acknowledge the chairman of this committee for the  collaboration on this bill, and let me again emphasize that we must  make sure that it is authorized at the amount of money needed.   If there is ever an unfortunate and tragic example, it is that of the  story of Alicia. She represents the Johnnys and Marys and Tommys and  Shirleys and Quamis and Lateshas and others across the Nation who fall  victim to this kind of cruel and almost inhuman attack on our children,  innocent as they are, smart as they are, using the internet as they do  online for any number of reasons, but then wooed by a dastardly person  who wants to do them harm.   The task forces that are now based upon knowledge, expertise,  commitment, passion, and with number of staffing that they need, can  really be for not only prevention, but the intervention to stop our  children from falling victim.   So I ask my colleagues to support S. 782, the Providing Resources,  Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our Children Act  of 2017--or the PROTECT Our Children Act--as quickly as possible so  that it can move to the President's desk and, as well, that we continue  the pathway not only of intervention and prevention, but completely  ceasing the online violence against our children because we have been  able to ensure that these individuals, in large numbers, are brought to  justice. By that very point, they cease to survive and thrive on the  internet.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of S. 782, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Conyers and I can remember the same type of hearings and the same  type of legislation many years ago, again denying women their  constitutional rights. I can see as clear as I can see you, Madam  Speaker, the women who were sitting and begging us not to undermine  them, their doctor, and their faith.   So I rise today to say to my friends on the other side of the aisle:  You have got it wrong. There are no mass abortions. There is no call  for mass abortions. The women that are undergoing these procedures are  women who have prayed and who have looked to their faith, their doctor,  and their family.   So I oppose this bill because it puts the lives of women at risk, it  interferes with women's constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy,  and it diverts attention from the real problem facing American women.  Let us reauthorize SCHIP. People are crying about that in my district.  How outrageous.   One of the most detestable aspects of this bill is that it would curb  access to care for women in the most desperate of circumstances. It is  these women who receive the 1.5 percent of abortions that occur after  20 weeks.   What number did I say? 10? 20? 1.5, and this is not diminishing the  aspects of this.   But it is those women who have prayed. They have sought doctors'  help, and they, as well, have sought their family's consultation.   We are making a mockery of these women. These women are not standing  on the street corner saying, ``I want to have an abortion.'' They have  a serious situation, like April Salazar.   At 18 weeks, she and her husband found out that their baby had a  lethal diagnosis, and if she carried the pregnancy to term and he was  born alive, he would die shortly from suffocation. It is not pain of  getting him out--he would die. April hoped the news wasn't true, so she  requested more tests to confirm the diagnosis. At 21 weeks she had an  abortion. This bill would have stopped April.    This would have stopped April, her husband, her  family, her God, and her doctor from making the decision.   Even the exceptions are bogus because you frighten these women. The  idea of Jeni, in my home State, where they had a 2-day waiting period  listening to a mandatory script about abortion and a sign-off from two  separate doctors. Once you start this, you are taking it away from  women who have sought their faith leader, their doctor, and their  family.   This is a bad bill. We need to do some important things. I would hope  with the carnage of Las Vegas, to save lives, we would ban assault  weapons and we would not have that gentleman having 42 guns in his home  and in his possession. That is what we need to fight to save lives, not  this bill that undermines the rights of women and their faith and their  doctor.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 36, the ``Pain  Capable Unborn Child Protection Act'' and the underlying bill.   I opposed this irresponsible and reckless legislation the last time  it was brought to the floor.   I oppose this bill because it is unnecessary, puts the lives of women  at risk, interferes with women's constitutionally guaranteed right of  privacy, and diverts our attention from the real problems facing the  American people.   A more accurate short title for this bill would be the ``Violating  the Rights of Women Act of 2017.''   Instead of resuming their annual War on Women, our colleagues across  the aisle should be working with Democrats to help rebuild the ravaged  communities hit by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   Madam Speaker, we could and should instead be voting reauthorize the  important SCHIP program that has helped families get on their feet for  years.   Instead of voting to abridge the constitutional rights of women for  the umpteenth time, we should bring to the floor for a first vote  comprehensive immigration reform legislation or legislations repairing  the harm to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the Supreme Court's  decision in Shelby County v. Holder.   The one thing we should not be doing is debating irresponsible  ``messaging bills'' that abridge the rights of women and poses a  nationwide threat to the health and wellbeing of American women and a  direct challenge to the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade.   Madam Speaker, one of the most detestable aspects of this bill is  that it would curb access to care for women in the most desperate of  circumstances.   It is these women who receive the 1.5 percent of abortions that occur  after 20 weeks.   Women like Jeni from Texas, who, at 21 weeks, was told that her fetus  had multiple severe defects.   Jeni could end the pregnancy or wait for the fetus to miscarry or  die.   There was no way that the pregnancy would end in a live, healthy  baby.   Jeni and her husband chose to terminate the pregnancy, but because  they live in Texas, they were forced to endure several cruel  restrictions: a two-day waiting period, listening to a mandatory script  about abortion, and a sign-off from two separate doctors.   Madam Speaker, every pregnancy is different.   No politician knows, or has the right to assume he knows, what is  best for a woman and her family.   These are decisions that properly must be left to women to make, in  consultation with their partners, doctors, and their God.   Madam Speaker, I also strongly oppose H.R. 36 because it lacks the  necessary exceptions to protect the health and life of the mother.   In Roe v. Wade, the Court held that a state could not prohibit a  woman from exercising her right to terminate a pregnancy in order to  protect her health prior to viability.   While many factors go into determining fetal viability, the consensus  of the medical community is that viability is acknowledged as not  occurring prior to 24 weeks gestation.   By prohibiting nearly all abortions beginning at ``the probable post- fertilization age'' of 20 weeks, H.R. 36 violates this clear and long  standing constitutional rule.   Madam Speaker, the constitutionally protected right to privacy  encompasses the right of women to choose to terminate a pregnancy  before viability, and even later where continuing to term poses a  threat to her health and safety.   This right of privacy was hard won and must be preserved inviolate.   I strongly oppose H.R. 36 and urge all Members to join me in voting  against this unwise measure that put the lives and health of women at  risk.   I would like to include in the Record stories from two women:         April Salazar, New York: ``It would have been too hard for       me to carry to term, and it  [[Page H7724]]       seemed pointless to make the baby suffer too when she would       never survive.''        At 18 weeks, April and her husband found out that their       baby had lethal skeletal dysplasia. He would never be able to       breathe on his own. If she carried the pregnancy to term and       he was born alive, he would die shortly after of suffocation.       April hoped the news wasn't true, so she requested more tests       to confirm the diagnosis, which took two weeks. At 21 weeks,       she had an abortion. April shares her story because she has       found that it can change opinions. Several people she knows       personally who previously had been anti-abortion told her       that they would have done the same thing she did.        Julie Bindeman, Maryland: ``Everything about a later       termination is already so incredibly difficult even just       picking up the phone to make the appointment. The 20-week ban       adds another hurdle. It's just cruel.''        Julie's doctor told her and her husband that their son's       brain had a serious abnormality, a diagnosis that they       confirmed with tests, more ultrasounds, and an MRI. If the       baby survived birth, he would never speak, walk, or have       conscious thoughts based upon what had developed in his       brain. Julie and her husband decided to end the pregnancy,       and the soonest they could get the appointment was at 22       weeks. Julie could not find a surgeon in Maryland at that       time willing to perform the procedure, so she had to be       induced for labor and delivery. Her baby was born alive and       died very shortly after.     Mr. Speaker, in 1997, with a very, very bipartisan  budget reconciliation deal, we passed a magnificent statement about  this Nation's commitment to children, and that was the Children's  Health Insurance Program that all of us were so very proud of. It  started in 1997 as the first real health reform since Medicare and  Medicaid, and millions of children were able to get healthcare. Maybe  at that time their parents could not, but they could be covered:  children with sickle cell, children with heart defects, children with  various hereditary or genetic diseases who were impacted, children with  cancer, leukemia, all of these children, or children injured on a  playing field, children could be covered.   It is time to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. In  fact, I call upon the leadership to be able to establish martial law so  that we can pass the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance  Program coming this week before we go home.   The Democrats have been pushing. The leadership of the Democrats have  been pushing. They have been asking for the passage of the Children's  Health Insurance Program.   I can tell you that those, Mr. Speaker, impacted by the hurricanes,  they need that healthcare. I ask for its passage.                            ____________________
