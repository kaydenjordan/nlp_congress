 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate and honor the  life of Dr. David L. Rice.   Dr. Rice was the founding and first president of the University of  Southern Indiana, where he worked from 1967 until his retirement in  1994.   Before his time at the University of Southern Indiana, Dr. Rice  earned a bachelor of science in agriculture and a master of science and  a doctor of philosophy in education, all from Purdue University.   While studying at Purdue, he met his wife, Betty J. Fordice, and the  two were shortly wedded to one another. The following year of their  marriage, Dr. Rice answered the called for his country and served in  the United States Army infantry in Korea.   After serving in the military, Dr. Rice returned to Indiana, where he  taught public school while pursuing his advanced degrees at Purdue.   In 1967, Dr. Rice was appointed to lead the Evansville campus of  Indiana State University. By 1985, under his leadership, the campus  became its own separate university, the University of Southern Indiana.   During his tenure, the University of Southern Indiana grew in  enrollment  [[Page H1649]]  from 992 students to 7,443, expanded the curriculum from 2-year degree  programs to a comprehensive range of baccalaureate and master's degree  programs. He did such an exemplary job, they honored him by naming the  library after him.   Dr. Rice was also very dedicated to bettering his community. He was a  member of countless groups and organizations, such as being on the  board of the Evansville Museum of Arts, History and Science, and  starting an organization called Leadership Everyone. The group looks to  develop leaders in the community who are committed to utilizing  inclusion and creativity in order to bring positive change.   Dr. Rice's legacy of service and achieving excellence will live on  through all the lives he impacted and through the David L. Rice and  Betty Fordice Rice Presidential Scholarship.   Most importantly, his memory will live on through his family. Dr.  Rice is survived by his wife of 69 years, Betty ``Janey'' Fordice Rice,  and their two children, along with six grandchildren.                            ____________________
