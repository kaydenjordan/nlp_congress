 Mr. Chief Justice, as the Chaplain has indicated, on  behalf of all of us, happy birthday. I am sure this is exactly how you  had planned to celebrate the day.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you very much for those kind wishes, and  thank you to all the Senators for not asking for the yeas and nays.   (Laughter.)                              Order of Procedure     For the information of all Senators, we should expect  to break every 2 or 3 hours and then at 6 o'clock a break for dinner.   And with that, Mr. Chief Justice, I yield the floor.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 483, the  counsel for the President have 22 hours and 5 minutes remaining to make  the presentation of their case. The Senate will now hear you.   The Senate will now hear you, Mr. Sekulow.                         Opening Statement--Continued    Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate,  managers, what we have done on Saturday is the pattern that we are  going to continue today, as far as how we are going to deal with the  case. We deal with transcript evidence. We deal with publicly available  information. We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not  based on evidentiary standards at all.   We are going to highlight some of those very facts we talked about  very quickly on Saturday. You are going to hear more about that. I want  to give you a little bit of an overview of what we plan to do today in  our presentation.   You will hear from a number of lawyers. Each one of these lawyers  will be addressing a particular aspect of the President's case. I will  introduce the issues that they are going to discuss, and, then, that  individual will come up and make their presentation. We want to do this  on an expeditious but yet thorough basis.   Let me start with, just for a very brief few moments, taking a look  at where we were. One of the things that became very clear to us as we  looked at the presentation from the House managers was the lack of  focus on that July 25 transcript. That is because the transcript  actually doesn't say what they would like it to say. We have heard--and  you will hear more--about that in the days ahead. We know about Mr.  Schiff's version of the transcript. You heard it. You saw it.   I want to keep coming back to facts--facts that are undisputed. The  President, in his conversation, was clear on a number of points, but so  was President Zelensky. I mentioned that at the close of my arguments  earlier, that it was President Zelensky who said: No pressure, I didn't  feel any pressure.   And, again, as this kind of reading of minds of what people were  saying, I think we need to look at what they actually said and how it  is backed up.   It is our position as the President's counsel that the President was  at all time acting under his constitutional authority, under his legal  authority, in our national interest, and pursuant to his oath of  office. Asking a foreign leader to get to the bottom of issues of  corruption is not a violation of an oath.   It was interesting because there was a lot of discussion the other  day about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, and one of the things that we  reiterate is that  [[Page S580]]  he himself said that he did not know if there was anything of crime or  anything of that nature. He had deep policy concerns. I think that is  what this is really about--deep policy concerns, deep policy  differences.   We live in a constitutional Republic where you have deep policy  concerns and deep differences. That should not be the basis of an  impeachment. If the bar of impeachment has now reached that level,  then, for the sake of the Republic, the danger that puts not just this  body but our entire constitutional framework in is unimaginable. Every  time there is a policy difference of significance or an approach  difference of significance about a policy, are we going to start an  impeachment proceeding?   As I said earlier, I don't think this was about just a phone call.  There was a pattern in practice of attempts over a 3-year period to not  only interfere with the President's capability to govern--which, by the  way, they were completely unsuccessful at; just look at the state of  where we are as a country--but also interfere with the constitutional  framework.   I am going to say this because I want to be brief. We are going to  have a series of lawyers address you. So it will not be one lawyer for  hours and hours. We are going to have a series of lawyers address you  on a variety of issues. This is how we envision the President's defense  going. We thought it would be appropriate to start with an overview, if  you will, of some of the significant historical issues, constitutional  issues, involving impeachment proceedings, since we don't have a long  history of that. I think that is a good thing for the country that we  don't, and I think that we would all agree. But if this becomes the new  standard, the future is going to look a lot different.   We are going to hear next from my cocounsel Judge Kenneth Starr.  Judge Starr is a former judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia. He served as the 39th Solicitor General of the  United States, arguing cases before the Supreme Court of the United  States on behalf of the United States.   I had the privilege of arguing a case alongside Judge Starr--we were  talking about this earlier--many years ago. He also served as the  independent counsel during the Clinton Presidency and author of the  Starr report. He testified for almost 12 hours before the Judiciary  Committee with regard to that report. Judge Starr is very familiar with  this process. He is going to address a series of deficiencies, which  are legal issues with regard to articles I and II--constitutional  implications, historical implications, and legal implications of where  this case now stands.   I would like to yield my time right now to, if it please the Chief  Justice, Ken Starr.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Starr.   Mr. Counsel STARR. Thank you.   Mr. Chief Justice, House Managers, and staff, Members of the Senate,  the majority leader, and the minority leader, at the beginning of these  proceedings on January 16, the Chief Justice administered the oath of  office to the Members of this body and then again on Tuesday. In doing  so, the Chief Justice was honoring the words of our Constitution,  article I, section 3. We all know the first sentence of that article by  heart: ``The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all  Impeachments.'' But then the constitutional text goes on to say this:  ``When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath Or  Affirmation.'' That oath or affirmation, in turn, requires each Member  of the Senate to do impartial justice.   This constitutionally administered oath or affirmation has been given  in every proceeding in this body since 1798. Indeed, to signify the  importance of the occasion, the Senate's more recent traditions call  for you, as you did, to sign the book. And that book is not simply part  of the record; it is entrusted to the National Archives. In contrast,  Members of the House of Representatives do not take an oath in  connection with impeachment. The Framers of our Constitution well knew  when an oath or affirmation should be required--the Senate, yes; the  House, no. Thus, each Member of the world's greatest deliberative body  now has special--indeed unique--duties and obligations imposed under  our founding document.   During the Clinton impeachment trial 21 years ago in this Chamber,  the Chief Justice of the United States ruled in response to an  objection that was interposed by Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. The  Senators are not sitting as jurors, Senator Harkin noted, and the Chief  Justice agreed with that proposition. Rather, the Senate is a court. In  fact, history teaches us that for literally decades, this body was  referred to in this context as the High Court of Impeachment. So we are  not a legislative Chamber during these proceedings. We are in a  tribunal. We are in court.   Alexander Hamilton has been quoted frequently in these proceedings,  but in Federalist 78, he was describing the role of courts--your role-- and in doing so, he distinguished between what he called the exercise  of judgment on the one hand, which is what courts do, and the exercise  of will or policy preferences, if you will, on the other hand. That is  what legislative bodies do.   According to Hamilton, courts were to be, in his word, ``impartial.''  There is that word again. You know, that is a daunting task for judges  struggling to do the right thing, to be impartial--equal justice under  law. It is certainly hard in life to be impartial. In politics, it is  not even asked of one to be impartial. But that is the task that the  Constitution chose to impose upon each of you.   Significantly, in this particular juncture in America's history, the  Senate is being called to sit as the High Court of Impeachment all too  frequently. Indeed, we are living in what I think can aptly be  described as the ``age of impeachment.'' In the House, resolution after  resolution, month after month, has called for the President's  impeachment.   How did we get here, with Presidential impeachment invoked frequently  in its inherently destabilizing, as well as acrimonious way? Briefly  told, the story begins 42 years ago.   In the wake of the long national nightmare of Watergate, Congress and  President Jimmy Carter collaboratively ushered in a new chapter in  America's constitutional history. Together, in full agreement, they  enacted the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government  Act of 1978. But the new chapter was not simply the age of independent  counsels; it became, unbeknownst to the American people, the age of  impeachment.   During my service in the Reagan administration as Counsel and Chief  of Staff to Attorney General William French Smith, the Justice  Department took the position that, however well-intentioned, the  independent counsel provisions were unconstitutional. Why? In the view  of the Department, those provisions intruded into the rightful domain  and prerogative of the executive branch of the Presidency.   The Justice Department's position was eventually rejected by the  Supreme Court, but most importantly, in helping us understand this new  era in our country's history, Justice Antonin Scalia was in deep  dissent. Among his stinging criticisms of that law, Justice Scalia  wrote this: ``The context of this statute is acrid with the smell of  threatened impeachment.'' Impeachment.    Justice Scalia echoed the criticism of the court in which I was  serving at the time, the District of Columbia Circuit, which had  actually struck down the law as unconstitutional in a very impressive  opinion by renowned Judge Laurence Silberman.   Why would Justice Scalia refer to impeachment? This was a reform  measure. There would be no more Saturday Night Massacres--the firing of  Special Prosecutor, as he was called, Archibald Cox by President Nixon.  Government would now be better, more honest, greater accountability,  and the independent counsel would be protected. But the word  ``impeachment'' haunts that dissenting opinion, and it is not hard to  discover why--because the statute, by its terms, expressly directed the  independent counsel to become, in effect, an agent of the House of  Representatives. And to what end? To report to the House of  Representatives when a very low threshold of information was received  that an impeachable offense, left undefined, may have been committed.   To paraphrase President Clinton's very able counsel at the time,  Bernie Nussbaum, this statute is a dagger  [[Page S581]]  aimed at the heart of the Presidency. President Clinton, nonetheless,  signed the reauthorized measure into law, and the Nation then went  through the long process known as Whitewater, resulting in the findings  by the office which I led, the Office of Independent Counsel, and a  written report to the House of Representatives. That referral to  Congress was stipulated in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.   To put it mildly, Democrats were very upset about what had happened.  They then joined Republicans across the aisle who, for their part, had  been outraged by an earlier independent counsel investigation, that of  a very distinguished former judge, Lawrence Walsh.   During the Reagan administration, Judge Walsh's investigation into  what became known to the country as Iran-Contra spawned enormous  criticism on the Republican side of the aisle, both as to the  investigation itself but also as to statute.   The acrimony surrounding Iran-Contra and then the impeachment and the  trial and President Clinton's acquittal by this body led inexorably to  the end of the independent counsel era. Enough was enough. Living  through that wildly controversial, 21-year, bold experiment with the  independent counsel statute, Congress, in a bipartisan way, had a  change of heart. It allowed the law to expire in accordance with its  terms in 1999.   That would-be and well-intentioned reform measure died a quiet and  uneventful death, and it was promptly replaced by Justice Department  internal regulations promulgated by Attorney General Janet Reno during  the waning months of the President Clinton administration. One can  review those regulations and see no reference to impeachment--none. No  longer were the poison pill provisions of Presidential impeachment part  of America's legal landscape. They were gone. The Reno regulation  seemed to signal a return to traditional norms. Impeachment would no  longer be embedded in the actual laws of the land but returned to the  language of the Constitution.   In the meantime, America's constitutional DNA and its political  culture had changed. Even with the dawn of the new century, the 21st  century, ``impeachment'' remained on the lips of countless Americans  and echoed frequently in the people's House. The impeachment habit  proved to be hard to kick.   Ironically, while this was happening here at home, across the  Atlantic, the use of impeachment as a weapon disappeared. In the United  Kingdom, from which, of course, we inherited the process, impeachment  was first used more than two centuries before those first settlers  crossed the Atlantic. But upon thoughtful examination, a number of  modern-day parliamentary committees looked and found impeachment to be  obsolete.   Among other criticisms, Members of Parliament came to the view that  the practice which had last been attempted in Britain in 1868 failed to  meet modern procedural standards of fairness--fairness.   As Sir William McKay recently remarked: ``Impeachment in Britain is  dead.''   Yet, here at home, in the world's longest standing constitutional  Republic, instead of a once-in-a-century phenomenon, which it had been,  Presidential impeachment has become a weapon to be wielded against  one's political opponent.   In her thoughtful Wall Street Journal op-ed a week ago, Saturday,  Peggy Noonan wrote this:         Impeachment has now been normalized. It will not be a once-      in-a-generation act but an every-administration act. The       Democrats will regret it when the Republicans are handing out       the pens [for the signing ceremony].    When we look back down the corridors of time, we see that for almost  our first century as a constitutional republic the sword of  Presidential impeachment remained sheathed. Had there been  controversial Presidents? Oh, yes, indeed. Think of John Adams and the  Alien and Sedition Acts. Think of Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay. Were  partisan passions occasionally inflamed during that first century? Of  course.   And lest there be any doubt, the early Congresses full well knew how  to summon impeachment to the floor, including against a Member of this  body--Senator William Blount, of Tennessee. During the Jefferson  administration, the unsuccessful impeachment of Justice Samuel Chase--a  surly and partial jurist, who was, nonetheless, acquitted by this  Chamber--became an early landmark in maintaining the treasured  independence of our Federal judiciary.   It took the national convulsion of the Civil War, the assassination  of Mr. Lincoln, and the counter-reconstruction measures aggressively  pursued by Mr. Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, to bring about the  Nation's very first Presidential impeachment. Famously, of course, your  predecessors in this High Court of Impeachment acquitted the unpopular  and controversial Johnson but only by virtue of Senators from the party  of Lincoln breaking ranks.   It was over a century later that the Nation returned to the  tumultuous world of Presidential impeachment, necessitated by the rank  criminality of the Nixon administration. In light of the rapidly  unfolding facts, including uncovered by the Senate select committee, in  an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 410 to 4, the House of  Representatives authorized an impeachment inquiry; and, in 1974, the  House Judiciary Committee, after lengthy hearings, voted again in a  bipartisan manner to impeach the President of the United States.  Importantly, President Nixon's own party was slowly but inexorably  moving toward favoring the removal of their chosen leader from the  Nation's highest office, who had just won reelection by a landslide.   It bears emphasis before this high court that this was the first  Presidential impeachment in over 100 years. It also bears emphasis that  it was powerfully bipartisan. And it was not just the vote to authorize  the impeachment inquiry. Indeed, the House Judiciary chair, Peter  Rodino, of New Jersey, was insistent that, to be accepted by the  American people, the process had to be bipartisan.   Like war, impeachment is hell or, at least, Presidential impeachment  is hell. Those of us who lived through the Clinton impeachment,  including Members of this body, full well understand that a  Presidential impeachment is tantamount to domestic war. Albeit  thankfully protected by our beloved First Amendment, it is a war of  words and a war of ideas, but it is filled with acrimony, and it  divides the country like nothing else. Those of us who lived through  the Clinton impeachment understand that in a deep and personal way.   Now, in contrast, wisely and judicially conducted, unlike in the  United Kingdom, impeachment remains a vital and appropriate tool in our  country to serve as a check with respect to the Federal judiciary.  After all, in the Constitution's brilliant structural design, Federal  judges know, as this body full well knows from its daily work, of a  pivotally important feature--independence from politics--exactly what  Alexander Hamilton was talking about in Federalist 78: during the  Constitution's term, good behavior; in practical effect, life tenure.  Impeachment is, thus, a very important protection for we the people  against what could be serious article III wrongdoing within that  branch.   And so it is that, when you count, of the 63 impeachment inquiries  authorized by the House of Representatives over our history, only 8  have actually been convicted in this high court and removed from  office, and each and every one has been a Federal judge.   This history leads me to reflect on the nature of your weighty  responsibilities here in this high court as judges in the context of  Presidential impeachment--the fourth Presidential impeachment. I am  counting the Nixon proceedings in our Nation's history, but the third  over the past half century.   And I respectfully submit that the Senate, in its wisdom, would do  well in its deliberations to guide the Nation in this world's greatest  deliberative body to return to our country's traditions when  Presidential impeachment was truly a measure of last resort. Members of  this body can help and in this very proceeding restore our  constitutional and historical traditions, above all, by returning to  the text of the Constitution itself. It can do so by its example here  in these proceedings in weaving the tapestry of what can rightly be  called the common law of  [[Page S582]]  Presidential impeachment. That is what courts do. They weave the common  law. There are indications within the constitutional text--I will come  to our history--so that this fundamental question is appropriate to be  asked--you are familiar with the arguments: Was there a crime or other  violation of established law alleged?    So let's turn to the text.   Throughout the Constitution's description of impeachment, the text  speaks always--always--without exception, in terms of crimes. It  begins, of course, with treason--the greatest of crimes against the  state and against we the people, but so misused as a bludgeon and  parliamentary experience, to lead the Founders to actually define the  term in the Constitution itself. Bribery--an iniquitous form of moral  and legal corruption and the basis of so many of the 63 impeachment  proceedings over the course of our history--again, almost all of them  against judges. And then the mysterious terms--other high crimes and  misdemeanors. Once again, the language is employing the language of  crimes. The Constitution is speaking to us in terms of crimes.   Each of those references, when you count them--count seven, count  eight--supports the conclusion that impeachments should be evaluated in  terms of offenses against established law but especially with respect  to the Presidency, where the Constitution requires the Chief Justice of  the United States and not a political officer--no matter how honest, no  matter how impartial--to preside at trial. Guided by history, the  Framers made a deliberate and wise choice to cabin, to constrain, to  limit the power of impeachment.   And so it was, on the very eve of the impeachment of President Andrew  Johnson, that the eminent scholar and dean of Columbia Law School,  Theodore Dwight, wrote this: ``The weight of authority is that no  impeachment will lie except for a true crime--a breach of the law-- which would be the subject of indictment.'' I am not making that  argument. I am noting what he is saying. He didn't over-argue the case.  He said ``the weight of authority,'' ``the weight of authority.''   And so this issue is a weighty one. Has the House of Representatives,  with all due respect, in these two Articles of Impeachment charged a  crime or a violation of established law or not? This is--I don't want  to over-argue--an appropriate and weighty consideration for the Senate  but especially as I am trying to emphasize in the case not of a Federal  judge but of the President. Courts consider prudential factors, and  there is a huge prudential factor that this trial is occurring in an  election year, when we the people, in a matter of months, will go to  the polls.   In developing the common law of Presidential impeachment, this  threshold factor, consistent with the constitutional text, consistent  with the Nation's history and Presidential impeachments, as I will seek  to demonstrate, serves as a clarifying and stabilizing element. It  increases predictability--to do what?--to reduce the profound danger  that a Presidential impeachment will be dominated by partisan  considerations--precisely the evil that the Framers warned about.   And so to history.   History bears out the point. The Nation's most recent experience--the  Clinton impeachment--even though severely and roundly criticized,  charged crimes. These were crimes proven in the crucible of the House  of Representatives' debate beyond any reasonable observer's doubt.   So too the Nixon impeachment. The articles charged crimes. What about  article II in Nixon, which is sometimes referred to as abuse of power?  Was that the abuse of power article--the precursor to article I that is  before this court? Not at all. When one returns to article II in  Nixon--approved by a bipartisan House Judiciary Committee--article II  of Nixon sets forth a deeply troubling story of numerous crimes--not  one, not two, numerous crimes--carried out at the direction of the  President himself.   And so the appropriate question: Were crimes alleged in the articles  of the common law of Presidential impeachment? In Nixon, yes. In  Clinton, yes. Here, no--a factor to be considered as the judges of the  high court.   Come, as you will, individually to your judgment.   Even in the political cauldron of the Andrew Johnson impeachment,  article XI charged a violation of the controversial Tenure of Office  Act. You are familiar with it. And that act warned expressly the Oval  Office; that its violation would institute a high misdemeanor,  employing the very language of constitutionally cognizable crimes.   This history represents, and I believe, may it please the court, it  embodies the common law of Presidential impeachment. These are facts  gleaned from the constitutional text and from the gloss of the Nation's  history.   And under this view, the commission of an alleged crime, the  violation of established law, can appropriately be considered, again, a  weighty and an important consideration and element of a historically  supportable Presidential impeachment.   Will law professors agree with this? No, but with all due respect to  the academy, this is not an academic gathering. We are in court. We are  not just in court. With all due respect to the Chief Justice and the  Supreme Court of the United States, we are in democracy's ultimate  court.   And the better constitutional answer to the question is provided by a  rigorous and faithful examination of the constitutional text and then  looking faithfully and respectfully to our history.   The very divisive Clinton impeachment demonstrates that, while highly  relevant, the commission of a crime is by no means sufficient to  warrant the removal of our duly elected President. Why?   This body knows. We appoint judges and you confirm them and they are  there for life. Not Presidents. And the Presidency is unique. The  Presidency stands alone in our constitutional framework.   Before he became the Chief Justice of the United States, John  Marshall, then sitting as a Member of the people's House, made a speech  on the floor of the House, and there he said this:         The President is the sole organ of the Nation in its       external relations, and its sole representative with foreign       nations.    If that sounds like hyperbole, it has been embraced over decades by  the Supreme Court of the United States, by Justices appointed by many  different Presidents. The Presidency is unique. There is no other  system quite like ours, and it has served us well.   And so as to the Presidency, impeachment and removal not only  overturns a national election and perhaps profoundly affects an  upcoming election, in the words of Yale's Akhil Amar, it entails a  risk, and these are Akhil's words, Professor Amar's, ``a grave  disruption of the government.'' Professor Amar penned those words in  connection with the Clinton impeachment. ``Grave disruption of the  government.'' Regardless of what the President has done, ``grave  disruption.''   We will all agree that the Presidents, under the text of the  Constitution and its amendments, are to serve out their term absent a  genuine national consensus, reflected by the two-thirds majority  requirement of this court, that the President must go away. Two-thirds.  In politics and in impeachment, that is called a landslide.   Here, I respectfully submit to the court, that all fairminded persons  will surely agree there is no national consensus. We might wish for  one, but there isn't. To the contrary, for the first time in America's  modern history, not a single House Member of the President's party  supported either of the two Articles of Impeachment--not one, not in  committee, not on the House floor.   And that pivotal fact puts in bold relief the Peter Rodino  principle--call it the Rodino rule--impeachment must be bipartisan in  nature.   Again, sitting as a court, this body should signal to the Nation the  return to our traditions--bipartisan impeachments.   What is the alternative? Will the President be King? Do oversight.  The tradition of oversight--an enormous check on Presidential power  throughout our history, and it continues available today.   In Iran-Contra, no impeachment was undertaken. The Speaker of the  House, a Democrat, Jim Wright from Texas, from Fort Worth, where the  West begins, knew better. He said no. But as befits the age of  impeachment, a House  [[Page S583]]  resolution to impeach President Ronald Reagan was introduced. It was  filed, and the effort to impeach President Reagan was supported by a  leading law professor whose name you would well recognize, and you will  hear it again this evening from Professor Dershowitz. I will leave to  it him to identify the learned professor. But the Speaker of the  people's House, emulating Peter Rodino, said no.   So I, respectfully, submit that the Senate should close this chapter,  this idiosyncratic chapter, on this increasingly disruptive act, this  era, this age of resorting to the Constitution's ultimate democratic  weapon for the Presidency. Let the people decide.   There was a great Justice who sat for 30 years, Justice John Harlan,  in the mid-century of the 20th century. And in a lawsuit involving a  very basic question: Can citizens whose rights have clearly been  violated by Federal law enforcement agencies and agents bring an action  for damages when Congress has not so provided--no law that gave the  wounded citizen a right to redress through damages?    And Justice Harlan, in a magnificent concurring opinion in Bivens v.  Six Unnamed Federal Agents, suggested that courts--here you are--should  take into consideration in reaching its judgment--their judgment--what  he called factors counseling restraint.   He was somewhat reluctant to say that we, the Supreme Court, should  grant this right, that we should create it when Congress hasn't acted  and Congress could have acted, but it hadn't. But he reluctantly came  to the conclusion that the Constitution itself empowered the Federal  courts to create this right for our injured citizens, to give them  redress, not just an injunctive relief but damages, money recovery, for  violations of their constitutional rights. Factors counseling  restraint. And he addressed them, and he came to the view--it was so  honest--and said: I came to the case with a different view, but I  changed my mind and voted in favor of the Bivens family having redress  against the Federal agents who had violated their rights, judging in  its most impartial, elegant sense.   I am going to draw from Justice Harlan's matrix of factors counseling  restraint and simply identify these. I think there may be others.   The articles do not charge a crime for violations established. I am  suggesting it is a relevant factor. I think it is a weighty factor,  when we come to Presidential impeachment, not judicial impeachment.   Secondly, the articles come to you with no bipartisan support. They  come to you as a violation of what I am dubbing the Rodino rule.   And third, as I will now discuss, the pivotally important issue of  process, the second Article of Impeachment: Obstruction of Congress.   This court is very familiar with United States v. Nixon. Its  unanimity in recognizing the President's profound interest in  confidentiality, regardless of the world view or philosophy of the  justice, the Justices were unanimous. This isn't just a contrivance; it  is built into the very nature of our constitutional order. So let me  comment, briefly.   This constitutionally based recognition of executive privilege and  then companion privileges--the deliberative process privilege, the  immunity of close Presidential advisers from being summoned to  testify--these are all firmly established in our law.   If there is a dispute between the people's House and the President of  the United States over the availability of documents or witnesses--and  there is in each and every administration--then go to court. It really  is as simple as that. I don't need to belabor the point.   But here is the point I would like to emphasize. Frequently, the  Justice Department advises the President of the United States that the  protection of the Presidency calls--whatever the President might want  to do as a political matter, as an accommodation in the spirit of  comity--to protect privileged conversations and communications.   I have heard it, in my two tours of duty at the Justice Department:  Don't release the documents, Mr. President. If you do, you are injuring  the Presidency. Go to court.   We have heard concerns about the length of time that the litigation  might take. Those of us who have litigated know that sometimes  litigation does take longer than we would like. Justice delayed is  justice denied. We could all agree with that.   But our history--Churchill's maxim, study history--our history tells  us that is not necessarily so. Take by way of example the Pentagon  Papers case--orders issued preventing and sanctioning a gross violation  of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the press, an order  issued out of the district court June 15, 1971. That order was reversed  in an opinion by the Supreme Court of the United States 2 weeks later.  June 15.   The House of Representatives could have followed that well-trodden  path. It could have sought expedition. The E. Barrett Prettyman  Courthouse is 6 blocks down. The judges are there. They are all very  able. They are hard-working people of integrity. Follow the path.  Follow the path of the law. Go to court.   There would have been at least one problem had the House seen fit to  go to court and remain in court. The issue is before you.   But among other flaws, the Office of Legal Counsel determined--and I  have read the opinion, and I believe it is correct--that with all  respect, all House subpoenas issued prior to the adoption of H.R. 660,  which for the first time authorized the impeachment inquiry as a House,  all subpoenas were invalid. They were void. With all due respect to the  Speaker of the House of Representatives, with all her abilities and her  vast experience, under our Constitution, she was powerless to do what  she purported to do. As has been said now time and again, especially  throughout the fall, the Constitution does entrust the sole power of  impeachment to the House of Representatives, but that is the House, its  435 Members elected from across the constitutional Republic--not one,  no matter how able she may be. In the people's House, every  Congressperson gets a vote. We know the concept: one person, one vote.    More generally, the President, as I reviewed the record, has  consistently and scrupulously followed the advice and counsel of the  Justice Department and, in particular, the Office of Legal Counsel. He  has been obedient. As you know, that important office--many of you have  had your own experiences professionally with that office--is staffed  with lawyers of great ability. It has a reputation for superb work. It  has done such thoughtful work with both Democratic and Republican  administrations. The office is now headed by a brilliant lawyer who  served as a law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy.   The House may disagree with the guidance provided to the President by  that office; the House frequently does disagree. But for the President  to follow the guidance of the Department of Justice with respect to an  interbranch legal and constitutional dispute cannot reasonably be  viewed as an obstruction and, most emphatically, not as an impeachable  offense.   History, once again, is a great teacher. In the Clinton impeachment,  the House Judiciary Committee rejected a draft article asserting that  President Clinton--and here are the words that were drafted:  ``fraudulently and corruptly asserted executive privilege.'' Strong  words, ``fraudulently and corruptly.'' That was the draft article.   In my view, having lived through the facts and with all due respect  to the former President, he did. He did it time and again, month after  month. We would go to court, and we would win. Many members--not  everybody--on the House Judiciary Committee agreed that the President  had, indeed, improperly claimed executive privilege, rebuffed time and  again by the Judiciary. But at the end of the day, that Committee, the  Judiciary Committee of the House, chaired by Henry Hyde, wisely  concluded that President Clinton's doing so should not be considered an  impeachable offense.   Here is the idea. It is not an impeachable offense for the President  of the United States to defend the asserted legal and constitutional  prerogatives of the Presidency.   This is, and I am quoting here from page 55 of the President's trial  brief, ``a function of his constitutional and policy judgments,'' not  just a policy judgment, but a constitutional judgment.   I would guide this court, as it is coming through the deliberation  process,  [[Page S584]]  to read the President's trial brief with respect to process. It was  Justice Felix Frankfurter, confidante of FDR, brilliant jurist, who  reminded America that the history of liberty is in large measure the  history of process, procedure.   In particular, I would guide the high court to the discussion of the  long history of the House of Representatives--over two centuries--in  providing due process protections in its impeachment investigations. It  is a richly historical discussion.   The good news is, you can read the core of it in four pages, pages 62  to 66, of the trial brief. It puts in bold relief, I believe, an  irrefutable fact. This House of Representatives, with all respect,  sought to turn its back on its own established procedures--procedures  that have been followed faithfully decade after decade, regardless of  who was in control, regardless of political party. All those procedures  were torn asunder and all over the vigorous objections of the unanimous  and vocal minority.   I need not remind this high court that in this country, minority  rights are important. Minority rights should be protected. Equal  justice.   But, then again, the House Members took no oath to be impartial. The  Constitution didn't require them to say by oath or affirmation: We will  do impartial judgment--justice. When they chose to tear asunder their  procedures, they were oathless. They could toss out their own rule book  through raw power.   Here we have--tragically for the country and, I believe, tragically  for the House of Representatives--in article II of these impeachment  articles a runaway House. It has run away not only from its  longstanding procedures; it has run away from the Constitution's demand  of fundamental fairness captured in those hallowed terms, ``due process  of law.'' We have cared about this as an English-speaking people since  the Magna Carta.   By doing so, however, the House has inadvertently pointed this court  to an exit ramp. It is an exit ramp provided by the Constitution  itself. It is an exit ramp built by the most noble of builders, the  founding generation. Despite the clearest precedent requiring due  process for the accused in an impeachment inquiry but, surely, all the  more so in a Presidential impeachment, House Democrats chose to conduct  a wholly unprecedented process in this case, and they did so knowingly  and deliberately because they were warned at every turn: Don't do it.  Don't do it that way.    And process--the process of being denied the basic rights that have  been afforded to every single accused President in the history of the  Republic, even to the racist Andrew Johnson seeking to undo Mr.  Lincoln's great legacy--he got those rights--but not here. Due process  could have been honored; basic rights could have been honored. The  House rules, the House's traditions could have been honored, but what  is done is done. These two articles come before this court, this High  Court of Impeachment, dripping with fundamental process violations.   The courts--and you are the court--are confronted with this kind of  phenomenon, a train of fairness violations. Courts of this country do  the right thing. They do impartial justice. They invoke, figuratively  or literally, the words of the preamble to America's Constitution. The  very first order of our government after ``to form a more perfect  Union'' is to ``establish Justice''--to ``establish justice.'' Even  before getting to the words to ``provide for the common Defense, to  promote the general Welfare, to insure domestic Tranquility,'' the  Constitution speaks in terms of justice--establishing justice.   Courts would not allow this. They would not allow this because--why?  They knew, and they know, that the purpose of our founding instrument  is to protect our liberties, to safeguard us, but to safeguard us as  individuals against the powers of government. Why? In the benedictory  words of the preamble, to ``secure the Blessings of Liberty to  ourselves and our Posterity.'' Liberty under law.   I thank the court.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, House  managers: Judge Starr laid out before you the solemn nature of these  proceedings. I want to contrast the solemn nature of these proceedings  and what has been laid out before us from both a historical and  constitutional perspective.   I want you to think about this, to history, the importance and  solemnity of what we are engaged in in this body, with what took place  in the House of Representatives upon the signing of Articles of  Impeachment--pens distributed to the impeachment managers. A  celebratory moment--think about that; think about this--a poignant  moment.   We are next going to address a factual analysis. To briefly reflect,  my colleague, the Deputy White House Counsel, Mike Purpura, will be  joining us in a moment to discuss more of the facts, to continue the  discussion that we had on Saturday. But let me just recap very quickly  what was laid out on Saturday.   First, the transcript shows that the President did not condition  either security assistance or a meeting on anything. The paused  security assistance funds aren't even mentioned on the call.   Second, President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials repeatedly  said there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review  anything.   Third, President Zelensky and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did  not even know the security assistance was paused until the end of  August, over a month after the July 25 call.   Fourth, not a single witness testified that the President himself  said that there was any connection between any investigation, security  assistance, a Presidential meeting, or anything else.   Fifth, the security assistance flowed on September 11, and a  Presidential meeting took place on September 25 without the Ukrainian  Government--without the Ukrainian Government--announcing any  investigations.   Finally, in the blind drive to impeach the President, President  Trump, in reality, strategically, has been the best friend and  supporter of Ukraine, certainly, in our recent history. These are the  facts. That is what is before you.    Deputy White House Counsel Mike Purpura will now address additional  facts related to these proceedings.   Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, good  afternoon. I would inform the leader that I believe we will be ready to  take a break at the conclusion of my remarks, if it meets with his  approval.   On Saturday, we walked through some of the evidence that the House  managers put forward and didn't put forward during their 21-plus hours  of presentation. The evidence that we recounted was drawn directly from  the House managers' own record, the case they chose to submit to this  Chamber.   To echo my colleague Mr. Sekulow briefly, the House managers' own  evidence shows that President Trump did not condition anything on  investigations during the July 25 call with President Zelensky and did  not even mention the pause on the security assistance on the call.  President Zelensky said that he felt no pressure on the call.   President Zelensky and the top Ukrainian officials did not learn of  the pause on the security assistance until more than a month after the  July 25 call, and the House managers' own record--their record that  they developed and brought before this Chamber--reflects that anyone  who spoke with the President said that the President made clear that  there was no linkage between security assistance and investigations.   There is another category of evidence that demonstrated that the  pause on security assistance was distinct and unrelated to  investigations. The President released the aid without the Ukrainians  ever announcing any investigations or undertaking any investigations.   Here is Ambassador Sondland.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, we will take a 15- minute break.   There being no objection, at 2:52 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 3:17 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.    It is my understanding that, having consulted with the  President's lawyers, we are looking at around 6 p.m. for dinner, and we  will plow right through until 6 p.m.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   President's counsel can continue with their case.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, House managers, there has  been a lot of talk in both the briefs and in the discussions over the  last week about one of our colleagues, former mayor of New York, Rudy  Giuliani. Mayor Giuliani served as one of the leaders of the  President's defense team during the Mueller investigation. He is  mentioned 531 times--20 in the brief and about 511, give or take, in  the arguments, including the motion day.   We had a robust team that worked on the President's defense during  the Mueller probe, consisting of Mayor Giuliani, Andrew Ekonomou,  Stuart Roth, Jordan Sekulow, Ben Sisney, Mark Goldfeder, Mayor  Giuliani, of course, and Marty Raskin, as well as Jane Raskin. Jane  Serene Raskin was one of the leading attorneys on the Mueller  investigation for the defense of the President.   The issue of Mayor Giuliani has come up here in this Chamber a lot.  We thought it would be appropriate now to turn to that issue, the role  of the President's lawyer, his private counsel, in this proceeding. I  would like to yield my time, Mr. Chief Justice, to Jane Serene Raskin.   Ms. Counsel RASKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Leader McConnell,  Members of the Senate.   I expect you have heard American poet Carl Sandburg's summary of the  trial lawyer's dilemma:         If the facts are against you, argue the law. If the law is       against you, argue the facts. If the facts and the law are       against you, pound the table and yell like hell.    Well, we have heard the House managers do some table-pounding and a  little yelling, but, in the main, they have used a different tactic  here, a tactic familiar to trial lawyers, though not mentioned by Mr.  Sandburg. If both the law and the facts are against you, present a  distraction, emphasize a sensational fact or perhaps a colorful or  controversial public figure who appears on the scene, then distort  certain facts, ignore others, even when they are the most probative,  make conclusory statements, and insinuate the shiny object is far more  important than the actual facts allow; in short, divert attention from  the holes in your case.   Rudy Giuliani is the House managers' colorful distraction. He is a  household name. He is a legendary Federal prosecutor who took down the  Mafia, corrupt public officials, Wall Street racketeers. He is the  crime-busting mayor who cleaned up New York and turned it around, a  national hero, America's mayor after 9/11, and, after that, an  internationally recognized expert on fighting corruption. To be sure,  Mr. Giuliani has always been somewhat of a controversial figure for his  hard-hitting, take-no-prisoners approach, but it is no stretch to say  that he was respected by friend and foe alike for his intellect, his  tenacity, his accomplishments, and his fierce loyalty to his causes and  his country.   And then, the unthinkable happened. He publicly supported the  candidacy of President Trump--the one who was not supposed to win. And  then, in the spring of 2018, he stood up to defend the President-- successfully, it turns out--against what we all now know is the real  debunked conspiracy theory; that the Trump campaign colluded with  Russia during the 2016 campaign. The House managers would have you  believe that Mr. Giuliani is at the center of this controversy. They  have anointed him the proxy villain of the tale, the leader of a rogue  operation. Their presentations were filled with ad hominem attacks and  name-calling: cold-blooded political operative, political bagman.   But I suggest to you that he is front and center in their narrative  for one reason and one reason alone: to distract from the fact that the  evidence does not support their claims.   So what is the first tell that Mr. Giuliani's role in this may not be  all that it is cracked up to be? They didn't subpoena him to testify.  In fact, Mr. Schiff and his committee never even invited him to  testify. They took a stab at subpoenaing his documents back in  September, and when his lawyer responded with legal defenses to the  production, the House walked away. But if Rudy Giuliani is everything  they say he is, don't you think they would have subpoenaed and pursued  his testimony? Ask yourselves, why didn't they?   In fact, it appears the House committee wasn't particularly  interested in presenting you with any direct evidence of what Mayor  Giuliani did or why he did it. Instead, they ask you to rely on  hearsay, speculation, and assumption--evidence that would be  inadmissible in any court.   For example, the House managers suggest that Mr. Giuliani, at the  President's direction, demanded that Ukraine announce an investigation  of the Bidens and Burisma before agreeing to a White House visit. They  base that on a statement to that effect by Ambassador Sondland.   But what the House managers don't tell you is that Sondland admitted  he was speculating about that. He presumed that Mr. Giuliani's requests  were intended as a condition for a White House visit. Even worse, his  assumption was on thirdhand information. As he put it, the most he  could do  [[Page S589]]  is repeat what he heard through Ambassador Volker from Giuliani, whom  he presumed spoke to the President on the issue. And by the way, as Mr.  Purpura has explained, the person who was actually speaking to Mr.  Giuliani, Ambassador Volker, testified clearly that there was no  linkage between the meeting with President Zelensky and Ukrainian  investigations.   The House managers also make much of a May 23 White House meeting  during which the President suggested to his Ukraine working group,  including Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, that they should talk to  Rudy. The managers told you that President Trump gave a directive and a  demand that the group needed to work with Giuliani if they wanted him  to agree with the Ukraine policy they were proposing, but those words,  ``directive'' and ``demand,'' are misleading. They misrepresent what  the witnesses actually said.   Ambassador Volker testified that he understood, based on the meeting,  that Giuliani was only one of several sources of information for the  President, and the President simply wanted officials to speak to Mr.  Giuliani because he knows all these things about Ukraine. As Volker put  it, the President's comment was not an instruction but just a comment.  Ambassador Sondland agreed. He testified that he didn't take it as an  order, and he added that the President wasn't even specific about what  he wanted us to talk to Giuliani about.   So it may come as no surprise to you that after the May 23 meeting,  the one during which the House managers told you the President demanded  that his Ukraine team talk to Giuliani, neither Volker nor Sondland  even followed up with Mr. Giuliani until July, and the July followup by  Mr. Volker happened only because the Ukrainian Government asked to be  put in touch with him. Volker testified that President Zelensky's  senior aide, Andriy Yermak, approached him to ask to be connected to  Mr. Giuliani.   House Democrats also rely on testimony that Mayor Giuliani told  Ambassadors Volker and Sondland that, in his view, to be credible, a  Ukrainian statement on anti-corruption should specifically mention  investigations into 2016 election interference and Burisma.   But when Ambassador Volker was asked whether he knew if Giuliani was  ``conveying messages that President Trump wanted conveyed to the  Ukrainians,'' Volker said that he did not have that impression. He  believed that Giuliani was doing his own communication about what he  believed he was interested in.   But even more significant than the reliance on presumptions,  assumptions, and unsupported conclusions is the managers' failure to  place in any fair context Mr. Giuliani's actual role in exploring  Ukrainian corruption. To hear their presentation, you might think that  Mayor Giuliani had parachuted into the President's orbit in the spring  of 2019 for the express purpose of carrying out a political hit job.  They would have you believe that Mayor Giuliani was only there to dig  up dirt against former Vice President Biden because he might be  President Trump's rival in the 2020 election.   Of course, Mr. Giuliani's intent is no small matter here. It is a  central and essential premise of the House managers' case that Mr.  Giuliani's motive in investigating Ukrainian corruption and  interference in the 2016 election was an entirely political one,  undertaken at the President's direction. But what evidence have the  managers actually offered you to support that proposition? On close  inspection, it turns out virtually none. They just say it over and over  and over.   And they offer you another false dichotomy. Either Mr. Giuliani was  acting in an official capacity to further the President's foreign  policy objectives or he was acting as the President's personal  attorney, in which case, they conclude, ipse dixit, his motive would  only be to further the President's political objectives.   The House managers then point to various of Mr. Giuliani's public  statements in which he is clear and completely transparent about the  fact that he is, indeed, the President's personal attorney. There you  have it. Giuliani admits he is acting as the President's personal  attorney, and therefore he had to have been acting with a political  motive to influence the 2020 election. No other option, right? Wrong.  There is, of course, another obvious answer to the question, what  motivated Mayor Giuliani to investigate the possible involvement of  Ukrainians in the 2016 election? The House managers know what the  answer is. It is in plain sight, and Mr. Giuliani has told any number  of news outlets exactly when and why he became interested in the issue.   It had nothing to do with the 2020 election. Mayor Giuliani began  investigating Ukraine corruption and interference in the 2020 election  way back in November of 2018--a full 6 months before Vice President  Biden announced his candidacy and 4 months before the release of the  Mueller report, when the biggest false conspiracy theory in circulation  that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia during the 2016  campaign was still in wide circulation.   As The Hill reported: ``As President Trump's highest profile defense  attorney, the former New York City mayor, often known simply as `Rudy,'  believed the Ukrainians' evidence could assist in his defense against  the Russia collusion investigation and former Special Counsel Robert  Mueller's final report.''   So Giuliani began to check things out in late 2018 and early 2019.   The genesis of Mayor Giuliani's investigation was also reported by  numerous other media outlets, including CNN, which related that  Giuliani's role in Ukraine could be traced back to November 2018, when  he was contacted by someone he describes as a well-known investigator.  The Washington Post and many other news outlets reported the same  information.   So, yes, Mayor Giuliani was President Trump's personal attorney, but  he was not on a political errand. As he has stated repeatedly and  publicly, he was doing what good defense attorneys do. He was following  a lead from a well-known private investigator. He was gathering  evidence regarding Ukrainian election interference to defend his client  against the false allegations being investigated by Special Counsel  Mueller, but the House managers didn't even allude to that possibility.  Instead, they just repeated their mantra that Giuliani's motive was  purely political. That speaks volumes about the bias with which they  have approached their mission.   The bottom line is, Mr. Giuliani defended President Trump vigorously,  relentlessly, and publicly throughout the Mueller investigation and in  the nonstop congressional investigations that followed, including the  attempted Mueller redo by the House Judiciary Committee, which the  managers would apparently like to sneak in the back door here.   The House managers may not like his style--you may not like his  style--but one might argue that he is everything Clarence Darrow said a  defense lawyer must be--outrageous, irreverent, blasphemous, a rogue, a  renegade. The fact is, in the end, after a 2-year siege on the  Presidency, two inspector general reports, and a $32 million special  counsel investigation, it turns out Rudy was spot-on.   It seems to me we are keeping score on who got it right on  allegations of FISA abuse, egregious misconduct at the highest level of  the FBI, alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and  supposed obstruction of justice in connection with the special  counsel's investigation. The score is Mayor Giuliani 4, Mr. Schiff 0.  But in this trial, in this moment, Mr. Giuliani is just a minor  player--that shiny object designed to distract you.   Senators, I urge you most respectfully: Do not be distracted.   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   I yield back to Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, and  House managers, we are going to now move to a section dealing with the  law. There are two issues in particular that my colleague Pat Philbin,  the Deputy White House Counsel, will be addressing, issues involving  due process and legal issues specifically dealing with the second  Article of Impeachment: Obstruction of Congress. So I yield my time  now, Mr. Chief Justice, to Mr. Philbin.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, Majority Leader  McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer, the other day, as we opened our  presentation, I touched on two areas: some of  [[Page S590]]  the due process violations that characterized the proceedings in the  House and some of the fundamental mischaracterizations and errors that  underpinned the House Democrats' charge for obstruction. I will  complete the presentation today on those points to round out some of  the fundamentally unfair procedures that were used in the House and  their implications in this proceeding before you now and also address  in detail the purported charges of obstruction in the second Article of  Impeachment.   On due process, there are three fundamental errors that affected the  proceedings in the House. The first is, as I explained on Saturday, the  impeachment inquiry was unauthorized and unconstitutional from the  beginning.   No committee of the House has the power to launch an inquiry under  the House's impeachment power unless the House itself has taken a vote  to give that authority to a committee. I noted that, in cases such as  Rumely v. United States and United States v. Watkins, the Supreme Court  has set out these principles, general principles derived from the  Constitution, which assign authority to each Chamber of the legislative  branch--to the House and to the Senate--but not to individual members  or to subcommittees. For an authority of the House to be transferred to  a committee, the House has to vote on that.    The DC Circuit has distilled the principles from those cases this  way: ``To issue a valid subpoena, a committee or a subcommittee must  conform strictly to the resolution establishing its investigatory  powers.'' That was the problem here in that there was no such  resolution. There was no vote from the House authorizing the issuance  of subpoenas under the impeachment power. So this inquiry began with  nearly two dozen invalid subpoenas. The Speaker had the House proceed  on nothing more than a press conference in which she purported to  authorize committees to begin an impeachment power. Under the  Constitution, she lacked that authority.   As the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Peter Rodino,  pointed out during the Nixon impeachment inquiry:         Such a resolution [from the House] has always been passed       by the House. . . . It is a necessary step if we are to meet       our obligation.    So we began this process with unauthorized subpoenas that imposed no  compulsion on the executive branch to respond with documents or  witnesses. I will be coming back to that point, that threshold  foundational point, when we get to the obstruction charge.   The second fundamental due process error is that the House Democrats  denied the President basic due process required by the Constitution and  by the fundamental principles of fairness in the procedures that they  used for the hearings. I am not going to go back in detail over those.  As we heard from Judge Starr, the House Democrats essentially abandoned  the principles that have governed impeachment inquiries in the House  for over 150 years. I will touch on just a few points and respond to a  couple of points that the House managers have made.   The first is that, in denying due process rights, the House  proceedings were a huge reversal from the positions the House Democrats  themselves had taken in the recent past, particularly in the Clinton  impeachment proceeding.   I believe we have Manager Nadler's description of what was required.  Perhaps not. Manager Nadler was explaining that due process requires at  a minimum notice of the charges against you, the right to be  represented by counsel, the right to cross-examine witnesses against  you, and the right to present evidence. All of those rights were denied  to the President.   Now, one of the responses that the managers have made to the defect  that we pointed out in the secret proceedings, where Manager Schiff  began these hearings in the basement bunker, is that, well, that was  really just best investigative practice; they were operating like a  grand jury. Don't be fooled by that. Those hearings operated nothing  like a grand jury.   A grand jury has secrecy primarily for two reasons: to protect the  direction of the investigation so others won't know what witnesses are  being called in and what they are saying--to keep that secret for the  prosecutor to be able to keep developing the evidence--and to protect  the accused because the accused might not ever be indicted.   In this case, all of that information was made public every day. The  House Democrats destroyed any legitimate analogy to a grand jury,  because that was all public. They made no secret that the President was  the target. They issued vile calumnies about him every day. They didn't  keep the direction of their investigation secret. Their witness lists  were published daily, and the direction of the investigation was open.  The testimony that took place was selectively leaked to a compliant  media to establish a false narrative about the President.   If that sort of conduct had occurred in a real grand jury, that would  have been a criminal violation. Prosecutors can't do that. Under rule  6(e) of the Federal criminal rules, it is a criminal offense to be  leaking what takes place in a grand jury.   Also, the grand jury explanation provides no rationale whatsoever for  this second round of hearings. Remember, after the basement bunker-- after the secret hearings where the testimony was prescreened--then the  same witnesses who had already been deposed were put on in a public  hearing where the President was still excluded.   Ask yourself, what was the reason for that? In every prior  Presidential impeachment in the modern era where there have been public  hearings, the President has been represented by counsel and could  cross-examine witnesses. Why did there have to be public, televised  hearings where the President was excluded? That was nothing more than a  show trial.   I also addressed the other day the House managers' contention that  they had offered the President due process; that when things reached  the third round of hearings in front of the House Judiciary Committee,  Manager Nadler offered the President due process. I explained why that  was illusory. There was no genuine offer there because, before any  hearings began, other than the law professor's seminar on December 4,  the Speaker had already determined the outcome, had already said there  were going to be Articles of Impeachment, and the Judiciary Committee  had informed the counsel's office that they had no plans to call any  fact witnesses or have any factual hearings whatsoever. It was all  done. It was locked in. It was baked.   There was something else hanging over that when they had purportedly  offered to allow the President some due process rights, and that was a  special provision in the rules for the House Judiciary Committee  proceedings--also unprecedented--that allowed the House Judiciary  Committee to deny the President any due process rights at all if he  continued to refuse to turn over documents or not allow witnesses to  testify, so that if the President didn't give up his privileges and  immunities that he had been asserting over executive branch  confidentiality--if he didn't comply with what the House Democrats  wanted--then it was up to Chairman Nadler, potentially, to say: No  rights at all. There is a term for that in the law. It is called an  unconstitutional condition. You can't condition someone's exercise of  some rights on his surrendering other constitutional rights. You can't  say: We will let you have due process in this way if you waive your  constitutional privilege on another issue.    The last point I will make about due process is this: It is important  to remember that due process is enshrined in the Bill of Rights for a  reason. It is not that process is just an end in itself. Instead, it is  a deep-seated belief in our legal tradition that fair process is  essential for accurate decision making.   Cross-examination of witnesses, in particular, is one of the most  important procedural protections for any American. The Supreme Court  has explained that, for over 250 years, our legal tradition has  recognized cross-examination as the greatest legal engine ever invented  for the discovery of truth.   So why do House Democrats jettison every precedent and every  principle of due process in the way they devise these hearing  procedures? Why did they devise a process that kept the President  blocked out of any hearings for 71 of the 78 days of the so-called  investigation?  [[Page S591]]    I would submit because their process was never about finding truth.  Their process was about achieving a predetermined outcome on a  timetable and having it done by Christmas, and that is what they  achieved.   Now, the third fundamental due process error is that the whole  foundation of these proceedings was also tainted beyond repair because  an interested fact witness supervised and limited the course of the  factual discovery, the course of the hearings. I explained the other  day that Manager Schiff had a reason, potentially, because of his  office's contact with the so-called whistleblower and what was  discussed and how the complaint was framed, which all remained secret,  to limit inquiry into that, which is relevant.   The whistleblower began this whole process. His bias, his motive, why  he was doing it, what his sources were--that is relevant to understand  what generated this whole process, but there was no inquiry into that.   So what conclusion does this all lead to--all of these due process  errors that have infected the proceeding up to now?   I think it is important to recognize the right conclusion is not that  this body, this Chamber, should try to redo everything--to start  bringing in new evidence, bring in witnesses because the President  wasn't allowed witnesses below and redo the whole process. And that is  for a couple of reasons.   One is, first, as my colleagues have demonstrated, despite the one- sided, unfair process in the House, the record that the House Democrats  collected through that process already shows that the President did  nothing wrong. It already exonerates the President.   But the second and more important reason is because of the  institutional implications it would have for this Chamber. Whatever  precedent is set, whatever this body accepts now as a permissible way  to bring an impeachment proceeding and to bring it to this Chamber  becomes the new normal. And if the new normal is going to be that there  can be an impeachment proceeding in the House that violates due  process, that doesn't provide the President or another official being  impeached due process rights, that fails to conduct a thorough  investigation, that doesn't come here with facts established, that then  this body should become the investigatory body and start redoing what  the House didn't do and finding new witnesses and doing things over and  getting new evidence, then, that is going to be the new normal, and  that will be the way that this Chamber has to function, and there will  be a lot more impeachments coming because it is a lot easier to do an  impeachment if you don't have to follow due process and then come here  and expect the Senate to do the work that the House didn't do.   I submit that is not the constitutional function of this Chamber  sitting as a Court of Impeachment, and this Chamber should not put its  imprimatur on a process in the House that would force this Chamber to  take on that role.   Now, I will move on to the charge of obstruction in the second  Article of Impeachment.   Accepting that Article of Impeachment would fundamentally damage  separation of powers under the Constitution by permanently altering the  relationship between the executive and the legislative branches. In the  second article, House Democrats are trying to impeach the President for  resisting legally defective demands for information by asserting  established legal defenses and immunities based on legal advice from  the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel. In essence, the  approach here is that House Democrats are saying: When we demand  documents, the executive branch must comply immediately, and the  assertions of privilege or defenses to our subpoenas are further  evidence of obstruction. We don't have to go through the  constitutionally mandated accommodations process to work out an  acceptable solution with the executive branch. We don't have to go to  the courts to establish the validity of our subpoenas.   At one point, Manager Schiff said that anything that makes the House  even contemplate litigation is evidence of obstruction. Instead, the  House claims it can jump straight to impeachment.   What this really means, in this case, is that they are saying for the  President to defend the prerogatives of his office, to defend the  constitutionally grounded principles of executive branch privileges of  immunities is an impeachable offense.   If this Chamber accepts that premise, that what has been asserted  here constitutes an impeachable offense, it will forever damage the  separation of powers. It will undermine the independence of the  executive and destroy the bounds between the legislative and executive  branches that the Framers crafted in the Constitution.   As Professor Turley testified before the House Judiciary Committee,  ``basing impeachment on this obstruction theory would itself be an  abuse of power . . . by Congress.''    And I would like to go through that and unpack and explain something.  I will start by outlining what the Trump administration actually did in  response to subpoenas, because there are three different actions--three  different legally based assertions for resisting different subpoenas  that the Trump administration made.   I pointed out on Saturday that there has been this constant refrain  from the House Democrats that there was just blanket defiance, blanket  obstruction, as if it were unexplained obstruction--just, we won't  cooperate with that warrant. And that is not true. There were very  specific legal grounds provided, and each one was supported by an  opinion from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel.   So the first is executive branch officials declined to comply with  subpoenas that had not been authorized, and that is the point I made at  the beginning. There was no vote from the House. Without a vote from  the House, the subpoenas that were issued were not authorized. And I  pointed out that in an October 18 letter from White House Counsel that  specific ground was explained.   And it wasn't just from the White House counsel. There were other  letters. On the screen now is an October 15 letter from OMB, which  explains:         Absent a delegation by a House rule or a resolution of the       House, none of your committees have been delegated       jurisdiction to conduct an investigation pursuant to the       impeachment power under article I, section 2 of the       Constitution.    The letter went on to explain that legal rationale--not blanket  defiance. There were specific exchanges of letters explaining these  legal grounds for resisting.   The second ground, the second principle that the Trump administration  asserted was that some of these subpoenas purported to require the  President's senior advisers, his close advisers, to testify.   Following at least 50 years of precedent, the Department of Justice's  Office of Legal Counsel advised that three senior advisers to the  President--the Acting White House Chief of Staff, the Legal Advisor to  the National Security Council, and the Deputy National Security  Advisor--were absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony.  And based on that advice from the Office of Legal Counsel, the  President directed those advisers not to testify.   Administrations of both political parties have asserted this immunity  since the 1970s. President Obama asserted it as to the Director of the  Office of Political Strategy and Outreach. President George W. Bush  asserted it as to his former counsel and to his White House Chief of  Staff. President Clinton asserted it as to two of his counsel.  President Reagan asserted it as to his counsel, Fred Fielding, and  President Nixon asserted it. This is not something that was just made  up recently. There is a decades-long history of the Department of  Justice providing the opinion that senior advisers to the President are  immune from compelled congressional testimony, and it is the same  principle that was asserted here.   There are important rationales behind this immunity. One is that the  President's most senior advisers are essentially his alter egos, and  allowing Congress to subpoena them and compel them to come testify  would be tantamount to allowing Congress to subpoena the President and  force him to come testify, but that in separation of powers would not  be tolerated. Congress could no more do that with the  [[Page S592]]  President than the President could force Members of Congress to come to  the White House and answer to him.   There is also a second and important rationale behind this immunity,  and that relates to executive privilege. The immunity protects the same  interests that underlie executive privilege. The Supreme Court has  recognized executive privilege that protects the confidentiality of the  communications with the President and deliberations within his  executive branch. As the Court put it in United States v. Nixon, ``The  privilege is fundamental to the operation of government and  inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the  Constitution.''   So the Supreme Court has recognized the executive needs this  privilege to be able to function. It is rooted in the separation of  powers.   As Attorney General Janet Reno advised President Clinton, ``immunity  such advisers enjoy from testimonial compulsion by a congressional  committee is absolute and may not be overborne by competing  congressional interests.''   So that is Attorney General Janet Reno advising President Clinton.  This is not a partisan issue. This is not a Republican or Democrat  issue. Administrations of both parties have asserted this principle of  immunity for senior advisers.   And why does it matter? It matters because the Supreme Court has  explained that the fundamental principle behind executive privilege is  that it is necessary to have confidentiality in communications and  deliberations in order to have good and worthwhile deliberations, in  order to have people provide their candid advice to the President.  Because if they knew that what they were going to say was going to be  on the front page of the Washington Post the next day or the next week,  they wouldn't tell the President what they actually thought. If you  want to have good decision making, there has to be that zone of  confidentiality.   This is the way the Supreme Court put it: ``Human experience teaches  that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well  temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own  interests to the detriment of the decision-making process.''   That was also from United States v. Nixon.   So those are exactly the interests that are protected by having  senior advisers to the President be immune from compelled congressional  testimony. Because once someone is compelled to sit in the witness seat  and start answering questions, it is very hard for them to protect that  privilege, to make sure that they don't start revealing something that  was discussed.   So for a small circle of those close to the President, for the past  40 to 50 years, administrations of both parties have insisted on this  principle.   Now, the other night, House managers, when we were here very late  last week, suggested that executive privilege was a distraction, and  Manager Nadler called it ``nonsense.''   Not at all--it is a principle recognized by the Supreme Court--a  constitutional principle grounded in separation of powers.   They also asserted that this immunity has been rejected by every  court that has addressed it, as if to make it seem that lots of courts  have addressed this. They have all said that this theory just doesn't  fly. That is not accurate. That is not true.   In fact, in most instances, once the President asserts immunity for a  senior adviser, the accommodations process between the executive branch  and the legislature begins, and there is usually some compromise to  allow, perhaps, some testimony, not in open hearing but in a closed  hearing or a deposition, perhaps to provide some other information  instead of live testimony. There is a compromise.   But in the only two times it has been litigated, district courts, it  is true, rejected the immunity. One was in a case involving former  counsel to George W. Bush, Harriet Miers. The district court rejected  the immunity, but immediately on appeal, the Court of Appeals of the DC  Circuit stayed that decision. And that decision means--to stay that  district court decision--that the appellate court thought there was a  likelihood of success on appeal, that the executive branch might  succeed, or, at a minimum, that the issue of immunity presented  ``questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult, and  doubtful as to make them a fair ground for litigation.'' The first  decision was stayed.   The second district court decision is still being litigated right  now. It is the McGahn case that the House has brought, trying to get  testimony from former counsel to President Trump, Donald McGahn. That  case was just argued in the DC Circuit on January 3. So there is no  established law suggesting that this immunity somehow has been rejected  by the court. It is still being litigated right now. It is an immunity  that is a standard principle asserted by every administration in both  parties for the past 40 years. Asserting that principle cannot be  treated as obstruction of Congress.   The third action that the President took--the administration took-- related to the fact that House Democrats' subpoenas tried to shut out  executive branch counsel, agency counsel from the depositions of  executive branch employees. Now, the Office of Legal Counsel concluded  that congressional committees may not bar agency counsel from assisting  an executive branch witness without contravening the legitimate  prerogatives of the executive branch and that attempting to enforce a  subpoena while barring agency counsel would be ``unconstitutional.''   The President relied on that legal advice here. As Judge Starr  pointed out, the President was consulting with the Department of  Justice, receiving advice from the very respected Office of Legal  Counsel, and following that advice about the constitutional  prerogatives of his office and the constitutional prerogatives of the  executive branch. Again, administrations of both political parties have  recognized the important role that agency counsel plays.   In the Obama administration, the Office of Legal Counsel stated that  the exclusion of agency counsel ``could potentially undermine . . . the  President's constitutional authority to consider and assert executive  privilege where appropriate.''   So why is agency counsel important?   As I tried to explain, the executive privilege of confidentiality for  communications with the President for internal deliberative  communications of the executive branch--those are important legal  rights. They are necessary for the proper functioning of the executive  branch, and the agency counsel is essential to protect those legal  rights.   When an individual employee goes in to testify, he or she might not  know--probably would not know--where is the line for what is covered by  executive privilege or deliberative process privilege--not things the  employees necessarily know, and their personal counsel, even if they  are permitted to have their personal counsel with them--same thing.  Most personal attorneys for employees don't know the finer points of  executive branch confidentiality interests or deliberative process  privilege. It is also not their job to protect those interests. They  are the personal lawyer for the employee who is testifying, trying to  protect that employee from potential legal consequences.   We usually have lawyers to protect legal rights, so it makes sense  when there is an important legal and constitutionally based right at  stake--the executive privilege--that there should be a lawyer there to  protect that right for the executive branch, and that is the principle  that the Office of Legal Counsel enjoys.   This also doesn't raise any insurmountable problems for congressional  investigations for finding information. In fact, just as recently as  April of 2019, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform  reached an accommodation with the Trump administration after the  administration had declined to make someone available for a deposition  because of the lack of agency counsel. That issue was worked out and  accommodation was made, and there was some testimony provided in other  circumstances. So it doesn't always result in the kind of escalation  that was seen here--straight to impeachment. The accommodation process  can work things out.   House Democrats have pointed to a House rule that excludes agency  counsel, but, of course, that House rule cannot override a  constitutional privilege.  [[Page S593]]    So those are the three principles that the Trump administration  asserted. Now I would like to turn to the claim that somehow the  assertion of these principles created an impeachable offense.   The idea that asserting defenses and immunity--legal defenses and  immunity in response to subpoenas, acting on advice of the Department  of Justice--is an impeachable offense is absurd and is dangerous for  our government. Let me explain why.   House Democrats' obstruction theory is wrong first and foremost  because, in a government of laws, asserting privileges and rights to  resist compulsion is not obstruction; it is a fundamental right. In  Bordenkircher v. Hayes, the Supreme Court explains that to ``punish a  person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a  due process violation of the most basic sort, and for an agent of the  State to pursue a course of action whose objective is to penalize a  person's reliance on his legal rights is patently unconstitutional.''   This is a principle that in the past, in the Clinton impeachment, was  recognized across the board, that it would be improper to suggest that  asserting rights is an impeachable offense. Harvard law professor  Laurence Tribe said: ``The allegation that invoking privileges and  otherwise using the judicial system to shield information . . . is an  abuse of power that should lead to impeachment and removal from office  is not only frivolous, but also dangerous.''    Manager Nadler said that the use of a legal privilege is not illegal  or impeachable itself--a legal privilege, executive privilege. Minority  Leader Schumer, in the Clinton impeachment, expressed the same view:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, I think we are looking at a 45- minute break for dinner.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess.   There being no objection, at 6:01 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 6:48 p.m., and thereupon  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate will come to order. Ready to proceed?   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Yes, sir.   Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, House managers, we are  going to do two things this evening. We are going to first hear from  former independent counsel Robert Ray. He is going to discuss issues of  how he was involved in the investigation, the legal issues, some of the  history of how that works, and then we will conclude this evening with  a presentation from Professor Dershowitz.   With that, I yield my time, Mr. Chief Justice, to Robert Ray.   Mr. Counsel RAY. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate,  distinguished House managers, and may it please this Court of  Impeachment, I stand before you today in defense of my fellow  Americans, who in November 2016 elected Donald Trump to serve the  people as their President. Their reasons for that vote were as varied  as any important decisions are, but their collective judgment, accepted  as legitimate under our Constitution, is deserving of my respect and  yours.   For only the third time in our Nation's history, the Senate is  convened to try the President of the United States on Articles of  Impeachment. Those articles do not allege crimes. The Constitution, the  Framers' intent, and historical practice all dictate that well-founded  Articles of Impeachment allege both that a high crime has been  committed, and that, as such, removal from office is warranted only  when such an offense also constitutes an abuse of the public trust;  that is, in the case of the President, a violation of his oath of  office. Both are required and neither one, by clear and unmistakable  evidence, is shown here by these Articles of Impeachment.   I am here this evening in this Chamber distinctly privileged to  represent and defend the President of the United States on the facts,  on the law, and on the constitutional principles that must be paramount  to you, Members of the Senate, in deciding the great question of  whether these articles warrant, with or without witnesses, the removal  of the President from office.   Because there is and can be no basis in these articles on which the  Senate can or should convict a President on what is alleged, the  President must not be removed from office. That judgment is reserved to  the people in the ordinary course of elections, the next of which is  just over 9 months away.   Now, 40 years ago, in 1980, I first came to Capitol Hill as a  legislative intern for a Congressman who only 6 years earlier had  played an important and critical role in the impeachment proceedings  against President Richard Nixon. The Congressman of whom I speak, whom  I came to respect immensely, served then, in 1974, in the House  Judiciary Committee. He was tasked in the summer of 1974, together with  his colleagues, in evaluating and voting on, as most of the House  managers here have, Articles of Impeachment. Those articles included  the crime of obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and obstruction of  Congress. But unlike how House managers--and, indeed, the entire  House--45 years later in December 2019 proceeded here, bipartisan  consensus in 1974, among both House Democrats and House Republicans,  was the order of the day. Indeed, it became apparent then, that narrow  partisan views aside, the House Judiciary Committee would step into the  breach only insofar as evidence of criminal Presidential conduct  warranted.    The tapes of Oval Office conversations involving the President  provided that evidence. The Supreme Court, in effect, overruled the  claim of executive privilege and ordered the release of the tapes to  the House Judiciary Committee.   As a result, 3 days later, the high crime of obstruction of justice,  including suborning perjury tethered to a second Article of Impeachment  2 days after that, alleging abuse of power, was approved by the House  Judiciary Committee by a vote of 27 to 11 and 28 to 10, respectively.   The second Article of Impeachment alleged, among other things,  unlawful use of the CIA and its resources, including covert activity in  the United States and interference with the law enforcement actions of  the FBI to advance the coverup; that is, the criminal conspiracy to  obstruct justice charge in the first Article of Impeachment.   The crimes alleged were serious, involving unlawful electronic  surveillance of an opposing political party, paying hush money out of a  White House safe to burglars and other coconspirators to silence  cooperation with law enforcement, and attempts to alter testimony under  oath.   Six Republican House committee members joined all 21 Democrats in  supporting those two articles. My Congressman was among those six  Republican House Members. Another one of the six was then a young  Congressman from Maine, who later became a Member of this body, serving  with distinction as a Senator and later as President Bill Clinton's  Secretary of Defense. That young Congressman was Bill Cohen. A third of  the six was Representative Caldwell Butler, a Republican from Virginia,  whose papers are housed at Washington and Lee University in Lexington,  VA, in the State where I grew up and where I later went to law school.   Together, these six Republicans made history. They did so with no  sense of triumph--in today's parlance, no fist bumps--but in the words  of my Congressman, only ``with deep reluctance'' and only because the  evidence was clear and unmistakable of unlawful activities by the  President in a criminal coverup that was--in the concluding language of  the first Article of Impeachment--``contrary to his trust as  President.''   As to the third article in the Nixon impeachment, that article  charging obstruction of Congress did not enjoy bipartisan support but  instead was voted  [[Page S605]]  on by the House Judiciary Committee along party lines by a vote of 21  to 17. Republicans objected then to the third article in the face of  the President's good-faith prior claim to executive privilege by  withholding certain evidence until such time as the matter was  definitively resolved by the Supreme Court.   My point in mentioning these three votes by the House Judiciary  Committee is simply this: Count votes, and do the math. I understand  that you all have been deprived of your phones and, thus, a calculator  app, so I will do it for you.   A 27-to-11 vote was not only bipartisan, as I have indicated, but  overwhelmingly so--indeed, over 70 percent; that is to say, greater  than a two-thirds supermajority.   That vote sent a powerful signal to the full House and indeed the  Senate that impeachment was overwhelmingly bipartisan and, therefore,  politically and legally legitimate.   President Nixon's fate was sealed, and the result was inevitable.  Thus, less than 2 weeks after that initial committee vote on  impeachment, the President resigned.   During the course of those proceedings, my Congressman commented  simply and plainly that it was, in his words, ``a great American  tragedy.'' But the greater point was--and is--that impeachment was  never designed or intended to be a partisan tool and was to be  undertaken only as a last resort.   This then brings me to what was intended by the Framers of the  Constitution relative to impeachment. That subject will be addressed at  some length by my colleague Professor Dershowitz, but, for now, let me  just say that much has been said by House managers in reliance on  Alexander Hamilton's oft-quoted statement in Federalist No. 65. That is  the one repeatedly taken out of context and cited in favor of an  expansive scope of jurisdiction by Congress over alleged offenses.   In Hamilton's words, ``which proceed from misconduct of [a] public  [official constituting] the abuse of or violation of some public  trust.'' The irony that Hamilton--the greatest proponent in this  country of executive and Presidential authority that perhaps ever  lived--should be front and center in this partisan impeachment effort  to remove a duly elected President from office is apparently lost on  House impeachment managers. I dare say that Hamilton would roll over in  his grave at the end of Wall Street in New York City to know that,  contrary to what he explicitly acknowledged in Federalist No. 69, a  President can only be removed from office ``upon conviction of treason,  bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors.'' We should just read  the word ``crime'' right out of the impeachment clause of the  Constitution and proceed merrily along the way toward an impeachment  trial, with witnesses, no less, of a President duly elected by the  people. And for what? Articles of Impeachment that do not even allege  crimes.   President Trump is right. That course, if sustained, cheapens the  impeachment process and, thus, is an American tragedy all its own.   Indeed, during the impeachment trial 21 years ago in January 1999,  none other than President Clinton's highly respected White House  Counsel Charles Ruff stated it best: ``To argue then, as the managers  do, that the phrase `other high crimes and misdemeanors' was really  meant to encompass a wide range of offenses . . . simply flies in the  face of the clear intent of the framers, who carefully chose their  language, knew exactly what those words meant and knew exactly what  risk they intended to promote against.''   Counsel Ruff went on to explain: One of those concerns and risks was  that ``impeachment be limited and well defined.''   For our purposes here, what is required is both that crimes be  alleged and that those crimes be of the type that, in particular, are  so serious that they--again, in Mr. Ruff's words--``subvert our system  of government and would justify overturning a popular election.''  Otherwise, what you have--in Tocqueville's words--is legislative  tyranny.   I respectfully submit, Members of the Senate, taken in its proper  context, that is what Alexander Hamilton well understood and meant, and  so did my Congressman. That Congressman was, of course, Hamilton Fish,  Jr. Actually, he was not really a junior but Hamilton Fish IV. His  great-grandfather was also Hamilton Fish, who was born in 1808, later  served as Governor of New York, a U.S. Senator immediately before the  Civil War, and, notably, as President Ulysses Grant's Secretary of  State. But at the time back in 1980, what I didn't realize--even though  now, perhaps, it is so obvious--the original Hamilton Fish was named  after his parents' best friend, none other than Alexander Hamilton  himself.    What Congressman Hamilton Fish, from the Watergate era, courageously  understood is the same historical lesson that Jeffrey A. Engel,  founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern  Methodist University, has written about in a coauthored 2018 book on  impeachment:   The charge must be treason, bribery or other high crimes and  misdemeanors. It must be one for which clear and unmistakable proof can  be produced. Only if the evidence actually produced against the  President is indeed irrefutable such that his own constituents--in this  case, the 63 million people, like me, who voted for President Trump-- accept his guilt of the offense charged in order to overwhelmingly  persuade a supermajority of Americans, and, thus, their Senators, of  malfeasance, warranting his removal from office.   And, finally, because it is the President of the United States, after  all, that we are talking about here, the repository of and entrusted  under the Constitution with all of the executive power of the United  States--in other words, an entire branch of government--removal from  office cannot be based upon an impeachable offense or offenses which  are, in essence, nothing more than--paraphrasing President Gerald Ford  now--whatever a partisan majority of the House of Representatives  considers them to be.   To supplement that cited statement 50 years ago, in 1970, from then- Congressman Jerry Ford in connection with the prospect of potentially  impeaching a Supreme Court Justice, Ford pointedly clarified that  executive branch impeachments are different because voters can remove  the President, the Vice President, and all persons holding office at  their pleasure at least every 4 years. To remove a President in  midterm--it has been tried before and never done--would indeed, he  said, require crimes of the magnitude of treason and bribery.   Professor Akhil Amar of Yale Law School made largely the same point  during the Clinton impeachment about the danger presented through  Presidential impeachment of transforming an entire branch of  government:         When they remove a duly elected President, they undo the       votes of millions of ordinary Americans on Election Day. This       is not something that Senators should do lightly, lest we       slide toward a kind of parliamentary government that our       entire structure of government was designed to repudiate.    In hammering home the constitutional uniqueness of Presidential  impeachments, he emphasized the case of Richard Nixon and distinguished  it from Andrew Johnson; that is to say, only when extremely high crimes  and gross abuses of official power indeed pose a threat to our basic  constitutional system, a threat as high and truly as malignant to  democratic government as treason and bribery, he reasoned, would the  Senate ever be justified in nullifying the votes of millions of  Americans and removing a President from office.   My point is this: History--our American history--matters. To listen  to how the House managers would have it, Articles of Impeachment are  merely--as Chuck Ruff warned a generation ago--empty vessels into which  can be poured any number of charges, even those considered and  abandoned.   At least in the case of President Clinton's impeachment, the articles  actually charged crimes. The Senate thereafter determined, by its vote  in that case, in effect, that while those crimes--perjury and  obstruction of justice--may have been committed, those crimes were not  high enough crimes damaging to the body politic to warrant the  President's removal from office.   That judgment was, of course, within this body's discretion to  render, and it has been accepted as such by the country--whether you  agreed with it or  [[Page S606]]  not--as legitimate. It is also one that is historically consistent with  Hamilton's views and Madison's, too, concerning the proper scope of  impeachment as applied to a President.   When I entered the scene and succeeded my colleague and cocounsel  here, Judge Kenneth Starr, as independent counsel in October of 1999,  it was left for me to decide whether prosecution of President Clinton  following impeachment, nonetheless, was warranted, consistent with the  Department of Justice's Principles of Federal Prosecution. That matter  was exhaustively considered in the midst of a Federal grand jury  investigation that I commissioned in order to decide, first, whether  crimes, in fact, had been committed. I found that they had, and I later  said so publicly in the final report expressly authorized and mandated  by Congress concluding the Lewinsky investigation.   Significantly, though, I also determined that the prosecution of the  President, while in, or once he left office, would not be in the  national interest, given alternative available means, short of  prosecution, in order to hold the President accountable for his  conduct. Those means included a written acknowledgement by the  President 2 years after his Senate trial that his testimony under oath  before the grand jury had, in fact, been false and a related agreement  to suspend his law license.   The price paid by President Clinton was indeed high, and it stemmed,  in the end, from the need to vindicate the principle, first raised most  prominently during Watergate, that no person, including the President,  is above the law.   Despite President Clinton's subsequent protestation in his memoirs  that I was just another Federal prosecutor out to extract, in his  words, a pound of flesh, I credit the President to this day with  agreeing to do what was necessary in order to exercise my discretion  not to prosecute; namely, that for the good of the country and  recognizing the unique place that the President--indeed, any  President--occupies in our constitutional government, accountability  and discretion go hand in hand and permitted--indeed, demanded--such an  appropriate resolution. It enabled the country to move on, and it was  as much, if not more, a credit to Bill Clinton than to any credit I  received or deserved that we were able to reach agreement and avoid any  further partisan recriminations or interference with the will of the  American people in electing and reelecting President Clinton in the  first place--and his successor, President George W. Bush.   In short, I was absolutely mindful and exceedingly concerned  throughout my tenure as independent counsel that, although crimes had  been committed, Bill Clinton was the elected official placed in office  by voters throughout the Nation and head of the executive branch, and I  was not.   The lesson for me was a simple one that I am sure every American  citizen, whatever their own experience or political perspective, can  understand: Be humble and act with humility. Never be too sure that you  are right.   Today, 20 years later, what have we learned from that experience? I  fear that the answer to that question is nothing at all. If these  Impeachment Articles now are sustained beyond summary resolution in  favor of acquittal, impeachment in the future literally will mean not  only that proof of high crimes is no longer necessary to sustain the  effort but that no crime at all is sufficient so long as a partisan  majority in the House says so.   Thus, during the past 4 months alone, we have witnessed the endless  procession of legal theories used to sustain this partisan  impeachment--from treason to quid pro quo, to bribery, to extortion, to  obstruction of justice, to soliciting an illegal foreign campaign  contribution, to a violation of the Impoundment Control Act--to who  knows what all is next.   What you are left with, then, are constitutionally deficient articles  abandoning any pretense of the need to allege crimes that are another  vehicle or weapon, if you will, in order to damage the President  politically in an election year.   It is, I submit, decidedly not in the country's best interest to have  the prosecution of the grave issue of impeachment and the drastic  prospect of removal from office become just politics by other means,  any more than it would be appropriate for the huge power of prosecution  of offenses under the Federal Criminal Code to be exercised not on the  merits, without fear or favor, but instead as a raw, naked, and  pernicious exercise of partisan power and advantage.   I have spent the better part of my professional life, for over 30  years--as a Federal prosecutor for 13 years through two independent  counsel investigations and now as a defense lawyer for over 17 years-- trying my level best always to ensure that politics and prosecution do  not mix. It must not happen here. A standardless and partisan  impeachment is illegitimate and should be rejected as such  overwhelmingly by this body, I hope and submit, or alternatively and,  if need be, by only a partisan Republican majority--for the good of the  country.   Turning now to what the House managers have alleged, regarding the  first article, the House Judiciary Committee report on impeachment  contains a rather extraordinary statement. It says as follows:  ``Although President Trump's actions need not rise to the level of a  criminal violation to justify impeachment, his conduct here was  criminal.'' So, in short, we needn't bother in an Impeachment Article  charging the President with a crime, implicitly recognizing that there  is insufficient evidence to prove that such a crime was committed, but  we are going to say that the President's conduct was criminal  nonetheless. Aside from being exceedingly unfair to call something  criminal and not stand behind the allegation and actually charge it, it  just ain't so.   I have heard House Manager Hakeem Jeffries argue before this body  that he and his team have overwhelming evidence of an explicit--his  word, not mine--quid pro quo by the President; that is, an explicit,  purported, and proposed exchange by President Trump of something of  personal benefit to himself in return for an official act by the U.S.  Government.   As I have explained as far back as November of last year in a TIME  magazine cover story, the problem with this legal theory is that an  unlawful quid pro quo is limited to those arrangements that are  corrupt; that is to say, only those that are clearly and unmistakably  improper are therefore illegal. And, in the eyes of the law, the  specific, measurable benefit that an investigation--or even the  announcement of an investigation--against the Bidens might bring  President Trump is, at best, nebulous.   I should add here also that any effort to contend that this purported  thing of value also constitutes an illegal foreign campaign  contribution to the President of the United States is fraught with  doubt as a matter of law. Indeed, the Justice Department has said as  much. So, too, have courts which have struggled since at least the  early 1990s with application of the Federal anticorruption laws to  situations like this when an in-kind benefit in the form of campaign  interference or assistance is alleged to be illegal. None of this would  permit the requisite finding supported by clear and unmistakable  evidence of a violation of law necessary to sustain impeachment as an  abuse of power.   But back to Manager Jeffries' contention, proof of an explicit quid  pro quo by the President--which, parenthetically, as previously noted  by Mr. Cipollone, is nowhere to be found in the Articles of  Impeachment--would have required a very different telephone call than  the one President Trump actually had with Ukraine President Zelensky.  As I tried to explain in the TIME magazine piece, an explicit quid pro  quo for alleged improper campaign interference would have had President  Trump saying to his counterpart in Ukraine, in words or substance,  ``Here is the deal,'' and followed up by explicitly linking a demand  for an investigation of the Bidens to the provision or release of  foreign aid. None of that was said or ever happened. The call  transcript itself demonstrates that beyond any doubt. In the  President's words, read the transcript.   By the way, the demand characterization apparently creeps into this  phone call largely as the result of Army LTC Alexander Vindman's  testimony where he equates a request based  [[Page S607]]  upon his military experience, and having listened in on the call, by a  superior officer--in this case, the Commander in Chief--as the same  thing as an order in the chain of command. While all of this may be  true in the military, it goes without saying that President Zelensky,  as the leader and head of a sovereign nation, was not and is not in our  military chain of command.   I say that to you, Members of the Senate, as the son of a U.S. Army  colonel and Vietnam war veteran buried in Arlington National Cemetery  and as the father of a U.S. Army major currently serving with President  Trump's Space Force Command in Aurora, CO, near Denver.   With all due respect, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's testimony in this  regard is at best, I submit to you, distorted and unpersuasive.   Next, the purported implicit link between foreign aid and the  investigations, or the announcement of them, is weak. The most that  Ambassador Gordon Sondland was able to give was his presumption that  such a link likely existed, and that presumption was flatly  contradicted by the President's express denial of the existence of a  quid pro quo to Ambassador Sondland as well as to Senator Ron Johnson.   The President was emphatic to Ambassador Sondland. The President  said:         I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I just want       Zelensky to do the right thing, to do what he ran on.    And to Senator Johnson, the same thing, just two words: ``No way.''   Recognizing this flaw in the testimony, House managers have focused  instead on an alternate quid pro quo rationale, that the exchange was  conditioned on a foreign head-of-state meeting at the White House in  return for Ukraine publicly announcing an investigation of the Bidens.   In the House Judiciary report, it states as follows: ``It is beyond  question that official White House visits constitute a `formal exercise  of governmental power' within the meaning of McDonnell.''   Not so fast. Actually, the Supreme Court in McDonnell helpfully  boiled it down to only those acts that constitute the formal exercise  of government power and that are more specific and focused than a broad  policy objective. An exchange resulting in meetings, events, phone  calls, as those terms are typically understood as being routine,  according to the Supreme Court's definition of an official act, do not  count.   The fact that the meeting involved was a formal one, with all of the  trappings of a state visit by the President of Ukraine and hosted by  the President of the United States, makes no difference. The Supreme  Court is talking about an official act as a formal exercise of  decision-making power, not the formality of the visit. Even if the  allegation were true, this could not constitute a quid pro quo.   I should know. I argued, in effect, the contrary proposition in  United States v. Sun-Diamond before the Supreme Court over 20 years ago  in 1999. That proposition lost--unanimously. The vote was 9 to 0.   In any event, the coveted meeting--and it was, after all, just a  meeting, whether at the White House or not--was not permanently  withheld. It later happened between the two Presidents at the United  Nations in New York City at the first available opportunity in  September 2019.   Finally, the argument by Chairman Jerry Nadler that this call by  President Trump with President Zelensky represented an ``extortionate  demand'' is patently ridiculous. The essential element of the crime of  extortion is pressure. No pressure was exercised or exerted during the  call. Ukrainian officials, including President Zelensky himself, have  since repeatedly denied that any such pressure existed. Indeed, to the  contrary, the evidence strongly suggests Ukraine was perfectly capable  of resisting any efforts to entangle itself in United States domestic  party politics and partisanship.   What, then, remains of the first Article of Impeachment? No crimes  were committed. Indeed, no crimes were even formally alleged. In that  regard, what exactly is left? It is not treason. Ukraine is our ally,  not our enemy or our adversary. And Russia is not our enemy, only our  adversary. It is not bribery. There is no quid pro quo. It is not  extortion--no pressure.    It is not an illegal foreign campaign contribution. The benefit of  the announcement of an investigation is not tangible enough to  constitute an in-kind campaign contribution warranting prosecution  under Federal law.   It is also not a violation of the Impoundment Control Act. Let's take  a look at that last one for a moment, shall we. The U.S. Government  Accountability Office, an arm of the U.S. Congress, in its infinite  wisdom, has decided, contrary to the position of the executive branch  Office of Management and Budget, OMB, that while the President may  temporarily withhold funds from obligation--but not beyond the end of  the fiscal year--he may not do so with vague or general assertions of  policy priorities contrary to the will of Congress.   The President's response to this interbranch dispute between Congress  and the executive branch was to assert his authority over foreign  policy to determine the timing of the best use of funds. Ultimately,  this is a dispute that has constitutional implications under separation  of power principles, about which this body is well familiar. It pits  the President's constitutional prerogatives to control foreign policy  against Congress's reasonable expectation that the President will  comply with the Constitution's faithful execution of the law  requirement of his oath of office.   This issue has come up before with other Presidents. There is a huge  constitutional debate among legal scholars about who is right. Law  review articles have been written about it, one as recently as last  June in the Harvard Law Review.   Congress, through its arm, the GAO, had an opposing view from that of  the administration and OMB--big surprise.   I am reminded of one of President Kennedy's famous press conferences,  where he was asked to comment about a report that the Republican  National Committee had voted a resolution that concluded he was a total  failure as President. He famously quipped: ``I am sure that it was  passed unanimously.''   That is all that this is here: politics. No more, no less. And in the  end, what are we talking about? The temporary hold was lifted and the  funds were released, as they had to be under the law and as  acknowledged was required by none other than Acting Chief of Staff Mick  Mulvaney, 19 days before the end of the fiscal year on September 11,  2019.   In any event, an alleged violation of the Impoundment Act can no more  sustain an Impeachment Article than can an assertion of executive  privilege in opposition to a congressional subpoena, absent a final  decision of a court ordering compliance with that subpoena.   Mere assertion of a privilege or objection in a legitimate  interbranch dispute is a constitutional prerogative. It should never  result in an impeachable offense for abuse of power or obstruction of  Congress. And, yet, in a last-ditch effort to reframe its first Article  of Impeachment on abuse of power, House managers, as part of the House  Judiciary Committee report, have gone back into history--always a  treacherous endeavor for lawyers. They now argue that President Andrew  Johnson's impeachment, from over 150 years ago following the end of the  Civil War and during reconstruction, was not about a violation of the  Tenure of Office Act, which, after all, was the violation of law  charged as the principle Article of Impeachment but, instead, rested on  his use of power with illegitimate motives.   In an ahistorical sleight of hand worthy only of the New York Times  recent ``1619'' series--a series, by the way, roundly criticized by two  of my Princeton Civil War and reconstruction history professors as  inaccurate--House managers now claim that President Johnson's removal  of Lincoln's Secretary of War Edwin Stanton without Congress's  permission in violation of a congressional statute, later found to be  unconstitutional, is best understood with the benefit of revisionist  hindsight to be motivated not by his desire to violate the statute but  on his illegitimate use of power to undermine reconstruction and  subordinate African Americans following the Civil War.   That all may be true, but it is another thing altogether to claim  that that motive actually was the basis of Johnson's impeachment.  Professor Laurence Tribe, who was the source for this misguided  reinterpretation of the Johnson impeachment, simply substitutes his own  self-described, far  [[Page S608]]  more compelling basis for Johnson's removal from office from the one  that the House of Representatives actually voted on and the Senate  considered at his impeachment trial.   There has been an awful lot of that going on in this impeachment-- people substituting their own interpretations for the ones that the  principles actually and explicitly insist on.   At any rate, a President's so-called illegitimate motives in wielding  power can no more frame and legitimize the Johnson impeachment than  recasting the Nixon impeachment as really about his motives in defying  Congress over the country's foreign policy in Vietnam. Again, all of  that may be true, but it has nothing to do with impeachment. Not only  that, it is also bad history.   As recognized 65 years ago by then-Senator John F. Kennedy in his  book ``Profiles in Courage,'' President Johnson was saved from removal  from office by one vote and thus by one courageous Senator who  recognized the legislative overreach that the Tenure of Office Act  represented.   Quoting now from Senator Edmund G. Ross in ``Profiles in Courage,''  who explained his vote as follows:         The independence of the executive office as a coordinate       branch of the government was on trial. . . . If . . . the       President must step down . . . upon insufficient proofs and       from partisan considerations, the office of President would       be degraded.    So, too, here. Contrary, apparently to the fashion now, Senator  Ross's action eventually was praised and accepted several decades after  his service and again many years later by President Kennedy as a  courageous stand against legislative mob rule. Professor Dershowitz  will have more to say about one other courageous Senator from that  impeachment. More on that later.   For now, the point is that our history demonstrates that Presidents  should not be subject to impeachment based upon bad or ill motives, and  any thought to the contrary should strike you, I submit, as exceedingly  dangerous to our constitutional structure of government.   If that were the standard, what President would ever be safe by way  of impeachment from what Hamilton decried as the ``persecution of an  intemperate or designing majority in the House of Representatives''?   The central import of the abuse of power Article of Impeachment-- indeed, when added together with the obstruction of justice article--is  a result not far off from what one citizen tweet I saw back in December  described as article I, Democrats don't like President Trump; article  II, Democrats can't beat President Trump.   President Trump is not removable from office just because a designing  majority in the House, as represented by their managers, believes that  the President abused the power of his office during the July 25 call  with President Zelensky. The Constitution requires more. To ignore the  requirement of proving that a crime was committed is to sidestep the  constitutional design as well as the lessons of history.   I know that many of you may come to conclude, or may have already  concluded, that the call was less than perfect. I have said on any  number of occasions previously--and publicly--that it would have been  better, in attempting to spur action by a foreign government in  coordinating law enforcement efforts with our government, to have done  so through proper channels. While the President certainly enjoys the  power to do otherwise, there is consequence to that action, as we have  now witnessed. After all, that is why we are all here.    But it is another thing altogether to claim that such conduct is  clearly and unmistakably impeachable as an abuse of power. There can be  no serious question that this President, or any President, acts  lawfully in requesting foreign assistance with investigations into  possible corruption, even when it might potentially involve another  politician.   To argue otherwise would be to engage in the specious contention that  a Presidential candidate or, for that matter, any candidate enjoys  absolute immunity from investigations during the course of a campaign.   I can tell you that is not the case from my own experience. I did so  during 2000 in investigating Hillary Clinton while she was running for  office to become a U.S. Senator from New York, to which she was  elected.   My point simply is this: This President has been impeached and stands  on trial here in the Senate for allegedly doing something indirectly  about which he was entirely permitted to do directly. That cannot form  a basis as an abuse of power article sufficient to warrant his removal  from office.   Turning now to the second Article of Impeachment, as we argued in our  written trial brief, at the outset, it must be noted that it is at  least a little odd for House managers to be arguing that President  Trump somehow obstructed Congress when he declassified and released  what is the central piece of evidence in this case. And that is, of  course, the transcript of the July 25 call, as well as the call with  President Zelensky that preceded it on April 21, 2019.   Release of that full call record should have been the end of this  claim of obstruction, but apparently not. Instead, again, relying on  the United States v. Nixon, House managers have proffered a broad claim  to documents and witnesses in an impeachment inquiry, notwithstanding  the Nixon court's limited holding that an objection by the President  based on executive privilege could only be overcome in the limited  circumstances presented there where the information sought was also  material to the preparation of the defense by his coconspirators in  pending cases awaiting trial following indictments. In other words, a  defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial in collateral  proceedings was what the court actually found dispositive in rejecting  the President's claim of privilege to prevent Congress from gaining  access to the Watergate tapes.   All subsequent administrations have defended that narrow exception  against any general claim of access to executive branch confidential  communications, documents, and witnesses who are the President's  closest advisers.   Thus, it should be a matter of accepted wisdom and historical premise  that a President cannot be removed from office for invoking established  legal rights, defenses, privileges, and immunities, even in the face of  subpoenas from House committees. Back in 1998, Professor Tribe called  out any argument to the contrary as frivolous and dangerous.   House managers respond now by arguing, nonetheless, that the  President has no right to defy a legitimate subpoena, particularly, I  suppose, when their impeachment efforts are at stake. And thus, it is  an issue rising to the level of an interbranch conflict that in our  system of government only accommodation between the branches and,  ultimately, courts can finally resolve.   The House chose to forgo that course and to plow forward with  impeachment. House managers cannot be heard to complain now that their  own strategic choice can form any basis to place blame on the President  for it and, worse yet, to then impeach him on that basis and seek his  removal from office. That is no basis at all, as Professor Jonathan  Turley persuasively has explained.   Compliance with a legitimate subpoena is enforced over a claim of  executive privilege or Presidential immunity only when a court with  jurisdiction says so in a final decision.   In sum, calling a subpoena legitimate, as House managers have done  here, does not make it so. An analogy taken from baseball, which I  believe the Chief Justice might appreciate, makes the point: A longtime  major league umpire named Bill Klem, who worked until 1941 after 37  years in the big leagues, was once asked during a game by a player  whether a ball was fair or foul. The umpire replied: It ain't nothing  until I call it.   I say the same thing to Chairman Schiff now. It's not a legitimate  and, therefore, enforceable subpoena until a court says that it is.   Preceding the Clinton impeachment and, indeed, in response to demands  not just from the Whitewater independent counsel but also from several  other of the independent counsel investigations that were ongoing at  that time--and, again, I know, I was in one of them--the White House  repeatedly asserted claims of executive privilege. Many of those claims  were litigated for months, not weeks, and in some cases for years.   When I hear Mr. Schiff's complaint that the House's request for  former  [[Page S609]]  White House Counsel Don McGahn's testimony, grand jury material, and  other documents has been drawn out since April of last year, I can only  say in response: Boohoo.   Did I think at the time that many of those claims of privilege were  frivolous and an abuse of the judicial process? Of course. And, indeed,  that was the determination of the House Judiciary Committee during the  Clinton impeachment. What did they do about it? Nothing. The committee  properly concluded then that those assertions of privilege, even if  ill-founded, did not constitute an impeachable offense. Did I believe  that the Clinton administration's actions in this regard have adversely  impacted our investigation? You bet I did. And I said so in the final  report. But never did I seriously consider that those efforts by the  White House, although endlessly frustrating and damaging to the  independent counsel's investigation, would constitute the crime of  obstruction of justice or any related impeachable offense for  obstruction of Congress. Instead, I and my colleagues did the best that  we could in reaching an accommodation with the White House where  possible or through litigation, when necessary, in order to complete  the task at hand, to the best of our ability to do so.   Any contention that what has transpired here involving this  administration's assertion of valid and well-recognized claims of  privileges and immunities is somehow contrary to law and impeachable is  ludicrous. In short, to add to the parade of criminal offenses not  sustained on this impeachment, there was no obstruction of justice or  of Congress, period.   The President cannot be impeached and removed from office for  asserting, subject to judicial review, what he has every right to  assert. That is true now, as it has been true of every President all  the way back to President George Washington.   In short, as to both Articles of Impeachment, all the President is  asking for here is basic fairness and to be held to the very same  standard that both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proffered in March 2019  and which previously was endorsed during the Clinton impeachment in  strikingly similar language by House manager Jerry Nadler 20-odd years  ago in 1998. The evidence must be nothing less than ``compelling,  overwhelming, and bipartisan.'' We agree. No amount of witness  testimony, documents, high-fives, fist-bumps, signing pens, or  otherwise are ever going to be sufficient to sustain this impeachment  under the Democrats' own standard.    With that, I am ready to conclude. The President's only instruction  to me for this trial was a simple one: Do what you think is right.   As a country, we need to put a stop to doing anything and everything  that we can do and start doing what is right and what needs to be done  in the Nation's best interests. A brazenly partisan, political  impeachment by House Democrats is not, I submit, in the best interest  of this country because in the final analysis, we will all be judged in  the eyes of history on whether, in this moment, we act with the  country's overriding welfare firmly in mind rather than in advancing  the cause of partisan political advantage.   I have always believed as an article of faith that in good times and  in hard times and even in bad times, with matters of importance at  stake, that this country gets the big things right. I have seen that in  my own life and for my own experience, even in Washington, DC.   Well, Members of the Senate, this, what lies before you now, is just  such a big thing. The next election awaits. Election day is only 9  months away.   As Senator Dale Bumpers eloquently concluded in arguing against  President Clinton's removal from office:         That is the day when we reach across this aisle and hold       hands, Democrats and Republicans, and we say, win or lose, we       will abide by the decision. It is a solemn event, a       Presidential election, and it should not be undone lightly or       just because one side has political clout and the other one       doesn't.    Otherwise, as Abraham Lincoln warned us during his first inaugural  address:         If the minority will not acquiesce . . . the government       must cease.        So that rejecting the majority principle, anarchy . . . in       some form, is all that is left.    This impeachment and the refusal to accept the results of the last  election in 2016 cannot be left to stand. For the reasons stated, the  Articles of Impeachment, therefore, should be rejected, and the  President must be acquitted.   Members of the Senate, thank you very much.   With that, Mr. Chief Justice, I yield back to Mr. Sekulow.   Thank you.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, we are going to now delve  into the constitutional issues for a bit and our presenter is Professor  Alan Dershowitz. He is the Felix Frankfurter Professor Emeritus of  Harvard Law School. After serving as a law clerk for Judge David  Bazelon of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, he  served as a law clerk for Justice Arthur Goldberg at the U.S. Supreme  Court. At the age of 28, Professor Dershowitz became the youngest  tenured professor at Harvard Law School. Mr. Dershowitz spent 50 years  as an active faculty member at Harvard, teaching generations of law  students, including several Members of this Chamber, in classes ranging  from criminal law to constitutional law, criminal procedure,  constitutional litigation, legal ethics, and even courses on  impeachment. He will address the constitutional issues raised by these  articles.   Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Members of  the Senate, our friends, lawyers, fellow lawyers, it is a great honor  for me to stand before you today to present a constitutional argument  against the impeachment and removal not only of this President but of  all and any future Presidents who may be charged with the  unconstitutional grounds of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.   I stand before you today as I stood in 1973 and 1974 for the  protection of the constitutional and procedural rights of Richard  Nixon, whom I personally abhorred, and whose impeachment I personally  favored; and as I stood for the rights of President Clinton, whom I  admired and whose impeachment I strongly opposed. I stand against the  application and misapplication of the constitutional criteria in every  case and against any President without regard to whether I support his  or her parties or policies. I would be making the very same  constitutional argument had Hillary Clinton, for whom I voted, been  elected and had a Republican House voted to impeach her on these  unconstitutional grounds.   I am here today because I love my country and our Constitution.  Everyone in this room shares that love. I will argue that our  Constitution and its terms, high crimes and misdemeanors, do not  encompass the two articles charging abuse of power and obstruction of  Congress. In offering these arguments, I stand in the footsteps and in  the spirit of Justice Benjamin Curtis, who was of counsel to impeached  President Andrew Johnson and who explained to the Senate that ``a  greater principle was at stake than the fate of any particular  president'' and of William Evarts, a former Secretary of State, another  one of Andrew Johnson's lawyers, who reportedly said that he had come  to the defense table not as a ``partisan,'' not as a ``sympathizer,''  but to ``defend the Constitution.''   The Constitution, of course, provides that the Senate has the sole  role and power to try all impeachments. In exercising that power, the  Senate must consider three issues in this case.   The first is whether the evidence presented by the House managers  establishes, by the appropriate standard of proof--proof beyond a  reasonable doubt--that the factual allegations occurred.   The second is whether, if these factual allegations occurred, did  they rise to the level of abuse of power and/or obstruction of  Congress?   Finally, the Senate must determine whether abuse of power and  obstruction of Congress are constitutionally authorized criteria for  impeachment.   The first issue is largely factual and I leave that to others. The  second is a combination of traditional and constitutional law, and I  will touch on those. The third is a matter of pure constitutional law.  Do charges of abuse and obstruction rise to the level of impeachable  offenses under the Constitution?   I will begin, as all constitutional analysis begins, with the text of  the Constitution governing impeachment. I  [[Page S610]]  will then examine why the Framers selected the words they did as the  sole criteria authorizing impeachment. In making my presentation, I  will transport you back to a hot summer in Philadelphia and a cold  winter in Washington. I will introduce you to patriots and ideas that  helped shape our great Nation.   To prepare for this journey, I have immersed myself in a lot of dusty  old volumes from the 18th and 19th century. I ask your indulgence as I  quote from the wisdom of our Founders. This return to the days of  yesteryear is necessary because the issue today is not what the  criteria of impeachment should be, not what a legislative body or a  constitutional body might today decide are the proper criteria for  impeachment of a President but what the Framers of our Constitution  actually chose and what they expressly and implicitly rejected.   I will ask whether the Framers would have accepted such vague and  open-ended terms as ``abuse of power'' and ``obstruction of Congress''  as governing criteria. I will show by close review of the history that  they did not and would not accept such criteria for fear that these  criteria would turn our new Republic into a British-style parliamentary  democracy in which the Chief Executive's tenure would be, in the words  of James Madison, father of our Constitution, ``at the pleasure'' of  the legislature.   The conclusion I will offer for your consideration is similar, though  not identical, to that advocated by highly respected Justice Benjamin  Curtis, who as you know, dissented from the Supreme Court's notorious  decision in Dred Scott, and who, after resigning in protest from the  High Court, served as counsel to President Andrew Johnson in the Senate  impeachment trial. He argued that ``there can be no crime, there can be  no misdemeanor without a law, written or unwritten, express or  implied.''   In so arguing, he was echoing the conclusion reached by Dean Theodore  Dwight of the Columbia Law School, who wrote in 1867, just before the  impeachment, that ``unless the crime is specifically named in the  Constitution''--treason and bribery--``impeachments, like indictments,  can only be instituted for crimes committed against the statutory law  of the United States.'' As Judge Starr said earlier today, he described  that as the weight of authority being on the side of that proposition  at a time much closer to the framing than we are today.   The main thrust of my argument, however, and the one most relevant to  these proceedings is that even if that position is not accepted, even  if criminal conduct were not required, the Framers of our Constitution  implicitly rejected--and, if it had been presented to them, would have  explicitly rejected--such vague terms as ``abuse of power'' and  ``obstruction of Congress'' as among the enumerated and defined  criteria for impeaching a President.   You will recall in the many Articles of Impeachment against President  Johnson were accusations of noncriminal but outrageous misbehavior,  including ones akin to abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. For  example, article X charged Johnson ``did attempt to bring into  disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach, the Congress of the  United States.''   Article XI charged Johnson with denying that Congress was  [a]uthorized by the Constitution to exercise the legislative power''  and denying that ``[t]he legislation of said Congress was obligatory  upon him.'' Those are pretty serious charges.   Here is how Justice Curtis responded to these noncriminal charges:         My first position is, that when the Constitution speaks of       treason, bribery, and other crimes and misdemeanors, it       refers to, and includes only, high criminal offenses against       the United States, made so by some law of the United States       existing when the acts complained of were done, and I say       that this is plainly to be inferred from each and every       provision of the Constitution on the subject of impeachment.    I will briefly review those other provisions of the Constitution with  you. Judge Curtis's interpretation is supported--indeed, in his view it  was compelled--by the constitutional text. Treason, bribery, and other  high crimes and misdemeanors are high crimes. Other high crimes and  misdemeanors must be akin to treason and bribery. Curtis cited the  Latin phrase ``Noscitur a sociis,''--I am sorry for my pronunciation-- referring to a classic rule of interpretation that when the meaning of  a word that is part of a group of words is uncertain, you should look  to the other words in that group that provide interpretive context.   The late Justice Antonin Scalia gave the following current example.  If one speaks of Mickey Mantle, Rocky Marciano, Michael Jordan, and  other great competitors, the last noun does not reasonably refer to Sam  Walton, who is a great competitor, but in business, or Napoleon, a  great competitor on the battlefield. Applying that rule to the groups  of words ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,''  the last five words should be interpreted to include only serious  criminal behavior akin to treason and bribery.   Justice Curtis then reviewed the other provisions of the Constitution  that relate to impeachment. First, he started with the provision that  says ``the President of the United States shall have Power to grant  Reprieves and Pardons''--listen now--``for Offenses against the United  States, except in Cases of Impeachment.''   He cogently argued that if impeachment were not for ``offenses  against the United States''--was not based on an offense against the  United States--there would have been no need for any constitutional  exception.   He then went on to a second provision: ``The trial of all crimes,  except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury.'' This demonstrated,  according to Curtis, that impeachment requires a crime, but unlike  other crimes, it does not require a jury trial. You are the judge and  the jury. He also pointed out that an impeachment trial, by the  ``express words'' of the Constitution, requires an ``acquittal'' or a  ``conviction,'' judgments generally rendered only in the trials of  crimes.   Now, President Johnson's lawyers, of course, argued in the  alternative, as all lawyers do when there are questions of fact and  law. He argued that Johnson did not violate the Articles of  Impeachment, as you heard from other lawyers today but, even if he did,  that the articles do not charge impeachable offenses, which is the  argument that I am making before you this evening.   Justice Curtis's first position, however, was that the articles did  not charge an impeachable offense because they did not allege ``high  criminal offenses against the United States.''   According to Harvard historian and law professor Nikolas Bowie,  Curtis's constitutional arguments were persuasive to at least some  Senators who were no friends of President Johnson's, including the  coauthors of the 13th and the 14th Amendments. As Senator William Pitt  Fessenden later put it, ``Judge Curtis gave us the law, and we followed  it.''   Senator James W. Grimes echoed Curtis's argument by refusing to  ``accept an interpretation'' of high crimes and misdemeanors that  changes ``according to the law of each Senator's judgment, enacted in  his own bosom after the alleged commission of the offense.'' Though he  desperately wanted to see President Johnson, whom he despised, out of  office, he believed that an impeachment removal without the violation  of law would be ``construed into approval of impeachments as part of  future political machinery.''   According to Professor Bowie, Justice Curtis's constitutional  arguments may well have contributed to the decision by at least some of  the seven Republican dissidents to defy their party and vote for  acquittal, which was secured by a single vote.   Today, Professor Bowie has an article in the New York Times in which  he repeats his view of ``impeachment requires a crime,'' but he now  argues that the Articles of Impeachment do charge crimes. He is simply  wrong. He is wrong because, in the United States v. Hudson--a case  decided almost more than 200 years ago now--the U.S. Supreme Court  ruled that Federal courts have no jurisdiction to create common law  crimes. Crimes are only what are in the statute book.   So Professor Bowie is right that the Constitution requires a crime  for impeachment but wrong when he says that common law crimes can be  used as a basis for impeaching even though they don't appear in the  statute books.   Now, I am not here arguing that the current distinguished Members of  the Senate are in any way bound--legally  [[Page S611]]  bound--by Justice Curtis's arguments or those of Dean Dwight, but I am  arguing that you should give them serious consideration--the  consideration to which they are entitled by the eminence of their  author and the role they may have played in the outcome of the closest  precedent to the current case.   I want to be clear. There is a nuanced difference between the  arguments made by Curtis and Dwight and the argument that I am  presenting here today based on my reading of history.   Curtis argued that there must be a specific violation of preexisting  law. He recognized that, at the time of the Constitution, there were no  Federal criminal statutes. Of course not. The Constitution established  a national government, so we couldn't have statutes prior to the  establishment of our Constitution and our Nation.   This argument is offered today by proponents of this impeachment on  the claim that the Framers could not have intended to limit the  criteria for impeachment to criminal-like behavior. Justice Curtis  addressed that issue and that argument head-on.   He pointed out that crimes such as bribery would be made criminal  ``by the laws of the United States, which the Framers of the  Constitution knew would be passed.'' In other words, he anticipated  that Congress would soon enact statutes punishing and defining crimes  such as burglary, extortion, perjury, et cetera. He anticipated that,  and he based his argument, in part, on that.   The Constitution already included treason as a crime, and that was  defined in the Constitution itself, and then it included other crimes;  but what Justice Curtis said is that you could include laws, ``written  or unwritten, express or implied''--by which he meant common law,  which, at the time of the Constitution, there were many common law  crimes--and they were enforceable, even federally, until the Supreme  Court, many years later, decided that common law crimes were no longer  part of Federal jurisdiction.   So the position that I have derived from history would include--and  this is a word that will upset some people--criminal-like conduct akin  to treason and bribery. There need not be, in my view, conclusive  evidence of a technical crime that would necessarily result in a  criminal conviction. Let me explain.   For example, if a President were to receive or give a bribe outside  of the United States and outside of the statute of limitations, he  could not technically be prosecuted in the United States for such a  crime, but I believe he could be impeached for such a crime because he  committed the crime of bribery even though he couldn't technically be  accused of it in the United States. That is the distinction that I  think we draw. Or if a President committed extortion, perjury, or  obstruction of justice, he could be charged with these crimes as  impeachable offenses because these crimes, though not specified in the  Constitution, are akin to treason and bribery. This would be true even  if some of the technical elements--time and place--were absent.   What Curtis and Dwight and I agree upon--and this is the key point in  this impeachment case; please understand what I am arguing--is that  purely noncriminal conduct, including abuse of power and obstruction of  Congress, are outside the range of impeachable offenses. That is the  key argument I am presenting today.   This view was supported by text writers and judges close in time to  the founding. William Oldhall Russell, whose 1819 treatise on criminal  law was a Bible among criminal law scholars and others, defined ``high  crimes and misdemeanors'' as ``such immoral and unlawful acts as are  nearly allied, and equal in guilt, to a felony; and yet, owing to the  absence of some technical circumstances''--technical circumstances-- ``do not fall within the definition of a felony.'' Similar views were  expressed by some State courts. Others disagreed.    Curtis's considered views and those of Dwight, Russell, and others,  based on careful study of the text and history, are not ``bonkers,''  ``absurdist,'' ``legal claptrap,'' or other demeaning epithets thrown  around by partisan supporters of this impeachment. As Judge Starr  pointed out, they have the weight of authority. They were accepted by  the generation of the Founders and the generations that followed. If  they are not accepted by academics today, that shows a weakness among  the academics, not among the Founders. Those who disagree with Curtis's  textual analysis are obliged, I believe, to respond with reason,  counter interpretations, not name-calling.   If Justice Curtis's arguments and those of Dean Dwight are rejected,  I think then proponents of impeachment must offer alternative  principles and alternative standards for impeachment and removal.   We just heard that, in 1970, Congressman Gerald Ford, whom I greatly  admired, said the following in the context of an impeachment of  justice: ``[A]n impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House  of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history,''  et cetera. You all know the quote.   Congresswoman Maxine Waters recently put it more succinctly in the  context of a Presidential impeachment. Here is what she said:         Impeachment is whatever Congress says it is. There is no       law.    But this lawless view would place Congress above the law. It would  place Congress above the Constitution. For Congress to ignore the  specific words of the Constitution itself and substitute its own  judgments would be for Congress to do what it is accusing the President  of doing--and no one is above the law, not the President and not  Congress.   This is precisely the kind of view expressly rejected by the Framers,  who feared having a President serve at the ``pleasure'' of the  legislature, and it is precisely the view rejected by Senator James  Grimes when he refused to accept an interpretation of high crimes and  misdemeanors that would change ``according to the law of each Senator's  judgment, enacted in his own bosom.''   The Constitution requires, in the words of Gouverneur Morris, that  the criteria for impeachment must be ``enumerated and defined.'' Those  who advocate impeachment today are obliged to demonstrate how the  criteria accepted by the House in this case are enumerated and defined  in the Constitution.   The compelling textual analysis provided by Justice Curtis is  confirmed by the debate in the Constitutional Convention, by the  Federalist Papers, by the writings of William Blackstone, and, I  believe, by the writings of Alexander Hamilton, which were heavily  relied on by lawyers at the time of the Constitution's adoption.   There were at the time of the Constitution's adoption two great  debates that went on, and it is very important to understand the  distinction between these two great debates. It is hard to imagine  today, but the first was, Should there be any power to impeach a  President at all? There were several members of the founding generation  and of the Framers of the Constitution who said no--who said, no, a  President shouldn't be allowed to be impeached.   The second--and the second is very, very important in our  consideration today--is, If a President is to be subject to  impeachment, what should the criteria be? These are very different  issues, and they are often erroneously conflated.   Let's begin with the first debate.   During the broad debate about whether a President should be subject  to impeachment, proponents of impeachment used vague and open-ended  terms, such as ``unfit,'' ``obnoxious,'' ``corrupt,'' ``misconduct,''  ``misbehavior,'' ``negligence,'' ``malpractice,'' ``perfidy,''  ``treachery,'' ``incapacity,'' ``peculation,'' and  ``maladministration.'' They worried that a President might ``pervert  his administration into a scheme of speculation and oppression''; that  he might be ``corrupted by foreign influence''; and--yes, this is  important--that he might have ``great opportunities of abusing his  power.''   Those were the concerns that led the Framers to decide that a  President must be subject to impeachment, but not a single one of the  Framers suggested that these general fears justifying the need for an  impeachment and removal mechanism should automatically be accepted as a  specific criterion for impeachment. Far from it.   As Gouverneur Morris aptly put it: ``[C]orruption and some other  offenses . . . ought to be impeachable, but . . . the cases ought to be  enumerated and defined.''  [[Page S612]]    The great fallacy of many contemporary scholars and pundits and, with  due respect, Members of the House of Representatives is that they fail  to understand the critical distinction between the broad reasons for  needing an impeachment mechanism and the carefully enumerated and  defined criteria that should authorize the deployment of this powerful  weapon.   Let me give you a hypothetical example that might have faced Congress  or, certainly, will face Congress.   Let's assume that there is a debate over regulating the content of  social media--whether we should have regulations or criminal, civil  regulations over Twitter or Facebook, et cetera. In the debate over  regulating the social media, proponents of regulation might well cite  broad dangers, such as false information, inappropriate content, hate  speech. Those are good reasons for having regulation; but when it came  to enumerating and defining what should be prohibited, such broad  dangers would have to be balanced against other important policies, and  the resulting legislation would be much narrower and more carefully  defined than the broad dangers that necessitated some regulation.   The Framers understood and acted on this difference, but I am afraid  that many scholars and others and Members of Congress fail to see this  distinction, and they cite some of the fears that led to the need for  an impeachment mechanism. They cite them as the criteria themselves.  That is a deep fallacy, and it is crucially important that the  distinction be sharply drawn between arguments made in favor of  impeaching and the criteria then decided upon to justify the  impeachment specifically of the President.   The Framers understood this, and so they got down to the difficult  business of enumerating and defining precisely which offenses, among  the many that they feared a President might commit, should be  impeachable as distinguished by those left to the voters to evaluate.   Some Framers, such as Roger Sherman, wanted the President to be  removable by ``the National legislature'' at its ``pleasure,'' much  like the Prime Minister can be removed by a simple vote of no  confidence by Parliament. That view was rejected.   Benjamin Franklin opposed decidedly the making of the Executive ``the  mere creature of the legislature.''   Gouverneur Morris was against ``a dependence of the Executive on the  Legislature, considering the Legislature''--you will pardon me for  quoting this--``a great danger to be apprehended . . . `'   I don't agree with that.   James Madison expressed concern about the President being improperly  dependent on the legislature. Others worried about a feeble executive.   Hearing these and other arguments against turning the new Republic  into a parliamentary democracy, in which the legislature had the power  to remove the President, the Framers set out to strike the appropriate  balance between the broad concerns that led them to vote for a  provision authorizing the impeachment of the President and the need for  specific criteria not subject to legislative abuse or overuse.   Among the criteria proposed were: malpractice, neglect of duty,  malconduct, neglect in the execution of office, and--and this word we  will come back to talk about--maladministration.   It was in response to that last term, a term used in Britain, as a  criteria for impeachment that Madison responded: ``So vague a term will  be equivalent to a tenure during the pleasure of the Senate.''   Upon hearing Madison's objections Colonel Mason withdrew  ``maladministration'' and substituted ``other high crimes and  misdemeanors.''   Had a delegate proposed inclusion of ``abuse of power'' or  ``obstruction of Congress'' as enumerated and defined criteria for  impeachment, history strongly suggests that Madison would have  similarly opposed it, and it would have been rejected.   I will come back to that argument a little later on when I talk  specifically about abuse of power.   Indeed, Madison worried that a partisan legislature could even misuse  the word ``misdemeanor'' to include a broad array of noncrimes, so he  proposed moving the trial to the nonpartisan Supreme Court. The  proposal was rejected.   Now, this does not mean, as some have suggested, that Madison  suddenly changed his mind and favored such misuse to expand the meaning  of ``misdemeanor'' to include broad terms like ``misbehavior.'' No, it  only meant that he feared--he feared that the word ``misdemeanor''  could be abused. His fear has been proved prescient by the misuse of  that term, ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' by the House, in this  case.   Now, the best evidence that the broad concerns cited by the Framers  to justify impeachment were not automatically accepted as criteria  justifying impeachment is the manner by which the word ``incapacity''-- focus on that word, please--incapacity was treated.   Madison and others focused heavily on the problem of what happens if  a President becomes incapacitated. Certainly, a President who is  incapacitated should not be allowed to continue to preside over this  great country. And everyone seemed to agree that the possibility of  Presidential incapacity is a good and powerful reason for having  impeachment provisions.   But when it came time to establishing criteria for actually removing  a President, ``incapacity'' was not included. Why not? Presumably  because it was too vague and subjective a term.   And when we had the incapacitated President in the end of the Woodrow  Wilson second term, he was not impeached and removed.   A constitutional amendment with carefully drawn procedural safeguards  against abuse was required to remedy the daunting problem of a  President who was deemed incapacitated.   Now, another reason why incapacitation was not included among  impeachable offenses is because it is not criminal. It is not a crime  to be incapacitated. It is not akin to treason. It is not akin to  bribery, and it is not a high crime and misdemeanor.   The Framers believed that impeachable offenses must be criminal in  nature and akin to the most serious crimes. Incapacity simply did not  fit into this category. Nothing criminal about it.   So the Constitution had to be amended to include a different category  of noncriminal behavior that warranted removal.   I urge you to consider seriously that important part of the history  of the adoption of our Constitution.   I think that Blackstone and Hamilton also support this view.   There is no disagreement over the conclusion that the words  ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes''--those words require  criminal behavior. The debate is only over the words ``and  misdemeanors.'' The Framers of the Constitution were fully cognizant of  the fact that the word ``misdemeanor'' was a species of crime.   The book that was most often deemed authoritative was written by  William Blackstone of Great Britain, and here is what he says about  this in the version that was available to the Framers:         A crime, or misdemeanor, is an act committed or omitted, in       violation of the [public] law, either forbidding or       commanding it. The general definition comprehends both crimes       and misdemeanors; which, properly speaking, are mere       synonymous terms.    Mere synonymous terms. He went then on:         [T]hough, in common usage, the word ``crimes'' is made to       denote such offenses are of a deeper and more atrocious dye;       while smaller faults, and omissions of less consequence, are       comprised under the gentler name of ``misdemeanors'' only.    Interestingly, though, he pointed out that misdemeanors were not  always so gentle.   There was a category called ``capital misdemeanors,'' where if you  stole somebody's pig or other fowl, you could be sentenced to death,  but it was only for a misdemeanor. Don't worry. It is not for a felony.  But there were misdemeanors that were capital in nature.   Moreover, Blackstone wrote that parliamentary impeachment ``is a  prosecution''--a prosecution--``of already known and established law  [presented] to the most high and Supreme Court of criminal  jurisdiction''--analogous to this great court.   He observed that ``[a] commoner [can be impeached] but only for high  misdemeanors: a peer may be impeached for any crime''--any crime.   This certainly suggests that Blackstone deemed high misdemeanors to  be a species of crime.  [[Page S613]]    Hamilton is a little less clear on this issue, and not surprisingly  because he was writing--in Federalist No. 65, he was writing not to  define what the criteria for impeachment were, he was writing primarily  in defense of the Constitution as written and less to define its  provisions, but he certainly cannot be cited as in favor of criteria  such as abuse of power or obstruction of Congress, nor of impeachment  voted along party lines.   He warned that the ``greatest danger''--these were his words--``the  greatest danger [is] that the decision will be regulated more by the  comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of  innocence or guilt.''   In addition to using the criminal terms ``innocence'' or ``guilt,''  Hamilton also referred to ``prosecution'' and ``sentence.'' He cited  the constitutional provisions that states that ``the party convicted  shall nevertheless be libel and subject'' to a criminal trial, as a  reason for not having the President tried before the Supreme Court.   He feared a double prosecution, a variation of double jeopardy,  before the same judiciary. These points all sound in criminal terms.   But advocates of a broad, open-ended, noncriminal interpretation of  ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' insist that Hamilton is on their side,  and they cite the following words regarding the court of impeachment.  And I think I heard these words quoted more than any other words in  support of a broad view of impeachment, and they are misunderstood.  Here is what he said when describing the court of impeachment. He said:         The subjects of its jurisdiction--    Those are important words, the subjects of its jurisdiction, by which  he meant treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors.         The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which       proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other       words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They       are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be       denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries       done immediately to society itself.''    Those are Hamilton's words. They are often misunderstood as  suggesting that the criteria authorizing impeachment include ``the  misconduct of public men'' or ``the abuse or violation of some public  trust.''   That is a misreading. These words were used to characterize the  constitutional criteria that are ``the subject of'' the jurisdiction of  the court of impeachment: namely, ``treason, bribery, or other high  crimes and misdemeanors.''   Those specified crimes are political in nature. They are the crimes  that involve ``misconduct of public men'' and ``the abuse or violation  of some public trust.''   Hamilton was not expanding the specified criteria to include--as  independent grounds for impeachment--misconduct, abuse, or violation.  If anything, he was contracting them to require, in addition to proof  of the specified crimes, also proof that the crime must be of a  political nature.   This would exclude President Clinton's private, nonpolitical crimes.  In fact, and this is interesting, Hamilton's view was cited by  Clinton's advocates as contracting, not expanding, the meaning of  ``high crimes.''   Today, some of these same advocates, you look at the same words and  cite them as expanding its meaning.   Clinton was accused of a crime--perjury--and so the issue in his case  was not whether the Constitution required a crime for impeachment.  Instead, the issue was whether Clinton's alleged crime could be  classified as a ``high crime'' in light of the personal nature.   During the Clinton impeachment, I stated in an interview that I did  not think that a technical crime was required but that I did think that  abusing trust could be considered. I said that.   At that time, I had not done the extensive research on that issue  because it was irrelevant to the Clinton case, and I was not fully  aware of the compelling counterarguments. So I simply accepted the  academic consensus on an issue that was not on the front burner at the  time.   But because this impeachment directly raises the issue of whether  criminal behavior is required, I have gone back and read all the  relevant historical material, as nonpartisan academics should always  do, and have now concluded that the Framers did intend to limit the  criteria for impeachment to criminal-type acts akin to treason,  bribery, and they certainly did not intend to extend it to vague and  open-ended and noncriminal accusations such as abuse of power and  obstruction of Congress.   I published this academic conclusion well before I was asked to  present the argument to the Senate in this case. My switch in attitude,  purely academic, purely nonpartisan.   Nor am I the only participant in this proceeding who has changed his  mind. Several Members of Congress, several Senators expressed different  views regarding the criteria for impeachment when the subject was  President Clinton than they do now.   When the President was Clinton, my colleague and friend Professor  Laurence Tribe, who is advising Speaker Pelosi now, wrote that a  sitting President could not be charged with a crime. Now he has changed  his mind. That is what academics do and should do, based on new  information.   If there are reasonable doubts about the intended meaning of ``high  crimes and misdemeanors,'' Senators might consider resolving these  doubts by reference to the legal concept known as lenity.   Lenity goes back to hundreds of years before the founding of our  country and was a concept in Great Britain, relied upon by many of our  own Justices and judges over the years. It was well known to the legal  members of the founding generations.   It required that in construing a criminal statute that is capable of  more than one reasonable interpretation, the interpretation that favors  the defendant should be selected unless it conflicts with the intent of  the statute.   It has been applied by Chief Justice Marshall, Justice Oliver Wendell  Holmes, Felix Frankfurter, Justice Antonin Scalia and others.   Now, applying that rule to the interpretation of ``high crimes and  misdemeanors'' would require that these words be construed narrowly to  require criminal-like conduct akin to treason and bribery rather than  broadly to encompass abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.   In other words, if Senators are in doubt about the meaning of ``high  crimes and misdemeanors,'' the rule of lenity should incline them  toward accepting a narrower rather than a broad interpretation, a view  that rejects abuse of power and obstruction of Congress as within the  constitutional criteria.   Now, even if the rule of lenity is not technically applicable to  impeachment--that is a question--certainly, the policies underlying  that rule are worthy and deserving of consideration as guides to  constitutional interpretation.   Now, here I am making, I think, a very important point. Even if the  Senate were to conclude that a technical crime is not required for  impeachment, the critical question remains--and it is the question I  now want to address myself to--do abuse of power and objection of  Congress constitute impeachable offenses?   The relevant history answers that question clearly in the  negative. Each of these charges suffers from the vice of being ``so  vague a term that they will be equivalent of tenure at the pleasure of  the Senate,'' to quote again the Father our Constitution.    Abuse of power is an accusation easily leveled by political opponents  against controversial presidents. In our long history, many Presidents  have been accused of abusing their power. I will now give you a list of  Presidents who in our history have been accused of abusing their power  and who would be subject to impeachment under the House managers' view  of abuse: George Washington, for refusal to turn over documents  relating to the Jay Treaty; John Adams for signing and enforcing the  Alien and Sedition laws; and Thomas Jefferson, for purchasing Louisiana  without congressional authorization.   I will go on--John Quincy Adams; Martin Van Buren; John Tyler,  ``arbitrary, despotic and corrupt use of the veto power''; James Polk-- and here I quote Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln accused Polk of  abusing the power of his office, ``contemptuously disregarding the  Constitution, usurping  [[Page S614]]  the role of Congress, and assuming the role of dictator.'' He didn't  seek to impeach him, just sought to defeat him.   Abraham Lincoln was accused of abusing his power for suspending the  writ of habeas corpus during the Civil War; President Grant, Grover  Cleveland, William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, William Taft, Woodrow  Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan-- concerning Iran-Contra, and now I say, Professor Laurence Tribe said  the following: ``Therein lies what appears to be the most serious  breach of duty by the President, a breach that may well entail an  impeachable abuse of power''--George H.W. Bush, ``The following was  released today by the Clinton-Gore campaign: In the past weeks,  Americans have begun to learn the extent to which George Bush and his  administration have abused their governmental power for political  purposes.''   That is how abuse of power should be used, as campaign rhetoric. It  should be issued as statements of one political party against the  other. That is the nature of the term. Abuse of power is a political  weapon, and it should be leveled against political opponents. Let the  public decide if that is true.   Barack Obama, the House Committee on the Judiciary held an entire  hearing entitled ``Obama Administration's Abuse of Power.''   By the standards applied to earlier Presidents, nearly any  controversial act by a Chief Executive could be denominated as abuse of  power. For example, past Presidents have been accused of using their  foreign policy, even their war powers, to enhance their electoral  prospects. Presidents often have mixed motives that include partisan  personal benefits, along with the national interest.   Professor Josh Blackman, constitutional law professor, provided the  following interesting example:         In 1864, during the height of the Civil War, President       Lincoln encouraged General William Sherman to allow soldiers       in the field to return to Indiana to vote.    What was Lincoln's primary motivation, the professor asks.         He wanted to make sure that the government of Indiana       remained in the hands of Republican loyalists who would       continue the war until victory. Lincoln's request risked       undercutting the military effort by depleting the ranks.       Moreover, during this time, soldiers in the remaining States       faced greater risks than did the returning Hoosiers.    The professor continues:         Lincoln had personal motives. Privately, he sought to       secure victory for his party; but the President, as a       President and as a party leader and Commander in Chief made a       decision with life-or-death consequences.    Professor Blackman used the following relevant conclusion from this  and other historical events. He said:         Politicians routinely promote the understanding of the       general welfare while at the back of their minds considering       how these actions will affect their popularity. Often the two       concepts overlap. What is good for the country is good for       the official's reelection. All politicians understand that       dynamic.    Like all human beings, Presidents and other politicians, persuade  themselves that their actions seen by their opponents as self-serving  are primarily in the national interest. In order to conclude that such  mixed-motive actions constitute an abuse of power, opponents must  psychoanalyze the President and attribute to him a singular, self- serving motive. Such a subjective probing of motives cannot be the  legal basis for a serious accusation of abuse of power that could  result in the removal of an elected President.   Yet this is precisely what the managers are claiming. Here is what  they said: ``Whether the President's real reason, the one actually in  his mind, are at the time legitimate.''   What a standard, what was in the President's mind--actually in his  mind? What was the real reason? Would you want your actions to be  probed for what was ``the real reason'' why you acted? Even if a  President were--and it clearly shows in my mind that the Framers could  not have intended this psychoanalytical approach to Presidential  motives to determine the distinction between what is impeachable and  what is not.   Here, I come to a relevant and contemporaneous issue: Even if a  President--any President--were to demand a quid pro quo as a condition  to sending aid to a foreign country--obviously a highly disputed matter  in this case--that would not, by itself, constitute an abuse of power.   Consider the following hypothetical case that is in the news today as  the Israeli Prime Minister comes to the United States for meetings.  Let's assume a Democratic President tells Israel that foreign aid  authorized by Congress will not be sent or an Oval Office meeting will  not be scheduled unless the Israelis stop building settlements--quid  pro quo. I might disapprove of such a quid pro quo demand on policy  grounds, but it would not constitute an abuse of power.   Quid pro quo alone is not a basis for abuse of power. It is part of  the way foreign policy has been operated by Presidents since the  beginning of time. The claim that foreign policy decisions can be  deemed abuses of power based on subjective opinions about mixed or sole  motives that the President was interested only in helping himself  demonstrate the dangers of employing the vague, subjective, and  politically malleable phrase ``abuse of power'' as a constitutionally  permissible criteria for the removal of a President.   Now, it follows from this that, if a President--any President--were  to have done what ``The Times'' reported about the content of the  Bolton manuscript, that would not constitute an impeachable offense.  Let me repeat it. Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true,  would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense.  That is clear from the history. That is clear from the language of the  Constitution. You cannot turn conduct that is not impeachable into  impeachable conduct simply by using words like ``quid pro quo'' and  ``personal benefit.''    It is inconceivable that the Framers would have intended so  politically loaded and promiscuously deployed a term as ``abuse of  power'' to be weaponized as a tool of impeachment. It is precisely the  kind of vague, open-ended, and subjective term that the Framers feared  and rejected.   Consider the term ``maladministration.'' I want to get back to that  term because it was a term explicitly rejected by the Framers. Recall  that it was raised, Madison objected to it, and it was then withdrawn,  and it was not a part of the criteria. We all agree that  maladministration is not a ground for impeachment. If the House were to  impeach on maladministration, it would be placing itself above the law.  There is no doubt about that because the Framers explicitly rejected  maladministration.   Now what is maladministration? It is comparable in many ways to abuse  of power. Maladministration has been defined as ``abuse, corruption,  misrule, dishonesty, misuse of office, and misbehavior.'' Professor  Bowie in his article in today's ``New York Times'' equates abuse of  power with ``misconduct in office''--misconduct in office--thus  supporting the view that, when the Framers rejected maladministration,  they also rejected abuse of power as a criteria for impeachment.   Blackstone denominated maladministration as a ``high misdemeanor''  that is punishable ``by the method of parliamentary impeachment,  wherein such penalties, short of death, are inflicted.'' He included  among those imprisonment. In other words, you can go to prison for  maladministration. Despite this British history, Madison insisted it be  rejected as a constitutional criteria for impeachment because ``so  vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the  Senate,'' and it was subsequently rejected and withdrawn by its  sponsor.   This important episode in our constitutional history supports the  conclusion that the Framers did not accept, whole hog, the British  approach to impeachment as some have mistakenly argued. Specifically,  they rejected vague and open-ended criteria, even those that carried  the punishment of imprisonment in Britain because they did not want to  turn our new Republic into a parliamentary-style democracy in which the  Chief Executive could be removed from office simply by a vote of  nonconfidence. That is what they didn't want.   Sure, nobody was above the law, but they created a law. They created  a law by which Congress could impeach, and they did not want to expand  that law to include all the criteria that permitted impeachment in  Great Britain. The Framers would never have included and did not  include abuse of  [[Page S615]]  power as an enumerated and defined criteria for impeachment. By  expressly rejecting maladministration, they implicitly rejected abuse.   Nor would the Framers have included obstruction of Congress as among  the enumerated defined criteria--it, too, is vague and indefinable,  especially in a constitutional system in which, according to Hamilton  in Federalist No. 78, ``the legislative body'' is not themselves ``the  constitutional judge of their own powers'' and the ``construction they  put on them'' is not ``conclusive upon other departments.'' Instead, he  said, ``the courts were designed as an intermediate body between the  people [as declared in the Constitution] and the legislature'' in order  ``to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority.''   Under our system of separation of powers and checks and balances, it  cannot be an ``obstruction of Congress'' for a President to demand  judicial review of legislative subpoenas before they are complied with.  The legislature is not the ``Constitutional judge of their own  powers,'' including the power to issue subpoenas. The courts were  designated to resolve disputes between the executive and legislative  branches, and it cannot be obstruction of Congress to invoke the  constitutional power of the courts to do so.   By their very nature, words like ``abuse of power'' and ``obstruction  of Congress'' are standardless. It is impossible to put standards into  words like that. Both are subjective matters of degree and amenable to  varying powers of interpretations. It is impossible to know in advance  whether a given action will subsequently be deemed to be on one side or  the other of the line. Indeed, the same action with the same state of  mind can be deemed abusive or obstructive when done by one person but  not when done by another. That is the essence of what the rule of law  is not, when you have a criteria that can be applied to one person in  one way and another person in another way and they both fit within the  terms ``abuse of power.''   A few examples will illustrate the dangers of standardless  impeachment criteria. My friend and colleague Professor Noah Feldman  argued that a tweet containing what he believed false information could  ``get the current President impeached if it is part of a broader course  of conduct''--a tweet.   Professor Allan Lichtman has argued that the President could be  impeached based on his climate change policy, which he regards as ``a  crime against humanity.'' I have to tell you, I disagree with our  President's climate change policy, as I do many of his other policies,  but that is not a criteria for impeachment. That is a criteria for  deciding who you are going to vote for.   If you don't like the President's policies on climate change, vote  for the other candidate. Find a candidate who has better policies on  climate change. If you don't like the President's tweets, find somebody  who doesn't tweet. That will be easy. But don't allow your subjective  judgments to determine what is and is not an impeachable offense.  Professor Tribe, as I mentioned, argued that under the criteria of  abuse of power, President Ronald Reagan should have been impeached.   Would any American today accept a legal system in which prosecutors  could charge a citizen with abuse of conduct? Can you imagine, abuse of  conduct? Fortunately, we have constitutional protections against a  statute that ``either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms  so vague that men and women of common intelligence must necessarily  guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.'' It is very  difficult to imagine criteria that fits this description of what the  Supreme Court has said violates the first essential rule of due process  more closely than abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.   Another constitutional rule of construction is that, when words can  be interpreted in an unconstitutionally vague manner or a  constitutional precise manner, the latter must be chosen. You are  entitled to use that rule of interpretation as well in deciding whether  or not obstruction of Congress or abuse of power can be defined as  fitting within the criteria of high crimes and misdemeanors.   For the Senate to remove a duly-elected President on vague,  nonconstitutional grounds, such as abuse of power or obstruction of  Congress, would create a dangerous precedent and ``be construed,'' in  the words of Senator James N. Grimes, ``into approval of impeachment as  part of future political machinery.''   This is a realistic threat to all future Presidents who serve with  opposing legislative majorities that could easily concoct vague charges  of abuse or obstruction. The fact that a long list of Presidents who  were accused of abuse of power were not impeached demonstrates how  selectively this term has and can be used in the context of  impeachment.   I am sorry, House managers, you just picked the wrong criteria. You  picked the most dangerous possible criteria to serve as a precedent for  how we supervise and oversee future Presidents. The idea of abuse of  power and obstruction of Congress are so far from what the Framers had  in mind that they so clearly violate the Constitution and would place  Congress above the law.   Nor are these vague, open-ended, and unconstitutional Articles of  Impeachment that were charged here--they are not saved by the inclusion  in these articles of somewhat more specific but still not criminal-type  conduct. The specifications are themselves vague, open-ended, and do  not charge impeachable offenses. They include such accusations as  compromising national security, abusing the power of the Presidency,  and violating his oath of office.   In any event, it is the actual articles that charge abuse of power  and obstruction of justice--neither of which are in the Constitution.  It is the actual articles on which you must all vote, not on the more  specific list of means included in the text of the articles.   An analogy to a criminal indictment might be helpful. If a defendant  were accused of dishonesty, committing the crime of dishonesty, it  wouldn't matter that the indictment listed as well the means toward  dishonesty, a variety of far more specific potential offenses.  Dishonesty is simply not a crime. It is too broad a concept. It is not  in the statute. It is not a crime. The indictment would be dismissed  because dishonesty is a sin and not a crime, even if the indictment  included a long list of more specific acts of dishonesty.   Nor can impeachment be based on a bunching together of nonimpeachable  sins, none of which, standing alone, meet the constitutional criteria.  Only if at least one constitutionally authorized offense is proved can  the Senate then consider other conduct in deciding the discretionary  issue of whether removal is warranted.   In other words, your jurisdiction is based on commission of an  impeachable offense. Once that jurisdictional element is satisfied, you  have broad discretion to determine whether removal is warranted, and  you can consider a wide array--a wide array--of conduct, criminal and  noncriminal. But you have no jurisdiction to remove unless there is at  least one impeachable offense within the meaning of high crimes and  misdemeanors.   In the 3 days of argument, the House managers tossed around words  even vaguer and more open-ended than ``abuse'' and ``obstruction'' to  justify their case for removal. These words include ``trust,''  ``truth,'' ``honesty,'' and finally ``right.'' These aspirational words  of virtue are really important, but they demonstrate the failure of the  managers to distinguish alleged political sins from constitutionally  impeachable offenses.   We all want our Presidents and other public officials to live up to  the highest standards set by Washington and Lincoln, although both of  them were accused of abuse of power by their political opponents.   The Framers could have demanded that all Presidents must meet  Congressman Schiff's standards of being honest, trustworthy, virtuous,  and right in order to complete their terms, but they didn't because  they understand human fallibility. As Madison put it, ``If men were  angels, no government would be necessary,'' and then, speaking of  Presidents and other public officials, ``If angels were to govern men,  neither internal nor external controls on government would be  necessary.''   The Framers understood that if they set the criteria for impeachment  too low, few Presidents would serve their terms. Instead, their tenure  would be  [[Page S616]]  at the pleasure of the legislature, as it was and still is in Britain.  So they set the standards and the criteria high, requiring not sinful  behavior--not dishonesty, distrust, or dishonor--but treason, bribery,  or other high crimes and misdemeanors.   I end this presentation today with a nonpartisan plea for fair  consideration of my arguments and those made by counsel and managers on  both sides. I willingly acknowledge that the academic consensus is that  criminal conduct is not required for impeachment and that abuse of  power and obstruction of Congress are sufficient. I have read and  respectfully considered the academic work of my many colleagues who  disagree with my view and the few who accept it. I do my own research,  and I do my own thinking, and I have never bowed to the majority on  intellectual or scholarly matters.   What concerns me is that during this impeachment proceeding, there  have been few attempts to respond to my arguments and other people's  arguments opposed to the impeachment of this President. Instead of  answering my arguments and those of Justice Curtis and Professor Bowie  and others on their merits and possible demerits, they have simply been  rejected with negative epithets.   I urge the Senators to ignore these epithets and to consider the  arguments and counterarguments on their merits, especially those  directed against the unconstitutional vagueness of abuse of power and  obstruction of Congress.   I now offer a criteria for evaluating conflicting arguments. The  criteria that I offer I have long called the ``shoe on the other foot''  test. It is a colloquial variation of the test proposed by the great  legal and political thinker, my former colleague, John Rawls. It is  simple in its statement but difficult in its application.   As a thought experiment, I respectfully urge each of you to imagine  that the person being impeached were of the opposite party of the  current President but that in every other respect, the facts were the  same.   I have applied this test to the constitutional arguments I am  offering today. I would be making the same constitutional arguments in  opposition to the impeachment on these two grounds regardless of  whether I voted for or against the President and regardless of whether  I agreed or disagreed with his or her policies. Those of you who know  me know that is the absolute truth. I am nonpartisan in my application  of the Constitution. Can the same can be said for all of my colleagues  who support this impeachment, especially those who opposed the  impeachment of President Bill Clinton?   I first proposed the shoe test 20 years ago in evaluating the Supreme  Court's decision in Bush v. Gore, asking the Justices to consider how  they would have voted had it been Candidate Bush, rather than Gore, who  was several hundred votes behind and seeking a recount. In other words,  I was on the other side of that issue. I thought the Supreme Court in  that case favored the Republicans over the Democrats, and I asked them  to apply the ``shoe on the other foot'' test.   I now respectfully ask this distinguished Chamber to consider that  heuristic test in evaluating the arguments you have heard in this  historic Chamber. It is an important test because how you vote on this  case will serve as a precedent for how other Senators of different  parties, different backgrounds, and different perspectives vote in  future cases.   Allowing a duly-elected President to be removed on the basis of  standardless, subjective, ever-changing criteria--abuse of power and  obstruction of Congress--risks being ``construed,'' in the words of  Senator Grimes, a Republican Senator from Iowa, who voted against  impeaching President Andrew Johnson, ``into approval of impeachments as  part of future political machinery.''   As I began, I will close. I am here today because I love my country.  I love the country that welcomed my grandparents and made them into  great patriots and supporters of the freest and most wonderful country  in the history of the world. I love our Constitution--the greatest and  most enduring document in the history of human kind.   I respectfully urge you not to let your feelings about one man-- strong as they may be--establish a precedent that would undo the work  of our Founders, injure the constitutional future of our children, and  cause irreparable damage to the delicate balance of our system of  separation of powers and checks and balances.   As Justice Curtis said during the trial of Andrew Johnson, a greater  principle is at stake than the fate of any particular President. The  fate of future Presidents of different parties and policies is also at  stake, as is the fate of our constitutional system. The passions and  fears of the moment must not blind us to our past and to our future.   Hamilton predicted that impeachment would agitate the passions of the  whole community and enlist all their animosities, partialities,  influence, and interest on one or the other. The Senate--the Senate-- was established as a wise and mature check on the passions of the  moment with ``a deep responsibility to future times.''   I respectfully urge the distinguished Members of this great body to  think beyond the emotions of the day and to vote against impeaching on  the unconstitutional articles now before you. To remove a duly-elected  President and to prevent the voters from deciding his fate on the basis  of these articles would neither do justice to this President nor to our  enduring Constitution. There is no conflict here. Impeaching would deny  both justice to an individual and justice to our Constitution.   I thank you for your close attention. It has been a great honor for  me to address this distinguished body on this important matter. Thank  you so much for your attention.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.   I am sorry. Are you complete?   Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Leader McConnell,  Democratic Leader Schumer, Senators, don't worry, this won't take very  long. We are going to stop for the day, and we will continue with our  presentations tomorrow. I just had three observations that I wanted to  briefly make for you.   First of all, thank you very much, Professor Dershowitz and all the  presenters from our side today.   I was sitting here listening to Professor Dershowitz, and believe it  or not, my mind went back to law school, and I began thinking, how  would this impeachment look as a law school hypothetical question on an  exam? How would we answer that question? And I found myself thinking  maybe that is a good way to think about it.   The question would go something like this: Imagine you are a U.S.  Senator and you are sitting in an impeachment trial. The Articles of  Impeachment before you had been passed on a purely partisan basis for  the first time in history. In fact, there was bipartisan opposition to  the Articles of Impeachment. They have been trying to impeach the  President from the moment of his inauguration for no reason--just  because he won.   The articles before you do not allege a crime or even any violation  of the civil law. One article alleges obstruction of Congress simply  for exercising longstanding constitutional rights that every President  has exercised. The President was given no rights in the House of  Representatives. The Judiciary Committee conducted only 2 days of  hearings.   You are sitting through your sixth day of trial. The House is  demanding witnesses from you that they refused to seek themselves. When  confronted with expedited court proceedings regarding subpoenas they  had issued, they actually withdrew those subpoenas.   They are now criticizing you in strong, accusatory language if you  don't capitulate to their unreasonable demands and sit in your seats  for months. An election is only months away, and for the first time in  history, they are asking you to remove a President from the ballot.  They are asking you to do something that violates all past historical  precedents that you have studied in class and principles of democracy  and take the choice away from the American people. It would tear apart  the country for generations and change our constitutional system  forever.   Question: What should you do?   Your first thought might be, that is not a realistic hypothetical.  That could never happen in America.  [[Page S617]]    But then you would be happy because you would have an easy answer and  you can be done with your law school exam, and it would be--you  immediately reject the Articles of Impeachment.   Bonus question: Should your answer depend on your political party?   Answer: No.   My second observation is, I actually think it is very instructive to  watch the old videos from the last time this happened, when many of you  were making so eloquently--more eloquently than we are--the points that  we are making about the law and precedent. But that is not playing a  game of ``gotcha''; that is paying you a compliment.   You were right about those principles. You were right about those  principles. And if you will not listen to me, I urge you to listen to  yourselves. You were right.   The third observation I had sitting here today is, Judge Starr talked  about that we are in the age of impeachment, in the age of constant  investigations. Imagine--imagine--if all of that energy were being used  to solve the problems of the American people. Imagine if the age of  impeachment were over in the United States. Imagine that.   I was listening to Professor Dershowitz talking about the shoe-on- the-other-foot rule, and it makes a lot of sense. I would maybe put it  differently. I would maybe call it the golden rule of impeachment. For  the Democrats, the golden rule could be, do unto Republicans as you  would have them do unto Democrats. And hopefully we will never be in  another position in this country where we have another impeachment but  vice versa for that rule.   Those are my three observations. I hope that is helpful. Those were  the thoughts I had listening to the presentations.   At the end of the day, the most important thought is this: This  choice belongs to the American people. They will get to make it months  from now.   The Constitution and common sense and all of our history prevent you  from removing the President from the ballot. There is no basis for it  in the facts. There is simply no basis for it in the law. I urge you to  quickly come to that conclusion so we can go have an election.   Thank you very much for your attention.   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                            ____________________     Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the  trial adjourn until 1 p.m., Tuesday, January 28, and that this order  also constitute the adjournment of the Senate.   There being no objection, at 9:02 p.m. the Senate, sitting as a Court  of Impeachment, adjourned until Tuesday, January 28, 2020, at 1 p.m.
