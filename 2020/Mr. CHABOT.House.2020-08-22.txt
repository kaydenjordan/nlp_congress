 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that the Paycheck Protection Program  has produced impressive results. All across America, PPP loans have  supported over 50 million jobs. That is 50 million people who can  continue to support themselves and their loved ones. In Ohio's First  Congressional District, for example, which I have the honor of  representing, the program helped over 200,000 people to stay on the  payroll and support their families.   Despite this success, there are small businesses that still need our  help. According to a July 27 NFIB survey, almost half of small business  borrowers predict that they will need additional capital within the  next 6 months.   As ranking member of the House Small Business Committee, I have  pushed for targeted bipartisan solutions to make sure that our Nation's  smallest firms have a chance to survive, and this Congress has acted.  Now it needs to do so again to help those small businesses and their  employees.   Unfortunately, the top leadership on the other side of the aisle  apparently doesn't feel the urgency to do so and allow a vote on  additional help for those small businesses that need it so much.   Let me be clear: Every day that goes by without action jeopardizes  America's 30 million small businesses and their employees.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support reopening the Paycheck  Protection Program through December 31 and allow businesses that have  suffered revenue declines to apply for a second loan.   Madam Speaker, we owe it to America's small businesses to work  together for a solution. We ought to be voting on that today.
