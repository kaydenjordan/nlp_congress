 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life and  legacy of Bill Steiner, who devoted his career to making Orange County  a better place.   He held many elected positions, serving on the Orange Unified School  District school board, the Orange City Council, and the Orange County  Board of Supervisors.   However, his true passion was his work for children. Mr. Steiner  founded the Orangewood Children's Home in Orange and the Good Samaritan  Boy's Home in Corona. He also served on the board of directors for the  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for over 16 years.   While we miss him dearly, his legacy lives on and his organizations  will have an untold impact on countless children.   He is also an active member of the Rotary Club of Orange. In that  capacity, Mr. Steiner epitomized the motto ``Service Above Self,'' and  we are all better because of his tireless work. We will miss him  dearly.                                time  1015                    Celebrating Villa Park's 61st Birthday     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate the  incorporation date of the city of Villa Park. Villa Park, known as the  Hidden Jewel, was incorporated on this day in 1962 but was first  settled around 1860.   Despite being the smallest incorporated city in California's 40th  District, in both land and population, Villa Park has an outsized  impact on our community. It is home to four public schools and is known  for its charitable organizations and programs, such as Villa Park  Rotary Club, Villa Park Women's League, and the Marine Thanksgiving  program.   Villa Park's quiet neighborhoods, tree-lined streets, and low crime  rate make the city an excellent place to live.   As your Representative, I am committed to doing all I can to help  Villa Park continue to be a haven for families and workers striving  toward their American Dream.   Happy 61st birthday, Villa Park.                       Recognizing Korean American Day     Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Korean  American Day.   Since the first Korean immigrants arrived on January 13, 1903, Korean  Americans have made their mark from sea to shining sea and have found  success in the classroom, workplace, and even right here in Congress to  make our Nation a better place.   As one of the first Korean-American women to serve in Congress, and  as an immigrant from South Korea, today, I reflect on the sacrifices my  family made in the aftermath of the Korean war to have the chance at a  better life here in the United States.   I remain grateful for those who came before me and paved the way for  someone like me to have a seat at the table, and I will always fight  for freedom and opportunity for all Americans.                            ____________________
