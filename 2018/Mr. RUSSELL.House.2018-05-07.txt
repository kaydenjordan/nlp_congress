The bill names the  United States Post Office at 3585 South Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles,  California, after Marvin Gaye.   Marvin Gaye was born in Washington, D.C., in 1939. After serving in  the United States Air Force, he joined Motown Records and went on to  compose and record some of the most memorable music in American  history. His rendition of the national anthem at the 1983 NBA All-Star  game was an instant classic.   His life was, tragically, cut short only 4 years later, 1 day before  his 45th birthday.   Marvin Gaye was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of  Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Mr. Gaye's music will endure for  generations.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.

Petty Officer Williams was born in Fort Mill, South Carolina, on  November 13, 1930. He joined the United States Navy at the young age of  16 and served for 20 years.   Chief Petty Officer Williams was awarded the Medal of Honor by  President Lyndon Johnson in 1968 for his actions during the Vietnam  war. He is just one of three sailors of Native American heritage to  receive the Medal of Honor in the 20th century.   Chief Petty Officer Williams is an American hero, and we thank him  and owe a great debt of gratitude for his service. I look forward to  hearing more about Chief Petty Officer Williams from the sponsor of the  bill, Congressman Norman, in a few minutes, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.

The Eighth Congressional District of Illinois is home to more than  23,000 veterans, including many Active-Duty veterans groups.

We thank the veterans of Bloomingdale and all veterans for their  service, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to echo the comments of my colleague from  Illinois and also hope that the name of this post office will recognize  the millions of veterans throughout our history that have returned  home, led productive lives, have entered further public service, and  have done so with gratitude, without issues, and have rendered great  service to the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from Illinois also  aware that I have no further speakers and am prepared to close. I  reserve the balance of my time.

The bill names the United States Post  Office at 567 East Franklin Street, Oviedo, Florida, after Sergeant  First Class Alwyn Crendall Cashe.   Sergeant First Class Cashe served in the United States Army and was  stationed in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was killed  on November 8, 2005, as a result of injuries sustained while rescuing  his fellow soldiers from an improvised explosive device explosion. With  severe burns, Sergeant First Class Cashe returned repeatedly to the  vehicle, determined to save his fellow soldiers.   For his heroic actions, he was awarded the Silver Star. Sergeant  First Class Cashe exemplified bravery and sacrifice, and he died  putting his comrades before himself.   I had the privilege to know and serve with his commander, then- Lieutenant Colonel Gary Brito, who is now a serving general officer. I  should also point out, Mr. Speaker, that Sergeant First Class Cashe has  been considered and recommended for the Medal of Honor, but to date, no  actions have been taken. It is my hope that his case will be reviewed  and come under further scrutiny.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to name a post  office in honor of Sergeant First Class Alwyn Crendall Cashe, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from  Illinois aware that I have no further speakers and am prepared to  close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.
