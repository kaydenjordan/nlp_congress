 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 467. I have deep concerns  with the partisan approach my Republican colleagues have taken on this  bill and the harmful implications it would have on our communities if  adopted.   The substance-use and overdose crisis impacts all our communities,  and the American people deserve bipartisan solutions that address both  public safety and public health. This bill fails on both fronts and  simply continues the status quo, allowing opioid use disorder and the  overdose crisis to continue to devastate American families across the  Nation.   In 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration first issued a temporary  classwide scheduling order of fentanyl-related substances under  schedule I, the strictest classification for drugs. Congress has voted  to extend the temporary order multiple times, most recently in the  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023.   Despite this action over the last 4 years, overdoses have not gone  down, and we have, unfortunately, not made a dent in the incidence of  opioid use disorders. Fentanyl and synthetic opioids continue to flood  into the country. In testimony before our committee, the DEA  administrator noted the DEA seized more than 50 million fake pills and  10,000 pounds of fentanyl in 2022.   In other words, the HALT Fentanyl Act is a partisan distraction from  the hard, bipartisan work that actually has to be done to address a  longstanding, intractable problem that faces our communities.   We lost over 100,000 people in 2022 to overdoses. This is one of the  biggest public health crises our Nation has ever faced, and now is not  the time for a partisan approach. Now is the time for comprehensive  bipartisan work.   Democrats stand ready to work with Republicans on addressing the  fentanyl crisis. We stand ready to work on permanent scheduling, so  long as it is carefully designed to avoid exacerbating inequities in  our criminal justice system.   In committee, Democrats offered amendments to improve the HALT  Fentanyl Act. We asked that Republicans consider additions to the bill  that reflect the Biden administration's commonsense interagency  proposal. The proposal would permanently schedule FRS but establish a  set of guardrails that promote a scientific and equitable approach. The  administration's proposal is reflected in bipartisan legislation that  was introduced by Representatives Pappas, Gonzales, and Newhouse and  includes an off-ramp to allow for expedited descheduling of FRS that  are found to be either inert or have medical applications. There is  already evidence that at least one FRS could have potential  applications for reversing overdoses, similar to naloxone, and we must  provide for such substances to be rapidly descheduled.   The Biden administration's proposal also strikes the right balance on  public safety by ensuring that permanent scheduling of FRS does not  exacerbate existing inequities in our criminal justice system. It  eliminates mandatory minimum standards involving FRS unless an offense  results in serious bodily injury or death. Instead, the Republican  majority has opted to continue failed punitive mandatory minimum  sentencing that we know will disproportionately impact communities of  color while doing nothing to address the underlying opioid crisis.   Now, as this bill comes to the House floor, Republicans are  continuing to refuse to make this legislation better. Almost 90  amendments were filed for consideration on this bill, and Republicans  ruled nearly all of them out of order, including the bipartisan Pappas  amendment. An amendment from Representative Pettersen of Colorado would  have provided the off-ramp for rapid descheduling of FRS that are inert  or have medical applications. An amendment offered by Representative  Crockett of Texas would have ensured that Federal law does not stand in  the way of the use of fentanyl test strips which have proven to reduce  overdoses from fentanyl and FRS. Unfortunately, Republicans refused to  make any of these commonsense amendments in order, despite the fact  that they are clearly germane.   We simply cannot incarcerate our way out of a public health crisis.  The HALT Fentanyl Act does not provide any resources for research,  prevention, treatment, recovery, or harm reduction. It also does not  provide law enforcement or public health agencies with any additional  resources to detect and intercept illicit drugs entering the country.   In fact, nearly every House Republican voted in favor of the default  on America act, which would inflict devastating cuts that would force  communities to lay off thousands of law enforcement officers and first  responders, and that is in addition to the significant cuts the default  on America act would make to substance use programs that help treat  patients in our communities.   The reality is that this bill, paired with Republican efforts to  slash vital public health and safety funding, will  [[Page H2581]]  leave our communities worse off and exacerbate existing inequities in  our criminal justice system.   Madam Chair, I can't support the underlying bill in its current form.  I encourage my colleagues to oppose it. I hope that at some point we  can get back to doing some bipartisan work that will really make a  difference in terms of this opioid and fentanyl crisis.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1745     Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester), a member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Madam Chair, I know the Republicans have a number of  speakers, so I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Lee).    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I don't like to disagree with my colleague from Arizona  who I respect, but she did say that when the Democrats were in the  majority that we didn't address the issue, and that is not accurate.   In fact, last Congress we did pass out of the Energy and Commerce  Committee a bipartisan mental health and substance use treatment  package, H.R. 7666, which became law as part of the consolidated  appropriations bill last December, and that bill, H.R. 7666, that came  out of our committee, when it came to the floor of the House, was  supported by over 400 Members. Only 20 Members didn't vote for it, and  it was later signed into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations  Act. That new law includes the MAD Act and the MAiD Act, historic  pieces of legislation that ensure medical practitioners are prepared to  identify and treat substance use disorders and increase access to  medication-assisted treatment, such as buprenorphine.   H.R. 7666 also reauthorized billions of dollars in public health  programs that addressed the mental health and substance use crisis,  including both the substance use prevention treatment and recovery  services block grant and State opioid response grants.   Now, I am not suggesting that this is the end all. Obviously, more  needs to be done, but part of what I think you are hearing from the  Democratic side of the aisle today is that this legislation on the  floor doesn't really deal with all these things. It doesn't deal with  treatment. It doesn't deal with the border. It doesn't deal with law  enforcement and more resources to address the fentanyl crisis.   We believe that a law that is going to really make a difference would  do that, and that is the reason that we are saying that this bill that  is before us, the HALT Fentanyl Act, really doesn't do anything because  it just says that it is going to be in schedule I beyond 2024.   Right now, you already have synthetic fentanyl scheduled in I until  the end of next year, and we haven't really seen any progress with  that.   We would like to see a comprehensive approach that takes into account  treatment that is a follow up on what we passed in the last Congress.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just want to correct the record, or at least set the record  straight, on what the DEA and the Biden administration are saying. I  heard what my colleague on the committee said, but I want you to  understand that no one on our side of the aisle, certainly not the  Biden administration or the DEA, is saying that we should get rid of  the current law, which says that synthetic fentanyl is on schedule I.  That is the  [[Page H2586]]  case now. We have extended it many times. As the gentlewoman said, it  is actually extended until December of 2024.   What the Biden administration, in conjunction with the DEA, is saying  is that before you go ahead and permanently extend, that you should  look at some of the other things that we have talked about on the  Democratic side of the aisle. In other words, they say, in this task  force from the administration with the DEA, that there is a real  possibility that research will find that there are synthetic fentanyl  substances that might actually help deal with the crisis and reverse an  overdose in certain circumstances.   What they recommend is that we have an off-ramp to ensure that  substances that are deemed to have a potential medical application are  not improperly classified. If you pass this permanently, then you have  to pass another law in order to take something off the list.   Also, they are not recommending that we have mandatory minimum  incarceration involving synthetic fentanyl unless an offense results in  serious bodily injury or death. This is what some of my colleagues on  the Democratic side are saying, that incarceration, mandatory minimum  sentencing, is not the answer. We know it hasn't been for years with  other drugs, as well.   In addition to that, there should be funding to deal with the  research, funding to deal with treatment, funding for law enforcement  so they can prevent more fentanyl from coming into the country. None of  that is included in this bill.   I just don't want my colleagues on the other side to misrepresent  what DEA or what the Biden administration are saying. We all understand  the nature of this crisis. We don't think that this bill is going to do  anything to change that, because it just basically extends the status  quo and doesn't do anything for all of these other things that have  been mentioned on the Democratic side.   I think it is really important for you to understand where we are  coming from on this. We don't disagree with putting this on schedule I,  but we want to see a comprehensive approach, because what we are doing  now has failed.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   The point that I have been trying to make and my colleagues have been  trying to make on this side of the aisle is that Republicans continue  to push punitive and partisan policies with regard to the opioid crisis  rather than real solutions to address the substance abuse crisis,  strengthen border security, or fix our immigration system.   The partisan HALT Fentanyl Act would not meaningfully address  substance abuse. It would simply result in more incarceration.   This bill takes a one-sided approach by only requiring permanent  class-wide scheduling of fentanyl-related substances in an attempt to  incarcerate our way out of a public health crisis.   By contrast, the Biden administration has put forth an interagency  proposal, which I have discussed, to permanently schedule synthetic  fentanyl within schedule I without exacerbating existing sentencing  disparities and inequities in our criminal justice system, as well as  creating an off-ramp to remove or reschedule these substances shown to  have medical or therapeutic value.   Now, I know that we hear from the other side: What have you done?  What are you doing?   Well, the bottom line is that the Biden administration has taken  aggressive action to combat the overdose epidemic. Congress and the  administration should be working together on a bipartisan solution to  address the fentanyl crisis, but the Republicans are threatening a  default crisis right now that would seriously undermine these efforts.   Last year, the Biden administration announced its inaugural National  Drug Control Strategy which expands access to lifesaving interventions,  like naloxone and buprenorphine, while providing additional resources  to law enforcement agencies to intercept illegal drugs.   To support this strategy and address illicit fentanyl, President  Biden has called on Congress to make a historic investment of $46  billion in funding for efforts to reduce the supply of illicit fentanyl  and stop drug trafficking, as well as expand access to treatment and  prevention to reduce overdose deaths across the country.   Now, at the same time, Republicans are threatening a default crisis  unless Democrats go along with their drastic cuts that would seriously  undermine our ability to combat the fentanyl and opioid crisis.   According to the administration, the cuts demanded by Republicans  would force Border Patrol to ax more than 2,000 agents and drastically  reduce funding for the DEA and the FBI. These things are crucial to  interdiction and anti-drug-trafficking efforts.   The Republican proposal, the default on America act, would reduce  funding for treatment for opioid use disorders resulting in thousands  more Americans losing access to treatment and recovery. It would also  threaten to take health insurance away from millions of low-income  individuals, including those struggling with substance use disorders  and the opioid epidemic, and it imposes a cruel and unnecessary work  requirement on Medicaid.   Now, all we are trying to say on our side of the aisle is in this war  on drugs, mandatory sentencing, incarcerate everybody, has not worked.  It didn't  [[Page H2587]]  work for other drugs. It is not going to work for fentanyl.   At the same time, the Biden administration has put forward a  proposal, and it has been put into bill form, the STOP Fentanyl Act,  that looks at all of this and tries to increase treatment, tries to  increase interdiction and help law enforcement, and tries to do more  research to see to what extent we can find uses for synthetic fentanyl  that actually will stop, if you will, or prevent overdoses from killing  people.   We are just asking for a comprehensive approach. I haven't heard  anything from the other side of the aisle that says you are going to do  anything more than continue with the current law, which says that we  are going to make synthetic fentanyl part of schedule I, which is  already the law, at least until the end of next year.   All we are saying is, let's sit down and actually try to come up with  something here on a bipartisan basis that is going to make a difference  for this fentanyl crisis. What we have done in the past hasn't worked.  If we are going to just reduce funding for all of these things, that is  certainly not going to work. That is only going to make it worse.   I guess I am just pleading with my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle: Rethink this. We have the time now to come up with a  comprehensive approach that will make a difference here. If you pass  this partisan bill, it is going to go nowhere in the Senate, it is not  going to become law, and we will have accomplished nothing.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and let's look  for a comprehensive solution along the line of what the President has  proposed.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
