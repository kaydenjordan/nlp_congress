 Mr. Speaker, last week, I had the  pleasure of joining the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army  Corps of Engineers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for an event announcing  NWPA, or the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, a rule that will replace  the flawed 2015 WOTUS, Waters of the United States rule.   For decades, there has been confusion and never-ending litigation  over WOTUS. During my time as chairman of the House Agriculture  Committee's Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee, which included  watersheds and oversees environmental policy regarding agriculture, I  heard from many farmers and ranchers, landowners, and environmental  advocates about just how harmful WOTUS was to their businesses and to  their way of life.   WOTUS was a gross overreach and particularly dangerous for the  agriculture industry, as vast new areas of farmlands would be subject  to the Clean Water Act and costly new permitting mandates for the very  first time, even beyond our farms and ranches. Anyone who owned  any property, private property rights would be  [[Page H572]]  regulated. Ninety-nine percent of Pennsylvania was swept under these  overreaching WOTUS regulations.    In addition to taking away States' authority to manage water  resources, the 2015 WOTUS rule expanded the Clean Water Act far beyond  the law's historical limits of navigable waters and the long-held  intent of Congress. Instead of providing much-needed clarity to the  Clean Water Act, WOTUS created even more confusion.   Thankfully, the negative impact of WOTUS was brought to an end when  the Trump administration repealed it this past fall.   I support the Clean Water Act, and I agree that it must be clarified.  However, this must be done without undue burdens on farmers,  landowners, private property owners, and commercial activities that are  already effectively regulated by the States.   Times have been very tough over the past decade for many farmers in  rural areas. An average farm income was nearly halved during that  period. Regulatory uncertainty--notably, the former WOTUS rule--only  made things more difficult.   I am confident, however, that the new Navigable Waters Protection  Rule is a step in the right direction and will address many of the  regulatory gray areas that WOTUS did not. This new rule clearly defines  four commonsense categories of Federal waters that would be regulated,  while providing clarity on what is not regulated. This includes  ditches, isolated ponds, and prior converted croplands.   The Navigable Waters Protection Rule will still support strong water  protections without compromising the rights of States and without  unnecessary burdens to the agriculture industry.   With clearly defined State and Federal regulations, our Nation's  farmers can continue to focus on what they provide all of us: food,  fiber, building materials, and energy that we all rely upon.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, last week marked the  47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade.   Our Nation's Founders enshrined in the Declaration of Independence  that all humans are ``endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable  rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness.''   Since that fateful Roe v. Wade decision, we have denied the first of  those basic rights, the right to life, to more than 60 million unborn  children.   I rise today in opposition to this atrocity, and I rise in support of  the brave individuals who flooded the National Mall this past Friday to  take part in the annual March for Life.   As long as abortion exists in our country, a dark cloud will hang  over us, but the March for Life makes me hopeful that this cloud will  not hang over us forever. I have great hope that life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness will extend to all Americans born and those yet to  be born.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to amend the rule to make in order the Cole-McCarthy amendment that  will ensure the President can protect the understand and our ally,  Israel.
