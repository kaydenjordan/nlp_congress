 Mr. Speaker, last week I was grateful  to join Senator Lindsey Graham on a delegation for the Munich Security  Conference. A highlight was Vice President Mike Pence reaffirming  America's commitment to the Transatlantic Alliance.   I then joined the delegation led by Congressmen Gerry Connolly and  Rick Larsen for the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reassured our allies of bipartisan support  for NATO's continued success. Congressman Mike Turner ably presided as  vice president of the assembly.   Another highlight in Brussels was to meet with U.S. Ambassador Ronald  Gidwitz and his wife, Christina, whose enthusiasm for service is  extraordinary.   The ambassador is promoting the restoration of the Mardasson  Memorial, honoring American servicemembers in the Battle of the Bulge.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
