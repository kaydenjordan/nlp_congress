 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and the whole group  of the Republican Study Committee for working on this budget proposal  because, frankly, this is an incredible threat to our Nation's  security. It is a threat to the U.S. dollar as our global reserve  currency, and as the Fed continues to accommodate it, we are destroying  the value of our dollar.   This is an essential duty of our body here in the House of  Representatives, and so it is an incredible honor to have three of the  bills that I have drafted be included in the proposal. One is the CBO  Show Your Work Act. Frankly, the Congressional Budget Office is our  accounting office.   Now, imagine if you worked at a firm and you were on the board, and  you simply said, I want to see the books. And the accounting department  said, no, we are not going to show it to you. They won't even show it  to regular Members sometimes. They should show it to the whole public.  They are doing the work on behalf of the public. It is not a trade  secret. It is not proprietary. They model our economy, their scores  have incredible consequences, and they need to show their work.   Another one is the Global Trade Accountability Act. President Trump  rightly put a lot of attention on trade, and it is right that Congress  would reclaim some of its authority. Because when Congress doesn't  enact a law, it doesn't endure, it pivots from administration to  administration. It pulls the authority back to Congress where it lies  in the Constitution, and it puts the President on a shot clock. And,  frankly, not the President so much as the people we initiate against;  either come to the table and negotiate something within 90 days, or the  authority goes away, and you have to change something. 90 more days.  And, in general, until you agree, it is going to keep getting worse.                                time  1830    Lastly, we have the fair representation amendment, and that would say  that when we apportion congressional districts, we apportion them based  on the number of U.S. citizens.   Frankly, rural America is being disenfranchised by counting  noncitizens when we apportion Representatives. Ohio is losing yet  another Representative.   That is not a partisan issue. It doesn't break on party lines.  Frankly, Texas and California benefit by counting noncitizens, but it  is hurting a lot of our country by counting them.   There are factors in terms of how we allocate dollars. Instead of  dollars per citizen, we are allocating dollars per capita, and that  sends more dollars to urban districts and fewer dollars to rural  districts.   It is important work. I thank the committee, and I thank,  particularly, Mr. Hern for his work leading it.
