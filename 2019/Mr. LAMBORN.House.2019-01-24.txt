 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 44, designating  this week as National School Choice Week.   There are many paths to a successful education, including traditional  public schools and charter schools, magnet schools, and homeschooling.   Finding the right path can include finding a school where a child  feels safe and can build friendships, meeting the needs of a disabled  child or playing to a student's strengths in a magnet school.   School choice is about empowering parents to make educational  decisions for their children. It can allow minority children to escape  poorly run, status quo schools.   There is no one-size-fits-all school system for our students, and I  am happy to support National School Choice Week, along with every  family and community that is seeking the best possible education for  their children.                            ____________________
