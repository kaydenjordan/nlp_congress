 Madam Speaker, January 6 was a horrific day for our  country, for our democracy. The Capitol was breached, the blood of our  defenders spilled, all because of a lie that the elections were stolen,  a lie that has infected this Nation as perniciously as the pandemic.   President Trump is the source of that lie. He has perverted and  betrayed his oath to defend the Constitution, attacking the foundation  of our democracy by inciting his supporters to violence. He is not fit  to serve and is a danger to our country while he does.   I too pledged to support and defend the Constitution against all  enemies, foreign and domestic. I will uphold that oath.
