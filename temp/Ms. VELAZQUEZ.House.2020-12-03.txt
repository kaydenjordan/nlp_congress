COMMUNITY ADVANTAGE LOAN PROGRAM.         Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a))       is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(37) Community advantage loan program.--        ``(A) Purposes.--The purposes of the Community Advantage       Loan Program are--        ``(i) to create a mission-oriented loan guarantee program       that builds on the demonstrated success of the Community       Advantage Pilot Program of the Administration, as established       in 2011, to reach more underserved small business concerns;

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I would like to take a moment to  recognize my good friend and colleague, Ranking Member Chabot. Mr.  Chabot has led this committee with me for years. Together, we have  worked in a bipartisan manner to pass legislation that will help  entrepreneurs across the country launch and grow their small  businesses.   Steve has been an absolute pleasure to work with. Not only is he  results-oriented, but he is strongly committed to bipartisanship and  finding common ground. While we do not always agree, Ranking Member  Chabot has always respected our views and the need to work together to  do the right thing for America's small businesses.   The bills we are bringing to the floor today represent our  committee's long tradition of collaboration.   Turning to the legislation now, I rise in support of the bill before  us today, H.R. 7903, which would codify the SBA's Community Advantage  Loan Program.   Initially launched in 2011 as a pilot program, Community Advantage  provides 7(a) loan guarantees to nonprofit lenders to make loans up to  $250,000 to small businesses in underserved markets.   As we all know, businesses in underserved areas have historically  struggled to access capital through conventional credit markets. This  is particularly true for minority-owned small businesses.   According to the Minority Business Development Agency, the loan  denial rates for minority-owned firms were about three times higher  compared to those of nonminority-owned firms with gross receipts under  $500,000.   To that end, the Community Advantage program partners with SBA's  certified development companies, SBA microlenders, and community  development financial institutions, or CDFIs, all of which have deep  relationships in the neighborhoods and can expand access to capital in  these areas.   The Community Advantage program reaches significantly more women and  minorities than traditional 7(a) loan programs, which will be critical  to helping these groups that were hit especially hard by the COVID-19  pandemic.   To fill gaps in lending, it is imperative that we empower the  community lenders with the strongest relationships in these areas. We  can accomplish this by passing the bill before us today to bring  stability and long-needed recognition to a program that has  successfully delivered over $770 million in capital since its  inception.   I thank Ms. Chu and Mr. Spano for working in a bipartisan manner on  this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I recommend a ``yes'' vote to all of my colleagues in  the House, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), the sponsor of the bill  and the chair of the Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight and  Regulations.    Mr. Speaker, in almost a decade, Community Advantage  lenders have delivered over $770 million in affordable capital to  underserved small businesses across America, assisting women- and  minority-owned businesses that have historically struggled to secure  affordable capital through traditional means, yet new lenders are  hesitant to participate because of its pilot status and frequently  changing rules.   Today's bill will remedy these problems and ultimately grow the CA  program to deliver more capital to entrepreneurs who need access to  affordable capital the most, especially those severely impacted by the  COVID-19 pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the work by the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Judy Chu) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Spano) for their  efforts in crafting a bipartisan bill to codify the Community Advantage  program.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8211) to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to  improve the loan guaranty program, enhance the ability of small  manufacturers to access affordable capital, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8211         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``504 Modernization and Small       Manufacturer Enhancement Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  8211, the 504 Modernization and Small Manufacturer Enhancement Act of  2020, a bill that makes important improvements to the SBA's 504 Loan  Program.   Over 62 years ago, Congress created the 504 Loan Program at SBA to  help America's small businesses access affordable, long-term capital  needed to purchase land, real estate, heavy machinery, equipment, and  other fixed assets.   The program is a true public-private partnership. An SBA-backed  Certified Development Company provides 40 percent of the financing; a  bank or credit union provides 50 percent; and the small business  borrower provides 10 percent. This structure has proved to be extremely  successful for all parties involved.   However, earlier this Congress, our Investigations, Oversight and  Regulations Subcommittee heard from stakeholders who expressed concerns  with the loan closing process, specifically that delays have caused  loans to fall through and businesses to lose out on affordable  financing.   To that end, Ms. Craig and Mr. Chabot have put forth today's bill to  streamline the closing process and make compliance easier for CDCs,  borrowers, and third-party lenders alike. The bill also enhances access  to capital for small manufacturers by increasing the maximum 504. Loan  amount for small manufacturers from $5.5 million to $6.5 million. These  changes address the issues we have heard in our engagement with CDCs  and their borrowers in our districts.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Craig and Mr. Chabot for their hard work and  applaud them for their efforts to make bipartisan improvements to this  valuable program.   Mr. Speaker, I recommend a ``yes'' vote to all my colleagues in the  House, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Craig), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The SBA's 504 program has enjoyed a track record of success in  delivering affordable, long-term capital to small businesses for  acquiring land, real estate, or heavy machinery.   Furthermore, the CDCs who deliver the program are actively involved  in promoting local economic development, especially for underserved  business communities.   As the chair of the Small Business Committee, I have seen the values  CDCs have delivered in my community in New York City, across the State,  and across the country. I am proud of our opportunity here today to  continue supporting their work and helping entrepreneurs access  affordable capital, especially as our local economies continue  adjusting to the realities of conducting business in the COVID-19 era.   I want to applaud the work by Ms. Craig and Ranking Member Chabot for  their collaboration to improve the 504 loan program.   I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8199) to amend the Small Business Act to enhance the Office  of Credit Risk Management, to require the Administrator of the Small  Business Administration to issue rules relating to environmental  obligations of certified development companies, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8199         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Section 47 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657t) is       amended--        (1) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:        ``(b) Duties.--The Office--        ``(1) shall be responsible for--        ``(A) supervising--        ``(i) any lender making loans under section 7(a) (in this       section referred to as a `7(a) lender');

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  8199, which clarifies the role of SBA's Office of Credit Risk  Management with respect to the 504 loan program.   In 2018, Congress passed bipartisan legislation to codify SBA's  Office of Credit Risk Management, which conducts periodic reviews of  SBA lenders to ensure they are complying with program requirements and,  ultimately, safeguarding the integrity of SBA's loan programs.   That legislation focused on the 7(a) loan program, giving the office  the regulatory and enforcement tools it needed to conduct oversight  over SBA's largest lending partners and hold them accountable.   Today's legislation takes that oversight work one step further by  increasing the office's responsibilities in supervising the 504  program, bringing much-needed consistency and clarity for all 504  program participants.   The bill will shift loan closing file review responsibilities for the  504 loan program to the Office of Credit Risk Management, streamlining  and standardizing an important process. By increasing SBA's  responsibilities in overseeing the 504 loan program, we are improving  the long-term sustainability of the program, ensuring it will be  available for the next generation of entrepreneurs.   I applaud Mr. Bishop and Ms. Craig for all of their diligence and  perseverance on this issue and, more importantly, their commitment to  America's small businesses.   I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, since its inception, SBA's 504 program has enabled  thousands of businesses to hire employees, grow to more locations, and  expand operations. These 504 loans are some of the most affordable for  commercial real estate projects, and most only require a 10 percent  down payment from small business owners. In its 62-year history, it has  proven to be a strong-performing SBA program that has helped  entrepreneurs create jobs in every corner of our country.   Thanks to Mr. Bishop and Ms. Craig's efforts, the bill before us  today will make commonsense improvements to this important program. By  shifting all loan closing file review responsibilities to the Office of  Credit Risk Management, program integrity will be preserved, and the  504 program will be an affordable financing option for the next  generation of entrepreneurs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8229) to require the Administrator of the Small Business  Administration to issue a rule authorizing the Office of Hearings and  Appeals to decide appeals relating to the status of HUBZone business  concerns, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8229         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Parity for HUBZone Appeals       Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORITY FOR THE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS TO                     DECIDE APPEALS RELATING TO QUALIFIED HUBZONE                     SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.         Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Administrator of the Small Business       Administration shall issue a rule authorizing the Office of       Hearings and Appeals of the Administration to decide all       appeals from formal protest determinations in connection with       the status of a concern as qualified HUBZone small business       concern (as such term is defined in section 31(b) of the       Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657a(b))).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8229, the Parity for HUBZone  Appeals Act of 2020, introduced by the gentlewoman from American Samoa  (Mrs. Radewagen) and the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan).   H.R. 8229 will grant SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals  jurisdiction over appeals of HUBZone eligibility determinations. The  Office of Hearings and Appeals provides independent quasi-judicial  review of certain SBA program decisions. Under current law, the office  decides appeals of eligibility determinations in the women-owned and  service-disabled veteran-owned small business contracting programs, but  it does not review appeals for the HUBZone program. That process is  different.   When a protest challenging a HUBZone designation is filed, SBA's  HUBZone director will review and make a decision. If the decision is  appealed, the head of the Office of Government Contracting and Business  Development will review and render a decision, which is final.   By shifting HUBZone eligibility appeals to the Office of Hearings and  Appeals, H.R. 8229 achieves priority and uniformity in SBA's  contracting programs. Moreover, it promotes transparency since the  office's decisions are published.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we all know consistent procedures in government foster a  better understanding of the rules and improve overall agency  effectiveness.   H.R. 8229 furthers that ideal by providing the HUBZone program with  parity and uniformity with the women-owned and the service-disabled  veteran-owned programs.   Furthermore, by making the Office of Hearings and Appeals the final  arbiter of all protest eligibility determinations, H.R. 8229  capitalizes on everything the office has to offer: subject matter  expertise, efficiency, and transparency.   I thank Mrs. Radewagen and Ms. Houlahan for working together on this  bipartisan solution.   Lastly, I would like to take a moment to thank the ranking member,  Mr. Chabot, for his outstanding service on the Small Business  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chabot and I have led this committee together  through four Congresses, each of us spending equal time as chair and  ranking member. Throughout it all, he has been an incredible partner,  working closely with me in good times and bad.   Over the course of our tenure, we have shepherded scores of  bipartisan bills through the House, giving small businesses better  access to capital, counseling, and Federal contracts. We have held  numerous oversight hearings to make sure SBA programs were operating  effectively and efficiently for small businesses, regardless of which  party held the White House. In sum, we worked very well together.                                time  1600    You may ask what is the secret to our success, especially during  these polarizing times. And I will point to Representative Chabot, who  is as committed to public service as I am. He puts politics aside and  works with Democrats and Republicans alike to solve problems.   When the pandemic struck, it hit small businesses particularly hard,  and our committee was called to action. Small businesses that were once  thriving were fighting for their very survival. Our committee was  working day and night, trying to develop a bipartisan package in mere  days that will provide economic relief to small businesses. These were  trying economic times, and we needed to bring people together and act  fast to rescue small businesses. It wasn't easy, but one thing was  certain. I was fortunate to have Ranking Member Chabot by my side.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the relief we have been able to deliver to  our Main Street small businesses. I would also be remiss if I didn't  mention Ranking Member Chabot's excellent staff, who have worked  tirelessly with us. I thank Kevin Fitzpatrick, Jan Oliver, Joe Hartz,  Rob Yavor, Vivian Ling, Delia Barr, Alison Kerman, and Rachel Emmons  for their commitment and dedication. They have worked hand in glove  with my staff to ensure hearings went well and the pandemic relief  programs were working as intended.   Mr. Speaker, I am saddened that Ranking Member Chabot will not be  returning to the committee as ranking member in the next Congress. I  will certainly miss our conversations during hearings and listening to  the many unique ways his name is pronounced. I thought my name was  tough.   Steve, you will be sorely missed. Thank you for your leadership,  dedication, and willingness to work across the aisle to make our world  a little bit brighter. I wish you the very best in the next Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 8229, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
