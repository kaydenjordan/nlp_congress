 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on  the committee.   Mr. Speaker, this is probably the most important bill that most  members of the United States of America citizenry will never have heard  of.   When I go back home, folks ask me to make smart and prudent  investments that will make a difference in people's lives. They ask me  to repeal unnecessary regulations that stand in the way of making those  improvements. They ask me to pay for those things rather than passing  the bill on to our kids and our grandkids.   The bill that the chairman and the ranking member have brought before  us today fulfills every single one of those challenges.   In my district, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about preserving water  quality in Lake Lanier, the sole water source for most of the metro  Atlanta area. We are talking about funding the Savannah Harbor  Expansion Project, a project of economic significance for the entire  southeastern United States. We are talking about offering local  officials the financing tools they need to bring projects to bear  faster and cheaper than ever before.   Mr. Speaker, median household income has never been higher. Small  business optimism has never been higher. Unemployment is at its lowest  point in decades. Job openings are at a record high. Manufacturing jobs  are at a record high. This does not happen by accident. This happens  when you create an environment in which success can breed.   I want to thank the ranking member from Oregon. I particularly want  to thank my chairman from Pennsylvania. Chairman Shuster said he was  going to bring three bills to the floor. He said we are going to get  back in the business of doing the people's business, not sometimes but  always; and here, at the end of his third term as chairman, we are  bringing our third WRDA bill to the floor.
