 Madam Chair, I thank my colleague and also Congresswoman  Speier for their leadership on this critical issue.   Madam Chair, I am so disappointed that in 2019 this amendment is even  necessary. Our military is strong and capable because of our dedicated  servicemembers, including nearly 15,000 transgender troops.   This year, the Armed Services Committee held a hearing on the  President's policy, and Active-Duty transgender servicemembers  testified before the House for the first time. Each one was an  incredibly capable, experienced, and decorated leader.   The DOD's exhaustive review found no valid reason to ban these  patriotic  [[Page H4718]]  Americans who meet the same criteria as their peers.   For 3 years, our military has operated under a de facto inclusive  policy where thousands could serve openly with, to quote General  Millie, ``precisely zero unit cohesion problems.''                                time  1545    Eighteen militaries already have inclusive policies without incidents  or impact to readiness, and the facts reveal this policy for what it  is: discrimination.   I urge my colleagues to support Ms. Speier's amendment.
