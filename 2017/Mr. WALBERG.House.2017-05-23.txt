 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity  to speak on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1808, the Improving Support  for Missing and Exploited Children Act of 2017.   For more than 30 years, the National Center for Missing & Exploited  Children, or NCMEC, has operated a unique public-private partnership in  order to build a national response to crimes affecting those we cherish  most: our children.   I am grateful that the bill maintains language that I supported,  which grants NCMEC the authority to provide technical assistance to law  enforcement agencies and first responders in identifying and recovering  victims of child sex trafficking.   During the committee's hearing in March, we heard from NCMEC's  director on how their ability to provide technical assistance has  allowed them to work in tandem with law enforcement to recover numerous  child sex trafficking victims.   Mr. Speaker, we all look forward to the day when no children are ever  taken and abused, and this bill helps ensure NCMEC has the tools to get  us one step closer to that goal.   I appreciate the bipartisan effort on this, and I urge all my  colleagues to support this important legislation.
