 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill,  the Women's Health Protection Act.   For decades, Roe v. Wade has guaranteed everyone the freedom to  access safe abortion care regardless of background. And for decades  anti-abortion extremists have been devising new ways to put that right  out of reach. That has left many, mainly low-income people of color, to  fear that every new anti-choice law could be the one that finally puts  abortion access out of reach for them or their daughters.   Well, it is time to put a stop to these attacks once and for all.  With today's historic vote, we are ensuring that access to abortion  care is a right, from Texas to California.   This bill respects our right and the freedom to make our own choices  about our bodies, and it leaves those decisions up to us and our  doctors. It is time to take control of our bodies out of the hands of  extreme rightwing politicians. It is time to pass the Women's Health  Protection Act.
