 Madam President, I rise to speak about the historic  vote to happen shortly that will advance conservation and public lands  projects,  [[Page S2755]]  called the Great American Outdoors Act. I urge all of my colleagues to  support this important legislation.   First, I thank everyone who has been involved in this legislation-- Senator Gardner, who just joined us on the floor; Senator Manchin, who  spoke earlier; Senator Daines; Senator Warner; Senator Portman, who  also spoke earlier; Senator Alexander; Senator King; Senator Burr; and  then several other Senators who will, I know, participate tomorrow as a  group and speak--Senators Tester, Bennet, Heinrich, and so many more.   This coalition has said we should spend the money in the fund for  LWCF and combine it with taking care of parks' backlog. This has been a  priority of two different groups of Senators who have worked together  to try to pass this legislation.   I also thank Senators Portman, Alexander, King, and Warner and my  House colleague, Representative Kilmer, for working so diligently on  the parks' backlog. I thank Senator Alexander specifically, who has  been one of the champions of the parks' backlog.   Just a few years ago, I remember I asked him: Lamar, do you think we  are really going to get $6.5 billion spent on the backlog?   He said: We are going to try our darned best.   Apparently, Lamar Alexander's darned best today has been a success in  helping us to move this forward.   Again, I thank the prime sponsors of the bill, Senator Gardner and  Senator Manchin, for their steadfast work on the LWCF and the parks'  backlog. I also thank Senator Burr, who is a steadfast champion of the  Land and Water Conservation Fund, and who, with me, helped to sponsor  the permanent reauthorization of the Fund and tried to get the funds  spent. This effort has continued over many decades by many colleagues,  including by two former Senators, Bingaman and Baucus, who were both  giants in all of this.   I thank everybody for their important efforts over the years that  have gotten us to this point today.   Why are we here? A lot of people would ask: In the middle of a  pandemic, an economic crisis, and a big struggle to energize the need  for civil rights and equality, why are we talking about a public lands  bill?    As I said, we are here because there is a lot of history behind the  outdoors economy and the economy itself of the activities that generate  an economic return from having public lands. This has been a juggernaut  for us. There is $887 billion in consumer spending every year, and that  helps to support about 7.6 million jobs.   While some are probably asking, ``How did we get so lucky to have  this coalition of bipartisan Senators come together with regard public  lands and public land investment, and why can't we take that same magic  and make it happen in other places?'' I encourage my colleagues not  only to get this legislation done and think about how we did get it  done together but also to think about how special public lands are for  the United States of America.   Public lands are part of our history. They are part of what we have  invested in on behalf of the citizens of the United States so you have  a place to recreate, to hunt, to fish, to find solace, to find  recovery, to find enjoyment, to find amazement when you see the  wonderful places, particularly in the State of Washington.   Because the LWCF is paid for by royalties from oil companies that  drill off our shores, these investments don't cost the taxpayers a dime  or add to our deficit. This bill will be injecting money into our  economy, creating more jobs, and fixing the repairs that we need to our  lands and lands infrastructure.   Over the last half a century, the Land and Water Conservation Fund  has supported over 42,000 State and local projects, and it has included  an investment of $725 million in the State of Washington. It has helped  us to expand access to clean rivers, hunting lands, forestlands, and to  improve our national parks. It has been a critical protection tool for  heritage areas and for augmenting wildlife refuges across our State. In  fact, the LWCF fund has supported 98 percent of the parks in counties  across the United States of America. At one point in time, 98 percent  of the counties across this country have used the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   In the State of Washington, it has helped us to establish iconic  places like Gas Works Park; Bidwell Park, which is near Spokane; the  Burnt Bridge Creek Trail, which winds through Vancouver; and the Warren  G. Magnuson Park at Sand Point, which has been used for valuable  conservation easements and to help popular forest legacy programs that  partner with timber owners to promote sustainable forestry.   The Great American Outdoors Act has helped us to make a decision that  has been long debated and long disputed. David Brooks, from the  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, could tell you how many  times we have had to debate both the backlog and the LWCF issues and  how people have wanted to spend those dollars. It has been a very, very  challenging issue for years.   Besides saying that we are going to take money and put it forward to  permanently fund the LWCF, the bill also says that we are going to  tackle the backlog and maintenance. I mentioned the $6.5 billion  infusion for that maintenance. For us in the State of Washington, with  our many national parks, there is $262 million for deferred maintenance  costs to include repairs to the water treatment system at Olympic  National Park. It could help us with $186 million in deferred  maintenance at Mount Rainier. It could help us with miles of trails and  access to campgrounds. It could also help us in the very important area  of expanding access.   There are other projects in the State of Washington, and sometimes,  when we don't take care of our backlog and maintenance, we don't get  the dollars because they go to the larger parks. So this will help us  to make sure we don't ignore that crumbling infrastructure or the  deteriorating hiking trails or the aging visitors centers. It will help  us with projects like the $28 million needed for the Lake Roosevelt  National Recreation Area, the $2.6 million for the Whitman Mission  National Historic Site, the $43 million that is needed for the Fort  Vancouver National Historic Site in southwest Washington, the $18  million for the North Cascades National Park in Washington, and the $5  million for the San Juan Island National Historic Park in the northern  part of our State.   As you can see, the State of Washington is definitely in the outdoor  industry business. We have been very blessed with a beautiful  environment, and we have been very blessed with an economy that has  been based on those beautiful outdoors. So we are very happy today that  our colleagues have joined in this bipartisan effort to say that public  lands really do mean a lot to our Nation and that they deserve an  upgrade--a facelift--an investment, and a commitment to keep funding  the things that will allow us to expand public access to them.   It is the legislation that we need to pass even in this unbelievable  time of so many other critical issues. I believe now, more than ever,  our local parks and our urban green space can give solace to Americans  who need refuge from all of the issues we are dealing with. Now, more  than ever, we need to promote access to the shared public lands so that  every American can get access, and the American people have had an  incredibly difficult several few months. Let's give them something to  think about for their futures--access to the great outdoors, which will  help all of us in the future.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, Mr. John Dwyer has  distinguishably served the U.S. Coast Guard and our Nation for more  than 43 years, on Active Duty, in the Coast Guard reserves, and as a  long-time Coast Guard civilian serving in Seattle, WA.   John earned his bachelor's degree from Gonzaga University in 1976 and  was selected shortly thereafter to attend Coast Guard Officer Candidate  School. Upon his graduation in 1977, he was commissioned as an Active- Duty officer in the Coast Guard. In 1985, he transitioned to the Coast  Guard reserves, where he continued to advance until retiring as a  captain in 2005, while serving as the Pacific Area Reserve Chief of  Staff. During this time, John also earned his master's degree from the  University of Washington, School of Marine Affairs, in 2004 and became  a Department of Homeland Security senior fellow. Concurrent with his  Reserve status, John began his service as a Coast Guard civilian  employee in 1986, allowing him to focus his expertise on the Puget  Sound region and serve as an invaluable source of knowledge and  continuity for the rotating Coast Guard personnel. Ultimately, he  advanced to serve as the officer in charge, marine inspection and the  chief of the Inspection Division at U.S. Coast Guard Sector Puget  Sound. In this important role, John was responsible for ensuring the  safety, environmental protection, and security standards for commercial  vessels and waterfront facilities throughout Puget Sound, as well as  the navigable waters of Washington State and Montana.   Throughout his service while in uniform, John was repeatedly  recognized for actions that increased safety in the maritime industry.  As early as 1977, as a young lieutenant, John improved the safety of  the vital North Pacific maritime industry as he helped establish an  uninspected vessel examination program in the Coast Guard's 17th  district. The processes he established were smoothly transitioned from  the district offices to a new field unit, the Marine Safety Office in  Anchorage, AK. He was recognized in the early 1990s as commanding  officer of the Reserve unit in Tacoma, WA, where John systematically  found meaningful ways to increase reserve member participation in  marine safety inspections, which had traditionally been conducted by  Active-Duty members. By enhancing the role for reservists in marine  inspections, John improved the safety of people in the commercial  fishing and maritime industries, while also boosting the efficiency of  the Coast Guard.   During his years of public service, John directly contributed to the  maritime safety and security of our Nation. John's direct oversight  ensured the seamless flow of maritime commerce, including the  transportation of almost 24 million passengers per year on the  Washington State ferries, the largest ferry system in the United  States. He led the effort to create the region's first multiagency  maritime security team that was responsible for the security of the  expansive international maritime border between the United States and  Canada. This successful program was adopted and became a best practice  throughout the Nation. John was also directly involved in ensuring the  safety of commercial fishing vessels in the North Pacific and Bering  Sea fisheries, worth more than $4 billion annually. His work with the  fishing community undoubtedly saved lives and resulted in John becoming  the standard-bearer for fishing vessel safety to Coast Guard members,  fishermen, and policymakers across the Nation.   Above his exemplary execution of Coast Guard mission requirements,  John left his mark as a skilled and thoughtful mentor. John served as a  patient teacher and remarkable mentor for thousands of Coast Guard  personnel. He generously shared his 43 years of maritime experience in  vessel inspections, port security, waterfront  [[Page S2762]]  facility inspections, mariner licensing, casualty investigations, and  marine disaster and firefighting response to train the next generation  of leaders within the Coast Guard's Marine Safety program. His  leadership and commitment to the professional development of others  made an incredible impact on more than 1,200 Coast Guard junior  officers and enlisted members, many of whom are now serving as  executive level leaders in the Coast Guard and throughout the Federal  Government. His mentees include a member of the Senior Executive  Service, three Coast Guard flag officers, 10 Coast Guard captains of  the Port, and several enlisted members who are now serving in  successful leadership roles in government and private industry.   During my time on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation, I have had the benefit of working with a number of  Coast Guard members that had been mentored by John. John trained them  well. Without a doubt, these members have left their mark on multiple  Coast Guard authorization bills that have been signed into law with  meaningful improvements to maritime safety and environmental protection  at the national level. I am personally grateful to have had the  opportunity to work with so many members who were mentored by John, and  I am sure that, after John retires, I will continue to learn from those  he influenced over his long career.   John also served as an influential leader within Puget Sound's  maritime community. In the wake of the tragedy of September 11th, he  played a key role in Puget Sound as the Coast Guard implemented the  Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. He served as the head of  the vessel security and Washington State ferries security sub- committees within the Puget Sound Maritime Security Committee and  played a critical advisory role in Puget Sound's Harbor Safety  Committee. He was always available to provide advice on maritime topics  and was frequently invited to speak at maritime events. In recognition  of his tremendous impact, the Seattle Propeller Club named John as its  Public Official of the Year in 2013 and the Puget Sound Port Maritime  Council recognized him as its Maritime Person of the Year in 2017.   John's actions and decisions were always in the best interest of the  public in which he selflessly and tirelessly served as he worked to  ensure the safety, security, and environmental protection of Washington  State and the pristine waters of Puget Sound. He will be missed, but  his legacy of service and those he trained will live on. I thank John  Dwyer for his selfless service to the United States Coast Guard, the  entire Pacific Northwest, and our Nation.                            ____________________
