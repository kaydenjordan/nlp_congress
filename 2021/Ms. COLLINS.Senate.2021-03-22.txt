 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, helping students achieve their education  and career goals has long been a priority for me. I come to the floor  today to introduce two bipartisan bills. Both are aimed at helping  students pursue higher education, complete their degrees, and have  satisfying work lives.   Prior to my election to the Senate, I worked at Husson University in  Bangor, ME. Many of Husson's students, for the most part, are first- generation college students. They are the first in their families to  take that step of pursuing higher education.   I saw firsthand the importance of several Federal initiatives: Pell  grants, work study, and TRIO--programs that are specifically aimed at  students whose families have little or no experience at all with higher  education.   The first bill that I am introducing today is the Educational  Opportunity and Success Act. It would reauthorize and strengthen the  Federal TRIO Programs.   I have been a longtime champion of TRIO. It helps students prepare  for, succeed in, and graduate from college or other institutions of  higher learning. I would like to thank Senators Tester, Capito, and  Baldwin for joining me as original cosponsors.   Congress created the TRIO Programs because it recognized that low- income, first-generation college students often face significant  obstacles to accessing and completing higher education. Our bipartisan  bill would reauthorize these programs, modestly increase grant sizes,  and make it easier for administrators to reach students who would  benefit from TRIO.   The bill also updates the way that the programs are evaluated and  streamlines the application process. The bill would also increase the  small stipend for Upward Bound students. Upward Bound is one of the  TRIO Programs. These stipends make their college visits more  accessible. These visits are often the first time that these young  people have experienced a college campus. And it would create a new  stipend for veterans participating in the Veterans Upward Bound  Program.   The Educational Opportunity and Success Act would also institute a  commonsense process for correcting TRIO applications that have minor  errors.   Now, let me give you a concrete example. In 2017, the Department of  Education initially rejected dozens of Upward Bound applications based  on arbitrary, nonsubstantive formatting criteria, such as line spacing  or font size irregularities. The Department lost sight of the goal of  serving students and instead focused on whether the formatting criteria  were followed exactly correctly.   One of these applications was from the University of Maine at Presque  Isle. It had used 1\1/2\ spacing instead of double spacing in text  appearing in graphics in just two of the application's 65 pages.   Imagine that the application was not considered on its merits at all  because of a spacing error that accompanied graphics on 2 pages of a  65-page application. The Department's bureaucratic decision would have  denied 960 disadvantaged Maine high school students from the chance of  fulfilling their academic potential.   After many months of advocacy, I worked with the Department of  Education. I kept pressing the Department. And I worked with my  Appropriations colleagues to reverse this ill-conceived policy. But it  took Federal legislation to move the Department from its bureaucratic  decision, which affected potentially 960 students in northern Maine. It  affected students that were in other high schools as well across this  country. I remember Montana was one of those that was affected.   The University of Maine at Presque Isle ultimately received its TRIO  grant to serve those students. The bill that we are introducing today  would prevent the Department of Education from rejecting applications  simply on the basis of formatting criteria. This is a commonsense  reform that will prevent unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles in the  future. We should be making sure that Federal funds get out the door  efficiently and focus on the students they are meant to serve.   I have met so many Maine TRIO students and have loved learning about  their dreams for the future. One of them is a priest who serves in  Skowhegan, ME. Neither of his parents went beyond the eighth grade. He,  through the encouragement of the Upward Bound Program, went to  Dartmouth and then on to the seminary and is now a priest.   Let me tell you about another outstanding individual, Jason Judd.  Jason grew up in Athens, ME, a very small community. Jason said: I knew  that education was the only way I could escape poverty. Upward Bound  taught me how to be successful in education and encouraged me to pursue  my passions.   Jason is a first-generation college graduate. With the support of  Upward Bound, he went to the University of Maine at Farmington and  earned his bachelor's degree. He chose to go into school  administration. He received his master's degree from the University of  Southern Maine in educational leadership and earned his doctorate from  Northeastern University in organizational leadership studies.   Now, Jason is the executive director of Educate Maine, where he works  to improve education in our State. TRIO put him on the path to success.  And now Jason supports students just like  [[Page S1674]]  himself across the State of Maine, a real success story that TRIO  helped make possible.   The TRIO Programs have changed the lives of first-generation students  across Maine and the country, opening the doors to the opportunities  provided by higher education. I would ask all of my colleagues to  support this important legislation to extend and improve the TRIO  Programs                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. Hassan, Mr. Cornyn, and Ms.          Smith):   S. 885. A bill to establish a rural postsecondary and economic  development grant program; to the Committee on Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, the second bill I am introducing today is  the Success for Rural Students and Communities Act. This bill would  help students living in rural areas achieve their higher education  goals and connect them with economic opportunities in their  communities. I want to thank Senators Hassan, Cornyn, and Smith for  introducing this legislation with me.   According to census data, two out of three Maine schools are in rural  communities, and more than half of Maine students attend these schools.  Ninety percent of Maine's students graduate from high school. That is  great. But only 62 percent enroll in some kind of higher education  right away. Unfortunately, an even lower percentage of Maine students  go on to actually earn a degree or a credential. That often leaves them  with student debts but without the credential or degree that they need.   Maine's experience is not unique. Rural students tend to graduate  from high school at higher rates than their peers in urban districts  and at about the same rate as their suburban peers, but fewer rural  graduates enroll in college upon graduation than their urban and  suburban counterparts. Our bill would authorize $60 million for  demonstration grants to create community partnerships that help rural  students access college and career pathways   Community stakeholders, such as local school districts, colleges,  universities, regional economic development entities and community  organizations, would join together to help students and their families  navigate higher education opportunities and address barriers that too  often stand in the way to their achievement.   For example, partnerships could work together to expose students to  college campuses, courses, programs, and internships. They could focus  on enrollment and completion rates of rural, nontraditional students,  who may find that they need additional credentials or who once began  but did not finish postsecondary education.   Today, as you well know, many of the employers require something more  than a high school diploma--perhaps a college degree, a skilled trade  credential, or a professional certificate. Our bill would encourage  schools and local employers to work together to put students on  pathways into the high-demand jobs available where they want to live.  Several strategies could be developed and tested, including work-based  learning opportunities like apprenticeships, internships, and a  sequence of courses on the path to a certain skill or job.   In northern Maine, the Aroostook Aspirations Initiative is using this  model successfully to help put students on pathways to academic and  career success. The initiative collaborates with local businesses and  with colleges and universities to offer seminars that guide students  throughout their education. Students can team up with employers in the  area through internships that give them the experience and the careers  they wish to pursue.   Last year, I met, from Aroostook County, a student named Katelyn  Amero, who came to Washington to talk about her career goals. Katelyn  hopes to pursue a career in medicine. In 2019, Katelyn participated in  the Emerging Rural Leaders program at the University of Chicago, which  provides opportunities for rural high school students to enroll in  college courses over the summer months. That program has helped put her  on the path to becoming a physician.   The Success for Rural Students and Communities Act would support  dynamic programs such as the Emerging Rural Leaders program and the  Aroostook Aspirations Initiative. It would encourage other communities  to innovate in similar ways.   Both bills I am introducing today would provide critical support for  students across the country who are seeking to achieve their college  and career dreams. I urge my colleagues to support both of these bills                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Sinema):   S. 886.
