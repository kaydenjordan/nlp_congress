 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Ramsey's Market of Lenox, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   The company was founded by Theo and Bonnie Ramsey in 2015 after  learning that the local grocery store in Lenox was up for sale. As  veterans of the U.S. Air Force, service is key for the Ramsey family,  so the pair jumped at the opportunity to fill a critical community  need. When a local grocery store goes out of business, residents  sometimes have extensive drives just to buy the basic food items. Over  the years, Ramsey's Market has been able to expand to include a food  locker delivery service, an adjoining Ace Hardware store with a bar  inside, and even a second location in Manning, IA.   Another unique aspect of the store is live music. Theo and Bonnie met  during their time in the U.S. Air Force Band of the Golden West, where  they both were singers. It is very normal for local musicians to  perform in the grocery store while customers shop. The staff behind the  deli counter, and even Bonnie can often be found singing to customers.   Ramsey's Market has been recognized for their hard work, earning the  Iowa Farm Bureau's Renew Rural Iowa Entrepreneur Award in 2018 for  their unique shopping experience and their impact on the Lenox  community. They have even been recognized for their success by  America's Small Business Development Center, Iowa. In January 2022, I  had the opportunity to visit the store and see the local impact the  business has on Taylor County.   Ramsey's Market's commitment to providing quality groceries in a fun  environment is clear. I want to congratulate the Ramsey family, and the  entire team at Ramsey's Market, for their continued dedication to  finding a solution to the food deserts in Iowa and serving their  community. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and success  in Iowa.                            ____________________
