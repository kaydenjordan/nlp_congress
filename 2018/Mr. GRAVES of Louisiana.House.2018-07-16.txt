 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman  from North Carolina for working with us on this, as well as many staff  and members from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.   Mr. Speaker, can you imagine for a minute if you had a medical  emergency at your house and you had to mail a form to the ambulance  service to have them come address the heart attack victim or other type  of medical emergency that is occurring at your house? How irrational is  that? Obviously, it doesn't make sense to do something like that, to  mail for something that may be an emergency.   Mr. Speaker, can you imagine, even in today's time, with the strict  demands we have for customer service, if we actually had to truly mail  order forms to different online companies to have them deliver  something, to retail outlets to have them deliver something, a product  to our house? There would be no tolerance for that.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, the government right now, the government today,  our own United States Government which is here to serve our own  Americans, only has a customer service rating of about 70 percent. In  fact, it is less than 70 percent.    Well, that might have been a high watermark for my grades in school-- maybe--Mr. Speaker, but that is absolutely an unacceptable level. This  is our government. These are our taxpayers.   Why is it that private industry has been able to use technology to  provide better customer service, to provide faster services? It is  because they care about their customers and they care about their  business and there is an incentive for them to do so. They don't have a  monopoly, like the Federal Government does, for many of the services  that it offers, but that does not excuse the Federal Government from  providing better services.   Mr. Speaker, I had an opportunity to work very closely with  Congressman Joe Kennedy to help develop this legislation, and this is a  solution to help bring the United States Government into the 21st  century, or perhaps the 20th century. It simply does the same thing  that private companies have figured out how to do for decades now,  where we can access our banks online, we can access our insurance  online, where we can go online to buy groceries and virtually any other  good or service that we need. We can even file our own taxes with the  Federal Government.   Yet the Privacy Act of 1974, as it is implemented today, requires, in  order for us to provide services to our constituents, which may be an  emergency situation, that they have to print out a form and mail it in,  and that we then have to take and mail it to an agency. That is  ridiculous in 2018, and it is unacceptable.   This bipartisan legislation addresses that. It allows for people to  access their own government, access government services to address  important things like, perhaps, accessing their VA benefits; like,  perhaps, fixing a wrong the IRS has caused; like, perhaps, dislodging a  permit or some other type of service the government is supposed to  provide and has been sitting on, in some cases as we have dealt with,  for years.   Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you a quick story.   In 2016, in August of that year, in my hometown of Baton Rouge in  south Louisiana, we experienced a 1,000-year flood. People were calling  us by the hundreds per day, calling and saying: I need help. I need  help with FEMA, SBA, and other government services.   We said: Yes, you bet. All you need to do is go to our website, print  out this form, and then mail it to us.   Mr. Speaker, I can't say on the House floor some of the responses our  office received whenever they were telling us about the 4 feet of water  that their computers and printers and other equipment were under. It  was a real aha moment.   How ridiculous is it that we sit here and act like we are 80 years  ago as a government? We can do better.   This simply brings us to current technology, to allow constituents to  reach out to our offices when we are addressing urgent issues, like  passport issues for folks stuck in other countries, like Department of  Defense issues where our own military men and women may be having  problems in other countries, where our own citizens aren't getting the  benefits that they paid for or they earned. It gives us the ability to  quickly step in and address their issues, to intervene on their behalf  and get these issues resolved.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, especially, my friend Joe Kennedy for  working with us so closely on this bipartisan legislation,  Congresswoman Mimi Walters, Congressman Gene Green, Congressmen Will  Hurd and Kevin McCarthy through the Innovation Initiative, Congressman  Mark Meadows, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, Congresswoman Barbara  Comstock, and many others who provided input to us, helped us perfect  this legislation and get it here today. I want to thank the bipartisan  cosponsors and folks who helped us on this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3906) to establish centers of excellence for  innovative stormwater control infrastructure, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3906         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Innovative Stormwater       Infrastructure Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. STORMWATER INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING TASK FORCE.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental       Protection Agency shall establish a stormwater infrastructure       funding task force composed of representatives of Federal,       State, and local governments and private (including       nonprofit) entities to conduct a study on, and develop       recommendations to improve, the availability of public and       private sources of funding for the construction,       rehabilitation, and operation and maintenance of stormwater       infrastructure to meet the requirements of the Federal Water       Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.).        (b) Considerations.--In carrying out subsection (a), the       task force shall--        (1) identify existing Federal, State, and local public       sources and private sources of funding for stormwater       infrastructure; and        (2) consider--        (A) how funding for stormwater infrastructure from such       sources has been made available, and utilized, in each State       to address stormwater infrastructure needs identified       pursuant to section 516(b)(1) of the Federal Water Pollution       Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1375(b)(1));        (B) how the source of funding affects the affordability of       the infrastructure (as determined based on the considerations       used to assess the financial capability of municipalities       under the integrated planning guidelines described in the       Integrated Municipal Stormwater and Wastewater Planning       Approach Framework, issued by the Environmental Protection       Agency on June 5, 2012, and dated May, 2012), including       consideration of the costs associated with financing the       infrastructure; and        (C) whether such sources of funding are sufficient to       support capital expenditures and long-term operation and       maintenance costs necessary to meet the stormwater       infrastructure needs of municipalities.        (c) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to       Congress a report that describes the results of the study       conducted, and the recommendations developed, under       subsection (a).        (d) State Defined.--In this section, the term ``State'' has       the meaning given that term in section 502 of the Federal       Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1362).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous on H.R. 3906, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman of the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee, Bill Shuster; the ranking member,  Congressman DeFazio; and my good friend the ranking member of the  subcommittee, Mrs. Napolitano, for their work in progressing this  bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, as we know, with the additional development that is  occurring in this country, with the additional water and stormwater  systems that are being built, heavy rains end up transiting or  transferring pollutants, heavy metals, trash, bacteria, and many other  things into our water system.   Mr. Speaker, I represent south Louisiana. The watershed that I  represent drains from Montana to two Canadian provinces to New York. It  is one of the largest watersheds in the world. Of course, all of that  stormwater runoff ends up coming down right through my home State and  contributes to one of the largest dead zones in the Nation--in fact,  the largest dead zone in the Nation--which is not very compatible with  us having some of the top commercial and recreational fishing and one  of the largest or most productive estuaries in the United States.   So I want to thank Mr. Heck for introducing this legislation, for  working with Congressman Katko in putting this together in a bipartisan  manner.   What this legislation does is it recognizes that stormwater runoff  does actually transfer, or does contribute to pollutants, in our  waterways, and it recognizes that this is a problem. But it also  recognizes that it is a problem that needs to be solved by local, by  State, and by Federal agencies, by Federal officials.   So this legislation creates a new task force to look at innovative  financing, to look at new funding streams, to look at how we can do a  better job integrating the various funding streams to actually achieve  this objective that we all share on a bipartisan basis to help reduce  the amount of pollutants and trash and other things that get into our  waterways. This is an important step forward.   Mr. Speaker, in a previous life, I managed a large infrastructure  program where we built tens of billions of dollars of infrastructure.  One of the first things I realized is how important it was for us to  look at all the funding streams that are available, and the possible  funding streams that are available, pulling those together to make sure  that they are being used in a complementary manner, not managed in  silos, and certainly not managed in a contradictory or in a conflicting  manner.   The gentleman's legislation helps to address that. It helps look at  the revenue streams that are available today, whether they are Federal,  whether they are State, whether they are local funds, or perhaps even  private or not-for-profit, looking at the different regulatory  structures that are out there, looking at opportunities for us to  achieve this bipartisan goal of reducing pollutants, of helping reduce  trash, of helping reduce the dead zone and other adverse outcomes as a  result of stormwater runoff from heavy rains.   Again, I want to point out that this is bipartisan legislation, that  this passed the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  unanimously, that my good friend from California Mrs. Napolitano worked  with us on changes in the committee. I thank, again, the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Heck) and Mr. Katko for working together on something  that is an important issue, for coming up with a bipartisan solution,  and looking forward to ensuring that this passes the House and passes  the Senate as well to where we can get it to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, Congressman Heck recently brought up the shellfish  industry. Just this week, the Louisiana Oyster Task Force is coming to  town. We are going to be meeting with them, talking to them about this  and a number of other priority issues because their industry has been  impacted by water quality and many other challenges.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that this legislation helps to make  sure that all of the various levels of government, together with our  nongovernment partners in the private sector and the not-for-profit  organizations that are out  [[Page H6221]]  there, that we are all working together; that we are ensuring that the  regulatory structure that is out there is actually complementary to  this effort to help ensure clean water not just now, but for  generations to come; that we are using better technology; that we are  using better mechanisms, such as vegetative plantings and buffers and  other things, to ensure that we are not polluting our waters but that  we are cleaning them; that we have safe drinking water; that we have  safe, productive ecosystems for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Congressman Heck, Congressman  Katko, my friend Congresswoman Napolitano, and many others who were  involved in this legislation. This is going to help us to ensure that  the various funding streams that are out there, that we are using them  in a complementary manner, not in a stovepipe manner.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3906,  as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.
