 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 782, the Providing  Resources, Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our  Children Act of 2017, and thank my colleague from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee), who has worked so diligently on this matter.   Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes appropriations for this program in  the amount of $60 million for each fiscal year from 2018 through 2022.  These figures are consistent with current appropriated levels.   We must continue to protect our children from the daily threats that  permeate the electronic platform and endanger the well-being of our  children.   Earlier this morning, as has been said, the House Judiciary  Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations  held a hearing addressing these very problems. As ranking member of  that committee, I vow to continue my commitment toward eradicating this  infectious poison that has claimed the innocence of so many of our  youths.   I look forward to working with my colleagues and others on these very  important issues. That is why I support the measures put forth in this  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 178, the Elder Abuse  Prevention and Prosecution Act. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee for his excellent work in this area.   This legislation would increase protections for elder abuse victims,  which is very important, as a vast majority of cases of abuse, neglect,  and exploitation of older adults in the United States often go  unreported and unaddressed.   Each year, nearly $3 billion is taken from older adults due to  financial abuse and exploitation, and this is happening across all  racial, social, economic, gender, and geographic lines.   This important measure increases protections for victims by, first,  ensuring support for Federal cases involving elder abuse. This support  will include the requirement that the Attorney General designate at  least one assistant United States attorney to serve as an elder justice  coordinator in every judicial district to prosecute, train, assist  with, and conduct public outreach on elder abuse.   Additionally, this measure would also require that the Executive  Office for United States Attorneys operate an elder abuse resource  group and a working group to advise the Justice Department on elder  abuse issues.   Secondly, this measure would require the establishment of best  practices for local, State, and Federal data collection to focus on  elder abuse, including, for example, the total number of Federal  investigations of elder abuse and locations where cases are filed.   Findings under this legislation include the fact that older adults  who are abused are three times more likely to die earlier than older  adults of the same age who are not abused, and that up to half of all  older adults with dementia will experience abuse.   For these reasons, a third component of this measure that I find  extremely important and valuable is the enhanced victim assistance to  elder abuse survivors. This measure would require that an annual report  be submitted to Congress on the funding under the Victims of Crime Act  of 1984 for victims of crimes who are elders.   And finally, this measure adds a new definition of ``telemarketing  and email marketing'' under the telemarketing statute to protect  victims of such scams, which typically involve elders.   We must do everything possible to support victims of elder abuse and  prevent the abuse from occurring in the first place. And so for these  several reasons, I am very pleased to support the bill with the  chairman of the committee.   Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, the elder abuse problem has  devastating consequences to the victims as well as their loved ones,  and it is an affront to America's older adults. It involves the  exploitation of some of our most vulnerable citizens.   This measure includes a multipronged approach to prevent elder abuse  and exploitation, protect the victims of elder abuse and exploitation  from further harm, and bring the perpetrators of these crimes to  justice. Accordingly, I am pleased to urge my colleagues to support  this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin my remarks today by extending my  condolences to the family and friends of the 59 individuals killed in  the shooting in Las Vegas, and I express my best hopes for the recovery  of the more than 500 persons who were injured.   This Congress has a responsibility to find a way to prevent tragedies  like this, as well as the daily incidents of gun violence in our  communities, but instead of considering legislation to prevent gun  violence, the House is spending today pushing a 20-week abortion ban  that will disproportionately hurt women and families who face some of  the most medically complex situations imaginable.   So it is with great pleasure that I oppose H.R. 36, because it is a  dangerous and far-reaching attack on a woman's constitutional right to  choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.   Roe v. Wade's basic holding is that a woman has a constitutional  right to have an abortion prior to the fetus' viability, which is  generally considered by the experts to be around 24 weeks from  fertilization. By banning previability abortions, H.R. 36 is a direct  challenge to Roe.   Another serious flaw, in my view, of H.R. 36 is that its narrow rape  exception completely misconstrues the difficult challenges that  survivors of sexual assault face and the very real reasons why a rape  or incest may go unreported. So by requiring that a rape or incest  survivor provide documentation to corroborate her statement that she  was raped, the bill's sponsors seem to be saying that maybe women  cannot be trusted to tell the truth about sexual assault, and they  certainly cannot be trusted to make their own private healthcare  decisions.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous and mean-spirited  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel).                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, how much time remains on both sides?    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, H.R. 36 is a dangerous and  unconstitutional bill that demonstrates a fundamental distrust of women  to make private decisions that are best for themselves and their  families. It is, therefore, unsurprising that this legislation is  strongly opposed by the Nation's leading civil rights organizations,  the medical profession, and women's groups.   In addition, 36 religious organizations noted in a letter to Members  opposing this bill that the decision to end a pregnancy must be left to  an individual woman, in consultation with her  [[Page H7725]]  family, doctors, and any others she chooses to involve, in keeping with  her personal beliefs.   Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to please  oppose this dangerous legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
