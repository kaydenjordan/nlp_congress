 Mr. Speaker, the question we raise this evening is  about  [[Page H2456]]  governance. In the debacle of last Friday, when the administration  failed to carry forward on its promise to pass the worst healthcare  bill in the history of the United States, the administration offered a  definition or an explanation: the ACA was exploding. It is not  exploding. The CBO has indicated that the ACA needs improving, but it  has insured some 20 million-plus people and protected children--unlike  the administration's bill, Mr. Trump's bill which, in fact, would throw  24 million people off of health care and cut $880 billion. It is about  governance.   That is why it is important to have a full investigation of the  Russian collusion of all of those who are involved in Mr. Trump's  campaign, and in his administration, including very close members of  his senior staff.   That is why we should have a full investigation, which would include  the Judiciary Committee. I demand that the classified documents that we  have requested in a bipartisan letter should be given to the Judiciary  Committee, and we should begin investigations on whether there are any  questions of criminality.   It is about governance, Mr. Speaker; and the House of Representatives  must know the truth so the American people can know the truth.                            ____________________
