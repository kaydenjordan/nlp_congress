 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  American men and women who put on a badge every day, men and women of  every color and creed, ethnicity, heritage, and background, of varied  ideology and political affiliation. They are American patriots, one and  all.   As a police officer, our job begins with an oath. That oath is not to  a chief or a sheriff or a marshal. It is to the constitutional  principles that represent the badges that we wear, badges like this.   In this body, we stand within the people's House. We serve within the  parameters of our ability. We wear a small pin upon our lapel to  designate our status as Congressmen and Congresswomen.   In humble service and an honor, yes, it is. But forget not, America,  the men and women in your community, unseen, unheard, far too  frequently unappreciated and unrecognized, who patrol your streets,  your neighborhoods, your counties, your States, and the parishes in my  State of Louisiana.   For they serve unknowing if they shall return home. They do so  willingly. They place great faith in their Lord. The Word tells us that  the Lord is my strength and my shield.   In many ways, we should recall that this small shield that we wear  begins with faith, that this Chamber began with faith, and that the  shield that officers wear from sea to shining sea maintains itself by  faith.   This week, we honor the Thin Blue Line. You are known. You are loved.  You are recognized. We honor you.   Madam Speaker, I thank the sheriff for allowing me to speak.
