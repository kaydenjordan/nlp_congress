 Mr. President, today is a historic day. Today, each Member  of the Senate will have the opportunity to cast a vote on the  nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an Associate Justice of  the U.S. Supreme Court. I say ``historic'' because throughout our  Nation's history, only 115 people have served on the Supreme Court.  Until now, only five of the Supreme Court Justices have been women.  Only two of the Justices have been Black. And none has been a Black  woman. So history, indeed, and long overdue.   But I am not going to cast my vote in support of Judge Jackson's  confirmation because she is a woman or because she is Black; I will  cast that vote because she is eminently qualified to serve in the  position to which she has been nominated.   Her nomination shouldn't just be welcomed; it should be celebrated.  It is a major step forward for our democracy. It is further widening  the lens to help make our Nation more inclusive and more representative  with each passing generation.   She is one of the most qualified nominees to the Supreme Court that I  have ever considered in my 48 years here: a graduate of Harvard and  Harvard Law School; a judicial clerk at the district, circuit, and  Supreme Court levels; a Federal appellate judge; a Federal district  court judge; a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission; an attorney in  private practice. And she will be the first ever Justice who has served  as a public defender, bringing that much needed perspective to the  Court. No one--no one--can argue that Judge Jackson is not objectively  qualified to be confirmed.   The manufactured accusations that were thrown at her by some of our  committee during our hearings not only fell flat, but they have been  refuted and debunked by serious voices across the political spectrum.  They hold no water. They serve only to showcase the vitriol and the  contempt with which some Members of this body approach their sacred  constitutional role of advice and consent.   I said it during the hearings, and I will say it again: It is  distressing, it is disheartening, and as the dean of the Senate, it is  saddening. Yet I find hope in the fact that Judge Jackson's  confirmation to our highest Court will have the bipartisan support it  deserves and it commands. I commend the Republican Senators who have  lauded her qualifications and staked their support of her nomination.  Judge Jackson has earned the President's nomination, and she has earned  confirmation from the Senate.   Each and every day, millions of American families are living their  lives, and how they live those lives--from the salaries they make to  the education their children receive and scores of issues in between-- is directly impacted by the decisions made at the Supreme Court.   The Supreme Court--in fact, all of our courts can't be ivory towers,  accessible only to and bending to the will of a select few in our  society. They have to be accountable to all--all--all Americans. To do  so, they must reflect the diversity of our Nation, the diversity that  is at the foundation of our democracy--diversity of gender, of race, of  creed, of education and history--but also diversity of thought and life  experiences. Judge Jackson brings that and more to the Bench.   Mr. President, I am proud to be the President pro tempore of the  Senate, and I was proud to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee in the  past. In that regard, I voted for the first woman to ever serve on the  Supreme Court. I voted for the first Latina to serve on the Supreme  Court. I voted on thousands of judicial nominations, nominees of both  Republican and Democratic Presidents. I voted for nominations to the  Supreme Court who were put forward by Republican Presidents.   I have long lamented the increasing political gamesmanship that has  infected our current confirmation process, and many times on this  floor, I have warned about the dire consequences for our courts and for  our democracy of converting our confirmation process into a zero-sum  game where one party wins and one party loses. But to change that  gamesmanship requires that we have some adults in the room, that we all  come here to the floor of the U.S. Senate not to score a headline or a  trending tweet but simply to do our jobs. There are only 100 of us to  represent this whole country. So who is going to do that today, simply  do their job?   I have taken a clear look at Judge Jackson's record. I heard her  testimony 2 weeks ago. I met with her. I read opinions that she has  written. I spent hours listening to her. I saw her intellect, her  humility, and her temperament on full display.   Mr. President, she is the Justice we need now. For America today, for  the generations to come, for our children and our grandchildren, for  all of us, I will cast my vote to confirm Judge Jackson, and I will do  it proudly.   I hope the Senate can rise to this moment. I hope it can be the  deliberative body the Founders envisioned when they conceived of this  great experiment. Our independent judiciary--in fact, our democracy-- demands it of us.   Mr. President, history will remember the votes cast here today. I  will proudly vote aye.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, among the many barbaric atrocities  committed by Russian soldiers in Ukraine where civilian infrastructure  including hospitals, schools, and apartment buildings have been  repeatedly bombed and shelled and countless civilians have been  summarily executed in the streets, the New York Times reports today  that the Russians are using a new kind of landmine.   This mine, called the POM-3, is inherently indiscriminate like other  mines in that it cannot distinguish between a civilian and a combatant,  and it is apparently equipped with a sensor that triggers the explosive  when a person approaches. With a kill radius of 50 feet, it is even  more deadly than a typical anti-personnel mine. And, unlike typical  landmines, it cannot be disarmed by a human deminer because anyone who  approaches it is likely to become a victim before reaching it. So it  will be necessary to use robots to clear these mines, at great  additional time and expense. As in other countries affected by armed  conflict, it will be many years and almost certainly decades after the  fighting ends, before the people of Ukraine can walk safely without  fear of mines and other unexploded ordnance.   Human beings seem to have an unlimited capacity to devise new ways of  destroying the lives of others. Landmines are especially insidious  because they maim or kill whoever comes into contact with them, or, in  the case of the POM-3, whosever's footsteps it detects. It could be  anyone, including a young child.   No matter how ``sophisticated'' the technology, mines are an  exceedingly primitive weapon because they are designed to be  indiscriminate in an age of so-called precision munitions.   Mines are the opposite. While landmines are so easy to make that it  will never be possible to completely eliminate them, in 1997, the  international community took an historic step, thanks in large part to  the leadership of former Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy and  the tireless advocacy of the International Campaign to Ban landmines.   In December of that year, countries came together to sign the  Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production, and  Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, known  informally as the Ottawa Treaty or the Mine Ban Treaty. Today, the  treaty has 164 states parties. But one of the reasons anti-personnel  mines have yet to be universally stigmatized is because key countries  including Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and the United States have  not joined the treaty.   Of course, when one country joins a treaty, it does not guarantee  that others will. But the more countries that do, the harder it is for  others to fail to do so, as they become the outliers, the pariahs. So  if the United States, which has not used anti-personnel mines since  1991, were to join the treaty it would not guarantee that Russia would.  But it would greatly enhance our credibility to call out their use of  mines, their devastating effects on innocent civilians, and the need to  universalize the treaty.   In 1994, President Clinton, at the United Nations, called for ridding  the world of anti-personnel mines. He also directed the Pentagon to  develop alternatives. They never did. While we can drive a robot on  Mars 100 million miles away, our own military continues to stockpile  landmines that are triggered by the victim. Whether a U.S. soldier or a  child, our landmines, like Russian landmines, cannot tell the  difference.   If anything good can come of this catastrophic and senseless war in  Ukraine, it would be for the international community to bring to  justice those responsible for war crimes and for the United States to  once and for all renounce the use of anti-personnel landmines. These  are not weapons that belong in the arsenals of civilized nations and  certainly not in the arsenal of the most powerful, modern military on  Earth. Let us be the country that not only denounces their use in  Ukraine, but denounces and renounces their use everywhere. What a gift  to the world that would be.   I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article entitled  ``New Russian Land Mine Poses Special Risk in Ukraine'' be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From The New York Times, April 6, 2022]            New Russian Land Mine Poses Special Risk in Ukraine                              (By John Ismay)         Washington--Russian forces in Ukraine appear to be using a       new type of weapon as they step up attacks on civilian       targets: an advanced land mine equipped with sensors that can       detect when people walk nearby.        Ukrainian bomb technicians discovered the device, called       the POM-3, last week near the eastern city of Kharkiv,       according to Human Rights Watch, a leading human rights       group, which has reviewed photos provided by Ukraine's       military.        Older types of land mines typically explode when victims       accidentally step on them or disturb attached tripwires. But       the POM-3's seismic sensor picks up on approaching footsteps       and can effectively distinguish between humans and animals.        Humanitarian deminers and groups that campaign against the       use of land mines said the POM-3 would make future efforts to       locate and destroy unexploded munitions in Ukraine vastly       more complicated and deadlier.        ``These create a threat that we don't have a response       for,'' said James Cowan, who leads the HALO Trust, a British       American charity that clears land mines and other explosive       remnants of war to help countries recover after conflicts.       The group began removing unexploded munitions from the Donbas       region of eastern Ukraine in 2016, after Russian-backed       separatists started fighting the Ukrainian government.        ``We'll need to find some donors to procure robotics that       can allow us to deal with these threats at some distance,''       Mr. Cowan added.        The POM-3 is typically launched by a rocket and falls back       to earth by parachute before sticking into the ground--where       it waits, according to CAT-UXO, an online resource for       military and civilian bomb technicians. When the mine senses       a person, it launches a small explosive warhead that       detonates midair, producing fragments that are lethal up to       about 50 feet away.        Mr. Cowan, a retired British Army major general, said his       staff of 430 Ukrainians clearing unexploded munitions in       Donbas had been unable to continue working since Russia       launched a full invasion of the country in late February,       with many staff members temporarily relocating in Ukraine. He       anticipates that in the future, HALO's operation across the       country will require about 2,500 workers, given that many       areas outside Donbas are now contaminated with unexploded       munitions as well.        U.S. government officials have said Russia appears to be       moving troops to consolidate its hold on Donetsk and Luhansk,       which could mean that even more weapons like the POM-3 will       be used in the war.        ``The war is entering a static phase--trenches are being       dug,'' Mr. Cowan said. ``This is the time when I would expect       the Russians to start using land mines on a massive basis.''        HALO, which stands for Hazardous Area Life-Support       Organization, has about 10,000 employees around the world and       is among the few international nonprofits that have remained       in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control of Kabul, the       capital, in August. Mr. Cowan said the future cleanup in       Ukraine would require roughly the same number of workers as       HALO's current operation in Afghanistan, which is recovering       from decades of armed conflict.        The POM-3 is just one new hazard among many that his       organization expects to encounter, in addition to an untold       number of rockets, bombs and artillery shells that failed to       detonate on impact. Russia has also attacked Ukrainian arms       depots, causing fires and explosions that typically fling       hundreds or even thousands of damaged munitions into       surrounding areas.        Once widely used around the world, antipersonnel land mines       often kill and maim civilians long after hostilities have       ceased. Ukraine is one of the 164 nations that have signed a       1997 treaty banning the use of antipersonnel land mines and       pledged to purge their stockpiles. The United States and       Russia have refused to join it.  [[Page S2085]]         The treaty does not prohibit the use of antitank land       mines--which typically have a much larger explosive charge       and are designed to detonate only when a vehicle drives over       or near them--nor does it address improvised explosive       devices built to destroy vehicles. Videos posted on social       media purport to show both antitank mines and improvised bomb       attacks on Russian vehicles in Ukraine.        Russia's use of land mines was among the discussions at an       event on Tuesday on Capitol Hill for the United Nations'       international mine awareness day, which brought together       groups that focus on the issue and lawmakers from Congress's       Unexploded Ordnance/Demining Caucus.        ``Wars end, they stay,'' Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat       of Vermont, said of land mines and unexploded munitions.       ``The targets are invariably civilians, and they are in       places where you have a limited ability to provide lifesaving       medical care.''        ``Look at what's happening in Ukraine--Russia is placing       land mines in people's homes, as well as children's       playgrounds and places where people go,'' Mr. Leahy said.       ``That's using it as a weapon of terror.''                            ____________________
