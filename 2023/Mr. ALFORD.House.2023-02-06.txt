 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the most critical  national security threat our Nation is facing today: the Chinese  Communist Party and their invasion of our U.S. airspace.   The recent Chinese surveillance balloon was allowed to fly unchecked  from one end of our country to the other, reaffirming that the CCP is  the top threat to our national security. I am beyond outraged at the  fact that this administration has allowed this to happen.   Was he asleep behind the wheel of his Corvette?   Unfortunately, that does seem to be the case because this did not  just occur for hours, it went on for days.   At the hands of this administration, the CCP was allowed to invade  our airspace, and it happened right over our district, right over  Whiteman Air Force Base, the home of the B-2 stealth bomber.   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I will not back down  until we get answers.   We cannot allow China to walk all over us and outpace us militarily.  This administration continues to project weakness on the world stage,  and it must end. We need answers. We must have a plan to stop the  Chinese Communist Party's clear and blatant military aggression.                            ____________________
