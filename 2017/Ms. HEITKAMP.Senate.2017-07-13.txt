 That is OK. I am from the better Dakota. I just have to  tell you.   Mr. President, I am always perplexed when the opposition party, the  Republican Party, says: We are the party of business. We are the party  that believes that government should function more like a business. We  are the party that believes that we have to make the tough decisions,  we have to do the work that needs to get done, and we have to do it in  a timely fashion.   OK, I get that. There is not a corporate board in America confronted  with the challenge that we have in healthcare that would not shore up  the  [[Page S3974]]  cost-saving payments. When you look at those of us who have served on  corporate boards, those of us who have spent some time in the private  sector, and, certainly, those of us who have been county officials or  State officials, where we have actually had to make decisions, we look  at how you make those decisions. The first thing you do is to try to  make sure that while you are deliberating and while you are making  decisions, you don't create market disruption. You don't do the things  that create more uncertainty. You stabilize what you can, triage what  you can, and then take a look at what the advantages are and what the  experience you can bring to bear is to resolve bigger, broader, and  more systemic issues.   If we look today at where we are right now with our constituents or  our customers, if we can put it in a business sense, our customers are  Americans and American families. Guess what. As for those of us who  have been in our States and who have spent time looking at healthcare,  talking to people about healthcare, talking to providers about  healthcare, I will tell you that there are two emotions they have. They  are mad, and they are scared. They are probably more scared than mad  because under the bills that are being deliberated here, the Republican  healthcare bills, they don't know if they can continue to keep their  disabled children at home with them. They don't know if they can  continue to provide for their parents in a nursing home. They don't  know if their rural hospital is going to be able to survive the kinds  of reductions in payments that are anticipated under this bill.   Today in North Dakota, $250 million is the value of Medicaid  expansion. I have institutions in North Dakota, providers in North  Dakota that are operating on razor-thin margins. They can't make ends  meet without making sure that they keep that amount of uncompensated  care greatly reduced. They need the cash flow.   If we raise uncompensated care, two things will happen. The first  thing that will happen under this bill is that they will have a hit to  their bottom line. The second and obvious consequence of that is that,  when they negotiate with the private insurance market on what those  next payments are going to be, they are going to ask for more money to  put back on the private insurance market the cost of uncompensated  care.   Let's also take a look at the growing issue in this country of  opioids. I have a facility in southwestern North Dakota. Their new  hospital anticipates that Medicaid is going to be about 14 to 17  percent of the billings they have. As they are trying to respond--as  responsible healthcare providers would--to the opioid crisis, they are  looking at converting the old hospital into a long-term facility, a  facility where people can go and get healthcare when they are addicted.   They anticipate that the facility will have to rely on about 60 to 70  percent Medicaid reimbursement. When people tell you that these issues  aren't intertwined, that the population that is going to need  assistance in recovery from addiction is not our Medicaid population,  they are wrong. Every person who has looked at this has come to the  same conclusion.   The other thing I am going to tell you about the people whom I talked  to is that most of them have never been involved in politics. They are  not partisans. They don't really even care about politics, but they  wonder why they are caught up in this tidal wave of political rhetoric  when people are scaring them about whether they are going to have  health insurance. They are wondering: What kind of responsible leaders  would ever do that? What kind of responsible leaders would not do what  they could today to provide some assurances in the near term that the  health insurance is going to be available, that their Medicaid is going  to be available, and that they are going to be able to take care of  their kids?   I am telling you that, instead of continuing to release bad bill  after bad bill, I hope the Republicans will come and honestly take us  at our word. We stand ready to work with Republicans on a truly  bipartisan bill that is going to deliver quality healthcare to North  Dakotans and quality healthcare to the people of this country.   People think bipartisanship can't happen. That is not true. Yesterday  I held a press conference on a completely separate issue that involves  clean coal. Standing side by side when we announced that bill, we had  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, one of the most vocal advocates for  aggressive action on climate, and Senators Barrasso, Capito, and me,  the most vocal advocates in support of coal. We all stood together  introducing this bill because we wanted to offer a real solution on  45Q. We wanted to find out where that lane is where we can all coexist  and solve the problems of the American people.   It is not impossible to do this. It is not impossible if we park the  partisanship, if we park the ideology, and if we start examining what  the true problems and the true issues with our healthcare system are.   The answer is usually in the middle. Has Medicaid worked to get more  people with chronic conditions, to manage care, and to lower costs? The  answer is yes. Are there too many people on Medicaid? The answer is  yes.   We need to grow our economy. We need to help people move them into a  workplace where they have workplace insurance. Instead of talking about  how we are going to grow the economy, instead of talking about how we  are going to raise wages, instead of talking about how we are going to  help people get set, we are talking about shifting the responsibility  of the sickest among us, shifting that responsibility to the States and  back to the patients.   Just 2 weeks ago, I joined 15 of my colleagues trying to bring some  commonsense bills forward. I thought we made a great case. We have been  challenged: You really don't want to work with us.   That is all facade. That is not true. We are back here again, saying:  Please, please, work with us. Let's just for a moment do what Senator  McConnell suggested we do. Let's take care of what is happening with  the 2018 plan year. Let's remove the uncertainty as we are looking at  premiums going up and skyrocketing because of that uncertainty. Let's  remove that uncertainty and solve this problem.   That is why I am supporting my colleague Senator Shaheen's  legislation that makes cost-sharing payments permanent and increases  the eligibility and generosity for that benefit.   I also cosponsored Senator Carper and Senator Kaine's bill to make  the reinsurance program for the individual marketplace permanent and to  devote resources to outreach and enrollment efforts. As a result, it  would encourage insurance companies to offer more plans in a greater  number of markets, improving competition, and driving down costs.   Isn't that what we all want? Everyone can agree that is the  consequence of this legislation.   Also, earlier this week I introduced another commonsense bill--the  Addressing Affordability for More Americans Act. That helps make  healthcare more affordable for middle-class families. What does that  mean? We know that right now on the exchanges--when we look at  subsidization of families on the exchange--we have what we call a cliff  event. You are either in or you are out, and there is no stepdown. Many  of our middle-class families could experience a joyous event called a  pay raise, only to find out that the pay raise evaporates because they  lose some of the tax advantages that they received because they bought  health insurance on a private exchange.   Why don't we glide that out? The same is true, actually, for  Medicaid. Is there an opportunity to take that slide out, or that glide  out, and moving more people into the workplace who are on Medicaid?   I share concerns that people have that the subsidization on both  Medicaid and on the individual marketplace may result in people not  taking economic opportunities that are available to them because, in  the long run, it doesn't pencil out, given where they will be with  healthcare. Let's take that incentive out. Let's work together. Let's  solve that problem.   I think our bill is the starting point. If people have a better idea  on how to address that concern, I stand willing and ready to make that  work. I want to say that we are here saying: Let's work together. We  are here saying: We do not believe that, on this side of the aisle, we  have all the answers.   Guess what. I don't believe that, on that side of the aisle, they  have all the  [[Page S3975]]  answers. I believe we could learn an incredible amount from a hearing  with a bipartisan group of Governors who are going to be responsible.  They are going to get this heaped into their lap if this passes. That  is why you see a bipartisan group of Governors saying: You know what,  keep it, because that is not a path forward.   If you want to hear some good ideas, I think we could hear some great  ideas from the corporate America that has become self-insured--as they  look at wellness programs, as they look at using big data metrics to  help keep their population healthier and drive down costs, and as they  negotiate for better deals with providers.   There are hundreds of ideas out there. There are hundreds of  opportunities to learn more before we take this step, but what is the  process we are in? The process we are in is this: Don't confuse me with  the facts. Don't confuse me with a new idea. Don't confuse me because,  politically, we have to do this.   Do you know what? No one, politically, has to do this. What we have  been sent here to do is not to fulfill political promises. We have been  sent here to legislate in the best interest of the American people and  the people of our States. That is our job--not to represent a partisan  political idea. Let's do it.   Let's bring in a whole lot of ideas, and let's park the ideology at  the door. Everybody, park the ideology at the door. As so many people  on the other side of the aisle would say, let's start acting in a  business, yeoman-like manner and start working through these problems.   We have to do what Senator Shaheen has suggested, and that is to buy  some time by making sure that we don't disrupt the marketplace today.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.    Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with  the comments from the former Governor and now Senator from the great  State of New Hampshire.   It is not enough to say the system is failing. It is not enough to  come here and say: We can fix it if you just agree to vote the way we  are voting. If you just agree, you can present any amendments you want.  You can do whatever you want.   We don't even have a CBO score on this legislation. We don't know  what is in this legislation. There have been no hearings so that people  on both sides of the aisle can ask questions and say: What does this  mean for a family on traditional Medicaid who has to rely on this to  keep custody of their kids? And by the way, what does it mean if, as a  result of losing their Medicaid coverage, those children are no longer  able to stay at home and they become foster children because it is the  only way they can get healthcare? What does it mean for those families  about whom we all think we ought to have a real discussion, young  people, young families who have excellent health, how they might have  been disadvantaged on the exchange? What do we need to do for them?  Maybe they were doing better economically than a lot of folks until  they hit the cliff.   That is why I want to see my bill debated, because it can, in fact,  offer opportunity. Every time we talk about this, what we hear about is  how much it would cost. Well, the bottom line is that if all you do is  shift the burden of these costs without any discussions with Governors,  with private payers, with corporate America that is self-insured--if  all we are doing is shifting costs and saying ``It is now your  problem,'' we are not doing our job.   If you look at the Rand Corporation study, 12 percent of the  population of this country has five or more chronic diseases. As a  result of those unmanaged--typically unmanaged chronic diseases, what  you will see is they incur 40 percent of the cost. Is that a problem?  The answer is yes, that is a problem. We need to figure out how we can  better manage chronic disease.   A great friend of mine, a guy named Richie Carmona, who once was the  Surgeon General of this country, used to say--and I think it is true-- 70 percent of all healthcare costs are related to chronic disease, most  of which is preventible. Where in any of these bills are we talking  about prevention? Where are we talking about wellness? Where are we  talking about bending the healthcare curve? We are only dumping and  running with these bills. We are not doing our job, and as a result, we  are frightening people in this country. We are frightening the elderly.  We are frightening people who say: Right now, I can afford my health  insurance; I am on an exchange. But when we change the ratio from 1-to- 3 to 1-to-5 and reduce the amount of subsidies, then 30, 40, 50 percent  of their disposable income will be used to pay for health insurance.  That is the thing you are not hearing here.   So we have to come together. We have to come together with the  fundamental questions of what is wrong with not just the Affordable  Care Act but what is wrong with healthcare and how we fix it and how we  change outcomes. We can't do that if we don't work together. This is a  body that is divided 48 to 52. How do you come together if you don't  come to the middle, if you don't come to the middle to compromise? You  don't.    At the end of the day, we have not met our deepest obligation, which  is to speak for those who are the least fortunate among us. We have not  met our obligation to govern this country in a way that would make our  Founding Fathers proud, to make our citizens proud, and that can  advance this idea that the U.S. Congress can get something done in the  United States of America--instead of partisan rancor.   We hold out the hope that we will at one point be able to debate  these ideas that we presented. We hold out the hope that we will, in  fact, meet somewhere to arrive at a better plan for the delivery of  healthcare in this country.   I just want to close with one thought. There is not one organized  healthcare group or advocacy group in my State that supports the  Republican healthcare plan, so as we are looking at judgment on that  plan, don't take my word for it. Take the medical associations' word  for it, take the hospital associations' word for it, take AARP's word  for it, take the consortium of large hospitals in my State, which urged  a ``no'' vote on this legislation, take the disabled children's  advocacy groups' word for it. This is not a path forward, but we are  big enough people and good enough leaders that we can forge a path  forward if we just find the will to do it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, before the chair of the Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations leaves, I also would like to put into  the Record that, recently, in a raid that was performed in the  Philippines, some very interesting documentation was seized about  backpage, according to news reports, and the FBI was immediately  called.   I think there is an opportunity to use that information to advance  the investigation and to continue to expose the participation of  backpage, not just as a billboard or as a want ad but as a knowing  participant in the trafficking of children--not just in our country but  globally.   I thank the chairman.    Madam President, one thing I want to talk about, as we  are talking about carbon utilization--and Joe did a great job of  talking about new technologies. Frequently when I talk about this topic  people say: There is no such thing as clean coal. Coal cannot be a  clean energy source. And I say: That is not true. I tell them about my  personal experience with the largest carbon sequestration storage  program in the country, up until some of the new developments, and that  was Dakota Gas. I served on the board of directors of Dakota Gas, and,  ironically, the carbon capture and transmission into an oil field was  not done to respond to concerns globally about carbon; it was done to  produce a salable and lucrative byproduct--CO2--which can be  used in the oil fields.   The one point I want to make is that a lot of the new development in  exploration and in production of oil is done in tight formations, shale  formations. This is not a technology, CO2 flooding isn't a  technology that has been widely used in tight formations because we  haven't figured out how to do it.   I want to acknowledge one of those great American corporations,  Occidental Petroleum, for doing something they call huff and puff,  where they inject the CO2. They basically let that sit in  the well and then eventually recharge the well. They are seeing  excellent results in using this as an enhanced oil recovery method.   We are very excited about the bipartisan group. We are very excited  that we can take one of the most contentious issues--one of the most  contentious issues here on the floor--an issue for which, time after  time, no one could find a path forward, and we have met with great  success in getting good people to come together.   Finally, I want to say that it has been a joy to work with the junior  Senator from West Virginia. I spend a lot of time with the senior  Senator from West Virginia. The junior Senator from West Virginia, from  my experience, is always looking for solutions to problems--not adding  to the rancor, but looking for solutions to real problems. We have had  a great partnership, and I look forward to our continued partnership in  promoting and moving this issue forward.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Felicia  Lucci, an AAAS fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  duration of today's session of the Senate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
