 Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman DeLauro for  yielding to me, along with her staff for working on these seven bills,  along with the ranking member, Kay Granger.   Even though I know we do have some differences, I know we will also  get together toward the end of the year. Having said that, I stand in  opposition to the en bloc amendments.   I also stand in opposition to the recent Nuclear Regulatory  Commission, NRC, conduct which runs counter to Federal law. The NRC is  fighting massive opposition from elected officials, including two  Governors, a Democratic Governor from New Mexico and a Republican  Governor from Texas, and the public against the licensing of nuclear  fuel storage facilities in Texas and New Mexico.   That is why I offered and withdrew my amendment in the committee  markup, so we can work and continue working as this bill moves forward.  The NRC not only lacks the consent but is acting unilaterally despite  clear opposition in a bipartisan way. The law is very clear. Section  42, U.S. Code 10155, says that the Governor can disapprove--and again,  both Governors have disapproved. Section 42, U.S. Code 10166, notice of  disapproval, also talks about when the Governor gives the disapproval.   Again, the Republican Governor from Texas and the Democratic Governor  from New Mexico have done that.   The law is clear. They have to follow the law, and we must clarify  that NRC can only license a DOE-monitored retrievable storage facility  once consent has been given by the State and the local community.   I want to thank Chairwoman Kaptur for expressing her willingness to  work with myself and Ranking Member Kay Granger on this particular  issue that is so important to us.   I am confident that the final version of this legislation will  clearly establish the NRC consent-based licensing approval standard.
