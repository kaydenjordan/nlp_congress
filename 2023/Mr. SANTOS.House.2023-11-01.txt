 Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Goldman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Mr. Speaker, efforts taken by other Members in this body to act as  judge, jury, and executioner are unconscionable and reckless to our  Republican system of government and to the integrity of this body.   I stand today to continue to prove my innocence of these allegations  and charges leveled against me. I would like to say I understand the  point of view of my colleagues, but I don't.                                time  1730    One can't say that they are pro-Constitution and at the same time act  as judge, jury, and executioner.   Where is the consistency, Mr. Speaker?   The actions taken within this body are delicate, and consistency is  essential. Now is not the time to set a dangerous precedent.  [[Page H5217]]    Consider this: The last time a Member of Congress was expelled was in  2002, following a criminal conviction. In fact, both expulsions in the  last two centuries took place after the defendants had been convicted.   To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I would like to  remind you that many of you are supporting another Member of Congress  who is under investigation--it is the second time he has been  indicted--and even one who recently pleaded guilty to a crime. Rather  than calling for their resignation, here we are.   I must warn my colleagues that voting for expulsion at this point  would circumvent the judicial system's right to due process that I am  entitled to and desanctify the long-held premise that one is presumed  innocent until proven guilty.   It is unconscionable to think that this body, which is at war with  the DOJ over their politically motivated practices, would blindly  accept their accusation against a member of another branch of  government.   We were each elected to Congress because our constituents supported  our pledge to uphold the Constitution, protect our liberties, and put  their needs first. We swore with our palms to the Bible to do so.   This expulsion, unfortunately, is politically motivated by some  Members within this body. They believe that by attempting to expel me,  they will garner political points, capitalize on political fundraising,  and receive congratulations from those who do not approve of my voting  record.   During this Congress, we have seen the world set aflame, our allies  attacked, recession looming, crime out of control, an unprecedented  border crisis, and the diminishment of American power, prestige, and  respect at home and around the globe. We should focus on solving these  pressing issues that plague our Nation and that affect our citizens  every single day. Instead, we are prioritizing petty politics and  undermining the integrity of our system of government, all for  political cheap gains.   Pettifog all you want, but you can never say I am not committed to  serving my constituents of New York's Third Congressional District. I  have strived to build relationships and institutional acumen to  represent and legislate for my people back home. Since I took office,  over 1,100 cases for constituents have been solved, key relationships  with stakeholders in the district have been built, and a fresh voice of  common sense and servant leadership has returned to New York.   My office has no strings attached to political parties and  apparatuses back home, so I am free to represent them openly here  without the overlords of the GOP over my head in New York and Nassau  County.   My office has done instrumental work regarding passports,  collaborating with State and local agencies, working with the  Department of State throughout this ongoing Israel crisis for  constituents overseas, and countless other requests.   In addition, I am proud to have two fully staffed district offices  serving the constituents of New York's Third District, participating in  the service academy nominations for dozens of exceptional candidates  from Long Island and Northeast Queens, and being involved in the  Congressional Art Competition.   One of my highest honors of being in Congress was presenting a Purple  Heart medal to a World War I hero's surviving family member after years  of them attempting to garner this from my predecessor. I will never  cease to honor those who have defended this Republic and our homeland.   From my involvement in assisting residents of New York's Third  District being held hostage by Hamas terrorists to my contributions in  the effort to close the migrant shelter at the Creedmoor facility in  Bellerose, being a champion for the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings  Point, and my resolve to clamp down on China's growing influence  against American interests, there is one thing consistent and  unwavering, and that is dedication to selfless service. This motivates  me to work day in and day out on behalf of them and to represent their  interests and values.   I am proud to have one of the most conservative voting records in the  118th Congress and the most conservative voting record in New York's  delegation. I will never apologize for voting in line with conservative  principles and my district.   Let us remember our commitment to justice ensures that the  presumption of innocence is upheld in all cases.   I requested that my evaluation be based on the work I do in this  body, and you granted me a reprieve earlier this year on the advice of  former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy. I am asking the Chamber to  please uphold those same principles today.   I hope that my colleagues come to their senses and recognize that the  perilous consequences of a trial by media are damaging. The loss of the  presumption of innocence establishes a dangerous precedent that  threatens the very foundation of our legal system, and we risk losing  the trust that the American people have placed in us by passing  judgment without due process.   If we work together, we can protect the integrity of our system and  the rights of all citizens.   I am fighting tooth and nail to clear my name in front of the entire  world, Mr. Speaker. It hasn't been easy, but I am fighting by God's  grace.   On a final note, as we wear these pins and stand within these  Chambers as elected Members of Congress, we cannot speak out of both  sides of our mouths. Promising to uphold the principles of the  Constitution while simultaneously trampling on the principles that  underpin our fundamental rights granted by the Constitution is  hypocrisy.   I hope that the House will understand the scope of this vote and have  the courage to do what is right, not what is politically expedient.    I stand firmly in my innocence and my passion to represent the people  of New York's Third District if the voters would continue to have me.  It is their responsibility and their responsibility alone to elect or  remove me from Congress.   Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to make my case directly to  you.   For God, for country, for liberty. God bless the United States of  America, and I yield back the balance of my time.
