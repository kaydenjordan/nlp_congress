 Mr. President, each week the U.S. Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship recognizes one small business  that exemplifies the hard work and perseverance of the American Dream  and the American entrepreneur. The great State of Nevada is home to  more than 250,000 small businesses of all types, from mom-and-pop shop  bakeries to world renowned cyber security firms. Nevada's small  businesses are the driving force behind our State's rapidly growing  economy and the engine that powers our communities. It is therefore my  honor to recognize Nevada's Expertise Cosmetology Institute, a small  business with a strong and deep-rooted commitment to improving lives  and a desire to give back to the community, for recently having been  named the U.S. Senate Small Business of the Week.   Small businesses, especially minority-owned small businesses, are  breaking down barriers in every corner of Nevada. Expertise Cosmetology  Institute is the first African-American-owned school of cosmetology in  Nevada and helps many of their students receive degrees in cosmetology,  hair design, nail technology, aesthetics, and barbering. Expertise  Cosmetology Institute equips its students with the knowledge to thrive  in the barbering and salon industry and ensures graduates have the  skills necessary to succeed post-graduation. Students gain a  comprehensive knowledge of State regulations, training on the latest  trends, and most importantly, how to manage a small business of their  own. Expertise Cosmetology offers financial aid to those students who  qualify so no student with the desire to succeed in this industry is  left behind.   I would also like to recognize Mrs. Gwen Braimoh who, in addition to  managing Expertise Cosmetology, also runs the Expertise New Path  program in Nevada. The Expertise New Path program helps women earn  their cosmetology license while incarcerated at Florence McClure  Women's Correctional Center in North Las Vegas, NV. Mrs. Braimoh's  passion for helping the less fortunate and those who wish to build a  better life for themselves is changing lives and improving our  communities across the State of Nevada.   Small businesses truly are the driving force for development and  growth not just in Nevada but across our entire Nation. Small  businesses like Gwen's not only help our economy succeed, they also  give back by uplifting our communities, inspiring others to  [[Page S5443]]  open businesses of their own and changing lives for the better.   Again, I would like to recognize Mrs. Gwen Braimoh and all the  employees at Expertise Cosmetology Institute for their contribution to  Nevada and our Nation and congratulate them for being named the Senate  Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee's Small Business of the  Week.                            ____________________
