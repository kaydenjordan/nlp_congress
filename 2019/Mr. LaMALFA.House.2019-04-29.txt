 Mr. Speaker, as Members have all heard, this weekend our  Nation experienced another horrific attack on the Jewish people during  Passover, this time in a shooting at a San Diego-area synagogue.   This is something that I am afraid is becoming too commonplace, and  we are becoming comfortable with this type of violence against Jewish  people around our country and even around the world.   Multiple people were injured. One person even lost her life, Lori  Gilbert-Kaye. Eyewitnesses claimed she died while shielding the Rabbi  from gunfire, her friend of more than 30 years.   Almog Peretz shepherded many children away from the gunfire and  toward safety.   While most people, understandably, were fleeing this violence, Army  veteran, Oscar Stewart, instinctively ran towards the gunfire, which  froze the shooter. He was shouting and intimidating the shooter which  eventually chased him off.   From there, off-duty U.S. Border Patrol Officer Jonathan Morales  joined him in the parking lot with a handgun and shot several rounds at  the shooter's car which made him continue to flee.    There is no telling how bad this could have gotten without the  heroics of these folks. And as Oscar Stewart alluded, a good guy with a  gun can stop a bad guy with a gun, and it happened in this case.   Join me in praying for Lori Gilbert-Kaye and her family, and for all  those who were injured. God bless those who stepped up and saved the  lives of others.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Bishop and Mr. Van Drew for  their work on this effort here tonight.   I am very excited about the support for this bill, and of course, I  rise tonight in support of H.R. 317, which is the Santa Ynez Band of  Chumash Indians Land Affirmation Act.   It has always been a bipartisan effort to affirm the Department of  the Interior to take land into trust for the benefit of the Chumash  Tribe, codifying agreements reached between the Tribe and the county of  Santa Barbara after much work.   I am very proud of the good faith, bipartisan effort that has gone  into this bill both in Congress and in the local community.   For the several years I have been involved with this legislation, I  have seen the Chumash Indians and the local government work together to  build trust and act as good neighbors to forge an agreement that works  for everyone.   There is nothing controversial about this bill. It simply ensures the  Tribe has the ability to provide housing for its members. I can't think  of anyone who really should take issue with that effort.   In fact, last Congress, this bill was passed both out of the Natural  Resources Committee and on this House floor with unanimous consent.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, in the committee, Chairman Grijalva and Ranking  Member Bishop for their hard work in support of this legislation  through the whole way.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank my colleague Congressman Salud Carbajal  from the Chumash homeland area who has been the region's representative  and an original cosponsor of this bill. He has played a key role in  facilitating these discussions at the local level, and I appreciate it.   Located in Santa Barbara, the recorded history of the Chumash reaches  back to the earliest arrival of Europeans in California when the  Spanish explorer Cabrillo recorded his encounters with the Chumash in  1542.   The Chumash have a strong and unbroken connection to the Camp 4  parcel, which is what this is known as, Camp 4, which is located close  to their current reservation.   Starting in the early 1800s, the Chumash became wards of the Spanish  mission in Santa Ynez, which included Camp 4. Later, lands were granted  to them that included Camp 4 as well. A commission recognized that the  Tribe continued to reside in the Camp 4 area, though only 99 acres were  ultimately taken into trust at that time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Van Drew for pointing out that the Chumash  face a significant housing crisis. Fewer than 17 percent of the Chumash  members and lineal descendants are able to reside on the Tribe's  existing reservations, which consists largely of hillsides, wetlands,  and streambeds unsuitable for housing, and areas that they want to  preserve.   To address this shortage, the Chumash used their own resources to  purchase the Camp 4 parcel, the 1,400 acres, with the intent of  construction of homes on a small part of it.   The Tribe applied to take Camp 4 into trust administratively. After  the formal BIA process, the Department of the Interior completed the  fee-to-trust process in January 2017.   That same year, the county ratified an agreement with the Chumash,  ensuring that any impacts of Camp 4 housing on local infrastructure and  other resources would be addressed. The Department of the Interior  approved this agreement that same day.   In order to enable the Chumash to address their housing crisis and  ensure any impacts to local governments are addressed, H.R. 317 affirms  and ratifies the action of the Department of the Interior to take the  land into trust and codifies the agreement ratified between the county  and the Tribe addressing local impacts.   At the request of the Tribe, it also prohibits the operation of  gaming facilities on this parcel, which is a key element the people  would have been concerned about, and it protects and respects the  rights-of-way held by local stakeholders.   The bill represents, again, the culmination of years of good faith  negotiations by all parties and should be considered a model for  maintaining positive working relationships between Tribal governments  and local governments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure. I thank  everybody who has helped with this in a bipartisan effort.                                time  1700
