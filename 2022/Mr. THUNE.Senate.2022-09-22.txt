 Madam President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for  yielding. I appreciate his kindness. I know he has got a lot to say on  the subject, and hopefully he will be able to get back to it.                                    Energy    Madam President, I want to speak just a minute about the issue of  high energy prices and high grocery prices that have become a  distinguishing feature of the Biden economy.   Electricity prices increased 15.8 percent in August, the largest  year-over-year increase since 1981--1981. I wasn't even married the  last time we saw electricity increases like this, and now I have  grandkids.   Utility gas service was up 33 percent from a year ago in August--33  percent increase year over year from August.   The price of home heating oil, which many households in places like  New Hampshire rely on to keep their homes warm in the winter, has  soared. All told, the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  estimates that home heating costs for the winter heating season will  average $1,202--a 17.2-percent increase from last season.   I haven't even mentioned gas prices. Gas prices may have decreased  from their $5 high this summer--partly as a result of President Biden's  problematic decision to draw down our Nation's emergency petroleum  reserves to their lowest point since 1985, with no plan to refill  them--but customers are still paying $1.30 more per gallon than they  were when President Biden took office. The average price for a gallon  of gas has increased this week, ending a streak of diminishing,  although still high, gas prices.   Madam President, if there is one thing we should be doing about high  energy prices, it is increasing our domestic energy supply, including  our supply of conventional energy--namely, oil and natural gas. I am a  longtime supporter of alternative energy, and I come from a State that  derives a substantial portion of its electricity generation from wind.  In fact, in 2021, over 50 percent of our State's power generation came  from wind and 30 percent came from hydroelectric on the Missouri River.  But if it weren't for traditional fossil fuels backing up that  generation, especially on days when the wind is still, we would be left  in the dark.    The fact of the matter is, no matter how much Democrats might wish it  were otherwise, alternative energy technology has simply not advanced  to the point where our country can rely exclusively on alternative  energy. Attempting to pretend we have advanced further than we have or  have solved all the requisite supply chain hurdles will lead to nothing  but economic pain for American families.   Just look at California, whose overreliance on alternative energy  technology has resulted in an electricity grid that cannot sustain the  demands being placed on it. Californians were recently asked to ration  their energy usage and refrain from charging electric cars during  certain hours to reduce strain on the grid. Yet the State has issued a  final regulation that will require all new cars sold in the State to be  electric or otherwise zero emission by 2035. I don't see this ending  well for Californians. This is the kind of unrealistic thinking that  has permeated pretty much the entire Democratic Party.   I am all for advancing clean energy technologies. I have done a lot  of work here in Congress to advance clean energy, from renewable fuels  to wind energy. But until clean energy technology has advanced to the  point where it can truly, reliably, and affordably supply America's  energy needs, we need to continue to invest in responsible conventional  energy production as part of the ``all of the above'' energy strategy  that we need for this country. Otherwise, the high energy prices  Americans are struggling with right now could get even worse and  persist long into the future.   President Biden, of course, has been discouraging conventional energy  production since day one, which is one reason why high energy prices  have become a defining feature of the Biden administration. From  canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline, to discouraging investment in  conventional energy with a targeted ESG agenda, to making it more  difficult for oil and gas companies to develop leases, President Biden  has shown a distinct hostility to conventional energy.   Last month, the President signed into law the so-called Inflation  Reduction Act, the partisan tax-and-spending spree the Democrats jammed  through Congress in August. Now, I have mentioned the high energy  prices Americans have been experiencing. Well, apparently, Democrats  think that the best solution is to pass a bunch of new fees and tax  hikes that will drive up energy prices further.   Their so-called Inflation Reduction Act includes a slate of taxes on  conventional energy production at the worst possible time. The methane  fee in their bill alone has the potential to drive Americans' natural  gas bills by 17 percent--17 percent--just what Americans need while  they are paying 15.8 percent more for electricity and 33 percent more  for utility gas service and $1.30 more for every gallon of gasoline.   But at least Americans can feel good about the fact that their tax  dollars will be going to fund Democrats' Green New Deal fantasies, like  tax credits for wealthy Americans to purchase electric vehicles. That  is right. The so-called Inflation Reduction Act--which, by the way,  even the Democrat chairman of the Senate Budget Committee admits will  do nothing to fix inflation--pours hundreds of billions of dollars-- taxpayer dollars--into Green New Deal priorities.   In addition to tax credits for wealthy Americans, the Inflation  Reduction Act also includes funding for things like expensive electric  vehicles for the U.S. Postal Service, mitigating urban heat island  hotspots and monitoring gaps in tree canopy coverage, and climate- related political activity. That is right--climate-related political  activity.   Democrats succeeded in pushing through the Inflation Reduction Act-- and its tax hikes on conventional energy--by promising one of their  Members a vote on permitting reform legislation.   Real permitting reform is something I heartily endorse. Too many  energy permits spend years mired in bureaucracy, leading to completely  needless delays in energy development. Cleaning up the permitting  process would help advance both conventional and renewable energy  production.   Unfortunately, it is not clear that the permitting reform deal that  was released last night will do anything to meaningfully address  permitting delays and, in some cases, could make things worse.   For one, it would expand FERC's authority to override State  jurisdiction for projects the President designates as ``national  interest facilities,'' which is why the South Dakota Public Utilities  Commission is opposed to it. And it would give States wide latitude to  kill the very infrastructure projects the bill purports to expedite by  expanding the State Clean Water Act jurisdiction.   In other sections where this proposal seeks to shorten deadlines for  various stages of permitting, which is a goal I support, the  consequences for not meeting a deadline are merely notifying the Office  of Management and Budget and the lead Department Secretary. It is hard  to see this actually moving the chains.   On top of that, it is starting to seem extremely doubtful that  Democrats actually have the votes in their conference to pass  permitting reform legislation.   Republicans, thanks to the efforts of Senator Capito, have a  meaningful, substantive permitting reform bill ready to go. It is  supported by every Member of our conference. It would need the support  of just 10 Democrat Senators to pass. It would be nice to think that  there are 10 moderate Democrat Senators--if the words ``Democrat'' and  ``moderate'' can still go together in this time of the Democratic  Party's rapid push to the extreme  [[Page S4947]]  left--who would be willing to join Republicans to pass our legislation  and finally take a real step to ease the burden of high energy prices  on American families.   But given the President's and the Democratic Party's hostility to any  measure that would genuinely start addressing high energy prices, I am  not holding my breath.   High prices--for energy and just about everything else--have become  the distinguishing feature of the Biden economy, and if Democrats  continue to take steps to discourage conventional energy production,  high energy prices will be a Democrat legacy that lasts long into the  future.
