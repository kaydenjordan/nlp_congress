 Madam Speaker, it is an honor to join this House, the  newest Representative from the great State of Iowa. I rise not to speak  of division within this Chamber but to champion the importance of  providing pragmatic, solution-oriented leadership for the American  people.   Serving the people of the Third District, I am humbled by the Iowans  who voted for change and remain mindful that good representation  includes being a fighter for every single Iowan, regardless of party.   That is why I am committed to ushering in a new era of public service  for our community, one that begins with transparent, pragmatic, and  bipartisan work.   With nearly two decades as a combat veteran, intelligence officer,  and a former State legislator, service has always come before self. In  the military, it is never 9 to 5. Deployments flying over Afghanistan  meant spending time away from family, and tours overseas sacrificed  memories shared with friends. But we had a call to serve, and our  brothers and sisters in arms demanded that we complete the job.   My call to serve now is being a Representative for every Iowan in all  21 counties. Whether in Des Moines or Atlantic or Ottumwa, common  challenges facing Iowans are dire. Inflation is crippling families and  small businesses, taxes and governmental overreach are burdensome, our  communities just this week are hurting from violent crime, and  providing quality education is top of mind across our State.   As a servant in Iowa, we worked across the aisle, and we delivered,  passing the largest tax cut in State history three times over. Growing  productivity for Iowa's family farms, we are now first in corn, first  in soybean, first in hogs, and first in high school graduation--not to  mention, we are still first in the GOP caucuses.   In Iowa, small businesses kept going during the pandemic, and we  ensured that Iowa's schools were open so students and parents could  work with educators to teach the next generation of Iowa leaders.   I am a sixth-generation Iowan. I know the struggles we face. I come  from a century family farm. My mother was a nurse, and my father was a  high school math teacher; they taught my brother and me to take  responsibility and to serve with grace in our hearts. Our community  helped raise all of us.    In high school, I met my future wife, Kelly, and we are blessed with  four kids and two foster children. Our hope for them is that we can  offer what our parents provided for us.   In times of tragedy, we are reminded that family always comes first.  This week we were saddened to lose my father-in-law, Kelly's dad, Jim.  He was a union electrician, and he only voted once for a Republican.   Thank you, Jim.   He was the best grandpa to our kids, the best dad, and the best  husband. He was a man who lived his life to the fullest with the ones  he loved, which is what the world needs more of today.   The importance of family is something every Iowan can agree on. In  Congress, I would like to see more of this realized, that there are  more things that can be done to achieve the 80 percent of priorities  that we all agree on. Americans would rather spend time seeing us work  together than in partisan dogfights.   In 2023, we entered a period of divided government. But this is no  excuse for gridlock or inaction. The American people demand and deserve  leaders who are willing to work for meaningful policies to address the  challenges that we all face: high inflation, educating our kids,  protecting our communities, and energy independence that serves both  our national security and protects our natural resources.   There is always more that can be accomplished when we work together  than when we are alone. Together we can ensure a prosperous American  future for the next generation by making our country safer, stronger,  and more accountable.   With that goal in mind, I am honored to bring Iowa's influential  voice to the House Agriculture Committee and bring Des Moines'  expertise in the insurance industry to serve on the Financial Services  Committee. We have the opportunity to bring homegrown Iowa values and  priorities to the Nation's Capital. And as a D.C. outsider and citizen  legislator, I plan to take full advantage of these opportunities to  make what works in Iowa an opportunity for the entire country.   Most importantly, I will strive every single day to be a servant to  my fellow Iowans. I will also work to be the best father and husband to  my family. This means being present right in my hometown back in Iowa  where together we all work and live.   I will be traveling across the district nonstop to hear from all  Iowans in all 21 counties both urban, suburban, and rural in the new  Third Congressional District. I look forward to delivering pragmatic  solutions for Iowans and helping D.C. along the way to operate a  [[Page H289]]  little bit more like we do in Iowa: family and neighbors first, common  sense, hard work, and--as always--a little bit of Iowa nice.                            ____________________
