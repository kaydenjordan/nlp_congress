 Mr. Speaker, Georgia was one of the first States in  the country to pass a voter suppression bill after the 2020 general  election, but S.B. 202 is just our State's latest attempt to  disenfranchise minority communities.   Georgia has a long history of undermining the right to vote, from the  Jim Crow era to more recent voter roll purges and exact-match policies.  This week, news from Georgia and Florida confirmed, yet again, that  bills like S.B. 202 were adopted because Republicans are afraid that  they will lose elections if all eligible voters participate.   It is time for Congress to fix what the Supreme Court broke in 2013  when they effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act.   I proudly supported the For the People Act and the John R. Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act, both of which laid essential groundwork  toward protecting our democracy. I now look forward to supporting the  Freedom to Vote Act in the coming weeks.                            ____________________
