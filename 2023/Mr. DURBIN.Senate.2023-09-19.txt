 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Vernon Oliver to the U.S. District Court for the District of  Connecticut. Judge Oliver's long career on the bench and in public  service make him an outstanding nominee to the Federal bench.   Born and raised in Connecticut, Judge Oliver received his B.A. and  J.D. from the University of Connecticut. After spending approximately 3  years in private practice, Judge Oliver devoted the rest of his legal  career to public service, serving as an Assistant State's Attorney in  the division of criminal justice and as an Assistant Attorney General  in the child protection unit of the Connecticut Office of the Attorney  General.   In 2009, Judge Oliver was appointed to be a judge on the Connecticut  Superior Court, presiding over criminal, civil, habeas corpus, and  housing matters. On the bench, he has presided over more than 320  trials that have gone to verdict or judgment. He has also sat by  designation on the Connecticut Appellate Court in three matters.   Judge Oliver has strong support from his home State Senators, Mr.  Blumenthal and Mr. Murphy. In addition, he was unanimously rated ``well  qualified'' by the American Bar Association. Judge Oliver's deep ties  to Connecticut and significant courtroom experience, as a longtime  litigator and on the bench, make him well-positioned to serve the  District of Connecticut with distinction.   I urge my colleagues to support Judge Oliver's nomination.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) are necessarily  absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2846         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Community Access, Resources,       and Empowerment for Moms Act'' or the ``CARE for Moms Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Every year, across the United States, nearly 4,000,000       women give birth, more than 1,000 women suffer fatal       complications during pregnancy, while giving birth or during       the postpartum period, and about 70,000 women suffer near-      fatal, partum-related complications.        (2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as a proxy to       measure the overall health of a population. While the infant       mortality rate in the United States has reached its lowest       point, the risk of death for women in the United States       during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period is       higher than such risk in many other high-income countries.       The estimated maternal mortality rate (deaths per 100,000       live births) for the 48 contiguous States and Washington, DC,       increased from 14.5 percent in 2000 to 32.0 in 2021. The       United States is the only industrialized nation with a rising       maternal mortality rate.        (3) The National Vital Statistics System of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention has found that in 2021, there       were 32.9 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in       the United States. That ratio continues to exceed the rate in       other high-income countries.        (4) It is estimated that more than 80 percent of maternal       deaths in the United States are preventable.        (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, the maternal mortality rate varies drastically       for women by race and ethnicity. There are about 26.6 deaths       per 100,000 live births for White women, 69.9 deaths per       100,000 live births for non-Hispanic Black women, and 32.0       deaths per 100,000 live births for American Indian/Alaska       Native women. While maternal mortality disparately impacts       Black women, this urgent public health crisis traverses race,       ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational background, and       geography.        (6) In the United States, non-Hispanic Black women are       about 3 times more likely to die from causes related to       pregnancy and childbirth compared to non-Hispanic White       women, which is one of the most disconcerting racial       disparities in public health. This disparity widens in       certain cities and States across the country.        (7) According to the National Center for Health Statistics       of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the       maternal mortality rate heightens with age, as women 40 and       older die at a rate of 138.5 per 100,000 births compared to       20.4 per 100,000 for women under 25. This translates to women       over 40 being 6.8 times more likely to die compared to their       counterparts under 25 years of age.        (8) The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the maternal       health crisis. A study of the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention suggested that pregnant women are at a       significantly higher risk for severe outcomes, including       death, from COVID-19 as compared to non-pregnant women. The       COVID-19 pandemic also decreased access to prenatal and       postpartum care. A study by the Government Accountability       Office found that COVID-19 contributed to 25 percent of       maternal deaths in 2020 and 2021.        (9) The findings described in paragraphs (1) through (8)       are of major concern to researchers, academics, members of       the business community, and providers across the obstetric       continuum represented by organizations such as--        (A) the American College of Nurse-Midwives;        (B) the American College of Obstetricians and       Gynecologists;        (C) the American Medical Association;        (D) the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and       Neonatal Nurses;        (E) the Black Mamas Matter Alliance;        (F) the Black Women's Health Imperative;        (G) the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative;        (H) EverThrive Illinois;        (I) the Illinois Perinatal Quality Collaborative;        (J) the March of Dimes;        (K) the National Association of Certified Professional       Midwives;        (L) RH Impact: The Collaborative for Equity & Justice;        (M) the National Partnership for Women & Families;        (N) the National Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association;        (O) the Preeclampsia Foundation;        (P) the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine;        (Q) the What To Expect Project;        (R) Tufts University School of Medicine Center for Black       Maternal Health and Reproductive Justice;        (S) the Shades of Blue Project;        (T) the Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance;        (U) Tulane University Mary Amelia Center for Women's Health       Equity Research;        (V) In Our Own Voice: National Black Women's Reproductive       Justice Agenda; and        (W) Physicians for Reproductive Health.        (10) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions,       cardiomyopathy, infection or sepsis, embolism, mental health       conditions (including substance use disorder), hypertensive       disorders, stroke and cerebrovascular accidents, and       anesthesia complications are the predominant medical causes       of maternal-related deaths and complications.  [[Page S4593]]       Most of these conditions are largely preventable or       manageable. Even when these conditions are not preventable,       mortality and morbidity may be prevented when conditions are       diagnosed and treated in a timely manner.        (11) According to a study published by the Journal of       Perinatal Education, doula-assisted mothers are 4 times less       likely to have a low-birthweight baby, 2 times less likely to       experience a birth complication involving themselves or their       baby, and significantly more likely to initiate breastfeeding       and human lactation. Doula care has also been shown to       produce cost savings resulting in part from reduced rates of       cesarean and pre-term births.        (12) Intimate partner violence is one of the leading causes       of maternal death, and women are more likely to experience       intimate partner violence during pregnancy than at any other       time in their lives. It is also more dangerous than       pregnancy. Intimate partner violence during pregnancy and       postpartum crosses every demographic and has been exacerbated       by the COVID-19 pandemic.        (13) Oral health is an important part of perinatal health.       Reducing bacteria in a woman's mouth during pregnancy can       significantly reduce her risk of developing oral diseases and       spreading decay-causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some       evidence suggests that women with periodontal disease during       pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor birth outcomes,       such as preeclampsia, pre-term birth, and low-birth weight.       Furthermore, a woman's oral health during pregnancy is a good       predictor of her newborn's oral health, and since mothers can       unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, putting       their children at higher risk for tooth decay, prevention       efforts should happen even before children are born, as a       matter of pre-pregnancy health and prenatal care during       pregnancy.        (14) In the United States, death reporting and analysis is       a State function rather than a Federal process. States report       all deaths--including maternal deaths--on a semi-voluntary       basis, without standardization across States. While the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity       and system for collecting death-related data based on death       certificates, these data are not sufficiently reported by       States in an organized and standard format across States such       that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is able       to identify causes of maternal death and best practices for       the prevention of such death.        (15) Vital statistics systems often underestimate maternal       mortality and are insufficient data sources from which to       derive a full scope of medical and social determinant factors       contributing to maternal deaths, such as intimate partner       violence. While the addition of pregnancy checkboxes on death       certificates since 2003 have likely improved States'       abilities to identify pregnancy-related deaths, they are not       generally completed by obstetric providers or persons trained       to recognize pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these vital       forms may be missing information or may capture inconsistent       data. Due to varying maternal mortality-related analyses,       lack of reliability, and granularity in data, current       maternal mortality informatics do not fully encapsulate the       myriad medical and socially determinant factors that       contribute to such high maternal mortality rates within the       United States compared to other developed nations. Lack of       standardization of data and data sharing across States and       between Federal entities, health networks, and research       institutions keep the Nation in the dark about ways to       prevent maternal deaths.        (16) Having reliable and valid State data aggregated at the       Federal level are critical to the Nation's ability to quell       surges in maternal death and imperative for researchers to       identify long-lasting interventions.        (17) Leaders in maternal wellness highly recommend that       maternal deaths and cases of maternal morbidity, including       complications that result in chronic illness and future       increased risk of death, be investigated at the State level       first, and that standardized, streamlined, de-identified data       regarding maternal deaths be sent annually to the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention. Such data standardization and       collection would be similar in operation and effect to the       National Program of Cancer Registries of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention and akin to the Confidential       Enquiry in Maternal Deaths Programme in the United Kingdom.       Such a maternal mortalities and morbidities registry and       surveillance system would help providers, academicians,       lawmakers, and the public to address questions concerning the       types of, causes of, and best practices to thwart, maternal       mortality and morbidity.        (18) The United Nations' Millennium Development Goal 5a       aimed to reduce by 75 percent, between 1990 and 2015, the       maternal mortality rate, yet this metric has not been       achieved. In fact, the maternal mortality rate in the United       States has been estimated to have more than doubled between       2000 and 2014.        (19) The United States has no comparable, coordinated       Federal process by which to review cases of maternal       mortality, systems failures, or best practices. The majority       of States have active Maternal Mortality Review Committees       (referred to in this section as ``MMRC''), which help       leverage work to impact maternal wellness. For example, the       State of California has worked extensively with their State       health departments, health and hospital systems, and research       collaborative organizations, including the California       Maternal Quality Care Collaborative and the Alliance for       Innovation on Maternal Health, to establish MMRCs, wherein       such State has determined the most prevalent causes of       maternal mortality and recorded and shared data with       providers and researchers, who have developed and implemented       safety bundles and care protocols related to preeclampsia,       maternal hemorrhage, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and the like.       In this way, the State of California has been able to       leverage its maternal mortality review board system, generate       data, and apply those data to effect changes in maternal       care-related protocol.        (20) Hospitals and health systems across the United States       lack standardization of emergency obstetric protocols before,       during, and after delivery. Consequently, many providers are       delayed in recognizing critical signs indicating maternal       distress that quickly escalate into fatal or near-fatal       incidences. Moreover, any attempt to address an obstetric       emergency that does not consider both clinical and public       health approaches falls woefully under the mark of excellent       care delivery. State-based perinatal quality collaboratives,       or entities participating in the Alliance for Innovation on       Maternal Health (AIM), have formed obstetric protocols, tool       kits, and other resources to improve system care and response       as they relate to maternal complications and warning signs       for such conditions as maternal hemorrhage, hypertension, and       preeclampsia. These perinatal quality collaboratives serve an       important role in providing infrastructure that supports       quality improvement efforts addressing obstetric care and       outcomes. State-based perinatal quality collaboratives       partner with hospitals, physicians, nurses, midwives,       patients, public health, and other stakeholders to provide       opportunities for collaborative learning, rapid response       data, and quality improvement science support to achieve       systems-level change.        (21) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports       that 22 percent of deaths occurred during pregnancy, 25       percent occurred on the day of delivery or within 7 days       after the day of delivery, and 53 percent occurred between 7       days and 1 year after the day of delivery. Yet, for women       eligible for the Medicaid program on the basis of pregnancy       in States without Medicaid postpartum extension, such       Medicaid coverage lapses at the end of the month on which the       60th postpartum day lands.        (22) The experience of serious traumatic events, such as       being exposed to domestic violence, substance use disorder,       or pervasive and systematic racism, can over-activate the       body's stress-response system. Known as toxic stress, the       repetition of high-doses of cortisol to the brain, can harm       healthy neurological development and other body systems,       which can have cascading physical and mental health       consequences, as documented in the Adverse Childhood       Experiences study of the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention.        (23) A growing body of evidence-based research has shown       the correlation between the stress associated with systematic       racism and one's birthing outcomes. The undue stress of sex       and race discrimination paired with institutional racism has       been demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk of maternal       mortality, irrespective of one's gestational age, maternal       age, socioeconomic status, educational level, geographic       region, or individual-level health risk factors, including       poverty, limited access to prenatal care, and poor physical       and mental health (although these are not nominal factors).       Black women remain the most at risk for pregnancy-associated       or pregnancy-related causes of death. When it comes to       preeclampsia, for example, for which obesity is a risk       factor, Black women of normal weight remain at a higher at       risk of dying during the perinatal period compared to non-      Black obese women.        (24) The rising maternal mortality rate in the United       States is driven predominantly by the disproportionately high       rates of Black maternal mortality.        (25) Compared to women from other racial and ethnic       demographics, Black women across the socioeconomic spectrum       experience prolonged, unrelenting stress related to       systematic racial and gender discrimination, contributing to       higher rates of maternal mortality, giving birth to low-      weight babies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a       risk-factor for these aforementioned experiences. This       cumulative stress, called weathering, often extends across       the life course and is situated in everyday spaces where       Black women establish livelihood. Systematic racism,       structural barriers, lack of access to quality maternal       health care, lack of access to nutritious food, and social       determinants of health exacerbate Black women's likelihood to       experience poor or fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully       account for the great disparity.        (26) Black women are twice as likely to experience       postpartum depression, and disproportionately higher rates of       preeclampsia compared to White women.        (27) Racism is deeply ingrained in United States systems,       including in health care delivery systems between patients       and providers, often resulting in disparate treatment for       pain, irreverence for cultural norms with respect to health,       and dismissiveness. However, the provider pool is not primed       with many people of color, nor are providers  [[Page S4594]]       (whether maternity care clinicians or maternity care support       personnel) consistently required to undergo implicit bias,       cultural competency, respectful care practices, or empathy       training on a consistent, on-going basis.        (28) Women are not the only people who can become pregnant       or give birth. Nonbinary, transgender, and gender-expansive       people can also become pregnant. The terms ``birthing       people'' or ``birthing persons'' are also used to describe       pregnant or postpartum people in a way that is inclusive of       individuals who experience gender beyond the binary.        (29) Substance misuse among pregnant women, including the       use of substances that are illegal or criminalized, misuse of       prescribed medications, and binge drinking, has increased       year after year for the past decade. Pregnant people with       substance use disorder, particularly those with opioids,       amphetamines, and cocaine use disorders, are at greater risk       of severe maternal morbidity, including conditions such as       eclampsia, heart attack or failure, and sepsis.       SEC. 3. IMPROVING FEDERAL EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO PREVENTION                     OF MATERNAL MORTALITY.

[[Page S4598]]                                ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2846         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Community Access, Resources,       and Empowerment for Moms Act'' or the ``CARE for Moms Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Every year, across the United States, nearly 4,000,000       women give birth, more than 1,000 women suffer fatal       complications during pregnancy, while giving birth or during       the postpartum period, and about 70,000 women suffer near-      fatal, partum-related complications.        (2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as a proxy to       measure the overall health of a population. While the infant       mortality rate in the United States has reached its lowest       point, the risk of death for women in the United States       during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period is       higher than such risk in many other high-income countries.       The estimated maternal mortality rate (deaths per 100,000       live births) for the 48 contiguous States and Washington, DC,       increased from 14.5 percent in 2000 to 32.0 in 2021. The       United States is the only industrialized nation with a rising       maternal mortality rate.        (3) The National Vital Statistics System of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention has found that in 2021, there       were 32.9 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in       the United States. That ratio continues to exceed the rate in       other high-income countries.        (4) It is estimated that more than 80 percent of maternal       deaths in the United States are preventable.        (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, the maternal mortality rate varies drastically       for women by race and ethnicity. There are about 26.6 deaths       per 100,000 live births for White women, 69.9 deaths per       100,000 live births for non-Hispanic Black women, and 32.0       deaths per 100,000 live births for American Indian/Alaska       Native women. While maternal mortality disparately impacts       Black women, this urgent public health crisis traverses race,       ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational background, and       geography.        (6) In the United States, non-Hispanic Black women are       about 3 times more likely to die from causes related to       pregnancy and childbirth compared to non-Hispanic White       women, which is one of the most disconcerting racial       disparities in public health. This disparity widens in       certain cities and States across the country.        (7) According to the National Center for Health Statistics       of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the       maternal mortality rate heightens with age, as women 40 and       older die at a rate of 138.5 per 100,000 births compared to       20.4 per 100,000 for women under 25. This translates to women       over 40 being 6.8 times more likely to die compared to their       counterparts under 25 years of age.        (8) The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the maternal       health crisis. A study of the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention suggested that pregnant women are at a       significantly higher risk for severe outcomes, including       death, from COVID-19 as compared to non-pregnant women. The       COVID-19 pandemic also decreased access to prenatal and       postpartum care. A study by the Government Accountability       Office found that COVID-19 contributed to 25 percent of       maternal deaths in 2020 and 2021.        (9) The findings described in paragraphs (1) through (8)       are of major concern to researchers, academics, members of       the business community, and providers across the obstetric       continuum represented by organizations such as--        (A) the American College of Nurse-Midwives;        (B) the American College of Obstetricians and       Gynecologists;        (C) the American Medical Association;        (D) the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and       Neonatal Nurses;        (E) the Black Mamas Matter Alliance;        (F) the Black Women's Health Imperative;        (G) the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative;        (H) EverThrive Illinois;        (I) the Illinois Perinatal Quality Collaborative;        (J) the March of Dimes;        (K) the National Association of Certified Professional       Midwives;        (L) RH Impact: The Collaborative for Equity & Justice;        (M) the National Partnership for Women & Families;        (N) the National Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association;        (O) the Preeclampsia Foundation;        (P) the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine;        (Q) the What To Expect Project;        (R) Tufts University School of Medicine Center for Black       Maternal Health and Reproductive Justice;        (S) the Shades of Blue Project;        (T) the Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance;        (U) Tulane University Mary Amelia Center for Women's Health       Equity Research;        (V) In Our Own Voice: National Black Women's Reproductive       Justice Agenda; and        (W) Physicians for Reproductive Health.        (10) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions,       cardiomyopathy, infection or sepsis, embolism, mental health       conditions (including substance use disorder), hypertensive       disorders, stroke and cerebrovascular accidents, and       anesthesia complications are the predominant medical causes       of maternal-related deaths and complications.  [[Page S4593]]       Most of these conditions are largely preventable or       manageable. Even when these conditions are not preventable,       mortality and morbidity may be prevented when conditions are       diagnosed and treated in a timely manner.        (11) According to a study published by the Journal of       Perinatal Education, doula-assisted mothers are 4 times less       likely to have a low-birthweight baby, 2 times less likely to       experience a birth complication involving themselves or their       baby, and significantly more likely to initiate breastfeeding       and human lactation. Doula care has also been shown to       produce cost savings resulting in part from reduced rates of       cesarean and pre-term births.        (12) Intimate partner violence is one of the leading causes       of maternal death, and women are more likely to experience       intimate partner violence during pregnancy than at any other       time in their lives. It is also more dangerous than       pregnancy. Intimate partner violence during pregnancy and       postpartum crosses every demographic and has been exacerbated       by the COVID-19 pandemic.        (13) Oral health is an important part of perinatal health.       Reducing bacteria in a woman's mouth during pregnancy can       significantly reduce her risk of developing oral diseases and       spreading decay-causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some       evidence suggests that women with periodontal disease during       pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor birth outcomes,       such as preeclampsia, pre-term birth, and low-birth weight.       Furthermore, a woman's oral health during pregnancy is a good       predictor of her newborn's oral health, and since mothers can       unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, putting       their children at higher risk for tooth decay, prevention       efforts should happen even before children are born, as a       matter of pre-pregnancy health and prenatal care during       pregnancy.        (14) In the United States, death reporting and analysis is       a State function rather than a Federal process. States report       all deaths--including maternal deaths--on a semi-voluntary       basis, without standardization across States. While the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity       and system for collecting death-related data based on death       certificates, these data are not sufficiently reported by       States in an organized and standard format across States such       that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is able       to identify causes of maternal death and best practices for       the prevention of such death.        (15) Vital statistics systems often underestimate maternal       mortality and are insufficient data sources from which to       derive a full scope of medical and social determinant factors       contributing to maternal deaths, such as intimate partner       violence. While the addition of pregnancy checkboxes on death       certificates since 2003 have likely improved States'       abilities to identify pregnancy-related deaths, they are not       generally completed by obstetric providers or persons trained       to recognize pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these vital       forms may be missing information or may capture inconsistent       data. Due to varying maternal mortality-related analyses,       lack of reliability, and granularity in data, current       maternal mortality informatics do not fully encapsulate the       myriad medical and socially determinant factors that       contribute to such high maternal mortality rates within the       United States compared to other developed nations. Lack of       standardization of data and data sharing across States and       between Federal entities, health networks, and research       institutions keep the Nation in the dark about ways to       prevent maternal deaths.        (16) Having reliable and valid State data aggregated at the       Federal level are critical to the Nation's ability to quell       surges in maternal death and imperative for researchers to       identify long-lasting interventions.        (17) Leaders in maternal wellness highly recommend that       maternal deaths and cases of maternal morbidity, including       complications that result in chronic illness and future       increased risk of death, be investigated at the State level       first, and that standardized, streamlined, de-identified data       regarding maternal deaths be sent annually to the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention. Such data standardization and       collection would be similar in operation and effect to the       National Program of Cancer Registries of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention and akin to the Confidential       Enquiry in Maternal Deaths Programme in the United Kingdom.       Such a maternal mortalities and morbidities registry and       surveillance system would help providers, academicians,       lawmakers, and the public to address questions concerning the       types of, causes of, and best practices to thwart, maternal       mortality and morbidity.        (18) The United Nations' Millennium Development Goal 5a       aimed to reduce by 75 percent, between 1990 and 2015, the       maternal mortality rate, yet this metric has not been       achieved. In fact, the maternal mortality rate in the United       States has been estimated to have more than doubled between       2000 and 2014.        (19) The United States has no comparable, coordinated       Federal process by which to review cases of maternal       mortality, systems failures, or best practices. The majority       of States have active Maternal Mortality Review Committees       (referred to in this section as ``MMRC''), which help       leverage work to impact maternal wellness. For example, the       State of California has worked extensively with their State       health departments, health and hospital systems, and research       collaborative organizations, including the California       Maternal Quality Care Collaborative and the Alliance for       Innovation on Maternal Health, to establish MMRCs, wherein       such State has determined the most prevalent causes of       maternal mortality and recorded and shared data with       providers and researchers, who have developed and implemented       safety bundles and care protocols related to preeclampsia,       maternal hemorrhage, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and the like.       In this way, the State of California has been able to       leverage its maternal mortality review board system, generate       data, and apply those data to effect changes in maternal       care-related protocol.        (20) Hospitals and health systems across the United States       lack standardization of emergency obstetric protocols before,       during, and after delivery. Consequently, many providers are       delayed in recognizing critical signs indicating maternal       distress that quickly escalate into fatal or near-fatal       incidences. Moreover, any attempt to address an obstetric       emergency that does not consider both clinical and public       health approaches falls woefully under the mark of excellent       care delivery. State-based perinatal quality collaboratives,       or entities participating in the Alliance for Innovation on       Maternal Health (AIM), have formed obstetric protocols, tool       kits, and other resources to improve system care and response       as they relate to maternal complications and warning signs       for such conditions as maternal hemorrhage, hypertension, and       preeclampsia. These perinatal quality collaboratives serve an       important role in providing infrastructure that supports       quality improvement efforts addressing obstetric care and       outcomes. State-based perinatal quality collaboratives       partner with hospitals, physicians, nurses, midwives,       patients, public health, and other stakeholders to provide       opportunities for collaborative learning, rapid response       data, and quality improvement science support to achieve       systems-level change.        (21) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports       that 22 percent of deaths occurred during pregnancy, 25       percent occurred on the day of delivery or within 7 days       after the day of delivery, and 53 percent occurred between 7       days and 1 year after the day of delivery. Yet, for women       eligible for the Medicaid program on the basis of pregnancy       in States without Medicaid postpartum extension, such       Medicaid coverage lapses at the end of the month on which the       60th postpartum day lands.        (22) The experience of serious traumatic events, such as       being exposed to domestic violence, substance use disorder,       or pervasive and systematic racism, can over-activate the       body's stress-response system. Known as toxic stress, the       repetition of high-doses of cortisol to the brain, can harm       healthy neurological development and other body systems,       which can have cascading physical and mental health       consequences, as documented in the Adverse Childhood       Experiences study of the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention.        (23) A growing body of evidence-based research has shown       the correlation between the stress associated with systematic       racism and one's birthing outcomes. The undue stress of sex       and race discrimination paired with institutional racism has       been demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk of maternal       mortality, irrespective of one's gestational age, maternal       age, socioeconomic status, educational level, geographic       region, or individual-level health risk factors, including       poverty, limited access to prenatal care, and poor physical       and mental health (although these are not nominal factors).       Black women remain the most at risk for pregnancy-associated       or pregnancy-related causes of death. When it comes to       preeclampsia, for example, for which obesity is a risk       factor, Black women of normal weight remain at a higher at       risk of dying during the perinatal period compared to non-      Black obese women.        (24) The rising maternal mortality rate in the United       States is driven predominantly by the disproportionately high       rates of Black maternal mortality.        (25) Compared to women from other racial and ethnic       demographics, Black women across the socioeconomic spectrum       experience prolonged, unrelenting stress related to       systematic racial and gender discrimination, contributing to       higher rates of maternal mortality, giving birth to low-      weight babies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a       risk-factor for these aforementioned experiences. This       cumulative stress, called weathering, often extends across       the life course and is situated in everyday spaces where       Black women establish livelihood. Systematic racism,       structural barriers, lack of access to quality maternal       health care, lack of access to nutritious food, and social       determinants of health exacerbate Black women's likelihood to       experience poor or fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully       account for the great disparity.        (26) Black women are twice as likely to experience       postpartum depression, and disproportionately higher rates of       preeclampsia compared to White women.        (27) Racism is deeply ingrained in United States systems,       including in health care delivery systems between patients       and providers, often resulting in disparate treatment for       pain, irreverence for cultural norms with respect to health,       and dismissiveness. However, the provider pool is not primed       with many people of color, nor are providers  [[Page S4594]]       (whether maternity care clinicians or maternity care support       personnel) consistently required to undergo implicit bias,       cultural competency, respectful care practices, or empathy       training on a consistent, on-going basis.        (28) Women are not the only people who can become pregnant       or give birth. Nonbinary, transgender, and gender-expansive       people can also become pregnant. The terms ``birthing       people'' or ``birthing persons'' are also used to describe       pregnant or postpartum people in a way that is inclusive of       individuals who experience gender beyond the binary.        (29) Substance misuse among pregnant women, including the       use of substances that are illegal or criminalized, misuse of       prescribed medications, and binge drinking, has increased       year after year for the past decade. Pregnant people with       substance use disorder, particularly those with opioids,       amphetamines, and cocaine use disorders, are at greater risk       of severe maternal morbidity, including conditions such as       eclampsia, heart attack or failure, and sepsis.
