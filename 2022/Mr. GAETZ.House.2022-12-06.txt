 Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago today, a Saudi Air Force officer  with ties to al-Qaida attacked Naval Air Station Pensacola resulting in  the deaths of Ensign Joshua Kaleb, Airman Apprentice Cameron Walters,  and Airman Mohammed Haitham; this also included the injury of eight  others, including brave sheriff's deputies and sailors.   Saudi Arabia had the responsibility to screen and monitor their  officers, and they failed. The family members who lost their loved ones  live with this pain every day, and the Saudi Government's initial  promise made directly to me that they would compensate the grieving  families has resulted in nothing.   For this reason, I am introducing the Saudi Arabia December 6, 2019,  Anti-Terror and Accountability Act.   This bill would prohibit the DOD from funding any Saudi-led proxy  wars and would end the export of weapons and logistical services to  Saudi Arabia. This legislation would halt the military officer exchange  programs with Saudi Arabia. It would also set aside $10 million within  the state-sponsored terrorism fund so that the victims would be able to  be compensated.   The legislation is budget neutral as it draws from a reallocation  from funds that would otherwise go to a war in Ukraine.   It is time that we demonstrate national solidarity on the anniversary  of this terrorist attack. We should send Saudi Arabia a message, not  more weapons.                            ____________________
