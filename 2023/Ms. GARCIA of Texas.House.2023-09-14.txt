 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Bill Richardson.   Former Governor Bill Richardson was a devoted public servant and a  skilled diplomat whose career improved countless lives in New Mexico  and across America, and indeed, the world.   As Governor of New Mexico, he tirelessly worked to improve the lives  of his constituents while making history leading as a Latino, but Bill  Richardson's influence extended well beyond the borders of New Mexico.  He served as Energy Secretary and also as the U.S. Ambassador to the  United Nations, where his diplomatic skills and commitment to peace  played a pivotal role in addressing many global challenges.   Today, we remember Governor Bill Richardson, and we also honor his  legacy of public service and diplomacy, which continues with his work  at his center. He was an inspiration to all of us, and he was a true  American patriot.   His leadership and kindness will forever be remembered. Rest in  peace, my friend.                            ____________________
