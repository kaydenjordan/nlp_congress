 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Raskin,  for his kind words and for his leadership on this bill and legislation  in bringing it to this point and for all of his efforts in combating  domestic violence as well.   I also want to thank my colleagues, in particular Congressman Young;  Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers, the Republican Conference Chair;  Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard; Congresswoman Brooks; as well as the  chairman, Mr. Goodlatte, for his leadership in making sure that this  bill comes to the floor today; as well as Senator Sullivan from Alaska  who is the original author of this legislation and has been working  with me on this for the past several years. I am grateful for his  leadership as well.   Mr. Speaker, I remember far too many times in a courtroom as a State- level prosecutor the challenges of bringing domestic violence cases to  trial. I remember to this day talking to victims and seeing perhaps a  paragraph in a police report and something that didn't quite seem  right; doing an interview with the victim and peeling back layer after  layer after layer of isolation and of control, and of the creation of a  state of dependence and of perpetual fear.                                time  1400    I remember getting ready to try a case one day. The victim came in  with her daughter. The victim had a black eye. She sat next to her  husband, the defendant, throughout the entire morning of the case. She  blamed the black eye on a newborn child who was sleeping in her bed.   I remember watching countless efforts for a restraining order as the  attorney badgered a victim, and watching a victim get so disenchanted  with our court system that she said she would never come back.   Standing in a courtroom, Mr. Speaker, with those survivors, you start  to see our justice system through their eyes. It is, at times, an  endless and impossible maze where abuse and injustice is relived and  replicated on every single occasion.   That is why we as a Congress must ensure that no survivor is ever  forced to stand alone before a judge, because we know and the data well  proves that, oftentimes, these cases can be a matter of life and death.  It is, in fact, the most predictable form of homicide we have in our  Nation.   We know how prevalent and pervasive it is. Nearly 8 million women are  raped, assaulted, or stalked every year by a current or former intimate  partner. We know that low-income women and men are at higher risk of  domestic violence and rape. We know that more than 80 percent of  survivors with access to a lawyer successfully obtain restraining  orders, while those who stand alone obtain one less than one-third of  the time.   Mr. Speaker, passing the POWER Act will begin to restore our sacred  promise of an equal justice system. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation.
