 Madam Speaker, the American people are rightfully concerned  about the ambiguity of the Biden Administration's ongoing negotiations  with Iran.   Are these negotiations being conducted in good faith? What  concessions are being made? How would this deal impact America's  standing within the international community and our ally, Israel?   These are precisely the questions that are being asked, and yet, the  only response coming from the administration is the sound of crickets  chirping. The same can be said for Congress.   The Biden administration has already expressed its intent to keep  Congress in the dark about this potential nuclear deal. And according  to new reporting, the Biden administration is trying to hide the facts  on their ongoing negotiations with Iran until after the midterm  elections to avoid scrutiny.   Here is the thing, Madam Speaker, the administration is already  required to submit information to Congress pursuant to the Iran Nuclear  Agreement Review Act or INARA.   INARA requires that the administration keep Congress fully and  currently informed of any new or amended agreement with Iran. Those  words couldn't be any clearer.   In 2015, many Members on the opposite side of the aisle voted for  INARA, and yet, we have heard nothing but crickets from them about  holding this administration accountable.   If INARA had not passed 7 years ago, Congress could have found itself  completely blind to former President Obama's deal with Iran at the  time.   Madam Speaker, 400 Members of the House, along with 98 senators voted  to force President Obama to submit his deal to Congress for  Congressional review. Given the profound silence as of late on these  ongoing negotiations, are we to believe that good governance and  effective oversight are no longer tenets of this body?   Madam Speaker, we cannot let accountability and transparency become  relics of a bygone era. That is why I have introduced H. Res. 1266  alongside my colleague from South Carolina, Representative   Joe  Wilson.   This resolution of inquiry requests that President Biden turn over to  the House copies of documents, memos, and other communications related  to any initiative or negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program.   It could also expose any side agreements--such as the episode of the  Obama administration leaving cash on a tarmac in 2016--that are offered  as part of negotiations with Iran.   Today, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs will be marking up my  legislation, and the American people will find out who still supports  increased transparency and oversight and who does not.   Congress must do its job and exercise its explicit oversight  authorities to hold this administration accountable. If this body  upheld its commitment to good governance and effective oversight 7  years ago, we should certainly do the same now. There is no excuse not  to.   Congress should not be sitting back and kicking its feet up while  there is work to be done.                            ____________________
