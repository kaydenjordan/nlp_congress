 Madam Speaker, our policy toward Cuba should be one  area where Democrats and Republicans can find common ground.   There are not many communist countries left, but let's consider that,  when it came to the old Soviet bloc or China and Vietnam today, we have  agreed on the basics. We all differ with their human rights practices,  and we say so.   We stand up for our security interests. We cooperate when we can. We  support trade and citizen contact because they are good for our economy  and they increase our influence.   In this vein, let me praise a few Republicans:   President Nixon for the opening to China;   President Ford for the Helsinki Accords and the principle that people  and information should flow freely across borders;   President Reagan for vastly expanding engagement with the Soviet  Union and its people.   These are big achievements, none of them terribly controversial, but  Cuba is an exception. Only with Cuba do we regulate our own citizens'  contact. Only there do we have a trade embargo that limits trade and  investment: six decades of embargo, a virtual lifetime of foreign  policy failure.   President Trump clearly realized this as a candidate when he  supported President Obama's opening to Cuba. It was a good idea to  bring Cuba ``into the fold,'' he said. Later, he changed his view.   Now, led by his White House staff, he wants to respond to Cuba's  support for the Government of Venezuela by increasing U.S. economic  sanctions against Cuba.   This is a mistake. It will do nothing to change Cuba's conduct; it  will not improve the situation in Venezuela; and it will harm American  interests.   Specifically, he is considering allowing title 3 of the Helms-Burton  Act to go into effect. This will allow Americans who lost property in  Cuba, including Cubans who later became U.S. citizens, to go to U.S.  courts to seek damages--three times the value of their property--by  suing Cuba, foreign, and even American companies whose businesses in  Cuba today are connected to those properties.   The purpose, as the law's authors made clear in 1996, is to harm  Cuba's economy by making it completely inhospitable for foreign  investment.   Now, it is no mystery why Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama, and Trump  blocked title 3 from going into effect every 6 months for the past 23  years. It is hypocritical. It penalizes companies for doing what  American companies do all over the world. It is contrary to  international law, which recognizes the right of expropriation and  requires compensation.   It is an extraterritorial sanction that guarantees a response from  our trading partners, like Canada, Spain, and the EU, including  complaints at the World Trade Organization.   And if you care about agriculture, be warned:   It will open a new front in the trade war, with all the repercussions  that can bring;   It will allow Cuba to claim victim status and rally international  support;   It will clog our courts with lawsuits;   It will make it impossible to negotiate compensation for U.S. claims  in Cuba and, in the end, hurt the very Americans who seek compensation  for property they lost;   It will divide us from friends and allies who are now working for a  peaceful solution in Venezuela; and   It will guarantee that new investment in Cuba will come from the  Russians, Chinese, and others who are hostile to the United States and  whose Stated-owned companies can't be sued in U.S. courts.   Once again, the U.S. will be pursuing a strategy that has failed over  and over and over again for absolutely no good result.   Madam Speaker, there is a better way that deserves vocal, bipartisan  support.   We should continue to press Cuba on human rights. With our Latin  American and European allies, we should challenge Cuba to play a  constructive role in resolving the crisis in Venezuela, as it did in  the Colombian peace process.   There are positive changes in Cuba to support: There is growing  Internet access, and there is more political space for Cuban citizens,  a growing private sector that now accounts for a third of Cuba's labor  force. And despite policies that limit contact, there are rich  cultural, educational, and intellectual exchanges between Americans and  Cuba.   Madam Speaker, we should follow President Trump's original instinct  and allow Americans to do business with Cuba.   We should pass Congressman Crawford's bill to increase the  competitiveness of our agricultural exports to Cuba. There is no reason  for us to have only a one-eighth market share of Cuba's $2 billion in  annual food imports.   We should finally end U.S. travel restrictions and allow all  Americans to travel freely, as they choose, to Cuba. That would serve  our values and our national interests, and it is a worthy cause in  which Democrats and Republicans can join.                            ____________________
