 Mr. President, I want to begin my remarks today by  paying tribute to a strong, wonderful civil rights leader, Ina Boon,  who passed away a few days ago. She was 90 years old, and she really  was the strength and heart of so much of the civil rights work that  went on in the St. Louis area.   She began working for the NAACP during the 1950s, and she will be  sorely missed. She was an extraordinary woman. I think it is important  to put a tribute to her in the record of the Senate.   Because of the other thing I want to talk about today, I want to  mention that Ms. Boon, after graduating from Sumner High School in St.  Louis, attended Oakwood University in Alabama, which is one of the  special historically Black colleges and universities in our country.                               Secretary DeVos    Mr. President, that brings me to what I want to talk to the Senate  about today and what I want to try to emphasize. Betsy DeVos has been  given one of the most important positions in education in this country.  Call me old-fashioned, but I think it is pretty important that the  Secretary of Education have a basic working knowledge of history. It is  one thing to appear for your confirmation and have no idea what the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is or not have a working  understanding of the Federal laws as they relate to education in this  country, but it takes it to a whole new level that someone who is  Secretary of Education would make the kind of statement that Secretary  DeVos made in the last few days.   I want to read it aloud. This is the statement from the Secretary of  Education following a listening session with historically Black college  and university leaders. I want to pull out the quote that I think is  important for us to dwell on today. The quote is as follows:  ``Historically black colleges and universities are real pioneers when  it comes to school choice.''   Now, let's be clear about what historically Black colleges and  universities were. It wasn't about a choice. It was about racism. That  is where these colleges came from. It wasn't that a young Black student  looked at the State university and said: Well, I have to decide; do I  want to go to the University of Alabama or do I want to go to a  historically Black college and university? It may be that way today,  but it was not when they began. They were established because do you  know what the University of Alabama said to African-American students?   You can't come here. You are not welcome. You are not allowed to  darken our doors. There was no choice.   This was the Jim Crow era of racism and segregation.   In 1862, President Lincoln signed the Morrill Act which provided land  for the purposes of colleges in each State. In 17 of those States,  mainly in the South, Black students were prohibited by law from  attending these land grant colleges. The second Morrill Act of 1890  required States to establish a separate land grant college for Blacks  if Blacks were excluded from existing land grant colleges. Many of our  great HBCU's, like Alabama A&M, Florida A&M, and Lincoln University, in  my home State of Missouri, became public land grant colleges after the  second Morrill Act of 1890. These schools were not established because  someone thought there should be school choice. These schools were  established because racism left Blacks without any choice. When Blacks  tried to attend schools like the University of Alabama and the  University of Mississippi, they were blocked and there were riots. The  fact that Secretary DeVos doesn't understand this basic fact is  appalling.   Her statement was wrong. It was offensive, and it should be  corrected. We need the Secretary of Education to have a basic  fundamental understanding of history in the United States of America,  especially as it relates to education. Is there anything that was more  important in the history of our country than the struggle for equality  in education? Is there anything that is more important than recognizing  and understanding that for years in this country, young Black people  could be punished for learning how to read? They would be told: You are  not welcome, even if the universities were public universities.   So shame on Secretary DeVos. Shame on her for not understanding  history, for trying to shoehorn the racist history in our country into  her talking points about school choice. That is wrong, and it should be  corrected.   I hope it was an oversight. If it was, I hope she will admit her  mistake and acknowledge that historically Black colleges and  universities in the United States of America were not about choice.  They were about racism. They were about trying to provide an  opportunity. They were mostly a movement that was largely led by  ministers and academicians from other parts of the country, trying to  make sure that in a land that professes equality and justice for all,  education is the most fundamental of opportunities that must be  afforded to every single citizen.   So no, it wasn't about choice, Secretary DeVos. It was about  something else. It is important that as the leader of education in this  country, you acknowledge the history that is the underpinning of the  importance of historically Black colleges and universities in our  country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
