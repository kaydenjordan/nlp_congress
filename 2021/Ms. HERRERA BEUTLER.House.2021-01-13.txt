 Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand against our  enemy. To clarify, our enemy isn't the President or the President- elect.   Fear is our enemy. Fear tells us what we want to hear. It incites  anger and violence and fire, but it also haunts us into silence and  inaction.   What are you afraid of? I am afraid of what people will say or think.  I am afraid of being devalued. I am not afraid of losing my job, but I  am afraid that my country will fail. I am afraid patriots of this  country have died in vain. I am afraid my children won't grow up in a  free country. I am afraid injustice will prevail.   But truth, truth sets us free from fear. Truth doesn't guarantee bad  things won't happen, but it does promise to always prevail in the end.  It has no shadows where darkness can hide. With truth comes love, and  we could use that right now.   My vote to impeach our sitting President is not a fear-based  decision. I am not choosing a side; I am choosing truth. It is the only  way to defeat fear.
