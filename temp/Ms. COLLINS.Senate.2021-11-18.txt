 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clean  Cooking Support Act. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my  friend and colleague, Senator Durbin. Our bill aims to address a  serious global public health and environmental issue where leadership  by the United States can make a real difference.   Today, close to 3 billion people, or one-third of the global  population, rely on ``dirty cooking,'' such as open fires or  inefficient, polluting, and unsafe cookstoves that use agricultural  waste, coal, dung, wood, charcoal, or other solid fuels, to cook their  meals. The majority of people using these types of cookstoves and fuels  are in developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.   Exposure to smoke from these traditional cooking methods and open  fires, referred to as ``household air pollution,'' causes chronic and  acute diseases such as lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke.  Alarmingly, the household air pollution caused by traditional  cookstoves and open tires causes 4 million premature deaths annually,  including 400,000 children younger than 5 years of age, most of whom  live in sub-Saharan Africa. Women and girls are disproportionately  affected, as they spend hours cooking, inhaling toxic smoke, and  collecting fuels.   These cookstoves also create serious environmental problems.  Household air pollution does not remain in the home; it contributes to  more than 10 percent of global ambient air pollution. According to the  EPA, greenhouse gas emissions from nonrenewable wood fuels for cooking  amount to 2 percent of the global CO2 emissions, on par with the global  CO2 emissions from the aviation or shipping industries. In 2019, more  than 600,000 deaths were attributed to ambient air pollution stemming  from the household combustion of solid fuels.   These cookstoves should be replaced with modern alternatives to  reverse these alarming health and environmental trends. Since 2010, the  Clean Cooking Alliance, an innovative public-private partnership hosted  by the United Nations Foundation, has supported the adoption of clean  cooking worldwide, with the goal of achieving universal access to clean  cooking by 2030. Recognizing the serious health and environmental  issues posed by traditional cookstoves, the Alliance aims to save  lives, improve livelihoods, empower women, and combat pollution by  creating a thriving global market for clean and efficient household  cooking solutions. In April, President Biden announced that the U.S. is  resuming and strengthening its commitment to the Clean Cooking  Alliance, and during a recent presentation at the 2021 United Nations  Climate Change Conference that covered clean cooking and household  energy, EPA Administrator Michael Regan reaffirmed this undertaking as  well.   Our legislation reinforces our country's policy on promoting clean  cookstoves and seeks to take a whole-of-government approach to address  household air pollution. Specifically, the Clean Cooking Support Act  would create an interagency working group, with representatives from at  least six different Federal agencies, committed to increasing access to  clean cooking fuels and technologies worldwide. Our legislation  explicitly spells out the role of each Federal agency in the  advancement of clean cooking as well. The Department of Energy, for  instance, is tasked with research and development to spur the  production of low-cost, low-emission, and high-efficiency cookstoves,  while the Department of State is directed to engage in diplomatic  activities across the globe to support the clean cooking and fuels  sector. Finally, our bill would authorize funding for the U.S.  Government to continue such activities through 2027, to ensure that  these important efforts to prevent unnecessary illness and reduce  pollution around the globe continue.   Our legislation would directly benefit some of the world's poorest  people, including the women and girls who are disproportionately  affected, and reduce harmful pollution that affects us all. I urge my  colleagues to join me and Senator Durbin in supporting the Clean  Cooking Support Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Ms. Warren, Mr.          Brown, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Reed):   S. 3251. A bill to provide that chapter 1 of title 9 of the United  States Code, relating to the enforcement of arbitration agreements,  shall not apply to enrollment agreements made between students and  certain institutions of higher education, and to prohibit limitations  on the ability of students to pursue claims against certain  institutions of higher education; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.
