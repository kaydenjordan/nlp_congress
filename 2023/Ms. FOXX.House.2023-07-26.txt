 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a government that  represents the people, not a bureaucracy that represents Washington's  interests.   Pending on the Supreme Court docket is Loper Bright Enterprises v.  Raimondo, a case with the potential to overturn 40 years of  bureaucratic overreach and restore the proper role of Congress, the  courts, and the Presidency.   Nearly 40 years of deference by lawmakers and judges to the executive  has given rise to the administrative state, sometimes called the fourth  branch of government. Over time, this unaccountable bureaucracy has  gradually subverted the doctrine of separation of powers laid out by  our Founders.   According to the Constitution, Article I vests the power to make law  in the Congress; Article II vests the power to enforce law in the  Presidency; and Article III vests the power to interpret law in the  courts.   In no article are all three powers--to make, enforce, and interpret  the law--jointly vested in a managerial bureaucracy of 1.8 million  civil service employees. The very idea is offensive to our founding.   However, at the heart of Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo lies  the doctrine of Chevron deference, a legal construct which would make  our Founders turn in their graves. It is a 1980s judicial invention  that shifts lawmaking powers from lawmakers and adjudicating powers  from judges to a plenary executive branch.   In the 1980s, Chevron deference may have been reasonably supported by  those who believed faithful bureaucratic agents could be trusted to  fill in areas where the law is silent. In 2023, the Biden  administration's relentless pursuit of government power has disabused  any dewy-eyed believer in faithful bureaucrats.   The 40-year experiment of Chevron deference has allowed the  bureaucracy to aggrandize nearly unlimited power, culminating in the  Biden administration exceeding its authority from sea to shining sea  and from cradle to grave with overregulation.   Just recently, President Biden and Secretary Cardona tossed up a Hail  Mary when their illegal, economically disastrous, taxpayer-funded  student loan bailout for the wealthy arrived at the Supreme Court. The  Supreme Court emphatically said no. It also said  [[Page H3962]]  that such a scheme ``requires that Congress speak clearly before a  Department Secretary can unilaterally alter large sections of the  American economy.''   Nevertheless, the Biden administration continues to claim the power  to implement its student loan bailout under even more ambiguous legal  pretenses.   President Biden's National Labor Relations Board, NLRB, is yet  another example of the unforeseen consequences of Chevron deference.  Within the NLRB, bureaucrats command the power to create law, execute  law, and adjudicate legal conflicts. Under the Biden administration,  the NLRB has issued sweeping rules regarding joint employer status and  union elections, enforced said rules, and then adjudicated hundreds of  cases, overturning longstanding preferences.   The Committee on Education and the Workforce is working hard to  conduct oversight of an agency that assumes it has lawmaking, law  enforcing, and law interpreting power. These abuses, and many more, are  the direct failure of the Chevron deference regime.   For many in this body, fighting back against the Biden administration  requires confronting an uncomfortable truth. Congress creates, enables,  and abides by the administrative state when it passes statutory  language without clear meaning. Congress' illegal delegation of its  Article I authority and the accelerated transfer of legislative powers  to unaccountable bureaucrats in the executive has been a fault of this  body over decades and the fault of both parties.    Today, there are over 123 statutes that enable the President and his  agencies to circumvent ordinary lawmaking processes upon the  declaration of a ``national emergency.'' The ultimate national  emergency, however, is if unscrupulous politicians abdicate the power  vested in them by the American people to make laws and instead make  more legislators. Then, the people will have no means to hold their  government accountable.   In fulfilling House Republicans' Commitment to America, we are  demanding accountability from the Federal Government. To fulfill the  will of the people, the Court must repeal Chevron deference in Loper  Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo.   I pray next term that the Court reclaims and fortifies Congress'  rightful powers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Julie Su has now exceeded the previous record  for the longest duration between a Presidential Cabinet nomination and  a confirmation--when the same party controls the White House and the  Senate--since 1887.   It is no surprise that Axios even dubbed her as ``Biden's forever  nominee.''   That is not a title, and certainly not an accolade worthy of a gold  star or pat on the back. For months on end, her nomination has  languished before the Senate. This is a telltale sign that she does not  have the votes.   One doesn't need to be an expert in reading tea leaves to see that  her nomination is on life support.   Mr. Speaker, I will offer some much-needed advice to the Biden  administration: rip the Band-Aid off already and pull Julie Su's  nomination.                            ____________________
