 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring  attention to the sham impeachment process being run out of this  esteemed House.   As House Democrats continue to pursue politically motivated attacks  on President Trump, it is alarming that their leaders are withholding  evidence and facts from elected Members of our Congress.   Last week, I sent letters to the chairs of the House Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and  the Committee on Foreign Affairs to inform them of my intent as an  elected Member of the 116th Congress to review documents and records in  possession of their committees. We must be allowed to do our jobs.   The fair choice is clear. We cannot allow House Democrats to continue  issuing political attacks behind the safety of clandestine, closed  doors.   Madam Speaker, I stand for transparency and I stand for  accountability. I stand for fairness. It is time for this body to  restore its integrity.                            ____________________
