 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                     Reviewing Last Year's Senate Agenda     Mr. President, our Constitution starts out with three  beautiful words: ``We the people.'' This was the whole mission  statement for the development of our form of government--not a  government that would deliver benefits by and for the privileged, not a  government that would deliver decisions for the rich and the powerful,  but for the people of the United States, for the best policy for the  population of the United States, so that its citizens everywhere, of  every stripe and every corner of the Nation, could have a foundation to  thrive. But in 2017, the leadership of this body dedicated itself to a  different mission. They dedicated themselves to the mission of  government of, by, and for the powerful and the privileged.   I think it is worth reviewing some of those items that we have gone  through in the course of this past year. Let's start by looking at the  attack on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. My colleagues on  the Republican side spent a whole year attacking this organization,  which was set up to make sure that financial transactions are fair--a  fair, square deal for ordinary Americans. We had seen all kinds of  predatory practices in consumer loans. We had seen all kinds of  predatory practices in auto loans. We certainly had seen them in home  mortgages. In fact, the exploding interest rate mortgages and the  triple option mortgages that were designed to deceive and bankrupt  ordinary Americans turned the dream of homeownership into a nightmare.   Fortunately, in 2010 this body said: No more. We are going to set up  an organization that can identify predatory practices as they develop  and prevent them from being implemented.   It makes a lot of sense. It is very similar to an organization we  have in the government that says: That appliance is dangerous and  should never be sold; that toy is dangerous and should never be sold.  In this case, it is this: That loan is predatory, deceptive and should  never be marketed.   This assault on CFPB went on throughout the year, purely  encapsulating government for the powerful, the rich, and the predatory  over ordinary people. This has culminated at the end of the year in  which President Trump has appointed an Acting Director to the CFPB who  hates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and wants to dismantle  it from the inside. In fact, that Director has called the organization  a ``sick, sad joke.''   Just yesterday, he threw out the payday loan rule. Payday loans have  interest rates of 300, 400, 500 percent interest. People have them,  initially, and borrow $1,000. In a year, they owe $5,000. In another  year, they owe $25,000. In another year, they owe $125,000. It is a  vortex of debt that pulls families into bankruptcy, squeezes them for  as long as it can, and then throws them out bankrupt. Many States have  said this is outrageous. Many religious traditions have said this is  unacceptable. People have seen the carnage it does in a society that  has high-interest loans. These are not just high-interest loans of 25,  35, or 45 percent. No, it is 300 percent, 400 percent, or 500 percent.   Yesterday the Director of the organization set up to protect against  predatory loans restored full power to allow these predatory loans to  occur. That symbolizes the whole year of leadership in this body  supporting the powerful and the privileged instead of the people of the  United States of America.   Just a little while ago we had a vote in the body--a 50-50 vote that  was broken by the Vice President, 51-50--that really does symbolize the  powerful over the people. This is a case where there was a rule adopted  by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that said you have to have  fairness in adjudicating consumer issues. Let's say, for example, a  telephone company puts charges on your bill that you didn't authorize.  Let's say, for example, a cable company proceeds to charge you a higher  price than the contract called for and you want to dispute this, but  currently if you seek to dispute it, you can't do so in a fair setting.  Instead, it is a rigged system set up for the company and against the  people, in which the company chooses the judge, in which the company  pays the judge, and in which the company promises future business to  the judge.   Who here in this Chamber really thinks they can get a fair decision  when one party to a dispute chooses a judge, pays the judge, and  promises the judge future business? That is the fair arbitration rule  that was undone by this body choosing to weigh in during 2017 once  again on the side of the powerful against ordinary people, choosing the  system rigged against middle-class and ordinary Americans.   Let's turn to yet another decision for the powerful in 2017 over the  people--net neutrality. People value the fairness of the internet. You  decide you have an idea, and you want to set up a company. Maybe you  want to offer a website that provides services to people who need home  repairs. You know you are going to be competing against big, powerful  actors who have other websites. But you decide: I have a different  idea, a different innovation, and a different way of doing this would  be better. Right now, until recently, you had the same ability to get  the same speed on your pages, or your website, loading as the big  player did so you could compete. But the Republican majority, team  Trump, says: No, we want  [[Page S233]]  to weigh in for the powerful over ordinary people. We want to give the  powerful the ability to have those web pages put up on the computer  screen really, really fast and stop the challengers--the little guy,  the ordinary person who wants to compete--from being able to have the  same speed so that the customer can only decide: Well, I better go to  the established big player.   What could more symbolize the powerful over the people than the FCC,  with the support of this administration--this Trump team for the  powerful--choosing to wipe out net neutrality? I think we will have  that issue revisited in 2018 when we have a Congressional Review Act  that already 50 Senators in this body--49 Democrats, 1 Republican--have  said they are ready to sponsor for the overturn of this act against  ordinary people. At least 50 out of 100 are saying that on this issue  they want to stand up for ordinary people against this 2017 reign of  terror by the powerful and privileged over ordinary people. It is at  least 50, but we are going to need 51. Isn't there one more Senator who  will stand up for ordinary people?   Then, we have the Congressional Review Act attack on Planned  Parenthood. This was a case where the administration and this  Republican leadership and this Republican-led body said: We want to  enable jurisdictions to divert funds away from a women's health  organization, Planned Parenthood. They centered their argument around  diminishing the number of abortions. Here is the fact. Family planning  decreases abortions. So it has the contrary impact than what was stated  by those who made that argument.   Here is another fact: 97 percent of the work of those organizations  is about general women's health/reproductive services, not abortion--97  percent. This takes away screenings for all kinds of cancers, for all  kinds of women's healthcare. Here we have the privileged and the  powerful choosing to weigh in against the health of ordinary women  across the United States. The list just goes on and on.   Let's turn to big, powerful mining companies brought to bear against  ordinary people. This is simply the case of a rule which said that when  you create a big mess with mountaintop removal mining, you have to fix  it so that it doesn't contaminate the stream. This was a rule in which  the people weighed in and said they wanted clean streams for the fish,  where the ordinary people of America weighed in and said they wanted  clean streams for fishing, where the ordinary people weighed in and  said they wanted clean streams for their water supplies--but no. This  body saw fit to weigh in for the rich and powerful, taking away those  streams for the fish and the opportunity for fishing, taking away those  clean streams for water in favor of the rich and powerful over the  interests of the people of the United States.   This ``rich and powerful over the people'' has extended abroad, even  beyond our borders. Equatorial Guinea, a country of Sub-Saharan Africa,  has a massive wealth of oil. President Obiang of that country has been  in power since 1979. That country has a per capita income of around--I  believe it is $20,000, but most of the nation lives on less than $2 a  day. Why is that? Why do ordinary people live on so little when the  country has so much wealth? It is because the international oil  companies have made their royalty payments to the leader of the country  rather than to the treasury of the country.   Congress came along and said: Do you know what? We need transparency  of these international transactions so that ordinary people overseas  are not ripped off through these hidden transactions of paying off  leaders who live extraordinary lives of luxury while their people  suffer.   When I talk about suffering, who here can live on $2 a day? Who here  can do that? It is a life-and-death issue, as 20 percent of the  children in Equatorial Guinea--a country with this vast wealth--die  before the age of 5 while the President and his Vice President own  yachts worth $250 million. They have a $200 million mansion in Paris,  and they have a $10 million car collection while people are dying  because in 2017 this Chamber chose to support the powerful over the  ordinary people of the world.   We see this in another environmental issue--the issue of the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge. We have protected that decade after decade--a  last great natural treasure, sacred Tribal land that is home to polar  bears and brown bears and lynx and moose and Arctic foxes and seals. In  fact, it is the calving ground where a herd of 160,000 porcupine  caribou go to give birth. Yet we decided that Tribal land was not as  important as the decision for the rich and powerful oil companies to be  able to destroy that pristine area.   Let's turn, really, to what was one of the biggest issues of the  powerful over the people in 2017, one in which this body facilitated  the theft of a Supreme Court seat in order to maintain the Citizens  United ruling that allows billionaires to flood our campaigns with cash  in order to control this body--one of the most evident sources of  corruption in the history of this country.   Finally, we had an opening for the Supreme Court in 2016, an opening  that might have redressed this ``we the powerful'' decision over ``we  the people.'' This body came forward, and the leadership said: We are  not going to allow a debate on President Obama's nominee. We are not  going to allow a vote.   They justified it because it was an election year. Yet, if you look  through history, there is nothing in our history that supports that.  Fifteen times before, we had openings on the Supreme Court during  election years. Fifteen times before, we had debated. Fifteen times  before, we had voted. Then again, it was dressed up as, maybe this is  protecting the Constitution. Of course, the Constitution doesn't  absolve us of our advice and consent responsibilities in the fourth  year of a Presidency or in the eighth year of a Presidency.   The consummation of that theft was completed when this body voted to  confirm the nomination of Neil Gorsuch last April--basically, an  incredible act of irresponsibility, a failure to honor our advice and  consent responsibility, an act which denigrated the legitimacy of the  Supreme Court and certainly diminished the reputation of the Senate in  honoring our pledge to honor the Constitution, including the  constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent--all in  order to keep billionaires' money in campaigns throughout this country.  If that is not the powerful over the people in 2017, what is?   That is not the end of it. In 2017, the Republican leadership of this  body brought us five different efforts to wipe out healthcare for 20 to  30 million people. Now, I didn't hear the Senators who were supporting  this say they wanted to give up healthcare for themselves--oh, no. They  wanted to keep that, but they were very comfortable in advocating for a  bill to wipe out healthcare for 20 to 30 million Americans. There you  have it--the powerful against the people.   Then we have the tax heist--the most recent of the powerful over the  people. Add up the provisions for the wealthy. Now, remember, this tax  bill was advertised as a middle-class tax cut for the middle class, but  what did we have? We had the provision to eliminate the dynasty  loophole, which allows the richest Americans to pass on their dynasties  to the next generation without their ever paying capital gains, at a  cost of $83 billion. We had a change in the tax brackets for the  wealthiest Americans in the hundreds of billions of dollars. We had the  eliminating of the alternative minimum tax--$40 billion or so--for the  wealthiest Americans. We had the reducing of corporate taxes, the  benefits of which largely go to the big stockholders--the richest  Americans. We had the sweetheart rate for passthrough corporations that  bolstered the value of that, helping out the richest Americans.   If you add it up, one after another after another of the provisions,  all told, probably about $2 trillion has been given to the richest  Americans by the so-called middle-class tax cuts--not $2 trillion for  the middle class, not $2 trillion for the struggling bottom third of  America's families, not $2 trillion for helping to diminish the size of  our classrooms in K-12 and to improve teacher training, not $2 trillion  dedicated to wiping out the high cost of college, not $2 trillion  dedicated to  [[Page S234]]  healthcare and our clinics, not $2 trillion dedicated to  infrastructure, creating jobs, and building a better economy for the  future. No. This is $2 trillion to the richest Americans to increase  wealth inequality, to increase income inequality.   How much is $2 trillion? Can you even get your hands around that  number? Divide it by the number of Americans--men, women, and children.  That is $6,000 for every man, woman, and child in America that this  body, under this Republican leadership, decided to give to the  wealthiest Americans rather than to make available for the foundation  for our families--education, healthcare, good jobs, improved  infrastructure.   That kind of wraps up 10 items from throughout 2017. This body  constantly ignored the mission of our Constitution--our ``we the  people'' mission--and chose instead to be the government of, by, and  for the powerful.   How about we have a new year's resolution for 2018 in which we decide  to actually honor the Constitution, the vision of the Constitution, and  address the needs of America and the foundation under which families  may thrive, that of good jobs, education, and healthcare in 2018. Then  we would be doing our job, and then we would be honoring our  Constitution.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).
