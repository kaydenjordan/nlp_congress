 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blunt). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                          Remembering Leo Thorsness     Mr. President, I am speaking tomorrow at an Air Force  ROTC commissioning ceremony at the University of Arkansas. As I have  been preparing my remarks, I have been thinking a lot about the airmen  who have left more than contrails behind them--the men and women who  served with such distinction that we still remember them to this day,  those great Americans, the heroes of the sky.   The first name that came to mind, the name that resounded louder than  almost any other is the great Leo Thorsness, so you can imagine how  saddened I was to hear about his passing last week. Whenever you hear  such a legend has left the Earth, it is like a sudden crack of thunder  in the dead of night. It wakes you up. It sobers you. It reminds you of  what we have lost because Leo Thorsness was an American classic.   Born in Walnut Grove, MN, his childhood sounds as idyllic as his  hometown. He joined the Boy Scouts and later rose to become an Eagle  Scout. He met his wife Gaylee in the freshman registration line at  South Dakota State College. They married 3 years later and had one  daughter, Dawn. He joined the Air Force, went to flying school, and  became a pilot.   Soon, he was a fighter pilot in both the Strategic and Tactical Air  Commands. Looking back on his life, we can see Leo Thorsness was part  of an era--those burly, self-confident, middle-class families who,  after the Great Depression and the greatest of wars, put down roots and  built the booming America of the mid to late 20th century.   Of course, Leo was not simply a part of his generation; he inspired  it with his courage and self-sacrifice. For many Americans, the only  number they remember from the Vietnam years is their draft number. But  for Leo Thorsness, there are two numbers that stick out: 88 and 93.   It was on his 88th mission for the Air Force that he performed the  noble deeds for which he would later receive the Medal of Honor. He was  flying an F-105 Thunderchief with his weapons specialist, Harold  Johnson. They were escorting fighter bombers targeting a North  Vietnamese army barracks. They shot down a MIG, roughed up another, and  hit two missile batteries. They were low on ammo and fuel, but they  fought on. He continued to scare off MIGs and instructed a tanker plane  to refuel another fighter. When he finally landed 70 miles south in  Thailand, the fuel tank was on empty. It was a stunning act of bravery.   It was on his 93rd mission, just seven shy of completing his tour of  duty,  [[Page S2912]]  that Leo Thorsness was shot down. He was captured and spent 6 years in  the ``Hanoi Hilton''--6 years in the darkness. It was there that he met  his cellmate, our colleague and future Senator, John McCain.   Imagining 6 days in such a terrible place is more than most people  can handle, never mind 6 years. But Leo Thorsness endured; he saw the  mission through. When he returned in 1973, it was to an astonished and  grateful nation, but the man himself was unfazed. He called his wife  after being released and said: ``I would have called sooner, but I've  been all tied up.''   He later went on to serve in the Washington State Senate and run for  other offices. But his legacy is not one of the titles he won; it is  the example he set.   He was quite a man, Leo Thorsness. And though we have lost him, we  will keep his memory for a good long time to come.   Leo Thorsness, rest in peace.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
