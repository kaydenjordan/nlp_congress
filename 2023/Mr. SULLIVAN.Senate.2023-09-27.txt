 Mr. President, I am going to speak about a really  important bill that I am hoping we are going to pass right here on the  Senate floor. It was passed, by the way, previously. It is called the  Pay Our Military Act.   It is pretty simple. In the event of a shutdown--and right now, we  are all working hard to make sure we avoid it--we need to make sure  that the men and women who protect us get paid. That is it, simple-- really, really simple.   I know back home in the great State of Alaska, there is a lot of  frustration with our government. It seems like every day the Biden  administration has another order to shut down Alaska, lock up our  lands, put people out of work. There are skyrocketing prices on  everything from gas to food. Interest rates are at 40-year highs.  Illegal immigration, which is just flooding across the southern border,  is a literal invasion happening right now. A lot of people are  frustrated with what is happening. The potential of a government  shutdown is not going to help any of that, in my view.   But this is something that every Member of the Senate should agree  on. If there is a shutdown--a lot of us are working hard to avoid  that--we need an insurance policy for our military personnel. The brave  men and women who are serving on the frontlines right now, at home and  abroad--dangerous work to keep us safe--they need nothing less than the  unwavering support of the U.S. Senate. For the men and women who  protect us, often at great personal sacrifice, the least we can do as  their representatives is to ensure that they receive their hard-earned  pay, regardless of the political circumstances that may unfold.   My Pay Our Military Act is not about partisan politics. It is not  about ideological differences. It is about fulfilling the solemn  obligation to our troops and their families, and it is about providing  them the stability and peace of mind that they need to do their jobs.   Regardless of what happens here, they will continue to serve, to  deploy, to train. We have seen, in the last couple of weeks, that  training can also be very dangerous. We had some marines recently  killed down in Australia in an Osprey accident. The last thing these  men and women need to worry about is whether or not they are going to  get a paycheck next week, whether or not they are going to be able to  support their families next week in the event there is a government  shutdown.   I want to emphasize again that I hope this bill is unnecessary, but  the fact remains that this certainly could happen, a government  shutdown, and, if it does, we need to pay our military right now.   There is precedent--very strong precedent--on this very bill, this  commonsense bill that has historically received the strong support from  both sides of the aisle and in both Houses.   Let me be specific. Facing an imminent government shutdown in 2013,  which ended up lasting 16 days, this bill, the Pay Our Military Act,  was passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate and unanimously by the U.S.  House and signed by the President. Congress recognized then the  importance of uninterrupted military pay for our military members and  their families.   The political makeup, actually, was the same. You had a Democrat in  the White House. You had a Democrat-controlled Senate, and a  Republican-controlled House. So it is simple.  [[Page S4703]]    While I urge my colleagues to put aside their differences and come  together in a spirit of unity to support this bill, I am a little  concerned. My colleague and friend Senator Cruz and I came down to the  floor last week to pass another related bill. This would have  guaranteed Coast Guard members got paid in a government shutdown. We  did that because, in 2019, the only branch of the military services  that didn't get paid when there was a government shutdown was the Coast  Guard. Everybody else got paid. The Coast Guard didn't. Senator Cruz  and I came down here last week and said: Hey, in the event of a  shutdown, we have to make sure the Coast Guard gets paid.    Well, it was blocked. It was blocked. I still don't know what my  colleague from Washington State was talking about when she blocked it-- something about, well, the authority of the Appropriations Committee.  What? Nobody cares about that. Do you support our troops or not?   This bill is even more simple. Our bill, the Pay Our Military Act,  covers all branches, including the Coast Guard and civilians that the  Department of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security believe  are necessary also to pay. Again, I hope that, like in 2013, this is  going to pass unanimously.   As I mentioned, last week, my colleague from Washington State  objected to the Pay Our Coast Guard bill. It was confounding,  particularly because she was a cosponsor of the exact same bill in  2019. As a matter of fact, here is what she wrote in 2019, when there  was a government shutdown and we were trying to pay the Coast Guard:         It's absolutely unacceptable--    This is the Senator from Washington State--         that our Coast Guard families went without their paychecks       during the shutdown. We need to make sure President Trump       doesn't put them through this again.    Whoa. That was the Senator from Washington State during the last  shutdown. I wish she would have said that last week.   So I am very hopeful that what happened in 2013--the Senate and the  House unanimously came together when there was an imminent shutdown and  said: Hey, we might not be able to figure out how to keep the  government open, but here is one darn thing we are going to do; we are  going to pay our military. I sure hope that we can do that again, and I  sure hope people who want to try to use the military as political pawns  leading up to a shutdown are not going to be tempted to object to this  bipartisan, much needed bill that 10 years ago had the support of  everyone.   I yield to my colleague from Texas.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Appropriations be discharged from further consideration of  S. 2835 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I  further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, as my colleague Senator Cruz just  mentioned, every member of the military just heard ``I object,'' and  the Senator from Washington State just said, ``Let's be real.'' ``Let's  be real.'' There is nothing more real than putting your life on the  line for the country you love and nothing more important than defending  those who defend us. Let's be real. I am having a hard time with  ``Let's be real.''   What she just mentioned had nothing to do with the bill. Again, 10  years ago, when there was an imminent shutdown just like there is  today, which I certainly don't want, the Senate and House and White  House came together and said: All right. We know there is a risk, but  there are some special people who serve in our government--and, mind  you, very special people--who deserve to be taken care of; that is, the  men and women and their families who are serving right now overseas,  all over the country, protecting Americans.   It is an outrage. It is an outrage to utter those two words: ``I  object.'' It is an outrage. And if it happens next week, as Senator  Cruz mentioned that there are young men and women around the world  protecting us without getting paid and having to worry where they are  going to buy or how they are going to buy groceries, I hope they  remember the Senator from Washington State's two words: ``I object.''  That was good, old-fashioned hostage-taking, making a marine lance  corporal all of a sudden subject to the political whims of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It didn't happen in 2013.   I have no idea, truthfully--no idea--why my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle would not support this Pay Our Military bill.   I am going to keep coming down here all week to get this passed, and  hopefully they will have a change of heart.   I yield the floor.
