 Mr. Chairman, I have amendment No. 48 at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I support the underlying legislation to  increase domestic energy production to replenish the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve that has been recklessly and dangerously drawn down  by the Biden administration in a cynically political move to try to  lower energy prices before an election.   But we know that in a move to placate radical environmentalists,  President Biden blocked the Keystone XL pipeline at the beginning of  this administration. His administration suspended oil and natural gas  leasing and permits when he took office. But for the last year, the  President and his supporters have been pleading for more domestic  energy production.   The President can't have it both ways. In just over 2 years, the  President has depleted the crude oil and the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve by 40 percent. Not only did this scheme fail to bring down  prices in a meaningful way for Americans, but it also threatens our  energy and national security should a true national emergency occur.   This is not just negligence from the administration. The  administration is waging an active war against the oil and gas sector.   Now, we all know about the war against leases, and we know about the  war against energy infrastructure like Keystone. But ground zero, Mr.  Chairman, for this war against domestic energy production is the  weaponization of financial regulation to discriminate against American  energy production and redirect capital away from American energy  production.   This is all happening at the precise time we need more, not less,  energy production. The Energy Information Administration recently  projected that global energy consumption will increase by 50 percent in  the year 2050 with almost one-half of energy consumption coming from  natural gas and other fossil fuel energy.   So why do we need this amendment?   Because this is a capital-intensive enterprise. In order for oil and  gas production to happen, Mr. Chairman, you have to have the financing  for that, and this Administration has weaponized the financial  regulators to limit access to financing and to limit access to capital.   For example, initiatives by the Federal Reserve working with a  Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial  System, otherwise known as NGFS; the Securities and Exchange  Commission's proposed Rules to Enhance and Standardize Climate-Related  Disclosures for Investors; the Financial Stability Oversight Council's  report and recommendation on climate-related financial risk; the FDIC's  principles for climate-related financial risk management for large  financial institutions; and the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency's principles for climate-related financial risk management for  large banks.   My amendment would simply pause any and all of these climate-related  financial regulations so that financial institutions can provide the  capital and the financing for the oil and gas producers so that we can,  in fact, replenish the petroleum reserve.   There is no question that the war on energy is costing families and  small businesses increased costs. Just in the first year of this  administration, investment and oil and natural gas production dropped  by 25 percent.   It is time we unleash American energy to lower costs over the long  run. That means we need access to capital--access to financing--for  American energy.   My amendment would give American energy companies access to our deep,  liquid capital markets so that we can continue to power this country's  economy and replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   That is why I am offering this amendment: to protect American energy  producers and to protect their access to capital markets so that we can  facilitate the replenishment of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   I would argue we need to unleash our financial institutions and our  asset managers and investors to give our energy producers the financing  that they need to rebuild our economy, to lower costs at the pump, and  to lower energy costs across the board.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and, of  course, support the underlying piece of legislation. I yield back the  balance of my time.                                Point of Order     Mr. Chairman, I would respectfully argue that the amendment  is core to the proper functioning of the  [[Page H378]]  underlying bill. The amendment's purpose is the same purpose as the  underlying bill: it is to facilitate the replenishment of the SPR for  the exact drawdowns covered in the bill. The amendment furthers the  objective of the underlying bill. In fact, it is arguably inextricably  linked and indispensable to the purpose of the bill in so far as  producing more oil and gas requires access to capital for those  producers of oil and gas.    Mr. Chairman, you can't produce oil and gas if you can't get  financing for it. That is why I respectfully oppose the point of order.
