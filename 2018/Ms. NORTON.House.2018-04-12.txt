 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, D.C. begins commemorations of the  emancipation of slaves in the Nation's Capital 9 months before slavery  was abolished elsewhere in the United States. Yet, D.C. residents, 156  years later, still are not free. Congress can overturn local laws  nowhere else except in the District, and collects taxes without  representation.   The residents of the Nation's Capital have more than paid the price  for their citizenship. Most are native-born American citizens.  Residents have fought and died in every U.S. war, including the  Revolutionary War that created the United States of America.   And D.C. residents rank number one in taxes paid to support the  United States Government. We are well within our rights to ask Congress  to grant the District of Columbia full emancipation by making the  District the 51st State.                            ____________________
