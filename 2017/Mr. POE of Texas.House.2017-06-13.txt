 Mr. Speaker, last week, Cheniere Energy,  headquartered in Houston, Texas, delivered its first liquified natural  gas shipment out of the Sabine Pass terminal to northern Europe, to the  Netherlands, and to Poland. This follows shipments to southern Europe  from earlier this year.   Put simply, this is a tremendous game changer. Exporting LNG is not  just an economic issue, it is a geopolitical security issue. These  shipments help thwart Russian aggression and weaken Russia's  stranglehold over Europe, and it is about time.   Under Secretary Perry's leadership, the Energy Department is finally  approving licenses for LNG terminals to ship LNG overseas.   Our natural gas is cheaper and more abundant in supply than anywhere  in the world. Harnessing our domestic energy resources and exporting  some of it to our friends and to our allies around the world makes  sense for our economy and for our national security.   We should apply the Blue Bell ice cream philosophy to our domestic  energy resources. It is: Use what we can and sell the rest.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
