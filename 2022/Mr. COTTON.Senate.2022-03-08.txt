 Madam President, today, I stand with a heavy heart,  alongside Senator Boozman, to mourn the deaths of two great Arkansans,  Arkansas Department of Corrections Sergeant Joshua Caudell and West  Memphis firefighter Jason Lang. They both died as they lived: serving  their fellow Arkansans.   Like every State, Arkansas is suffering terribly from the crime wave  that has crashed across the country in the past 2\1/2\ years. Our men  and women in law enforcement are on the frontline of this crisis,  fighting against the forces of disorder, ridding our streets of  poisonous drugs, facing down evil itself.   Sadly, too many in law enforcement have paid the ultimate price while  protecting the innocent and fighting the guilty.                       Honoring Sergeant Joshua Caudell    Madam President, last Monday, another Arkansan lost his life as an  officer in the line of duty.   The other week, Pulaski County Sheriff's deputies were asked to check  on a woman who hadn't shown up to work that day. Her friends were  concerned about her well-being and wanted to make sure she was safe.  When the deputies arrived at the woman's house, an armed assailant  opened fire, forcing them to take cover and call backup. The shooter  managed to escape, and deputies then called in canine officers to find  the would-be cop killer.   One of the officers assigned to this dangerous job was Sergeant  Joshua Caudell. Sergeant Caudell helped track the shooter to a trailer  not far away. Tragically, unknown to the officers, the shooter was  lying in wait underneath the trailer. He once again opened fire on the  police, this time hitting Sergeant Caudell and killing him.   Sergeant Caudell was 29 years old. He had a wife and three children.  My prayers and Senator Boozman's prayers reflect the prayers of all  Arkansans going out to his family. We can only imagine their heartbreak  and pain.   The heinous criminal who committed this murder is now in custody. He  will face justice--stern, swift, and fair. And he must face the  sternest justice possible because an attack on a law enforcement  officer is also an attack on the rule of law, on order, on civilization  itself.   Sadly, the slaying of Sergeant Caudell was not the only tragedy that  befell our State in the last 2 weeks.                             Honoring Jason Lang    Madam President, on Saturday, February 26, 20-year-old West Memphis  firefighter Jason Lang was on his way to an EMT class when he saw that  a stranger had gotten into a car accident. Exactly as you would expect  from such a fine public servant, he pulled over, and he tried to help  the crash victim. As he was selflessly helping the stranger, Jason was  tragically struck by an 18-wheeler and killed.   Jason's death is a heartbreaking loss for our State. When Jason saw a  fellow Arkansan in distress, he ran toward the danger. Every young boy  and girl should aspire to serve their community with the same sense of  bravery.   Today, all of Arkansas weeps red and blue. My heart and Senator  Boozman's heart goes out to all Arkansas firefighters and police  officers who do so much for our State each and every day.   President Reagan said in his first inaugural address that ``those who  say that we're in a time'' without heroes ``just don't know where to  look.'' Jason Lang and Joshua Caudell were, indeed, heroes; and we can  look to them, and we can honor their legacy. God bless them, God bless  their families, and God bless the State of Arkansas.   I yield the floor.
