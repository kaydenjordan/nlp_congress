 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Journey House  in Milwaukee, WI, on its 50th anniversary. For five decades, Journey  House has been a beacon of hope in the city's Clarke Square  neighborhood. Since its founding in the summer of 1969, Journey House  has made tremendous strides in helping families move out of poverty on  Milwaukee's near Southside. I am delighted to honor this remarkable  community organization and commemorate this significant milestone.   Through its four core programs, Journey House has helped low-income  community members achieve their greatest potential. Its adult education  program provides basic skills and GED education in both English and  Spanish to lay the foundation for a successful career path. Its youth  development programs focus on keeping children and young adults away  from drugs and violence. Its emphasis on workforce readiness builds the  skills and motivation employers seek. Its family engagement events  offer the simple but important gift of spending time together in a safe  and welcoming environment. Programming also includes community learning  centers, housing for homeless youth aging out of foster care, and  affordable family housing.   Journey House began with a staff of two local teenagers, Zlan  Kleczewski and Rudy Rosas, working as codirectors. With funding from  VISTA--Volunteers in Service to America--they organized programs for  youth engagement and development. As Journey House started to grow and  as Zlan and Rudy returned to school, the organization sought permanent  leadership.   After receiving its first VISTA grant in 1969, Journey House hired  its first full-time director in 1971. Today, Journey House is led by  Dr. Michele Bria who, since her start in 1998, has been the inspiration  behind the agency's success. Under her leadership, the agency has grown  from a small operation with two sites and a $200,000 budget to a  multimillion dollar organization that serves thousands daily. Her hard  work and commitment are reflected in the achievements of countless  youth and families who have broken the cycle of poverty.   From its humble beginnings five decades ago, Journey House has played  a transformative role in one of Milwaukee's most ethnically diverse and  economically challenged neighborhoods. I am proud to recognize the  contributions made by Journey House over the past 50 years, and I am  grateful for the work the staff do every day to change lives for the  better.                            ____________________
