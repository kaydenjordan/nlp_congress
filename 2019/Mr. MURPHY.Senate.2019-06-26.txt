 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order of  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on July 9, the Trump administration will  be in court defending the Texas v. United States lawsuit. Let me  rephrase that. They will not be defending the lawsuit. They will be  arguing on the side of the plaintiff in that lawsuit.   This is a virtually unprecedented move. Administrations traditionally  defend the statutes of the United States, no matter what they feel  about the politics of the underlying statute. But the Trump  administration has made the decision to join with 22 Republican  attorneys general to argue that the entirety of the Affordable Care Act  should be dismantled, with nothing to replace it.   There are those of us who believe that it would not be wise policy to  kick 20 million people off of insurance and get rid of all of the  insurance protections in the Affordable Care Act, with no idea as to  what comes next. We have begged our Republican colleagues to join us in  telling the Trump administration--demanding that the Trump  [[Page S4536]]  administration argue against the attorneys general in this case.   I have listened to my Republican friends, and I have listened to the  President himself over and over again say that they don't like the  Affordable Care Act. They want to replace it with something else,  something that insures more people, and something that continues to  protect people with preexisting conditions. If that is your position,  it stands to reason that you would oppose a lawsuit that seeks to  invalidate the entirety of the Affordable Care Act with nothing to  replace it.   The bewitching hour is upon us. The oral arguments are the week after  next. This lawsuit was successful at the district court level, so there  is no reason not to believe there is a substantial possibility that it  could be successful at the appellate court level as well.   I wanted to come to the floor, as we head into this week while we  will be back in our districts, just to make sure that everybody  understands what the stakes are on July 9 when the Trump administration  will argue in court to get rid of insurance for 20 to 30 million  Americans and what the stakes are for this Senate--in particular,  Senate Republicans refusing to stand up to the President in his  perpetuation of this lawsuit.   If the Affordable Care Act is struck down, there are 130 million  Americans with preexisting conditions who could see insurance rates  increase by up to 50 to 60 percent. Others will have their insurance  withdrawn when they go through open enrollment next because no insurer  will cover someone with serious, very expensive preexisting conditions.  That was the way things worked before the Affordable Care Act was  passed.   Gone is Medicaid expansion, which today covers 17 million people  across the country--and I have been happy to see more and more States  with Republican Governors or Republican State legislators adopt the  Medicaid expansions and become a source of bipartisan agreement that  more people should have access to Medicaid--but those 17 million people  will lose their coverage.   There are 12 million seniors who will immediately pay more for  prescription drugs because the Affordable Care Act gets rid of, over  time, essentially the entirety of the Medicare part D doughnut hole.   There are 2.3 million adult children who are on their parents'  insurance until they become 26, who would potentially lose access to  that insurance. The Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to  cover those kids. Many insurers, without that requirement, would no  longer cover those children.   Then many of the other protections in the marketplace, like bans on  lifetime caps or annual caps, can be lost. Insurers would once again be  back in the practice of saying to a very sick child, a patient with  cancer: You only get x amount of insurance coverage from us, and once  you go beyond that number, then it is on your dime.   Again, remember, before the Affordable Care Act was passed, there  were 1.5 million families every single year in this country who  declared bankruptcy. Today, there are half as many families who declare  bankruptcy in this country. It is not coincidence that studies have  shown us that of those 1.5 million, half of them were declaring  bankruptcy because of medical costs. When you don't go bankrupt any  longer because of medical costs because you have access to affordable  insurance and your insurance company can't kick you off because you get  sick, you don't face the kind of destitution that families faced  before.   So I think it does make sense to run through the lineup of who has  weighed in in favor of this court case to invalidate the entirety of  the Affordable Care Act and knock 20 to 30 million people off of  insurance to jack up rates for millions more and who has weighed in  against it.   Well, the President wants this lawsuit to succeed. Attorneys general  want this lawsuit to succeed. And by the silence of my Republican  colleagues, you would infer that many Republicans may want this lawsuit  to succeed.   But here is who hates this lawsuit. I am not going to run through the  whole list here, but this is essentially anybody who knows anything  about healthcare. This is essentially every organization that  represents people who have serious diseases, every association that  represents doctors, and every association that represents hospitals.  You don't really find all of those groups aligned on much at all  because when you are moving around pieces in the healthcare system,  often you will do something that benefits patients that insurers will  not like or you benefit something at hospitals that single-practice  offices will not like. This is pretty much everybody who says: If you  kick 20 million people off insurance like that and you have no plan to  replace it, that is a humanitarian catastrophe.   Here is what the AARP says in their filing opposing this lawsuit:         If this Court finds that the ACA is invalid, millions of       older adults will lose the healthcare coverage and consumer       protections they have relied on for years. They will also       throw the Medicare and Medicaid programs into fiscal and       administrative chaos, which will disrupt the nation's       healthcare system and economy. It will plunge the more than       100 million people with preexisting conditions into an abyss       of uncertainty about whether they can obtain coverage.    That is the AARP.   Here is what the American Medical Association says: ``The decision  below, if affirmed, would have devastating effects on the quality,  cost, and availability of such care.''   Families USA says: ``Among those whose coverage rates increased due  to Medicaid expansion are young adults, people with HIV, veterans,  rural residents, and racial and ethnic minorities.''   For many of our most vulnerable citizens who are covered by Medicaid,  eliminating the expansion would leave them without healthcare.   I mentioned the insurance companies are against this lawsuit. They  say this: ``Invalidation of the ACA--irrespective of the continued  operation of the so-called individual mandate--would wreak havoc on the  healthcare system.''   Finally, Americans with disabilities say:         The result is a cruel irony: the population that needs       healthcare the most has the hardest time obtaining it. For       the last nine years, the ACA has helped change that.       Stripping away its protections now will reverse the positive       gains that people with disabilities have realized and will       return this community to the same grim reality as before the       ACA, if not place people with disabilities in an even worse       position.    So let's not forget where we were before the Affordable Care Act was  passed. I am not saying that it is perfect. I am not saying that we  shouldn't work together to try to improve it. We just finished a debate  in the Health Committee in which we passed a whole bunch of reforms to  our healthcare system that Republicans and Democrats agree on.   But the American Cancer Society, in their filing, reminds the court:  ``A 2009 Harvard Medical School study found approximately 45,000 deaths  annually could be attributed to lack of health insurance among working- age Americans.''   The Heart Association said this: ``Even during a heart attack,  uninsured patients were more likely to delay seeking medical care  because of the financial implications.''   I could go on and on, reading from these filings or reading from the  testimony that all of these groups have submitted. Again, that is not  to say that these groups don't want changes in our healthcare system.  Nobody on this list, as far as I know, is arguing for the status quo,  just as no one in this body is arguing for the status quo. But to rip  away Medicaid expansion, to rip out from the roots of the healthcare  system the exchanges and the tax credits, to get rid of all of the  insurance protections, to reverse the gains we have made on lowering  prescription drug costs for seniors--to do all of that with nothing to  replace it is to invite misery, destitution, and chaos.   Let's just be honest. We are not ready to ride to the rescue. I  offered an amendment in the Health Committee today just asking for the  Department of Health and Human Services to provide us with a report  about what the landscape would look like in the healthcare system if  Texas v. United States were successful. I didn't get a single  Republican vote for that one. All I was asking was that we just get a  report on how bad it is going to be so  [[Page S4537]]  that we can start doing a little bit of advance planning, and not a  single Republican was willing to vote for that in committee today.   So we are deliberately boxing our eyes and ears about what the  effects on our constituents could be if this lawsuit is successful. We  are not in a position to ride to the rescue. There is no chance that  this Congress is going to pass a new healthcare reform proposal that  will restore healthcare to everybody who lost it. That is not  happening, and I know that is not a surprise to anyone here.   You also shouldn't delude yourself into thinking this lawsuit will  not be successful. There are lots of very smart legal scholars who  suggest that this argument that the plaintiffs are making, which the  Trump administration has endorsed, is nonsense. I tend to agree with  them. The argument is that because you got rid of one section of the  Affordable Care Act, then the court needs to invalidate the rest.   Well, Congress made its intent pretty clear. Republicans decided to  get rid of the individual mandate for the penalty that is assessed if  you don't have insurance and deliberately did not choose to get rid of  the rest of it. I think that is not a smart decision, but the intent of  Congress is pretty clear.   It is my belief that this argument doesn't hold water, and that is  the belief of many smart legal scholars, but the district court ruled  in favor of the plaintiffs. So you already have a Federal judge who  invalidated the entire Affordable Care Act.    Since then, the Trump administration has upped the ante. The district  court finding in favor of the plaintiffs, which invalidates the entire  Affordable Care Act, didn't convince the President to say: Let's pull  back the reins a little bit here. Let's maybe change our position. This  feels too real. Let's hedge our bets. No; after the district court  ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, the administration changed their  position to go all in on the plaintiffs' side. Their initial lawsuit  only backed up some of the plaintiffs' claims.   So the district court ruled that the Affordable Care Act has to  disappear overnight. The Trump administration has changed their  position to weigh in and to support the entirety of the lawsuit, and we  are not having a serious conversation about what happens if the fate  that all of these groups are deeply fearful of comes to pass.   Finally, this is not about numbers. This isn't about statistics. This  is about real people. Michael from New Fairfield, CT, says:         This is . . . personal to me, the ACA literally saved my       life in 2016. I have pre-existing, recurrent skull base       disease for most of my adult life. I underwent an 11-hour       skull base neurosurgery to remove a benign tumor that       involved my brain arteries, nasal passages, jaw and a total       reconstruction of my middle and outer ear canals. My surgeon       said I was a month away from a much more debilitating       surgical outcome. As it is, my recovery and rehabilitation       period has been a full two years with resulting partial       physical impairment.        My spouse and I both run our own businesses and the ACA is       still our family's only option for healthcare. Without the       operations and the ACA coverage, the disease would have       continued to progress--I would have eventually died and my       family would have had to sell the house and/or go bankrupt to       manage the medical expenses.    David from Southport said:         In July of 2011 I was diagnosed with Colon Cancer. At the       time, I was covered under an individual policy with Blue       Cross Blue Shield. It was a very comprehensive policy and,       after my deductible was satisfied, it covered all my doctor       and hospital expenses, surgeries, chemotherapy, medications,       etc.        However, a couple of years later I was advised that due to       my preexisting condition I would not be able to renew my       policy. . . .        At that time I enrolled in [the Affordable Care Act] Access       Health CT and without this policy . . . [through Access       Health CT] I would not be able to be insured and would face       prohibitive costs for even basic care.    David's story can be told thousands of times over: a diagnosis  followed by denial of coverage from an insurance company because of a  preexisting condition.   There is no free market response when it comes to very sick people  who want insurance. The free market tells the insurance company: Do not  insure somebody who is going to cost you a lot of money. The free  market would tell the insurance company to keep that person on the  outside of insurance. So there has to be a public sector response. We  provided that response with the Affordable Care Act and now, in a  matter of weeks or months, it could all be gone.   So I come down to the floor this afternoon to once again engage my  colleagues and ask them to work together. Let's try to find a common  ground here, at least behind the premise that you shouldn't rip out the  foundation of the modern healthcare system without a plan for what  comes next.   I assume we will continue to offer unanimous consent requests to try  to withhold funding for the Trump administration's perpetuation of this  lawsuit. I would hope we can get Republican support for that motion,  not because Republicans support the Affordable Care Act--I get it; I am  not going to get Republicans to support the Affordable Care Act--but  because my Republican friends need to make good on what they have said  for years; that they want the Affordable Care Act to go, but they  really want something else to replace it that will insure the same  number of people and protect folks who are sick. That cannot happen if  this lawsuit succeeds.   As we head back to our districts for this recess period, I wanted to  make sure everybody knows how many groups that know something or  anything about healthcare are standing against Texas v. The United  States.   I yield the floor.
