 Mr. President, 18 years ago today, Americans witnessed  what evil looks like. Eighteen years ago today, Americans witnessed the  loss of innocent life. Eighteen years ago today, Americans witnessed  acts of cowardice.   Today, Montanans and Americans across our country are taking time to  reflect upon the horrific acts of 9/11. Today, we take time to remember  the thousands of lives lost on that horrible day. We remember the  daughters who lost mothers, the sons who lost fathers, and the loved  ones and friends and the communities that were broken by these  tragedies.   I know I speak for most of us when I say that we remember that day  like it was yesterday. That fateful morning, I was in Bozeman, MT. I  typically like to get an earlier start at work. We are 2 hours behind  eastern time. So it was early in the morning.   My wife Cindy called me. I was at my desk. I was working for a cloud- computing software company, just starting the day, and Cindy called me.  She said: There is really strange news. There has been a plane that hit  one of the World Trade Center towers.   I think many of us at that time thought it was maybe a small, private  plane--sort of, kind of a strange bit of news coming out that morning.  Then, as the minutes went by, we started finding out what was really  going on, that it wasn't a small plane. It wasn't an accident. It was a  767 loaded with fuel because it was attempting to make a journey across  our country from Boston out to the west coast.   The images of the planes crashing into the Twin Towers is one I will  never forget, and it is one that will never stop hurting. I remember  that after it was confirmed that it was a commercial aircraft, very  quickly the speculation began that this was a premeditated terror  attack. In moments like that you want to be with your loved ones. I  quietly closed the door to my office, and I drove home to be with my  wife and to be with family as we watched the rest of the horrible day  unfold: 2,977 innocent Americans lost their lives, and 2,977 innocent  Americans didn't return home that day.   I think it is important to think about every single human life that  was lost and the pain of the families who remember that day today when  they lost their loved ones. That pain is very real yet again today.   This was a slaughter of our fellow Americans that shook our Nation to  its very core. Yet, in the face of extreme adversity, we are a nation  that did come together and we carried on. I think about those moments  when our churches and cathedrals were filled with Americans in prayer,  reflecting upon what had happened.   Today, we honor and remember the almost 3,000 people who died that  September morning. We remember the survivors, those first responders,  the firefighters, and the friends and families of those we lost. While  we take the time to remember today, we also reflect on who we are as a  nation. As Americans, we are strong and resilient. After the 9/11  attacks, we responded with strength and we strengthened the homeland.   We are most grateful to those who served and to those who are serving  today in our Armed Forces. Just recently, last December, I flew to  Afghanistan. In fact, we carried 50 pounds of Montana beef jerky to  deliver to the 495th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion of the  Montana Army National Guard, who are deployed over in Afghanistan  protecting us. As I received the briefs that day, I was reminded yet  again that this war that we have against terrorism exists this very  moment, and I can tell you this because of the men and women who serve  in our Armed Forces, in intelligence, and in law enforcement across our  Nation. It is because of them that we are able to stand here today  without another terror attack like we saw on 9/11.   When I received the brief in Afghanistan in December, I was reminded  again of the porous border between Afghanistan and Pakistan and that  there are plots being created and attempts to hit the homeland again.  There are many brave men and women there, many Special Forces.   I spent time with the four-star there, Scott Miller, who has had a  career in Special Forces. He is overseeing the operations there. I am  grateful that they continue to remain vigilant in this fight against  global terrorism.   America's enemies want us to be afraid, but the thing is, here in  America, we don't give up. When America is strong, so are our allies  and so is the free world. We must remain vigilant to ensure that we  maintain that Reagan doctrine of peace through strength.   The world will never forget what happened on this day 18 years ago,  and despite the political differences and divisions that we have across  our country and this city, we must always remember that we are all in  this together, and Americans are strong when we are united.   There is no force of evil or terror that will ever overcome the will  and the determination of a free and united people.   We ask that God continue to bless our fighting men and women, and may  God continue to bless the United States of America.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I have the honor of  recognizing Dr. Bardett Fausett, of Missoula County, for his service in  providing care and treatment to Montana mothers and babies.   Early in his career, Dr. Fausett made the decision to serve his  country in the U.S. Air Force. After serving his country, he was able  to afford to go to medical school and provide for his young family  after college. After serving 25 years in the Air Force, Dr. Fausett  retired from his military service earned a position at the Missoula  Community Medical Center.   Dr. Fausett went to Missoula with the hope of serving the community  and providing care and treatment for mothers and their babies. Fausett  took up the challenge of handling mothers with very complicated  pregnancies and medical issues.   As a maternal fetal medicine specialist, he focused on treating  babies and mothers while the baby is still in the womb. Pregnant  mothers from all over the region with complicated medical issues  traveled to see Dr. Fausett with the hope that he could help their  families.   In his 5 years in Missoula, Dr. Fausett has delivered about 1,200  babies.   His service to our Nation in the U.S. Air Force as well as his  dedication to continue his service by providing care to Montana mothers  and babies is exemplary of the Montana spirit. He has changed the lives  of many families across Montana by giving them personal care through  challenging times.                            ____________________
