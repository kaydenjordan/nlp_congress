 Mr. Speaker, on August 5, 2016, the Obama administration  published another overreaching regulation that threatens the authority  of States nationwide to manage fish and wildlife.   Specifically, the new rule undermines Alaska's authority to manage  fish and wildlife on State, private, and Federal lands. The new  regulation destroys the cooperative relationship between the State of  Alaska and the agency that historically worked well.   This power grab threatens management policies and wildlife refuges  nationwide and, if allowed to stand, will set a dangerous precedent for  future top-down mandates from the Federal Government that seize  authority from States.   The rule violates the Alaska constitution and two laws that were  passed by Congress in the form of the Alaska National Interest Lands  Conservation Act and the Alaska Statehood Act. People throughout the  country oppose this misguided rule that harms the State of Alaska's  authority to manage fish and wildlife within its borders.   In my home State of Arizona, 21 different sportsmen's groups have  come out publicly against the rule and endorsed Representative Young's  bill to overturn this Washington power grab. The 21 Arizona sportsmen's  groups include:   Anglers United; Arizona Flycasters; Arizona Sportsmen for Wildlife  Conservation; Arizona Antelope Foundation, Arizona B.A.S.S. Nation;  Arizona Big Game Super Raffle; Arizona Bowhunters Association;  Arizona Catfish Conservation Association; Arizona Chapter of National  Wild Turkey Federation; Arizona Council of Trout Unlimited; Arizona  Deer Association; Arizona Desert Bighorn Sheep Society; Arizona Elk  Society; Arizona Houndsmen Association; Arizona Outdoor Sports;  Coconino Sportsmen; Outdoor Experience for All; Shake Rattle and Troll  Outdoors; the Bass Federation-AZ; Xtreme Predator Callers; and  1.2.3.Go.    Representative Don Young's bill is also supported by 27 different  sportsmen and conservation groups throughout the country. The National  Rifle Association, who is key voting in support of Representative  Young's bill, stated:         The sustainable management of these natural resources needs       to be led by the State working in cooperation with the Fish       and Wildlife Service. The Fish and Wildlife Service's final       rule would set an ill-advised national precedent that could       have far-reaching negative implications on the lower 48  [[Page H1264]]       States. H.J. Res. 69 will restore the jurisdictional State-      Federal relationship as Congress has previously directed.    Americans for Prosperity, who is also key voting in support of H.J.  Res. 69, stated:         The Interior rule relating to nonsubsistence take of       wildlife, and public participation of closure procedures on       national wildlife refuges in Alaska undermines the ability of       Alaskans to manage fish and wildlife on refuge lands, which       make up more than 20 percent of the State.        Instead, Congress should work with the Trump administration       to ensure cooperative Federalism and greater public       participation over fish and wildlife management decisions.    I share these concerns and urge rejection of this Obama power grab  that undermines Alaska authority to manage fish and wildlife on State,  private, and Federal lands. I applaud Representative Don Young for his  excellent work and leadership on this issue. He has been remarkably  successful over the years of protecting the interests of the people of  the State of Alaska. This is yet another classic example of the  bureaucratic overreach that Representative Young is working hard to  overturn.   The Alaska Department of Fish and Game knows best how to manage fish  and wildlife in the State of Alaska, not Washington bureaucrats.   I urge adoption of Representative Young's commonsense bill.                                time  1315
