 Mr. Speaker, last week, we observed a moment of silence  to remember the victims 6 years after the Tucson shooting. Just  yesterday, another moment of silence to remember the five people killed  and six wounded when they were shot while waiting at the Fort  Lauderdale Airport baggage claim.   In those awful moments after the shooting, the airport was thrown  into chaos and confusion. Yet, before we knew anything of the  circumstances, every American could tell you what would come next  because Congress has developed a well-worn routine in response to gun  violence: first, shocking news of a deadly shooting, followed by  thoughts and prayers, followed by a moment of silence on this floor,  followed by a complete failure to take action.   To truly honor the victims, moments of silence must be followed by  productive discussions of policy: What will we do to keep our community  safer? I ask my Republican colleagues, meet with me. Let's at least  start a conversation here on the House floor. We can no longer remain  silent during this epidemic of gun violence. Thoughts and prayers are  all that we have offered the American people, and that is not enough.                            ____________________
