 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  3445, the African Growth and Opportunity Act and Millennium Challenge  Act Modernization Act.   I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 3445, and as Chairman of the House  Foreign Affairs Africa subcommittee, I want to applaud Chairman Royce,  Ranking Member Elliot Engel, and the Ranking Member of my subcommittee,  Karen Bass, for their commitment to Africa and to enhancing trade, and  all the benefits in terms of closer relationships that flow from trade,  between the people of the United States and the people of Africa.   The original AGOA Act of 2000 has been called a ``cornerstone'' of  our trade policy toward the continent, and it has served us well. Over  the years, however, our subcommittee has had numerous hearings--not to  mention meetings with African heads of state and ambassadors--on AGOA,  increasing exports to Africa, and on cultivating the-rule-of-law  reforms necessary to attract business and investment to Africa. In past  Congresses I introduced the Increasing American Jobs Through Greater  Exports to Africa Act. It has become apparent that, as well as AGOA has  served us, there is room for improvement and innovation.   H.R. 3445 marks a step toward that, by emphasizing capacity building  and training and encouraging entrepreneurship in Africa. Importantly,  it acknowledges that the world has changed since 2000, and that Africa  has been targeted by radical extremists such as Boko Haram and al- Shabaab. Recognizing that we now live in a post-2001 world, H.R. 3445  fosters compliance with our counterterrorism initiatives by African  businesses and institutions.   Africa, and much of the developing world, has also benefitted from  the Millennium Challenge Corporation since passage of the Millennium  Challenge Act of 2003. MCC is a critical partner, for example, in our  Global Food Security strategy, which fosters agriculture-led economic  development.   Though MCC has played a key role, there are also room for  improvements. Sometimes during the country selection process,  narratives about a country become set, and there is not a fresh  appraisal of evidence regarding improvements, or backsliding, in the  conditions of that country.   I'd like to thank Chairman Royce for working to ensure that MCC  remains a vehicle focused on assisting countries with development, and  does not become diverted from its original mission.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 3445, the African  Growth and Opportunity Act and Millennium Challenge Act Modernization  Act.    Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege and honor,  as we approach the March for Life on Friday, to remember the infamous  Supreme Court decision that has resulted in the loss of some 60 million  unborn babies and tens of millions of women who have been harmed. Sixty  million have been killed, a number that equates with the entire  population of England, as a result of that very misguided and sad and  tragic decision.   It is my honor, as we open up this Special Order, to yield to  Congresswoman Jackie Walorski from Indiana, a distinguished Member of  this body who serves on the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  very strong and powerful statement.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to Robert Pittenger from North Carolina, who  is the author of the No Abortion Bonds Act, a bill that would close  loopholes in the Tax Code that allow abortion providers to finance new  clinics and facilities with local bonds that are exempt from Federal  taxes. Congressman Pittenger serves on the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, we do have several physicians  who serve in this Congress who are very, very pro-life and very  eloquent in their defense of life.   I yield to Congressman Andy Harris, who is associated, obviously,  with Johns Hopkins, the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Harris for his very  eloquent remarks and for reminding us that this is the greatest human  rights struggle on Earth.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Foxx), the chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Ms.  Foxx has been a lifelong leader on the issue of life and, of course, in  leadership, and now as a full committee chairman. I thank the  gentlewoman for all she does on behalf of the unborn and their mothers  each and every day.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Foxx again  for her very moving words, which are backed up by her actions each and  every day.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg),  who serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Education and  the Workforce Committee.    I yield to the distinguished gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Banks), who is a member of the Navy Reserve and who serves  on the House Armed Services Committee; the Veterans' Affairs Committee;  and the Space, Science, and Technology Committee. He is championing the  Patients First Act to prioritize ethical stem cell research that will  help patients and do no harm to the youngest members of the human  family.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly),  from the Third District, a member of the Committee on Ways and Means.    Mr. Speaker, I just remind everyone this is  a total team effort. One of the beauties of the pro-life movement--and  I have been in it for 45 years--is that it is filled with incredibly  compassionate, selfless people who would do anything to help the  weakest and the most vulnerable. So I thank the gentleman for his  leadership for all these years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.  Jenkins), who is the famous gentleman who serves on the Appropriations  Committee where so many of these battles are engaged.    I thank the gentleman for his eloquent  statements and remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman).  General Jack Bergman is a retired three-star general of the Marine  Corps, and he serves on the Veterans' Affairs, Budget, and Natural  Resources Committees.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Georgia (Jody B. Hice), who is co-chair of the Values Action Team. It  is worth noting that he is part of the team back home that has now been  ranked number 8 by Americans United for Life in what they call the  ``Life List'' because of the legislation and the policies that have  come forward in Georgia to protect life.   He was a pastor before coming to Congress and has been a leader for  religious liberty as well in the House.  [[Page H466]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), who is from Wisconsin's Sixth District. He is  a member of the House Budget Committee, the Education and the Workforce  Committee, and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who is the chairman of the Water Resources and  Environment Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  very eloquent remarks.  [[Page H467]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson), who  serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee. He has long pushed for  transparency and led a landmark effort on Federal payments to Federal  abortions providers. He recently led an amicus brief supporting his  State's right not to be forced to fund Planned Parenthood.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Olson for those  very strong comments. I feel the same way about his great leadership  for all these years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), a  member of the Judiciary Committee and the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes), who serves on the Education and the Workforce  Committee and the Homeland Security Committee. His home State of Kansas  was just ranked number five as the most pro-life State in the country  by AUL's 2018 Life List. I thank him for his leadership all these years  as well.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for his  comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Rothfus), a pro-life leader who has been a leader in educating members  of our Conference about the dangers of assisted suicide. He serves on  the Financial Services Committee. He has been, of course, a great  leader in defending the unborn and their moms.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Abraham), a member of Armed Services Committee; the  Agriculture Committee; and the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
