 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1559, as  provided for under the previous order.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading be dispensed with.    Madam President, I have been in the Senate during 9/11,  for Hurricane Katrina, for the 2008 financial crisis, and I still have  never experienced anything like what we are seeing today. These are  truly extraordinary circumstances, and the stories I am hearing from my  constituents and from people across the country are crushing. Some of  the most heartbreaking stories are the ones about people who want to do  the right thing in this moment but are having to choose between staying  home, as public health experts say we must, and paying the rent or  putting food on the table.   I am hearing from workers like Cristal Westwood from Auburn, WA. She  and her husband just welcomed their first child on February 7 of this  year. They both have autoimmune diseases, but her husband's job is not  allowing him to work from home. And she says:         This is an extremely stressful situation for our family. We       have the option for my husband to take leave without pay for       the next month or so, but that would mean we wouldn't have       any income coming in to support our family. He could use up       all of his sick and vacation time, but that would mean he       doesn't have any left for the rest of the year in case       something happens. Both of those options don't seem right.    I agree. That is not right. A pastor in Tukwila, WA, shared similar  concerns  [[Page S1793]]  from a parent in their congregation with school-aged children who  worries:         What if they call off school? I don't have anyone to care       for the kids. Then, without a paycheck, we will get evicted.       As it is, we already run close to eviction every month.    Since that time, all of our schools in Washington State are closed.   And then there is Chris, who lives in Seattle, works in a grocery  store, and is at high risk for coronavirus. She writes:         It's an awful decision: Go to work and put your life at       risk, or lose your job, lose your income, and lose your       insurance. I haven't committed either way at this point. I'm       trying to find a way to stay home.    I am not just hearing from workers but from small business owners, as  well, across our State, people who own restaurants and shops. Everyone  from farmers to fishers who are used to the spring being a time when  the phones are ringing off the hook. Now no one is coming in the door.  No one is calling. They want to do the right thing for their workers,  but they don't have the cashflow to keep them on.   People are scared. They feel they have gotten the rug pulled out from  under them, and they need our help. Unfortunately, here is what the  Senator from Wisconsin wants to do. After the House overwhelmingly  passed a bipartisan agreement that includes an important step forward  to provide workers the paid sick leave they need in this crisis, his  amendment would undo that bipartisan work by stripping any paid sick  leave progress out of the bill we are voting on today.   Instead of helping people keep their jobs and their paychecks by  providing sick leave, Senator Johnson's amendment would force workers  to seek compensation through their State unemployment system, meaning  they would be on their own until they were compensated by the State,  and the unemployment system in each State would be drastically  overburdened at a time when workers are going to need it in the event  they are laid off.   Democrats are pushing for solutions through the unemployment  insurance to support families and workers in the months ahead, but  simply using this program now as a replacement for paid sick leave  workers is unacceptable, and it is shameful. We have to do better than  that.   At a time when families are facing impossible decisions, my fellow  Senators face a glaringly simple one. We need to be doing as much as we  can as fast as we can, and his amendment would set us backward at the  worst possible time.   That is why I am here on the floor to offer our amendment, based on  legislation I have worked on with Senator Gillibrand and Representative  DeLauro, introduced yesterday. Our legislation would simply provide  workers with 7 days of accrued paid sick leave, 2 weeks of paid  emergency days, and 12 weeks of paid emergency leave, and it would make  sure that their employers can be quickly and fully reimbursed by the  Treasury Department for providing that leave.   For those who may not be ready just yet to agree we need paid sick  days and paid leave going forward permanently, the amended version of  this bill that we are introducing today and asking for a vote on  shortly would only provide this support through December 2021.   My No. 1 priority right now is getting people the support they need  right now for this emergency that is at hand, and this is a commonsense  step. It is good for workers who need to stay home if they are sick or  to take care of their family without losing a job or their paycheck,  and it is good for small businesses that want to keep their workers and  communities safe and that are struggling to stay afloat during this  crisis.   It is the right thing to do for our economy, for our public health,  and we should get it done as soon as possible. If we don't do this, if  we let this opportunity slip by, we are sending a message to scared  people across the country that we are still not willing to acknowledge  the scope of the tragedy we are seeing unfold and not listening to the  stories like the ones I just shared, stories that I know my colleagues  have heard as well.   We must not and we cannot send that message. People need help; they  need hope; and they need to see that we are willing to do the right  thing and pass big solutions. So I hope all of our colleagues join us  in supporting our amendment. I want to see this passed and sent to the  President's desk as part of this response, and by the way, I am not  going to stop fighting until that happens.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
