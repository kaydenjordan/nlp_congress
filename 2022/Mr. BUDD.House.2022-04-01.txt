 Madam Speaker, I was unable to attend votes in D.C. due to  an important constituent event. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 103, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 104, ``nay'' on  rollcall No. 105, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 106, and ``nay'' on rollcall  No. 107.                            ____________________
