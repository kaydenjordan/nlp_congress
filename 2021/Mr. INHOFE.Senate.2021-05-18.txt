 Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize MAJ Aimee A.  Mack, U.S. Army, on the conclusion of her current assignment. Since May  2020, Major Mack has served with great distinction as the legislative  liaison for the Countermeasures Acceleration Group, which was  previously known as Operation Warp Speed. Throughout the development,  production, and distribution of the various coronavirus vaccines, Major  Mack has been an outstanding source of information for my staff and me,  helping us understand a fast-moving and game-changing program that is  saving millions of American lives.   I think we all need to pause and marvel at the miracle that Operation  Warp Speed fostered. Today, based on the successful foundational work  of Operation Warp Speed, it is extremely easy for any eligible American  to receive a coronavirus vaccine. So it might be hard to remember just  how far-fetched that objective seemed when Operation Warp Speed was  launched during the height of the pandemic, approximately 1 year ago.  At the time, many in the mainstream media doubted that a coronavirus  vaccine could be produced so quickly. President Trump's plan to make a  coronavirus vaccine available by the end of 2020 was repeatedly ``fact  checked,'' and leading political and medical figures viewed the program  as either a low-odds gamble or a political stunt.   This was the very difficult information environment that Major Mack  confronted when she was appointed as Operation Warp Speed's legislative  liaison in May 2020, but she was uniquely suited for the assignment.  Like all of the best legislative liaisons, Major Mack had the  confidence of her commanding officer, GEN Gustave A. Perna, and was  meticulous in her provision of precise, detailed information to  Congress. She is also a Nurse Corps officer, and her medical knowledge  made her an exceptional asset to Members of Congress and their staffs,  particularly when it came to explaining the program's revolutionary  scientific and medical testing decisions, which were vital to finding,  testing, and receiving emergency approval for three vaccines in record  time. In this sense, Major Mack was not merely a source of information  but of education. Thanks to her efforts, when the first coronavirus  vaccines were administered in December 2020, there was broad,  bipartisan congressional confidence in the vaccines' safety and  efficacy because she taught our staffs and us what we needed to know.   In the months that followed, as attention shifted from the  development of the vaccines to their production and delivery, Major  Mack continued to provide regular and detailed updates for Members and  staff. Again, I think we need to admire Operation Warp Speed's  achievement here: For the first time in history, vaccines are  effectively going from conveyor belts to arms within days. Major Mack's  deep knowledge of the process and her outstanding work in sharing it  with us bolstered congressional confidence in the program. To put a  finer point on it, when our State health departments needed the latest  information on vaccine allotments and projections, we knew who to  call--MAJ Aimee Mack.   Major Mack will soon depart for Command and General Staff College at  Fort Leavenworth, KS, and she will be greatly missed. I want to thank  her for her exceptional service and thank her family as well--her  husband, MAJ Jamaal Mack, and her children, Daunte and Alisa. I wish  her every success in the future and sincerely hope we get to work with  her again soon.                            ____________________
