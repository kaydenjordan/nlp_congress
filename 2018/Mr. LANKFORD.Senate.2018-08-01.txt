 Mr. President, today, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator  Leahy. My colleagues have heard me stand at this same desk multiple  times and speak on the issues underlying the Secure Elections Act, a  piece of authorizing language that it is exceptionally important that  we actually get passed. This is a bill that Senator Klobuchar and I,  along with Senators Harris, Graham, Collins, Heinrich, Burr, and  Warner, have worked on very hard to get done. It is something that is  being discussed in the Intelligence Committee hearing that is going on  right now. Some of the witnesses spontaneously raised its reforms as  some of key steps that we need to take to secure our elections.   But what we are talking about today is not the authorizing language  that is needed; it is appropriations dollars. Just 4 months ago, this  body appropriated $380 million to give to the States to help them in  their elections. Ninety percent of those dollars have been transmitted,  but most of that money is not out the door.   We have $380 million that is in process, but it will be the end of  next year before we know how the States have actually spent it. I  believe it is far too early to add another one-quarter of a billion  dollars, which is what this amendment would provide, to the States when  we don't know how the first $380 million has even been spent.   The Intelligence Committee did extensive research on how much was  needed, and the $380 million amount was what was needed for the moment.  I ask us to keep the funding at $380 million and not add another one- quarter of a billion to that amount.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all votes  after the first in this series be 10 minutes.
