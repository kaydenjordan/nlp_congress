 Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank our chairman for  bringing this bill and his leadership on this issue.   I have the honor of representing Nevada's First Congressional  District in the heart of Las Vegas. Every week, as I travel to and from  Las Vegas through McCarran International Airport--just like more than  50 million travelers do each year--I see our TSA employees very hard at  work screening passengers, baggage, and cargo. They play a critical  role in allowing Las Vegas to be a truly international city with an  economy that thrives on tourism and visitors who come to work, hike,  and play.   More broadly, Transportation Security officers have the immense  responsibility of making sure passengers from all over the world, on  hundreds of flights a day, make it safely to their destinations,  wherever they may be. Yet, Federal law prohibits them from collectively  bargaining for better pay, better benefits, and better working  conditions. This shortcoming has led to a high level of turnover at TSA  which threatens our security.   It is time for that to change. That is why I strongly support this  long overdue piece of legislation that will improve TSA agents' pay and  boost their collective bargaining power, not to mention their morale.   So let's come together today to give them the rights that other  Federal employees have and that they so rightly deserve. Let's respect  them and give them this privilege so they can do what they do and keep  us all safe. It is the least we can do to recognize that sacrifice.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this bill, and I urge my colleagues  to vote in favor of it.
