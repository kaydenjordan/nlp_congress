 Mr. President, I wish to honor the lives of Lt.  Col. Frederick Hollister Campbell and Amy S. Campbell.   Lt. Col Frederick Hollister Campbell served in the U.S. Marine Corps  for more than 25 years, serving in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. He  earned  [[Page S6356]]  a Navy Commendation Medal for saving the lives of 250 fellow marines at  the Battle of Iwo Jima. After his military career, Fred opened his own  private law practice and taught college-level classes at Colorado  College and the University of Colorado.   During a time when women rarely attended college, Amy received her  B.A. in elementary education from National University and went on to  receive her M.A. in reading education from Northwestern University.  Prior to her marriage to Fred, Amy taught first and second grade. A  two-time military widow, Amy lost her first husband, Bob Noran, as a  result of injuries sustained during the Battle of the Bulge in WWII.   Amy and Fred were married on April 14, 1951. A proud supporter of her  husband's career, Amy put aside her teaching career to be a full-time  officer's wife and mother to their daughter.   Amy and Fred went on to live an incredible life together, traveling,  raising their daughter, Susan, and volunteering with many  organizations. Fred passed away on December 27, 2011, and Amy went on  to live near Susan in Missoula, MT, before passing away on November 29,  2016. I send my condolences to the friends and family of Fred and Amy,  as they are both greatly missed. They will be laid to rest together in  Arlington National Cemetery.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor  of recognizing a young Montanan named Braden Matzinger for his  compassionate heart and entrepreneurial spirit in helping our State  recover from a devastating wildfire season.   The 2017 wildfire season has impacted many communities in Montana.  The fires consumed nearly 1.3 million acres of land. Over the summer,  two firefighters lost their lives while protecting the people of the  Treasure State. The bravery and commitment demonstrated by all the  folks involved with the firefighting effort has generated a sense of  unity and support from Troy to Alzada. That sense of unity can be found  in the actions of 9-year-old Braden Matzinger of Bozeman. Braden has  raised donations for the Montana Wildfire Relief Fund at the last two  Montana State University home football games. He sweetened his approach  to charitable fundraising with a cup of free lemonade for all those  making a donation. At the two football games, he raised over $600 in  donations.   Sometimes life throws us lemons. How we respond is a reflection of  our character. The Montana values of charity, compassion, and  entrepreneurship are alive and well in the character of our next  generation of youngsters, and Braden is a prime example. Thank you,  Braden, for seeing an opportunity to help, making a plan, and following  through with your plan. To Braden's parents, Jeff and Katie, thank you  as well for raising such a high-quality young man.                            ____________________
