 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the scourge of the  diabetes disease in lower income communities all across our Nation.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 30  million Americans are living with the dreaded diabetes, and many cannot  properly manage this potentially deadly disease due to the high cost of  their medication.   Insulin is a critical and necessary treatment for those with  diabetes. Since 1996, the cost of the most frequently prescribed forms  of insulin has increased from just $25 to over $250 per bottle.   According to a 2018 Yale University survey, one in four patients were  forced to ration their insulin due to these skyrocketing costs, a  potentially deadly practice.                                time  1030    No one, Madam Speaker, should ever have to forgo or ration their  lifesaving medication, which is the very reason why I introduced H.R.  366, the Insulin Access for All Act.   This bill would prevent the most vulnerable citizens from having to  choose between taking their insulin or paying their household bills by  eliminating the out-of-pocket costs for Medicare and Medicaid patients.   I encourage all of my colleagues, Madam Speaker, to join me in  supporting this very necessary bill.   Additionally, Madam Speaker, the Committee on Energy and Commerce  Subcommittee on Health held a hearing yesterday to begin discussions on  H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act. I am a proud cosponsor of this  bill. I firmly believe that passing this piece of legislation would be  an important step in relieving the burden of rising pharmaceutical  costs experienced by all of our citizens. This legislation would direct  the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate fairer prices  for some of the 250 most costly drugs, including insulin.   Madam Speaker, no American should ever have to wonder if they can  afford the lifesaving insulin that they must depend on. Congress must  take bold action to lower insulin costs. Lives are depending on it.   Madam Speaker, healthcare is a human right, and access to insulin is  righteous and just and good.                            ____________________
