 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Clean Water For  Military Families Act.'' This legislation would provide $10 billion for  the Department of Defense to conduct investigations and remediate PFAS  contamination at and surrounding DOD installations in the U.S. and  state-owned National Guard facilities.   Dating back to the 1960s, the U.S. Navy began using a firefighting  foam called aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) that contains toxic PFAS  chemicals. The military used AFFF firefighting foam for emergencies,  fire training exercises, and equipment testing, resulting in large  discharges of PFAS contamination in groundwater and other environments.   For decades, DOD continued using AFFF firefighting foam despite  mounting evidence of detrimental health concerns, and even after  leading manufacturers voluntarily phased out production of PFOS and  PFOA, the two most widespread and studied PFAS compounds.   In recent years, Congress has passed legislation requiring DOD to  phase out the use of AFFF firefighting foams. While this is a vital  step toward ensuring DOD adopts PFAS-free alternatives going forward,  it does not address DOD's legacy pollution.   To clean up the legacy pollution at contaminated military sites  across the country, this legislation authorizes a one-time, $10 billion  investment for PFAS investigations and cleanup. We owe it to military  communities to ensure that they can drink clean water and live  pollution-free.   There are hundreds of contaminated military sites across the country  that jeopardize the health, safety, and well-being of military  communities who have suffered from exposure to PFAS pollution and toxic  drinking water.   In California alone, there are 62 military facilities with a known or  suspected PFAS release.   Since the discovery of PFAS at these installations, there has been  little to no progress on the bases with the highest PFAS detections. A  $10 billion investment would accelerate DOD's existing cleanup efforts  and cover all types of PFAS chemicals. Absent this legislation, it  could take decades for DOD to clean up toxic PFAS. We must act now to  move beyond studying the problem and toward a comprehensive cleanup  effort to protect service-members, veterans, and military communities.   I thank my co-lead, Senator Gillibrand for her tireless leadership  fighting PFAS contamination at DOD sites. I also thank the bill's  cosponsors for championing this effort with me in the Senate.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the ``Clean  Water for Military Families Act'' as quickly as possible.   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Clean Water For  Military Families Act.''
