 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Pennsylvania's  Fifth District class of 2021 and wish them well in their next  adventures.   As we watched the world change before our eyes over the past year- and-a-half, we also saw the strength and determination of young people  in our district, throughout the U.S., and across the globe.   We saw students pick up jobs to help support their families, take to  the streets to support causes they believed in deeply, and contribute  their time and savings to help others in need.   Whether they realized it or not, their energy and activism have  shifted the national conversation around issues like gun violence,  racial justice, and the climate crisis.   We are at an inflection point of history, science, and technology,  and I have never been more inspired or hopeful than I am for this  generation.   I also want to acknowledge our debt of gratitude to all the teachers  and school staff who showed such dedication and resilience as they  guided our students through the challenges of a pandemic with patience,  courage, and innovation.   Graduates, the world is waiting for our next wave of leaders, and we  know that you are ready for the challenge. Congratulations.                            ____________________
