 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to House Republicans' efforts to eliminate critical student  loan relief.   Now, as an educator, it is shameful to me that my colleagues could  look at this crisis of student debt in our country and decide to  intentionally make it worse for 40 million Americans.   These are the same people that voted for tax breaks for billionaires  and large corporations, and now they are telling everyday people that  we can't afford to help them, and it is appalling.   When I was in the classroom, I saw my students take out loans for  basic needs like rent and putting food on the table. We tell kids to go  get an education, to go to college, to work toward the American Dream,  but that also means taking out, oftentimes, thousands of dollars of  loans.   Student loan debt also disproportionately impacts people of color,  low-income students, and millions of young people that may not have had  access to financial training. Millionaires are not burdened with  student debt; working-class people are.   So let's be clear: Republicans in the House are putting billionaires  and large corporations over students.
