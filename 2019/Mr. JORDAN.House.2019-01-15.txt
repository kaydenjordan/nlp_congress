 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.   Madam Speaker, you know why we can't get a deal on the border  security wall? You know why we can't get a deal? Because today's left  has taken the most radical positions in American history.   They applaud Kaepernick when he disrespects the flag, they embrace  Governor Cuomo when he says America  [[Page H592]]  was never that great, and they cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go  out and harass anyone who supports the President.   Today's left thinks that America is just another country, just one of  the 190-some countries on the planet.   Madam Speaker, the United States of America is not just another  country. It is the greatest Nation in history that has done more good  for more people than any country ever; a special place, a special place  where people from all over the world, all shapes, all sizes, all  colors, all talents come to so they can chase down their goals, chase  down their dreams, make life better for themselves and their family.   That is this country: a special place, where people come and respect  the Constitution, cherish the Bill of Rights, and embrace the rule of  law.   But today's left, specifically on this issue, Democrat Congressman  Blumenauer said, abolish ICE; Secretary Clinton, when she was running  for the highest office in the land, said we need a borderless  hemisphere; Speaker Pelosi said walls are immoral. And just last week,  Stacey Abrams, Governor candidate from the State of Georgia, said  noncitizens should be able to vote. Think about that: noncitizens  should be able to vote.   Americans believe, Republicans believe, the House Freedom Caucus  believes that borders need to be strong. Americans believe, we believe  that there is a difference, a big difference, between legal immigration  and illegal immigration. And Americans and Republicans and the House  Freedom Caucus believe that a border security wall will help stop the  drug problem, the gang problem, and the human trafficking problem.                                time  1730    Mr. Speaker, this is not just a fight about a border security wall.  It is bigger than that. It is about those fundamental values, those  fundamental principles, that make us the greatest Nation in history.   The House Freedom Caucus and the House Republicans stand with our  President. We know there needs to be a border security wall. We know  this needs to happen to deal with all the things that have been talked  about.   That is why we are here. That is why this is important. That is why  this fight is so fundamental. And that is why it is important we stand  with the President of the United States and make sure it gets done.
