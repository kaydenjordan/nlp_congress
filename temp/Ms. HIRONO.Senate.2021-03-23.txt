 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will  help to improve adult vaccination rates throughout this country. I am  thankful to Senators Capito, Whitehouse, and Scott of South Carolina  for their partnership on this important legislation.   Before there were vaccines, nearly everyone got measles, and diseases  like whooping cough, polio, and rubella were commonplace among children  and adults. Luckily for us, vaccines are now a cornerstone of our  nation's disease prevention efforts. They have a demonstrated record  limiting the spread of debilitating and potentially deadly conditions-- from measles to flu to pneumonia--saving lives and reducing health care  costs. A successful vaccination campaign is also essential to fully  reopening society and preventing future COVID-19 outbreaks.   Unfortunately, adult vaccines rates are not nearly as high as they  could and should be. Prior to the pandemic, more than 50,000 adults per  year died from vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States, while  millions more became ill as a result, causing them to miss work and  leaving some unable to care for those who depend on them. The health  care costs associated with low adult vaccine rates are enormous--each  year, the U.S. spends $15 billion treating Medicare beneficiaries alone  for these vaccine-preventable diseases.   Because the immune system deteriorates as people age, adults 50 and  over are especially susceptible to many vaccine-preventable diseases  and account for a disproportionate number of deaths and illnesses from  these disease. As Americans age, the impact of these diseases and their  complications is likely to grow--unless we quickly and substantially  improve use of and access to adult vaccines, especially among Medicare  beneficiaries.   By increasing vaccine access, we can save thousands of lives and  potentially billions of dollars. Unfortunately, older adults seeking  access to and coverage for vaccines encounter many barriers. They may  not know where or how to get vaccinated and cost can be an obstacle for  both patients and providers.   That's why we've introduced the Protecting Seniors Through  Immunization Act of 2021. The bill improves vaccine information and  education for Medicare beneficiaries, including the risks and  consequences of vaccine-preventable disease, and ensures older adults  know what vaccines are right for them at the right time.   The bill also eliminates the cost burden of vaccines on our nation's  aging population. Vaccines are available for free under private  insurance, but under Medicare, vaccine coverage is split between  Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D. Seniors can access vaccines  covered under Part B--such as flu, pneumonia and Hepatitis--with no  cost-sharing. However, vaccines covered under Part D, such as shingles  (herpes zoster) and pertussis (Tdap), can include a wide range of cost- sharing requirements. For seniors, many of whom live on fixed incomes  such as Social Security benefits, these additional costs may preclude  them from being vaccinated.   A 2018 study of Tdap and herpes zoster vaccine claims under Medicare  Part D demonstrated that higher out-of-pocket cost-sharing is  associated with higher rates of cancelled vaccination claims--in other  words, when the costs of vaccines are too high, seniors can't or won't  get them. The study found that cost-sharing of $51 or greater is  associated with a 2 to 2.7-times greater rate of cancelled vaccination  claims compared with $0 cost-sharing.   There are more than 300,000 cases of shingles reported in the U.S.  each year. About 50 percent of people who experience shingles will have  postherpetic neuralgia, a debilitating, painful, and long-lasting  disease. This is just one example of the types of conditions that  vaccines can prevent.   We have a lot of room for improvement for uptake of these vaccines.  Passing the Protecting Seniors Through Immunization Act of 2021 will  help us to do so. By reducing cost barriers and improving access and  raising awareness, we can implement these vaccines better and set the  stage for healthy aging.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. Booker, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms.          Klobuchar, Mr. Reed, and Ms. Warren):   S. 913. A bill to conduct a study on the spread of COVID-19-related  disinformation and misinformation on the internet and social media  platforms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the COVID-19  Disinformation Research and Reporting Act. I thank Representative  Jennifer Wexton for working with me on this important piece of  legislation, which will help shine a light on the ways social media and  other online platforms amplify and spread misinformation and  disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic to the detriment of  public health. I also thank my colleagues--Senators Booker, Blumenthal,  Klobuchar, Warren, and Reed--for cosponsoring this bill.   As I stand here today nearly 30 million Americans have been diagnosed  with COVID-19 and over 540,000 have died from the virus.   The numbers alone are staggering. But when you hear and read the  personal stories of individuals and families who are suffering, it is  truly tragic. It makes you mournful that for many of the individuals  who died, they died alone in the absence of their loved ones.   While many things contributed to this massive loss of life, I am here  to talk about one in particular: the insidious spread of coronavirus- related misinformation and disinformation online. This ``infodemic''  has undercut the efforts of public health officials at every turn, and  threatens to prolong the virus's impact on the health of our people and  economy long after a safe and effective vaccine is available.   The online spread of misinformation about public health is nothing  new.  [[Page S1711]]  Claims that the 2014 Ebola epidemic was a form of population control  spread across social media. Anti-vaccination groups have long used  Facebook and YouTube to share junk science and recruit new members.   However, social media platforms' response to coronavirus was supposed  to be different. Early in the pandemic, the major social media  platforms announced new measures to combat misinformation while making  sure users had access to accurate, authoritative information about the  virus. Facebook added a COVID-19 Information Center to the tops of  users' News Feeds and announced it would remove misinformation that  could contribute to imminent physical harm. Twitter verified accounts  that provided credible updates on the pandemic and committed to  removing false or misleading content that contradicted information from  health authorities. YouTube began directing users who searched for  COVID-related information to the WHO or other health authorities and  banned false information contradicting health authorities on treatment,  prevention, diagnosis, or transmission of COVID-19.   Unfortunately, these measure proved lacking and insufficient. The  conspiracy film Plandemic was viewed more than 8 million times across  social media platforms, and the sequel was viewed over 100,000 times on  YouTube during its first week alone. An August 2020 study by advocacy  group Avaaz found that misinformation about vaccines and other health  topics had been viewed an estimated 3.8 billion times on Facebook in  the previous year--four times more than factual, authoritative content  from institutions like the WHO and CDC. The study found that only 16%  of previously fact-checked health misinformation on Facebook carried a  warning label.   Spend even a small amount of time on the internet or social media and  you will find rampant misinformation and conspiracy theories about  COVID-19. Some examples of these falsehoods include: Bill Gates created  the virus to use a vaccine as cover to implant microchips into  Americans. No, actually, Dr. Fauci created the coronavirus to seize  political power. You shouldn't wear a mask to protect against the  coronavirus, because wearing a mask actually weakens your immune  system. And do not worry if you catch the coronavirus--you can treat it  by drinking bleach.   These claims might seem ridiculous, but they have real word  consequences. A study published in the American Journal of Tropical  Medicine and Hygiene found that 5,800 people had been hospitalized and  at least 800 people died in the first three months of 2020 alone as a  direct result of coronavirus-related misinformation. As recently as  August, the Georgia Department of Health and the Texas Poison Control  Center had to warn people not to drink bleach to treat COVID. A recent  poll found that only 51 percent of people wear a facial covering in  public, despite its proven efficacy in preventing the spread of COVID.  And, perhaps must troubling, polls suggest that over 30% of the U.S.  population will not get a COVID vaccine.   If we hope to get past the coronavirus and avoid similar public  health crises in the future, we must understand where misinformation  originates, how it spreads, and strategies to stop it.   This is exactly what the COVID-19 Disinformation Research and  Reporting Act will do. It directs the National Science Foundation to  partner with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and  Medicine to conduct a study on the spread of COVID-19-related  disinformation and misinformation on the internet and social media  platforms. This study will provide critical information on the roles  disinformation and misinformation have played in the public response to  COVID-19, including public acceptance of and demand for COVID-19  vaccines; the sources of COVID-19-related disinformation and  misinformation and the ways it has influenced the public debate; the  role social media plays in the disseminating and promoting this  disinformation and misinformation; and potential strategies for  combatting misinformation and disinformation in the future.   This information will not stop the next pandemic from coming. And, it  will not force the next Administration to take it seriously and follow  the advice of doctors and scientists. But it can give us the knowledge  and tools necessary to avoid another infodemic and ensure the American  public receives accurate and authoritative information when it is most  needed.   I therefore encourage my colleagues to support the COVID-19  Disinformation Research and Reporting Act.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 933. A bill to designate the Battleship IOWA Museum, located in  Los Angeles, California, as the National Museum of the Surface Navy,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources.
