 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gordon Rather and  [[Page H6895]]  his hard work with the Historic Arkansas Museum in Little Rock.  Currently, Gordon serves as the secretary of the Historic Arkansas  Museum Commission. This year will mark Gordon's 50th year on the  museum's board.   For half of those years, I have been fortunate to work alongside  Gordon, an exceptional attorney and civic leader. He has devoted his  adult life to preserving Arkansas' rich heritage for our kids.   I am proud to have served at his side in this worthy mission. I have  seen firsthand the impact that he has made on our State and the legacy  that he is preserving.   Congratulations, Gordon, on 50 years educating Arkansans about our  rich history and preserving it for the next generation. I am thankful  for your service.                            ____________________
