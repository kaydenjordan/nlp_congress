 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition  to this reckless default on America act. I have got to say, I see why  the Republicans put this together in the dead of night. I wouldn't want  Americans to see this plan, either. It is the same GOP playbook: Give  more to the rich and elite, stick hardworking Americans with the bill,  and threaten economic disaster if we don't go along.   Why exactly is the GOP endangering American livelihoods?   They want to help a few rich friends dodge their taxes.   What is the cost to the American people?   Here are just a few: 2,400 Border Patrol agents off the job, 300,000  kids out of childcare, 400,000 families evicted from their homes, a  million seniors kicked off of Meals on Wheels, $2 billion taken away  from veterans' healthcare; that is 30 million doctors' appointments  stolen from veterans. It is disgraceful.   Mr. Speaker, there is one responsible path forward--a clean,  unconditional vote to avoid default, something the GOP did three times  under Donald Trump. As Trump put it himself, we cannot use the debt  ceiling to negotiate.   Stop the madness. Deliver a resounding ``no'' vote on this dangerous  piece of political theater.
