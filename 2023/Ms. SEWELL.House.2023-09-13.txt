 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 60th  anniversary of the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in  Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963, and to honor the lives and legacies of  four little girls killed in this heinous attack.   Mr. Speaker, 60 years after parishioners of the 16th Street Baptist  Church prepared for Sunday service, 19 sticks of dynamite placed by Ku  Klux Klan members exploded. As the interiors of the walls of the church  caved in, over 100 churchgoers rushed for safety.   Though most of the congregation escaped, under the debris lay the  bodies of Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and  Cynthia Morris Wesley, as well as Sarah Collins Rudolph, who was  injured but ultimately survived.   Tragically, the brutality did not stop after the bombing. When  African-American communities across the State of Alabama took to the  streets to demand justice, they were met with unspeakable violence at  the hands of law enforcement. Within a few hours, Johnny Robertson and  Virgil Ware, ages 16 and 13, were killed in a clash between protesters  and the police.   Despite the horrific nature of this attack, it took over 34 years  before the perpetrators faced justice.   In 2013, Mr. Speaker, I was honored that the very first bill I passed  in this body awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian  honor we can give, to the four little girls posthumously to ensure that  their lives were never forgotten.   While we will never recover the lives lost or the injuries suffered,  we know that their sacrifice was not in vain.   Indeed, the loss of the four little girls changed America forever,  bringing into clarity our Nation's storied history of racially  motivated violence, and galvanized the civil rights movement.   It was their memory that inspired generations of freedom fighters to  build for a world where the color of your skin does not determine the  value of your life.   It was their memory that burned in the minds of foot soldiers as they  fought to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act  of 1965.   It was their sacrifice that brought our Nation closer to realizing  its highest ideals of equality and justice for all.   Without the influence of the four little girls, I not only question  where America would be, but where I would be.   Mr. Speaker, 60 years after their passing, I get to walk the Halls of  Congress as Alabama's as first Black Congresswoman, and I do so because  of their sacrifice and because they cannot.   Their premature and senseless death serves as a constant reminder  that every battle and every gain in the fight for civil rights has come  at a high cost, paid for by the sacrifice of others.   Yet, despite their gains and our gains as a Nation, we know that our  work is far from over. Today, as extremists seek to rewrite our history  and roll back our progress, it has never been more crucial to ensure  that the legacy of the four little girls lives on in American history.   After all, those who don't learn from their history are doomed to  repeat it.                                time  1015    In the words of Coretta Scott King, struggle is a never-ending  process. Freedom is never really won. It is earned and won in every  generation.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the lives of the four  little girls and remembering them by name: Addie Mae Collins, Denise  McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Morris Wesley.                            ____________________
