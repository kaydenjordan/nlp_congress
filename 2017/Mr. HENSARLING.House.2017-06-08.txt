 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 10, the Financial  CHOICE Act of 2017.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 375 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 10.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Womack) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1237                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 10) to create hope and opportunity for investors, consumers, and  entrepreneurs by ending bailouts and Too Big to Fail, holding  Washington and Wall Street accountable, eliminating red tape to  increase access to capital and credit, and repealing the provisions of  the Dodd-Frank Act that make America less prosperous, less stable, and  less free, and for other purposes, with Mr. Womack in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 45 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, at this time I proudly yield 1 minute  to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the distinguished Speaker  of the House.    Mr. Chairman, at this time I proudly yield 1 minute  to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the distinguished Speaker  of the House.    Mr. Chairman, at this time I proudly yield 1 minute  to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the distinguished Speaker  of the House.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, it has been 7 years since the Dodd-Frank Act was  passed, a monumental triumph of ideology over compassion and common  sense. All of the promises of Dodd-Frank were broken. They promised us  it would lift the economy, Mr. Chairman, but, instead, we are still  stymied in the weakest, slowest recovery in the postwar era.   They promised us that it would end too big to fail, but, instead, it  cynically codified too-big-to-fail banks in the law and backed it up  with a taxpayer bailout fund.   It promised us, Mr. Chairman--they promised us that it would lead to  a more stable economy, but, instead, the big banks are bigger. The  small banks are fewer. We are losing a community bank or credit union a  day.   Our corporate bond market, a key component of financing of jobs,  historic levels of volatility and illiquidity.   They promised us, Mr. Chairman, that it would help the consumer, but,  instead, we see free checking cut in half at banks, bank fees are up.  The ranks of the unbanked have increased.   For many creditworthy borrowers, they are paying $500 more for an  auto loan. Have you tried getting a mortgage recently? They are harder  to come by and cost hundreds of dollars more to close.   Every promise of Dodd-Frank has been broken. And, Mr. Chairman, we  hear about it every day. I heard from Julieann, a banker in  Massachusetts, and she wrote, `` `We have experienced a spike in loan  declines to women,' for their investigation identified that women  attempting to buy the family home to settle their divorce and stabilize  their family were being declined at a high rate due to the Dodd-Frank  Qualified Mortgage rules. . . .''   Dodd-Frank is hurting recently divorced women. I heard from Allen in  New Hampshire who talked about his need for a new car, but he couldn't  find a loan from a bank, and he said:         But for my local dealer's efforts on my behalf, there is no       doubt I would not be driving my current car, and this was a       desperate situation, for I am the sole income earner for my       family. My wife is ill, and we have two young children in       school. After my old vehicle broke down, I needed to find       reliable, replacement transportation so that I could get to       work and continue to provide for my family. Please ensure       that financing car and truck dealerships are not stymied by       Dodd-Frank's CFPB.    I heard from Maxine in Salt Lake City, who talked about her company.  She said:         Last February, we were awarded a major catering contract       for all food services in the new performing arts center. The       new contract will require us to make a major investment in       equipment in small wares. We will be able to hire 50       additional staff. Unfortunately, red tape got in the way,       turned what should have been a golden opportunity into an       unbelievable headache. Three banks informed us that our       rating, according to new bank regulations imposed by Dodd-      Frank, disqualified us from consideration.    Mr. Chairman, we have letter after letter, email after email, showing  how Dodd-Frank is harming working families, harming small businesses,  crushing community banks.   Fortunately, Mr. Chairman, there is a better, smarter way, and it is  called the Financial CHOICE Act. It is going to create hope and  opportunity for investors and consumers, and entrepreneurs, and it  stands for economic growth for all, but bank bailouts for none.   Contrary to Dodd-Frank, and what every Democrat will come here  today--my friends on the other side of the aisle--and defend, we will  end bank bailouts once and for all. We will replace bailout with  bankruptcy. We will replace economic stagnation with a growing healthy  economy. We will ensure that there will finally be pay increases, wage  increases for working Americans who haven't seen a pay increase since  Dodd-Frank became law.   We will replace Washington micromanagement with market discipline. We  will ensure that we replace taxpayer money with private money because  for every bank who will have a 10 percent simple leverage ratio, which  is analogous to having a private insurance policy against bailout, we  will let them have that Dodd-Frank off-ramp, and that is so important.   But, Mr. Chairman, we are also going to hold Wall Street accountable  with the toughest penalties that they have seen, and no more bailouts.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons they oppose the Financial CHOICE Act  and support the status quo of Dodd-Frank.   We will make sure that there is needed regulatory relief for our  small banks and credit unions, because it is our small banks who loan  to our small businesses, that create the job engine of America, and  make sure that the American Dream is not a pipe dream; but, instead, it  is a dream and a vision where we will only be limited by our  imagination.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, the Speaker and Mr.  Hensarling would have you think this is all about community banks being  hurt, but let me tell you what this is all about.   U.S. and foreign banks have paid more than $160 billion in penalties  to resolve cases brought against them by the Justice Department and  Federal regulatory agencies for cases involving collusion, fraud  against consumers, bribery, and other abuses.  [[Page H4718]]    There were 144 major cases of $100 million or more against 26 large  U.S. and foreign banks. Just look at this: Bank of America, $56  billion; J.P.Morgan, $28 billion; Citigroup, $15 billion; Wells Fargo-- and you know about Wells Fargo and what they did--$11 billion; Goldman  Sachs, $9 billion; Morgan Stanley, $5 billion. This is about rip-offs,  so this bill will prevent us from being able to assess these kinds of  penalties on those who are ripping off the American public.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Clay), ranking member of the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), chairman of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), chairman of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), a real leader on our committee and chairman  of the Financial Institution and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the chairman of our Small Business Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), who is a leader on our Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investments Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), who is a fighter on our committee. She is  the chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who is the chairman of the Monetary Policy and  Trade Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), a gentleman on leave from the Financial  Services Committee and one we proudly call our own.   Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I first want to thank Chairman Hensarling and the entire  Financial Services Committee for the work they have done on this bill.  They have listened to Members and they have listened to constituents  throughout this country. They studied the issue and they found the very  best policy.   We all know we need economic growth, but we also know that growth  means little if wages will not rise, if jobs do not return, and if more  businesses close than open.   If a rising tide lifts all boats, we need to make sure every American  is in the boat. Repealing Dodd-Frank with the Financial CHOICE Act  lifts people back in so they can participate in America's economy. It  will reestablish the severed ties that link communities to the money  they need to start businesses and hire employees.  [[Page H4721]]    Bringing back the community banks that Dodd-Frank destroyed means  that more people, not just the wealthy, will have access to credit. But  if we want everyone to be part of the American economy, we don't want  people to face the same risks they did before. We want people to be  treated fairly.   In 2008, people lost everything. Aided by misguided Washington  policies, some played fast and loose and put almost everyone else at  risk. So it is only natural that people looked around and asked: Why do  we have a system where, when things go wrong, banks need to get  bailouts, but the American people get nothing?   It is not a fair system. Dodd-Frank made it worse. It actually  codified bailouts into law and made a taxpayer slush fund. On top of  all that, we all know the regulations it created were just ridiculous.   Why is it that the rich and powerful get to game the complicated  rules produced by their friends in the bureaucracy while everyone else  faces a mountain of paperwork and regulations that no human being has a  chance of understanding?   We all know that is not fair. All this ends up boxing out small- business owners and normal Americans who can't hire lawyers to sift  through it all.   The Financial CHOICE Act levels the playing field. It makes both Wall  Street and Washington accountable so that their bad decisions don't  cost the taxpayers money. It makes things simple so that you don't need  an Ivy League law degree to understand the rules that govern our lives.   America is a nation for the people. Everyone has a shot. Everyone  should be treated the same. Everyone has a chance to succeed. The  Financial CHOICE Act brings us a little closer to that America one more  time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott), one of our senior members of  the Financial Services Committee.   Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I love this country. The  heart and soul of our country is our financial system.   This bill is a dangerous bill to our economy. Let me tell you why.  First of all, it takes away all of our consumer protections. I want to  give you an example.   Before we had Dodd-Frank, a bank that is insured by the taxpayers  could go in and use their customer's money. They could take their  customer's money out to invest in risky bets, and then when the bets go  south, it is the taxpayers that have to pick up the freight.   Secondly, let us use this example. Because of the impact and the  complexities of our financial system, so much of the cause and effect  of the downturn were the big banks. What Dodd-Frank did was provide a  test to be able to go in and simulate and confer with the bank to  prevent it from going overboard.   Wake up, America. I have talked with our Senators and they have  assured me that this bill is dead on arrival in the Senate.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), who is the chairman of the Terrorism and  Illicit Finance Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the chairman of the Housing and Insurance  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the chairman of the Housing and Insurance  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say  that perhaps the gentlewoman from California is unaware that the VFW  has tweeted that it lauds Representative Hensarling for a commitment to  protect veterans, and then:         We are so happy that the Financial CHOICE Act has been       endorsed by over 100 groups, including the Concerned Veterans       for America, because of what we do to protect their freedoms.    At this point, I am very happy to yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Ross), a proud member of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, apparently the gentleman forgot that  the big Wall Street banks also oppose this, according to the Wall  Street Journal, Washington Post, and New York Times.   And I am now very happy to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).    Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer), a member of our committee and chairman of the  Republican Policy Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Williams), my friend and neighbor.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a real workhorse of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Utah (Mrs. Love), an incredibly talented member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Utah (Mrs. Love), an incredibly talented member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the Financial Services Committee whip.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), another hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Trott), a new and very knowledgeable member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), a new member of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), a new member of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is  remaining on either side?   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Simpson). The gentleman from Texas has 8  minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 12 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, to better balance the time, I reserve  the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, at this time I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), a new member of our  committee.    Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney), another new member of our  committee.   Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act. This critical piece of  legislation rolls back onerous Obama-era regulations on the financial  services industry  [[Page H4729]]  that are strangling small businesses and hurting hardworking American  taxpayers.   As I held roundtables across West Virginia, I heard from small- business owners and job creators that Obama-era regulations make it  harder for community banks to make loans to small businesses and first- time home buyers.   The Financial CHOICE Act will remove stifling Federal regulations  from out-of-touch Washington bureaucrats and return financial  decisionmaking to you, the individual consumers and to the small  community banks.   I know that President Trump is committed to supporting the reforms in  the Financial CHOICE Act, and I look forward to continuing to work with  our President to grow our economy and bring much-needed relief to West  Virginia consumers and small-business owners.   I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and my colleagues on the  Financial Services Committee for their leadership on this important  legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I am now very happy to yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd), a huge fighter for  freedom and a fighter against Federal price controls.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I would like to thank both gentlemen for  their steadfast leadership on this issue. Basic economics tell us that  when government fixes market prices, consumer welfare suffers. So it is  not a surprise that researchers have found that the Durbin amendment  resulted in a net loss of perhaps $25 billion for consumers.   But in a larger sense, what we have is a legal dispute between two  parties. This is an issue that belongs in the courts, not Congress,  which is why we sought to repeal the Durbin amendment.   I remain hopeful that Congress will correct this mistake, and I will  work towards that goal in the future.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), a new member of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Tenney), another new member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We have now had 7 years of history with Dodd-Frank, and what do we  know? We know that the big banks are bigger. We know that the small  banks are fewer. The gentleman cites some statistics about lending, but  what he left out is, we are losing a community bank or credit union a  day, and they are not dying of natural causes. They are dying of the  dreaded Dodd-Frank disease.   Our small businesses continue to suffer. It takes small banks to lend  to small businesses. The job engine of America and small bank business  lending isn't recovering, and it can't recover, as long as Dodd-Frank  is on the rolls of the Federal Register.   I got to tell you, Mr. Chairman, it is time. It is time for a better  way. It is time to help our struggling families. That is really what  this is all about. We have had 7 years of Dodd-Frank, and yet working  Americans haven't received a pay increase. Their small businesses can't  get loans. Struggling families have not seen their savings recover from  the great financial panic which, oh, by the way, was brought about by  government in the first place, with dumb regulation to put people into  homes they couldn't afford to keep.   And let's also remember that Dodd-Frank is actually hurting the  consumers it claims to help. Free checking was cut in half. Credit  cards, there are fewer of them. They cost 200 to 300 basis points more.  Have you tried to get a mortgage lately? They are harder to come by.  They cost hundreds of more dollars to close.   Instead, what we have is, Washington elites now making the decision  on whether or not we get to put a credit card in our wallet, whether we  get to put a mortgage on our home.   No, Mr. Chairman, there is a better way. It is why we must enact the  Financial CHOICE Act. There will be economic growth for all, bank  bailouts for none, and we will, once again, have an America that is  only limited by the size of its dreams.  [[Page H4731]]    Mr. Chair, I encourage all to support the Financial CHOICE Act.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.

Amend section 361 to read as follows:       SEC. 361. BRINGING THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION                     INTO THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS.

Pursuant to House Resolution 375, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that is purely technical in nature  that addresses a few discrete issues in the amendment in the nature of  a substitute.   Specifically, it clarifies the noninsurance-related functions of the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union  Administration subject to congressional appropriations.   This amendment will not--not--affect the ability of the NCUA to  determine the appropriate allocation of expenses between their  insurance and other functions for purpose of their overall funding, but  it will, for the first time, give Congress the power of the purse--our  constitutional power of the purse--over many of the FDIC and NCUA's  operating expenses.   Additionally, the amendment revises the vesting of the appointment  power for certain positions and clarifies congressional access to  nonpublic meetings of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  [[Page H4790]]    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and to  support the underlying bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I know that my friend and colleague from the other side  of the aisle spoke about rhetoric. Unfortunately, that is pretty well  all we have heard from my friends on the other side of the aisle.   I am absolutely fascinated, Mr. Chairman, how often Members on the  other side of the aisle say: I care so much about community banks; I  care so much about small business.   But, Mr. Chairman, do you know how many amendments that they filed on  H.R. 10?   Let me count them. Zero. Zero amendments.   Where is their bill to help small banks? Where is their bill to help  credit unions?   They don't have one, and they didn't offer any amendments, so that is  all we hear.   We hear the rhetoric about Wall Street, Mr. Chairman, but it is  fascinating to me--don't take my word for it, but according to The  Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal, three  of the largest publications in our country, they all say the same  thing: Large, Wall Street banks support Dodd-Frank, and they oppose the  Financial CHOICE Act.   Now, why do they do that?   Maybe it is because my friends on the other side of the aisle are  only all too happy to preserve Wall Street bailouts. They wrote it into  the law. They codified it into the law; and then they took  [[Page H4791]]  the rest of us and created this thing called the orderly liquidation  authority, which is nothing more than a taxpayer-funded bailout system.  Trillions of dollars can be taken from taxpayers to bail out large  banks. And they defend it. No wonder the large banks, seemingly, are  satisfied with the Dodd-Frank Act.   But who supports the Financial CHOICE Act?   The credit unions support it and the community banks support it  because they are suffering and dying under the weight of the load of  the Dodd-Frank Act.   Again, if we want to get this economy moving again, if we want to  ensure that our hardworking constituents finally get the pay increase  they deserve, that they finally get the future that they deserve, we  must reject Dodd-Frank, and we must support not only this amendment,  but the underlying Financial CHOICE Act.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  for yielding me the time, and I thank him for his leadership.   Indeed, the whole issue of data security is so vital to our  constituents, so many of them have been victimized by identity theft.  So I appreciate his leadership on this issue, and I know that Chairman  Luetkemeyer in our committee will be leading on this issue. I support  this underlying amendment.   I do have some outstanding questions on what type of multifactor  authentication would be required. I want to ensure that we do not  specify the technology, that this is a sense of Congress provision. But  I look forward to working very closely with Congressman Smucker to  refine the concept as it goes forward, and I thank him for his  leadership.    May I inquire how much time is remaining, Mr.  Chairman?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 1 minute remaining.  The gentleman from Minnesota has 1\1/2\ minutes remaining, and the  gentleman from Minnesota has the right to close.    Mr. Chairman, the last time this body listened to the  minority leader and enacted Dodd-Frank, permanent Wall Street bailouts  were enshrined into law. That is what the gentlewoman represents, but  somehow we did not hear that in her speech. The last time we listened  to the gentlewoman from California, what we see is that working  Americans have not received a pay increase. Their paychecks are  stagnant and their savings remain decimated the last time we listened  to the gentlewoman from California, the minority leader. Since we  listened to her, we have seen that free checking has been cut in half,  bank fees have gone up, mortgages are more difficult to come by and  they are more expensive to close. That is the last time we listened to  the gentlewoman from California, the minority leader.   Her counsel must be rejected, as should the Washington elitism that  is represented by her philosophy must be rejected as well. It is why  Dodd-Frank must be rejected and why the Financial CHOICE Act must be  enacted.   Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment from the gentleman from New  York.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.
