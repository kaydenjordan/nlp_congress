 Madam President, it is an honor to join my colleagues of  both parties on the floor today to read one of the greatest pieces of  writing of the 20th century, Dr. King's letter from the Birmingham  jail.   I thank Senators Warnock, Tillis, Casey, Capito, Boozman, and Rosen  for joining me.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after I speak briefly,  you will recognize, in this order, Senators Warnock, Tillis, Casey,  then me, then Capito, then Boozman, then Rosen.    Mr. President, our former colleague, Doug Jones from  Alabama, began this bipartisan tradition. It happened in his State, and  it is an honor to carry it.   Today, we recommit to Dr. King's mission--equal rights for all--to  ensuring that every voice is heard and to the dignity of work.   On Friday, we marked Workers Memorial Day, when we honor workers  killed on the job over the past year and throughout our history. People  don't talk enough about what Dr. King was doing when he was  assassinated. He was killed in Memphis while fighting for sanitation  workers, AFSCME Local 1633, some of the most exploited workers in our  country.   He traveled there following the death of two sanitation workers on  the job. Not only was it a segregated neighborhood in Memphis, but, of  course, even the garbage truck was segregated. Two White workers worked  in the cab, and two Black workers worked in the back of the truck. They  were killed when the truck malfunctioned and crushed them.   Dr. King understood the deep connection between workers' rights and  civil rights. Speaking to those workers, he said:         [W]henever you are engaged in work that serves humanity and       is for the building of  [[Page S1492]]       humanity, it has dignity and it has worth. . . . All labor       has dignity.    Until we have equal rights for all and dignity for all workers, our  work here remains unfinished. We have a long road left to travel. It is  up to us to push our country further along the road. That is the  message to me in Dr. King's words in the letter we read today.   Just a quick preface of what this letter was about and then we will  turn to Reverend Warnock. In April 1963, Dr. King was held in a  Birmingham, AL, jail for the supposed crime of leading a series of  peaceful protests and boycotts. The goal was to pressure the business  community to end discrimination in their hiring for local jobs.   Some White ministers from Alabama had taken issue with the boycotts.  They told him: Dr. King, slow down. We are supporting you. We are for  voting rights, too, but slow down. Don't move too fast. Don't demand  too much all at once.   Dr. King rejected that premise.   It is up to all of us--as citizens, as leaders, as members of our  churches in our communities--to get to work to demand justice and  equality now, not at some hazy, far-off point in the future that never  seems to get here.   Dr. King made that point more eloquently and persuasively than any of  us ever could. So I will turn to my colleague, the Reverend Senator  Warnock.    Mr. President, I will continue.         I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and       Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few       years I have been gravely disappointed with the white       moderate.        I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the       Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is       not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but       the white moderate, who is more devoted to ``order'' than to       justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of       tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice;       who constantly says: ``I agree with you in the goal you seek,       but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action''; who       paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for       another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of       time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a       ``more convenient season.'' Shallow understanding from people       of good will is more frustrating than absolute       misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance       is much more bewildering than outright rejection.        I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that       law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice       and that when they fail in this purpose they become the       dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social       progress.        I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that       the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the       transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the       Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive       and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity       and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in       nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension.       We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is       already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can       be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be       cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with       all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and  [[Page S1494]]       light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its       exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the       air of national opinion before it can be cured.        In your statement you assert that our actions, even though       peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate       violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like       condemning a robbed man because his possession of money       precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like       condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to       truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by       the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock?       Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God       consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God's will       precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see       that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is       wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his       basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate       violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the       robber. I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject       the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for       freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother       in Texas. He writes: ``All Christians know that the colored       people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is       possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has       taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish       what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to       earth.'' Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception       of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is       something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure       all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used       either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel       that the people of ill will have used time much more       effectively than have the people of good will. We will have       to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words       and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence       of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels       of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of       men willing to be coworkers with God, and without this hard       work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social       stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge       that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to       make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending       national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is       the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of       racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.        You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At       first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would       see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I began       thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two       opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of       complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of       long years of oppression, are so drained of self respect and       a sense of ``somebodiness'' that they have adjusted to       segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who,       because of a degree of academic and economic security and       because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become       insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is       one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close       to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black       nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation,       the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad's Muslim       movement. Nourished by the Negro's frustration over the       continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement       is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have       absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded       that the white man is an incorrigible ``devil.''        I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that       we need emulate neither the ``do nothingism'' of the       complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black       nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and       nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the       influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became       an integral part of our struggle. If this philosophy had not       emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am       convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced       that if our white brothers dismiss as ``rabble rousers'' and       ``outside agitators'' those of us who employ nonviolent       direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent       efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and       despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist       ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a       frightening racial nightmare.     Thank you, Senator Rosen.   Thank you to my colleagues who joined us today to read these powerful  words: Senators Warnock, Tillis, Casey, Capito, Boozman, and Rosen.   This is a diverse group on the floor today whose States reflect the  vibrant  [[Page S1496]]  and wonderful diversity of our great Nation, from the Deep South to the  Mountain West, to the Industrial Midwest. We represent different  places. We may disagree on many things, but we love this country. We  know we can do better for the people who make it work.   Dr. King and the civil rights leaders of his generation did more than  just about anyone to push this country to live up to our founding  ideals and to make the dream of America real for everyone. Protesting,  working for change, organizing, demanding our country do better--those  are some of the most patriotic things all of us can do. That is Dr.  King's charge in this letter.   My favorite single line certainly in this letter and maybe in all of  Dr. King's preachings and teachings and writings: ``Progress never  rolls in on [the] wheels of inevitability.''   ``Progress never rolls in on [the] wheels of inevitability.'' It  rolls in because we make it so. That is our charge.   Think about that campaign Dr. King was waging when he was martyred in  Memphis. Think about who he was talking to--a union, Sanitation Workers  Local 1613, AFSCME. Think of the circumstances. This was a very  segregated Memphis. He was in a segregated, White neighborhood. Even  the sanitation trucks where these workers were working were segregated.  The cab of the truck was two White workers; the back of the truck was  doing the actual lifting and picking up garbage--two Black workers.   In February, before Dr. King first visited, the garbage truck--there  was a torrential downpour in this White, segregated neighborhood. There  was nowhere for these Black sanitation workers to go. They crawled in  the back of the truck. It malfunctioned and crushed these two workers.  That is why Dr. King was in Memphis the first time and the second time.   As he wove together worker rights and civil rights and labor rights,  he told these workers:         What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an       integrated lunch counter if he doesn't earn enough money to       buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee?    Those workers were vital to their community. They worked hard to  provide for their families. They were denied fair pay, denied political  rights, denied basic safety on the job.   Now, the Presiding Officer today is Senator Cortez Masto from Nevada,  who has joined in so many efforts on the Senate floor to fight for  workers, to fight for the dignity of work, to fight for safety and  civil rights and worker rights. It is not a coincidence that the  workers who are so often the most exploited are low-income workers,  especially Black workers.    Until all workers have the dignity they have earned, Dr. King's work  will remain unfinished. It means paying all workers a living wage. It  means giving them power over their schedules. It means providing good  benefits and safety on the job. It means letting them, if they so  choose, organize a union. It is about the dignity of work. All workers  get a fair share of the wealth they create. When we empower workers, we  bring us closer to the society Dr. King envisioned where all labor has  dignity.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  S. Res. 152 and S. Res. 185 and that the Senate now proceed to the en  bloc consideration of the following Senate resolutions: S. Res. 152, S.  Res. 185, S. Res. 192, S. Res. 193, and S. Res. 194.   There being no objection, the committee was discharged of the  relevant resolutions, and the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    I know of no further debate on the resolutions en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  preambles be agreed to and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Madam President, I will speak briefly. I know we are  expecting a vote at 5:30. I will not speak nearly that long, but I know  we are about to vote on the Congressional Review Act on an issue that I  happen to disagree with the President on.   My whole career has been standing up for workers. My whole career has  been standing up for, sometimes, the Presidents--the Presidents of both  parties.   I think, if you look at the history of trade in this country and what  we have done, we have seen, frankly, that this body, that down the hall  in the House of Representatives, and that the White House have  historically not stood up for workers.   I grew up in Mansfield, OH, in a small, industrial city of about  50,000 people. It was a very industrial city, less so now. I went to  Johnny Appleseed Junior High School, and I remember walking the halls  with the sons and daughters of machinists who worked at Tappan Stove  and rubberworkers who worked for Mansfield Tire and steelworkers at  Empire in Detroit. ``Empire-Reeves,'' I believe, was the company's name  then. I remember the autoworkers who worked at General Motors, a number  of electrical workers at Westinghouse, and also the sons and daughters  of people in the trades, who were electricians and carpenters,  insulators and pipefitters, plumbers and operating engineers and  laborers--people highly skilled who built America.   Companies and corporations--particularly in my part of the country  but also in Nevada and everywhere--began to shut down plants in the  industrial Midwest. They moved those plants to low-wage areas--Alabama,  Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, North and South Carolina especially.  Because those wages weren't quite low enough to satisfy the greed--I  think there is no other word other than the ``greed'' of corporate  America--then those same companies began to lobby Congress.   One of my first votes as a Member of Congress many years ago was in  opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Those of us who  opposed NAFTA predicted with almost certainty what was almost certainly  and inevitably going to happen. Once you pass a trade agreement giving  these companies the opportunity to go to Mexico and then to China with  no tariffs and to go for very low wages to exploit workers in those  countries, which is what they did, you begin to see plants shut down.   We know what happened. We know that far too many of our colleagues in  the House and Senate were willing to pass these free-trade agreements,  like NAFTA. We also know that, down the hall, the House of  Representatives did the same thing; the Senate did it; and, frankly, we  had Presidents of both parties who sold out American workers. The  lobbyists were here, pushing for NAFTA and pushing later for the PNTR  with China, weakening the rules there so that these companies were up  and gone. They left. They left Ohio. They left Indiana. They left  Illinois. They left so much of the industrial Midwest because this  Congress and the Presidents of both parties, from Trump all the way  back to Clinton--I would include Obama and both Bushes and  [[Page S1497]]  Clinton and Trump--were willing to sell out American workers to the  lobbyists who pushed for these trade agreements as they could seek  cheaper wages in China.   There is another thing that happened with China. What we did when we  moved all of these jobs to China was we built up the Chinese military  because we provided the technology and the wealth to the Chinese  Communist Party that then was able to build up a high-tech military-- not quite rivaling ours, but it was certainly dangerous enough that we  paid attention.   My vote against NAFTA was one of my proudest votes and my vote  against the PNTR with China, the most favored nation status with China.  So we are seeing what that has yielded.   In the end, it is a simple choice: Whose side are you on? Are you on  the side of the Chinese Communist Party or are you on the side of  American workers? That, to me, is what this vote is about today with  the Congressional Review Act about solar tariffs.    I would add full disclosure. One of the biggest solar manufacturers-- I believe still the biggest single solar manufacturing plant in  America--is near Toledo, just south of Toledo, in Northwest Ohio. Those  workers will benefit if we vote yes and then override the President's  veto.   It is what I urge my colleagues to do today--to pass this simple  resolution to continue these tariffs on China--because as long as they  keep cheating, as long as American companies are willing to take the  products from slave labor and underpaid labor and exploited labor and  bring them into this country, these problems will continue for our  industrial base.   I heard the President of the United States down the hall, I believe,  in his last State of the Union, saying the term ``Rust Belt'' and that  we are burying the term ``Rust Belt.'' I have talked to the President  about burying that term. He mentioned it that day, in the State of the  Union that evening.   Mostly, we are starting to see in this country a reindustrialization  of America. We are seeing chips now. Chips were invented in the United  States, but 90 percent of them are made mostly in Taiwan and China. The  light bulb was invented by an Ohioan, Thomas Edison. He grew up not far  from where I grew up. Now 100 percent of LEDs are made overseas. So if  we are going to reindustrialize this country and bring these jobs back,  that is what the CHIPS legislation is all about, and that is what we  are doing with Intel in Columbus.   This sets us back. The President's veto of this bill sets us back a  couple more years in redeveloping and bringing these jobs back and  doing the kind of in-sourcing that Senator Casey and others have fought  for here.   As I wrap up, I am asking my colleagues to vote yes on this  Congressional Review Act on solar tariffs because, again, whose side  are you on? Are you on the side of the Chinese Communist Party or are  you on the side of American workers? To me, it is as clear as day which  side to be on.
