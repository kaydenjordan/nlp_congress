 Mr. President, today, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting another dedicated and talented public servant and a great  Ohioan--my Congresswoman for the last 12 years--Marsha Fudge, to be our  next Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.   Congresswoman Fudge is a proud daughter of Ohio. She was born in  Cleveland, grew up in Ohio, and graduated from the Ohio State  University and Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. Congresswoman Fudge  has a long and distinguished career serving our State in the Cleveland  and Cuyahoga County courts and Cuyahoga County prosecutors' office, as  chief of staff to the trailblazing Stephanie Tubbs Jones, and as mayor  of Warrensville Heights, OH.   At HUD, Congresswoman Fudge will work to help protect our kids from  lead poisoning, to restore the promise of fair housing, and to give  communities the help and the resources that they need. It is a tall  order. It is one she is poised to meet.   She brings to the job the unique and critical experience of serving  as mayor for the kind of community that is either overlooked or  outright preyed upon by Wall Street and by big investors. She  understands we can't write off entire swaths of the country--whether it  is a coal town in southeast Ohio or a historic industrial city like the  one I grew up in, in Mansfield, or whether it is farm country around  Lexington, OH, or whether it is an urban neighborhood on the East Side  of Cleveland.   This champion of Cleveland understands that. She saw up close how  lenders preyed on families and the foreclosure crisis that followed. My  colleagues have heard me talk about ZIP code 44105, where Connie and I  live, which had more foreclosures in the first half of 2007 than any  ZIP code in the United States   At the time, Congresswoman Fudge was serving as mayor of a city fewer  than 20 miles away. Today, she represents this ZIP code in the United  States Congress. Those families are more than just a statistic to her.  They are her constituents. They are her neighbors. They are her  friends. She knows their story. She knows how, for decades, communities  have watched as factories closed, investment dried up, and storefronts  were boarded over. She knows how many neighborhoods and towns have  never had the investment they should--from Black codes to Jim Crow, to  red lining, to the discrimination that President Trump's regulators  locked into place. She understands how decades of policy funneled  resources and jobs away from Black and Brown communities.   A few years ago, I was talking with local health department officials  in Cleveland. I asked them what percentage of the older homes that make  up the bulk of Cleveland housing have dangerous levels of lead, those  homes built right after World War II or before that. They said 99  percent of those homes have high levels of lead--dangerously high  levels of lead.   The families in those homes are Congresswoman Fudge's constituents.  She knows what lead poison does to kids. She knows the local efforts  that Ohioans are leading in Cleveland to take this on. She lifts up  their voices, which have been drowned out or silenced for too long. She  will be a champion for families all over the country who want to be  able to afford a home without crippling stress every single month and  to be able to build wealth through home ownership to pass on to their  children and grandchildren.   Congresswoman Fudge has dedicated her career to fighting for Ohioans.  I am excited she is now going to use all that talent and all that  passion and all that empathy to fight for her whole country. I ask my  colleagues to support her confirmation to be Secretary of Housing and  Urban Development.                       American Rescue Plan Act of 2021    Mr. President, this weekend, on Saturday, we passed the American  Rescue Plan that will put shots in people's arms, kids back in school,  money in people's pockets, and workers in jobs. Tens of millions  Americans, including more than 5 million Ohioans, are going to see  money in their pockets from stimulus checks and the dramatic expansion  of the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit.   This comes back to, as it always does in politics--the Presiding  Officer knows--as it does in government, and it comes down to ``whose  side are you on?'' as this illustrates pretty well. The American Rescue  Plan. We all remember--most of us remember--4 years ago, the Trump tax  cut for the rich, and the blue here is the American Rescue Plan, which  we just passed on Saturday, which the House will probably pass  tomorrow, and President Biden will probably sign it this weekend. The  lowest numbers--the lowest 20 percent--saw their income go up by 20  percent under our plan. It is barely perceptible how much it went up  under the Trump tax plan. But if you go to the top of 1 percent, you  can see how much their income went up, and this is to the tune of  millions and millions of dollars, and the lowest earners essentially  got nothing from the Trump tax plan.   So you can see here in the blue is how our tax bill will put money in  the pockets of middle-income people, all the way up--middle-income  people, working-class people, the lowest income people--while the Trump  tax plan, of course, was helping the richest people in the country.   We see that middle-class and working-class and low-income families  are all going to benefit from the American Rescue Plan. This is a broad  investment in a whole country--in the vast majority of people, who get  their income not from a stock portfolio but from a paycheck. Contrast  that with those who benefitted from the McConnell-Trump tax scam. The  vast majority of benefits, as we all know, went to those at the top.  Again, look at the top 1 percent. They got more from the Washington  Republican tax giveaway than anyone else.   At the time, I remember--the Presiding Officer, I think, remembers  this; he opposed that bill vigorously, too--Republicans claimed it just  wasn't possible--to do their tax bill, it wasn't possible--to avoid  giving tax cuts to the richest 1 percent. They just had to. We knew  they were wrong then. This has proved they are wrong.   Again, look at the blue and the purple--the benefits that go to the  lowest, to middle-class families, working families, and low-income  families. Our rescue plan gave literally zero to the top 1 percent.  They are doing just fine. The value of their stock portfolio has soared  during the pandemic. We invested in everyone else, in the people who  were promised more money in their paychecks from the Republican tax  scam but never got those raises.   As I said, 4 million Ohioans will get a stimulus check. That is out  of 12 million people in the State. Two million Ohio families will get  at least a $3,000 child tax credit. They will get a check--$250 every  month year round. More than half a million Ohio workers will get an  expanded earned income tax credit. Those childless families--single  people, childless people, some old, a  [[Page S1415]]  number of older Ohioans not yet quite 65--will get their enhanced  earned income tax credit. Over a million delivery drivers and more than  a million cashiers will get an income boost, and 800,000 home health  aides get more money back in their pockets.   These are the workers on the frontlines of the pandemic. These are  the people who go to work every day and expose themselves to people  whom they don't know, in the course of their job. They go home at night  anxious that they might be infecting their families. This is what  making hard work pay off looks like. This is what investing in the  country looks like. This is what a government on the side of workers  and their families look like. It is about the dignity of work. It is  about rewarding people that work hard. It is what we did on Saturday.  It is what I said, as I was walking out of this building on the way  home on Saturday, was the best day of my Senate career because we  helped tens of millions of Americans. We helped millions of people in  my State. We will make a difference in their lives. That is what we did  on Saturday. That is what we will continue to do.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
