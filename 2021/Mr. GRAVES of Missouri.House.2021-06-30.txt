 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3684.   Here we are again. It is ``Groundhog Day'' for infrastructure on the  floor this week. Exactly 1 year ago, I stood here as we took up the  majority's first version of its my-way-or-the-highway bill. That bill,  just like today's, was developed without working with Republican  Members, and it passed mostly along party lines. And then that bill  died, forcing Congress to pass a 1-year, short-term extension,  something that we all know is extremely costly, and it is detrimental  to our States' ability to plan and carry out the improvements that they  need.   Unfortunately, the Speaker has ignored the obvious lesson that  successful legislating is through partnership, not through  partisanship. As a result, today's bill is even worse than last year's  failed effort.   This bill is completely unpaid for. It is completely unpaid for,  something that I have never seen in a highway bill in my two decades  here in Congress. It is all deficit spending, and it is going to  continue driving up what is already the highest inflation rate since  2008.   Mr. Speaker, it didn't have to be this way. Earlier this year, our  committee's leaders met with the President, and we made it clear that  Republicans wanted to be a part of a bipartisan bill. I have no doubt  that we could have compromised in a way that met many of the majority's  goals while still including Republicans' priorities from our own  proposal.   Far from being impossible, the Senate committees have managed to do  just that. They found common ground on commonsense project  streamlining, flexibility for our State and local partners, and  equitable treatment for rural America.   However, in order to appease the progressives in their party, the  majority showed no willingness to meet us anywhere in the middle.  Instead, they moved their bill even further to the left than the one  from last year. Ironically, even that won't be enough, as Speaker  Pelosi right now is preparing another partisan effort that is going to  completely overshadow this bill by pushing through a multitrillion- dollar, tax-and-spend plan using budget reconciliation.   Mr. Speaker, I will just walk through a few of the things, just a  very few of the things that are wrong with this bill.   Mr. Speaker, $1 out of every $2 on this bill is tied up in the Green  New Deal agenda. This bill eliminates a ban on spending transit dollars  to fund art at train stations or transit stations. It is insane, given  the infrastructure needs that we have in this country, that this bill  would waste critical infrastructure resources on buying paintings and  sculptures for transit stations.   This bill significantly increases the size of government. It creates  41 new programs.   As I mentioned, this bill provides no regulatory reform to make  project delivery more efficient and less wasteful.   This bill ties the hands of States that need to build new roads and  new capacity. Even if that is their most critical need, it still ties  their hands.   These are just a few of the examples of why this bill is bad for the  country. I can go on and on and on and on and on. This partisanship was  absolutely unnecessary, and it is sad.   The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the Senate  Commerce Committee have overwhelmingly approved their own pieces of a  surface reauthorization. The Senate has also approved a bipartisan $35  billion water infrastructure plan. But instead of following that  example or using the bipartisan agreement we had on clean water  infrastructure that we agreed to last Congress as the framework, the  majority again chose to walk away from bipartisanship.   This bill now includes more than $170 billion for drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure, which is completely unrealistic, and it is  out of touch with the Senate's bill and House Republicans. In fact,  everything about this bill is out of touch.   Although the President currently supports a bipartisan infrastructure  framework in the Senate, progressives in Congress have already declared  that that Senate proposal is dead on arrival without first getting  their massive partisan wish list. If they don't get it, they have  stated that.   The Speaker and the far left are trying to hold infrastructure  hostage in order to get their $6 trillion in other priorities through  budget reconciliation.   While the other side says that all the spending in today's bill is  supposed to transform our transportation system, it is certainly going  to change one thing in transportation, and that is your gas prices.  More deficit spending is only going to further fuel inflation and raise  the price of not only gas but food and every other necessity.   Voting for this bill is an implicit endorsement of the Speaker's  overall strategy to ram through a $6 trillion tax-and-spend  reconciliation package, and I encourage Members to vote against this  bill and against this partisan process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).  [[Page H3511]]         Mr. Speaker I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Balderson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Madam Speaker, can I inquire as to how much  time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Nehls).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, this bill basically lets the American people down.  This is a missed opportunity for partnership, a chance to come together  and pass a bill that addresses the real infrastructure needs of all of  our communities, from the largest cities right down to our most rural  areas.   Members on the other side have said that they don't want another  traditional highway bill, but we can't abandon our roads and bridges  just to say we want something new. Our core infrastructure has become  traditional because Americans depend on it to work, travel, and live.   That is why every highway bill that has become law for at least the  last three decades has done so based on bipartisanship, Democrats and  Republicans sitting down together with their  [[Page H3514]]  priorities and putting in the work to find common ground that both  sides can support.   We could have found common ground and achieved many of the goals  while addressing Republican priorities, as well. That is what the  American people want us to do. That is what the President at least said  that he wanted, and that is what the Speaker actually said she wanted  our committees to do.   But the process that led us here didn't reflect any of those calls to  unity. What is even more frustrating is that we did have a bipartisan  agreement in place, at least part of it, ready to take up again, and  that was the wastewater section of this bill. But the majority, again,  blatantly rejected the chance to work together on another  infrastructure issue that has been and should continue to be  bipartisan.   This bill only reflects the majority's one-size-fits-all vision for  what they think our infrastructure should look like. It doesn't reflect  the realities of what actually addresses the needs of our communities.   Today, I am going to ask my colleagues to consider this: Does this  help your communities? Do you consider art to be infrastructure? Do you  feel good about spending $550 billion on a highway bill that restricts  communities from building highways? Most importantly, can you ignore  the reality of spending more than $715 billion with no pay-fors, no  revenue title, just piling more debt onto our children's future and  driving up inflation?   For me, that answer is really simple. It is no.   What is worse, progressives are not going to let this bill or any  real infrastructure bill become law unless they get their $6 trillion  partisan wish list. They are holding infrastructure hostage to achieve  their socialist tax and spend agenda.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and the  majority's partisan process, and I yield back the balance of my time.
