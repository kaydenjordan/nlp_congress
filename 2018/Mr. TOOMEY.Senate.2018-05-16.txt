 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about two related  topics. The first is to recognize and honor the men and women of law  enforcement across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and across our  country. This week is National Police Week, and it is really an  important opportunity for us to let the folks in law enforcement know  how grateful we are to them for the service they provide and for the  sacrifices they make every single day to keep us safe.   It is also an important occasion to remember those who made the  ultimate sacrifice. This week, the names of 129 law enforcement  officers killed in the line of duty in 2017 alone were added to the  National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Among the fallen were two  Pennsylvania officers: Patrolman Brian Shaw of the New Kensington  Police Department and Trooper Michael Paul Stewart III of the  Pennsylvania State Police.   Given the clear and obvious dangers that our police officers face, it  seems to me that we have an obligation to make sure they have the tools  they need to protect themselves and the public, so I want to mention  two efforts to do exactly that and urge my colleagues to support these  efforts.   The first is a Bureau of Prisons gun locker bill. This is legislation  that I have introduced with Senator Manchin. We call it the Lieutenant  Osvaldo Albarati Correctional Officer Self-Protection Act. What it  would do is allow Federal prison guards to protect themselves on their  commutes to and from work.   Why is this a problem? Because in many cases, the prisons where the  prison guards work do not have a secure place to secure firearms, so  the guards cannot bring their firearms to work with them nor would they  have them to go home. They often are unarmed going to and from work.   Sadly, the fact is, Federal prison guards can often be targets of  criminals when they are off duty. Let's be honest here. Some of the  prisoners they are guarding get released and are still pretty bad guys.   Unfortunately, the Department of Justice policy essentially makes it  impossible for guards to protect themselves when they are going to and  from work. Sadly, Lieutenant Albarati, of Puerto Rico, paid for the  price for this policy. In 2013, he was driving home from work. He was  unarmed. He was shot and killed. Three inmates from the prison where he  worked had hired the killer.   What our bill does is very simple. It requires the Federal Bureau of  Prisons to provide officers with an onsite storage locker for their  personal firearms so that when they get to work, they can secure them  in a safe place or allow these prison guards to store their personal  firearms in a lockbox that is in their cars. It is pretty simple. It is  pretty straightforward.   Yesterday, the House voted on a companion bill, and it passed 378 to  0--378 to 0. Now is the opportunity for the Senate to act. We should  act quickly. We should pass this. We should do it through our hotline  and get this done. I am sure the President will sign this into law, and  we will be providing a tool to enhance the safety of the prison guards  who protect our security.   There is another piece of legislation, which is the Lifesaving Gear  for Police Act. I have introduced this legislation. What this would do  is allow local law enforcement to continue obtaining the surplus  defensive Federal gear they need to protect themselves and the public.  It is based on a simple principle. The idea is that the police ought to  at least have sufficient equipment. They should at least be as well- equipped as criminals and terrorists who attack them and are a threat  to  [[Page S2712]]  all of us. We should make every effort we can to make sure that law  enforcement officers have the chance to go home safely to their  families at the end of their shifts.   It was longstanding policy that surplus, leftover, military gear that  was defensive in nature, when it was not wanted or in use by the  military, would be made available to law enforcement. Unfortunately, in  2015, the Obama administration severely restricted the ability of State  and local law enforcement to obtain this surplus, leftover, in-storage  gear.   The restrictions by the Obama administration were rationalized on the  completely false narrative that the police were a source of unrest and  violence, as opposed to the truth that we all know, that they are brave  men and women who defend us against unrest and violence. I think the  American people know better. They know that the vast, overwhelming  majority of people in law enforcement are good, honest, decent, hard- working people who are motivated by their desire to do a good job and  protect the public.   Fortunately, President Trump reversed the Obama administration's  flawed policy of denying our local police forces this equipment. But  that only has the power of an Executive order, and the safety of our  law enforcement officers and the public should not be subject to  political whims. A new administration will arrive at some point, and  when they do, they could reverse this unless we codify it in law. That  is what our bill would do. It would ensure that State and local law  enforcement can continue to obtain this lifesaving Federal gear,  regardless of who occupies the Oval Office or Congress.    So as we mark National Police Week, we should never forget the  courage our law enforcement officers exhibit every day in keeping us  safe. I would like to say to our country's law enforcement officers,  including the more than 25,000 in Pennsylvania, we thank you for your  service and your sacrifice.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the second topic I wish to touch on today  is a subject that is apparently misunderstood, and it is certainly  wildly mischaracterized. It is the subject of rescissions. It has  become a topic of conversation since the President--the  administration--has proposed a rescission. A rescission relates to our  budget process. It is when money originally authorized by Congress to  be spent on a program but actually is not spent--that authorization is  revoked, it is rescinded, but it is with respect to money that was  never spent.   Now, specifically, I want to discuss how this relates to the  Children's Health Insurance Program, which is often referred to by the  acronym CHIP--the CHIP program. So if you follow recent media reports  and comments by some of our colleagues, and even some industry  stakeholders, boy, it sure seems like there is a lot of confusion.   Let me state an unequivocal fact. Since 2011, there have been  rescissions from CHIP every single year. This is not new. It has  happened every single year since 2011.   Now, is that because Congress decides during the course of each year  that they don't really like the CHIP program or they don't like  children or they don't want kids to get health insurance? No, that is  not why it happens. The reason it happens each and every year is  because Congress systematically, intentionally, and willfully  authorizes far more money for the CHIP program than it is ever going to  actually spend.   We have a chart that illustrates this. We can see the vertical  columns. The red bars show how much money Congress has authorized in  the years to the left of the dotted line. Those are historical years.  To the right of the dotted line is the projected future years. So the  red bars are how much money Congress has authorized for the CHIP  program. The green line shows how much of that money actually gets  spent on the program. We can see that in each and every year the red  bar is way above the green line. It has been going on back to 2009; it  is every single year, and if we continue on our current path, that will  continue to be the case as far as we can see going into the future.   Now, take a particular year; for example, this year, 2018. We expect  the Federal Government is going to spend $16 billion on the program.  Now, because of the nature of the way this program works and certain  features, it is possible we will spend $16.1 billion. It is possible it  will end up being $15.99 billion, but we know $16 billion is enough to  provide the Federal share of funding for the children enrolled by their  States, but, as I say, we don't know it with precise precision right to  the last dollar.   So knowing it is going to be about $16 billion, how much money do we  think Congress authorized for this program that is going to cost $16  billion? The answer is $25 billion. So $25 billion, when we know for a  fact--everybody, including our Democratic colleagues, knows we are not  going to spend anything close to that amount of money. As I say, this  overfunding is not unique to 2018; it happens each and every year, and  it will continue well into the future.   Now, within that $25 billion, I should point out a subset. There is  something called the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund. In 2018, $4.3  billion of the $25 billion is designated for this Child Enrollment  Contingency Fund. The word ``contingency'' is there because it is  meant, theoretically, to be a backstop in case the demand--the  utilization--for this program is so great that the allocated money  isn't enough, so there will be this contingency fund. That raises a  question: Is that a sensible number, $4.3 billion?   Well, let's look at this. Since 2009, there has been a total of $11.4  billion made available in this very category, this contingency fund.  That is represented by the blue circle on the chart. How much has  actually been needed? The answer is $100 million--one-tenth of $1  billion. Nine-tenths of 1 percent of the amount of money that has been  made available has actually been used for this purpose, and $11.4  billion was authorized in the decades since this contingency fund was  invented.   During that period of time, all 50 States and the District of  Columbia, if they ever needed it, would have been able to access this.  That 50, plus 1, over the course of 9 years, is 460 opportunities for a  State or the District to come to the Federal Government and say: We  need some of that money from the contingency fund--460 times. How many  times has it actually occurred over the course of those 9 years? The  answer is three, and the amount of money is less than 1 percent of what  has been authorized: $108 million used out of $11 billion that has been  authorized.   Well, next year, according to State law, despite the fact that no  State is even close to consuming the full amount of the main fund, we  are going to allow another $4.5 billion to be deposited in this  account, when the sum total of all the States' usage for the last 9  years was $100 million, one-tenth of $1 billion.    Look at it another way. If you look at all the CHIP-related  accounts--all the Federal money that has been designated for this  children's health program since 2009--Congress has willfully and  systematically authorized so much in excess of what is needed that  actually only 58 percent of the money has gone to the CHIP program  because that is all the demand there was for this program.   So this, obviously, raises a question: Why is it that year after year  after year, including this year, Congress intentionally authorizes so  much more funding than we are ever going to spend on this category, on  this program, on the children's health program? I will tell my  colleagues why. It is a big budget gimmick. It creates a big  opportunity for Congress to lie to the American people and spend more  money on other programs under the guise of putting it toward the  children's health program.   How does this work? Every year, as I mentioned at the beginning of my  comments, after knowingly authorizing way more money than is needed,  Congress comes back and says: Oh, you know what, let's do a rescission,  but we will take this money out of CHIP, and we will spend it on  something else. It could be spent on anything else, whatever the  politically favorite cause is of the moment, but buried somewhere in a  1,000-page appropriations bill every  [[Page S2713]]  year there has been a rescission, and the money has been shifted to  something else. Basically, it becomes a slush fund to be used in the  appropriations process and to allow the appropriations to exceed the  cap on spending that we all agreed upon.   So that is what happens. Congress willfully creates a number way  above what we are going to spend, comes back a little later and says:  Oh, my goodness, look at all this leftover money. Well, let's just take  it and spend it somewhere else.   It is completely dishonest. It completely misrepresents the CHIP  program. It completely misrepresents--in fact, it blatantly violates  the spending caps we have established, and it is not trivial. It is not  a trivial amount of money. Over the last 8 years, the amount of these  rescissions, so it can be spent elsewhere, has added up to 45 billion  taxpayer dollars--entirely a gimmick, a device that just allows  Congress to lie to the American people about what they are spending.   So that brings us up to last week. The administration comes along and  says they have a suggestion for Congress. First of all, let's fully  fund the CHIP program. Let's make sure the CHIP program is fully  funded. There will be no shortage whatsoever, but let's stop the lying.  Let's remove the deception. Let's provide a reasonable amount of excess  funding, because I acknowledge at the beginning we don't know right  down to the last dollar exactly how much we are going to spend, but  let's take aside all of this wild excess.   Let's be honest. Let's rescind now most of the excess funding, which  has been going on each and every year separately; let's leave more than  enough in the contingency fund. Even though it is extremely unlikely  that any of it will be tapped, the administration has proposed $500  million to be left in the contingency fund. Remember, that is the fund  that has been used to the tune of $108 million over the last 9 years,  but they are saying let's leave $500 million--five times as much as has  been spent cumulatively over the last 9 years--and basically send all  of this huge, excessive amount back to the Treasury so it is not just  spent willy-nilly and irresponsibly.   Now, for some reason, despite the fact that not a single dollar that  would have actually been spent on the CHIP program will be spent  differently, will not be spent; despite the fact that the CHIP program  will not lose a single dollar of actual funding; despite the fact that  Congress has been doing this every single year since 2011, as long as  it can spend it on something else; despite the fact that 65 Senators,  including 40 of my Democratic colleagues, voted to rescind $6.8 billion  from CHIP--how long ago? In March of this year, a few weeks ago,  including $3.1 billion from the contingency fund. So the vast majority  of my Democratic colleagues voted to rescind money from CHIP just  earlier this year. Despite that, now we have people up in high dudgeon,  wailing and gnashing of the teeth, about how what we are doing would  tear CHIP apart--even after what they did in March, by the way--that it  is somehow a betrayal, immoral, appalling; it hurts low- and middle- class families.   It would be too generous to suggest this is merely a lapse of memory.  Everybody knows what is going on. This is ridiculous.   So I fully support the President's proposal that we fully fund CHIP  but stop with the dishonesty in our budgeting. Stop throwing a bunch of  money under this category, knowing we are going to go back later and  spend it somewhere else. This program shouldn't be pillaged this way to  spend money on unrelated things that just allow us to bust the budget  cap.   I would go a step further. What the administration has proposed, to  their credit, fixes this terrible flaw this year. I would like us to  permanently fix it. I have suggested to my colleagues, rather than  specifying a dollar amount, since we don't know the precise dollar  amount, I would be OK with a provision that says: such sums as will be  needed. That would guarantee it would be fully funded, but it would not  create this big excess that gets wasted on who knows what.   If the only concern people have is to ensure that the CHIP program  will be fully and properly funded, how can they object to that? It  would specify, codified in language, that would be exactly what would  happen. It would be fully funded, but we have gotten this resistance to  that. How could that possibly be? Unless it is that people want to  continue this gimmickry, this deception that has been going on for all  of these years.   Well, I hope we will be able to work out a long-term solution. I hope  we will bring an end to this. I understand my colleagues on the other  side want to spend more money. Let's just admit it--admit it, and let's  debate it. We have agreed-upon spending caps. I think they are too  high, but that is what we agreed upon. We shouldn't be lying to the  American people and going through this gimmick yet again.   So I want to state my unequivocal support for the administration's  proposal for a rescission package. I would prefer if there were actual  spending being cut. This is indirectly going to help reduce excessive  spending because it is going after these unobligated funds, it is going  after these excessive accounts. It happens in other accounts, but CHIP  is the most noteworthy. To me, this is a modest step in the direction  of honest budgeting and protecting the taxpayers.   I hope we will be able to have a permanent solution to this soon, but  in the meantime, I hope my colleagues will support the administration's  rescission package.   I yield the floor.
