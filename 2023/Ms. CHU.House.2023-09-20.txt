 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 95th birthday of  my friend, Reverend James Lawson, who for more than half a century has  been a force for justice and worker rights.   As a minister and teacher of nonviolent resistance, James Lawson was  a leader of the civil rights movement and worked closely with Dr.  Martin Luther King. Lawson led sit-ins, Freedom Rides, and strikes,  including the historic 1968 Memphis sanitation strike, and he was a  mentor to our beloved John Lewis.   In 1974, Reverend Lawson moved to Los Angeles, where he teaches  nonviolence at UCLA. His work orchestrating nonviolent sit-ins and  civil disobedience helped improve working conditions for southern  California hotel workers, generating a national movement for immigrant  worker justice.   Reverend Lawson has been an inspiration to many as he continues the  fight for freedom and justice.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Reverend Lawson a happy birthday.                            ____________________
