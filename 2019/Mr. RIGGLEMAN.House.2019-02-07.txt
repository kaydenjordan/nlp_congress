 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak about a great man,  a man who was a proud son of my home, Nelson County, Virginia, Edward  Embrey, former Faber Volunteer fire chief and Nelson County Rescue  Squad captain, after a courageous battle with cancer. His courage  reflects how he lived his life.   Raised in my home county of Nelson, Eddie dedicated his life to  helping friends and neighbors who found themselves in harm's way. He  fought countless wildfires across the Commonwealth and Nation, leading  to his commendation as Forest Warden of the Year in Virginia. He was  asked to serve as captain of the Nelson County Rescue Squad and chief  of the Faber Volunteer Fire Department.   His dedication to public safety and to helping all the men and women  of Nelson County should be recognized and commended. He put his life at  risk time after time to save people he didn't even know across the  entirety of the Commonwealth. Eddie lived a life of selflessness, and  for that, we are all thankful.   From me and all those who have served: Rest easy, Chief.                            ____________________
