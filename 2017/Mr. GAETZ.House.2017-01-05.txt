 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I support this rule and the underlying legislation.  Today the Federal Government's rules exceed 97,000 pages--the most in  American history. So we ask ourselves: Do we really need 20 pages of  rules governing vending machines? Could we cover fuel standards in less  than 578 pages? Would the Union crumble if we didn't have 61 pages of  regulations on residential dehumidifiers?   Each of these rules has compliance costs that exceed $100 million.   In my home State of Florida, we passed a version of the REINS Act.  The result has been repeal or replacement of over 4,000 job-killing  regulations. We can only make America great again if we make Americans  free again--free from the tyranny of unelected Washington bureaucrats  huddled in windowless cubicles dictating to Americans how they should  live their lives, build their businesses, and protect their own  property. Voters sent us here to drain the swamp, but with so many  regulations, we would be lucky to get permission to mop up a puddle.
