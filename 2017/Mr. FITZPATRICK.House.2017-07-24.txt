 Mr. Speaker, for over a half century, the Lenape  Valley Foundation has provided assistance, compassion, and hope to  thousands of children, adults, and families within my district. They  offer services related to mental health, substance abuse, intellectual  disability, and early intervention.   I was pleased to meet with community leaders and volunteers during  the groundbreaking ceremony at The Lodge at Lenape Valley Foundation, a  new construction on the campus of Lower Bucks Hospital.   The new facility will provide more outpatient mental health services,  including individual group and family therapy, an improved crisis call  center, an improved crisis walk-in center, peer support, and Bucks  County's only Crisis Residential Program.   I am thankful for the leadership of the Lenape Valley executive team:  Alan Hartl, Walter Wolaniuk, Sharon Curran, Philip Braun, JoAnne Davis,  Mary Dubyk, Mary Jane Fletcher, Traci Gorman, Angela Jacobsen, Marjorie  Morgan, and Mary Ann Venezia, as well as board president, Robert  Rogala; vice president, Lisa Bodine; secretary, Helene Cevasco Mathern;  treasurer, Mark Strasburg; and all the board of directors.   I am proud to work with an organization which recognizes that  everyone can grow and progress toward personal fulfillment, and we are  proud to stand by their side.                     Honoring United Way of Bucks County     Mr. Speaker, the United Way of Bucks County is  dedicated to improving the lives through the caring power of  communities. We all have a stake in making our communities healthy and  prosperous. The United Way of Bucks County is committed to working  together, advancing the common good, and creating a better life for  all.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 24, 2017, on page H6149, the following appeared: HONORING  UNITED WAY OF BUCKS COUNTY  Mr. Speaker,    ========================= END NOTE =========================     The United Way works in close collaboration with diverse partners in  Bucks County. From schools, government agencies, community  corporations, neighborhood associations, the faith community, and  volunteers, the United Way brings together passion, resources, and  expertise to get things done in Bucks County.   Although there are about 1,300 United Way chapters nationally, each  chapter shapes its own identity, holding firm  [[Page H6150]]  that everyone deserves a good life through quality education, stable  employment, supportive income, and good health.    I am very proud to work with Bucks County's team at the United Way:  Marissa Christie, Faith Parkinson, Patricia Winslow Gallagher, Matt  Uhler, Danielle Bush, Tim Philpot, Candi Guerrero, Katie Matarazzo, Dan  Warvolis, and Pat Miller.   Mr. Speaker, these problem-solvers are making an impact on improving  lives and making Bucks County a more prosperous community, and for  that, they are deserving of all of our thanks and support.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, for more than 100 years, residents of  Bucks and Montgomery Counties have trusted Grand View Health hospital  with the well-being of their families. They are dedicated toward  leading our community to a healthier future.   Following their Community Health Needs Assessment, Grand View Health  has identified and prioritized a community health improvement program,  which, over the next 3 years, will address health challenges present in  their service area.   I am proud of the positive impact that Grand View Health has made in  our community. I commend their board of trustees for their outstanding  leadership and service to our community. Many thanks to Jeffrey Landis,  Mary Anne Poatsy, Mark Schlosser, William Aichele, Jean Keeler, Michael  Corrado, Marc Freeman, Nicholas Lindberg, Robert Pritchard, Gregory  Shelly, and all the doctors, nurses, staff, and volunteers who make  this a success.   Madam Speaker, Grand View Health's commitment to the people it serves  reminds us that we are all in this together, and it is never too late  to start living a healthy lifestyle.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking  member for their leadership on this bill.   Since 1944, the GI Bill has provided veterans the opportunity to  invest in themselves and their future through access to education  benefits.   My father attended college on the GI Bill following his service to  our country, launching his life and putting our family on the path to  success.   While the world has changed since 1944, the dedication and service of  our men and women in uniform remains constant. These volunteer warriors  stand ready to defend our Nation in theaters around the globe. While we  can never fully thank them for their commitment, we must endeavor to  assist them and their families wherever possible.   The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act improves and  extends the benefits granted to veterans and their surviving dependents  through the GI Bill, helping to ease the transition from Active Duty to  civilian life by paving the way with new career opportunities and  technical education.   This bipartisan legislation is a crucial step to investing in the  success of our veterans and advancing the common cause of serving those  who have served us so honorably.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member and the  entire committee for their leadership.
