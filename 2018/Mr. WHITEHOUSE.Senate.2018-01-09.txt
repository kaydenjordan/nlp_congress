 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I believe that my distinguished  colleague and friend, Senator Blumenthal, will be joining me on the  floor. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as in morning  business for such time as I may require and, at the conclusion of my  remarks, that Senator Blumenthal be recognized to make his remarks on  the same subject.    Mr. President, 2018 is going to be an election year.  In just 10 months, Americans will go to the polls to exercise their  franchise, believing in the integrity of our democratic process. I am  here today to discuss a threat to the integrity of that process, which  is getting little attention here in Congress--nothing near what it  deserves. We really ought to be acting with some expedition to  safeguard our elections this November. Yet, instead, the effort is one  of chasing down partisan investigative rabbit holes.   What ought to be our job? Well, national security, intelligence,  election, and law enforcement officials, many of them testifying before  us here in Congress, have made what our job is very clear. We must  counter Russia's well-established election interference playbook.  Russia will hack. Russia will bully. Russia will propagandize. Perhaps  more insidiously, Russia will seek to corrupt, particularly by  exploiting cracks in our incorporation and campaign finance laws. We  are warned: Russia will seek to interfere in 2018's election.   I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ``CIA's Pompeo says  Russia and others trying to undermine U.S. elections'' be printed in  the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   To quote the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Heather  Conley, testifying before Congress last spring, corruption is the  ``lubricant'' for Moscow's election interference, so ``the battle of  Western democracies to defeat corruption'' must be seen as ``a matter  of national security.''   Testifying before our Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee, former  Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, agreed, saying of  Russia's 2016 election meddling:         I believe [the Russians] are now emboldened to continue       such activities in the future, both here and around world,       and to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a       clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the       very foundation of our democratic political system, this       episode is it. I hope the American people recognize the       severity of this threat and that we collectively counter it       before it further erodes the fabric of our democracy.    How to counter it? Well, there are two important solutions that  witnesses have identified in recent testimony before the Judiciary and  other committees here in the Senate.   First, guard against the use of phony shell corporations as  facilitators of corruption. Ms. Conley, as I said, wrote that  corruption is the ``lubricant'' with which the Russians operate their  interference schemes. She and her colleagues warn that to fight the  corruption that gives Russia this channel of influence--and I quote her  here--``enhancing transparency and the effectiveness of the Western  democratic tools, instruments, and institutions is critical.'' One  central way to cut off this channel of improper influence would be to  require companies to disclose who their real owner is so that Russian  influence can no longer hide behind anonymous American shell companies.   Another would be to crack down on the dark money that is flooding  into American elections. It is illegal for foreign nationals to spend  money or participate at all in American elections. Yet, post-Citizens  United, the same dark money avenues that allow domestic election  interference--for instance, that the Koch brothers use to manipulate  American elections--are right out there to be used by Vladimir Putin.  If they can hide their identity behind 501(c)(4)s and other dark money  channels, so can operatives for the Russians.   Instead of taking up these important measures or even ensuring a  thorough investigation into the 2016 election meddling, we are--to  paraphrase the legendary Senator Sam Ervin of Watergate fame--chasing  rabbits when we should be on a bear hunt.   Let's look at a few rabbits that have distracted us from the task at  hand. Remember, when Michael Flynn, the President's former National  Security Adviser, illicitly communicated with the Russian Ambassador  about sanctions during the transition. Then in the White House, he lied  to the FBI about it, which concerned the Justice Department so badly  that the Acting Attorney General warned the White House Counsel  personally, after which she was fired, but the President then  [[Page S96]]  waited 18 days until all of this had become public in the media to ask  for Michael Flynn's resignation. Out of all of that, the topic for many  Republicans was the alleged leaks of classified information that  allowed the story to come to light--not the story itself of problems at  the highest level of our national security establishment. Off people  went after the ``leaks'' rabbit.   Republicans then pivoted to talking about the ``unmasking''--remember  that word; we heard a lot of it around here--of identities in  intelligence reporting and the purported misconduct of Obama  administration officials. Trump even publicly suggested that former  National Security Adviser Susan Rice may have committed a crime. So off  people went after the ``unmasking'' rabbit.   Next, the President accused President Obama of wiretapping Trump  Tower, an allegation so outrageous that even congressional Republicans  have refused to stand by it, but my, what a bright and shiny rabbit it  was for the weeks that it was still a distraction.   By the spring and summer, Republicans were railing against purported  conflicts of interest by FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, a  distinguished career public servant.   I ask unanimous consent that this article, ``FBI ruled McCabe had no  conflict of interest in Clinton probe,'' be printed in the Record at  the conclusion of my remarks.   So off everybody went after the ``McCabe's wife'' rabbit.   After President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey to impede the  Russia investigation and then told the Russian Foreign Minister and NBC  that was why he had done it, the President launched another leak  rabbit: a coordinated effort with his lawyers, congressional  Republicans, and the rightwing media to suggest that Comey had leaked  classified information by sharing with a friend his own contemporaneous  notes of conversations with Trump.   Just last week, the President again suggested on Twitter that Comey  should be charged with a crime--another bite at the ``leaks'' rabbit.   In early July, we learned of the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower  between Russian lawyer and operative Natalia Veselnitskaya and senior  Trump campaign leaders seeking dirt on Hillary Clinton. Republicans  tried to distract attention from that mess by suggesting that  Veselnitskaya was in the country on a visa issued by Obama  administration officials, with some rightwing media--aided by some  congressional Republicans--even whipping on the ``visa'' rabbit by  suggesting there was a setup orchestrated by the Obama administration  against the Trump campaign.   Then came the ``Fusion'' rabbit. Because Fusion GPS had worked on  separate projects--one with Christopher Steele and a separate one with  Natalia Veselnitskaya--some Republicans began suggesting either that  Russia had been Fusion's client for the Steele dossier or that Steele  was the unwitting victim of a Russian disinformation campaign.   Then there is the ``Uranium One'' rabbit, which began when a  rightwing author suggested, without evidence, that Hillary Clinton may  have been responsible for a Russian state company acquiring uranium  mines in the United States. This rabbit remains a topic of  investigation in Congress and in rightwing media.   Then there are the attacks on Bob Mueller, which, like rabbits,  multiply by the hour. As the special counsel's investigation started  heating up over the late summer and fall, the rightwing began  investigating the investigation--alleged conflicts of interest, history  of campaign donations, inappropriate text messages, questions about  spouses' employment. But the big one was that the FBI was corruptly  involved in the procurement of the Steele dossier and that this had  launched the ``witch hunt.'' This, of course, is a very shiny rabbit.   However, a week ago, reporting by the New York Times confirmed that  the FBI did not begin its investigation into Donald Trump's connections  to Russia because of the so-called Steele dossier. This should not come  as a surprise. We have already been told that U.S. allies warned  American national security officials about Russian interference in our  2016 elections.   In response to a question from Ranking Member Feinstein at our Crime  and Terrorism Subcommittee hearing on May 8, former Director of  National Intelligence James Clapper confirmed that ``Britain's  intelligence service''--Britain's intelligence service--``first became  aware in late 2015 of suspicious interactions between Trump advisers  and Russian intelligence agents,'' and the Brits passed that  information on to U.S. intelligence agencies. Clapper confirmed that in  ``the spring of 2016, multiple European allies passed on additional  information to the United States about contacts between the Trump  campaign and Russians.'' Clapper said that these reports were accurate  and that ``the specifics are quite sensitive.''   Now we have learned that Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George  Papadopoulos, who pled guilty last year to lying to the FBI, apparently  told a senior Australian official in the spring of 2016 that Russia had  dirt on Hillary Clinton. This is something he said he had been told by  an intermediary for the Russians. When hacked emails started showing up  that summer, Australia's Government became sufficiently concerned to  let U.S. officials know about what they had learned from Papadopoulos.   So you have the British intelligence community warnings, the European  intelligence community warnings, the Australian warnings, and Carter  Page's travels to Russia. You have the attribution of the DNC hack, the  intrusion into those emails, to Russian hackers. You have the leaking  of the stolen emails. You have abundant evidence out of all of that for  the FBI that the Trump campaign's links to Russia required further  investigation. It would have been a complete failure of their duty to  not have looked further based on all of that evidence.   That is not to say that Christopher Steele and his work are not taken  seriously by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials. U.S.  security agencies have relied on Steele's analysis long before any  dossier appeared. Steele is a leading Russia expert. Beginning in 1990,  as an undercover officer in Moscow, he watched the Soviet Union  unravel. He observed Russia's current leaders ascend through the  Russian security services during the 1990s and 2000s. He rose to a  senior position on MI6's Russia desk in London. Since leaving MI6, his  reports on Russia and Ukraine have been shared widely within the U.S.  Government as credible reporting. A U.S. official told the Guardian  that Steele's reports were ``consistently reliable, meticulous, and  well-informed.''   But you would never know this from listening to congressional  Republicans. They have been repeating, in chorus with the White House  and conservative media, the disproven claim that the Russians somehow  commissioned the Steele dossier or that Steele somehow got suckered by  the Russians or that some deep-state FBI set up the whole thing to  pressure Trump. They have pushed to discredit Steele. They have pushed  to discredit Fusion.    As one example, rewind to the Judiciary Committee's hearing on the  Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, last July. On the morning of  the second day of that hearing, the President tweeted: ``One of the  things that has been lost in the politics of this situation is that the  Russians collected and spread negative information about then candidate  Trump.'' This is Trump tweeting about himself. His tweet came shortly  after a segment on FOX News centered on the same question. Other  rightwing outlets parroted the same message.   That same day, Republicans in Congress spun out the same premise that  Russians paid for the dossier and that the dossier was, to use their  word, the ``genesis'' of the FBI's inquiry. I hope we have made it  clear that this was not the genesis.   While the FARA hearing was still going on, that same day, the gop.gov  website published this post:         [W]e now know a Russian backed, Democrat connected research       firm, with a history of smearing individuals and pitching       fake information to reporters, was hired by opponents of       President Trump to compile a ``dossier'' of supposed Trump       ties to Russia.        The information that was compiled was taken seriously by       the highest level of our intelligence community along with       our media, despite obvious signs that the firm behind it was       tied to Russia.  [[Page S97]]         As a reminder, this phony ``dossier'' helped spark the       investigation now led by Special Counsel Mueller.    That is the rabbit we are chasing now.   The uniformity of the rightwing message that day with the White House  was telling, but the message--the content of it--is simply not true. In  fact, at that hearing, the witness denied any knowledge of any link  between Russians and the clients of the Steele dossier.   In the months that followed, Fusion GPS's founder, Glenn Simpson,  spent over 20 hours speaking with congressional investigators,  including investigators from the Senate Judiciary Committee.   I ask unanimous consent that his op-ed be printed in the Record as a  third and final item at the conclusion of my remarks.   During these interviews, he specifically told Democratic and  Republican staff alike that the dossier was taken seriously by the FBI  because it corroborated reports the Bureau had already received from  other sources--remember the British, the European, the Australian we  have talked about--and a source inside the Trump campaign. From the  Time's recent reporting, we can conclude that that source was George  Papadopoulos. This has all been known for months, but the narrative  about Fusion GPS and the FBI grinds on, unhinged from fact.   The revelation about George Papadopoulos and the Australian  Government should serve as a clarifying moment about the rightwing  effort to undermine Bob Mueller's investigation of the ties of the  Trump campaign and his Presidency to Russia. The FBI investigation did  not begin because of opposition research. It did not begin because  researchers or journalists or American national security officials fell  victim to Russian disinformation. It did not begin because of fake news  or because Democrats needed an explanation for losing an election. It  began when multiple allies, friends of the United States, warned us  that the Russian Government was interfering in our democratic process-- something many of them knew about from Russia's interference in their  own democratic process.   We still do not know to what extent that interference may have been  facilitated or even simply known to members of the Trump campaign or  other Trump associates. We still have done nothing to prevent further  interference in our elections in 2018. The special counsel's  investigation and the investigations going on in Congress must be  allowed to continue until all of the facts are known.   Here in the Senate, we should stop looking for new distractions, stop  chasing rabbits, and start thinking about how we are going to protect  our future elections--our 2018 election--against a repeat performance,  which we have been warned about, by the Russians or another foreign  adversary, for that matter.   As the Center for Strategic and International Studies warns in its  report, ``The Kremlin Playbook,'' we must fight the avenues for  corruption that give Russia influence. We must ``enhanc[e]  transparency'' in government and build ``resilience against Russian  influence'' in our elections and elsewhere in American society.   I will conclude by saying that the best measure of our success in  Congress will be an America defended against foreign election  interference in time to protect our 2018 elections. If we have not  achieved that, we have failed at our duty. I do not see us presently on  a path to meet that goal. We are less than a year out from election  day. We have work to do. Enough with the rabbits.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   CIA's Pompeo Says Russia and Others Trying To Undermine U.S. Elections                            (By Susan Cornwell)         Washington (Reuters).--The head of the Central Intelligence       Agency said on Sunday that Russia and others are trying to       undermine elections in the United States, the next major one       being in November when Republicans will try to keep control       of Congress.        U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia       interfered in the 2016 presidential election to try to help       President Donald Trump win, in part by hacking and releasing       emails embarrassing to Democratic presidential candidate       Hillary Clinton, and spreading social media propaganda.        CIA Director Mike Pompeo told CBS that the Russian       interference is longstanding, and continues. Asked on ``Face       the Nation'' if Moscow is currently trying to undermine U.S.       elections, Pompeo responded: ``Yes sir, have been for       decades.''        ``Yes, I continue to be concerned, not only about the       Russians, but about others' efforts as well,'' Pompeo said,       without giving details. ``We have many foes who want to       undermine Western democracy.''        Moscow denies any meddling in the 2016 elections to help       Republican Trump win. U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is       investigating whether any crimes were committed. Two Trump       associates, former national security adviser Michael Flynn       and campaign aide George Papadopoulos have pleaded guilty to       lying to FBI agents in the probe. Trump denies any campaign       collusion with Russia.        Trump has at times suggested that he accepts the U.S.       intelligence agencies' assessment that Russia sought to       interfere in the election but at other times has said he       accepts Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials that       Moscow meddled.        Trump has frequently spoken of wanting to improve relations       with Putin, even though Russia has frustrated U.S. policy in       Syria and Ukraine and done little to help Washington in its       standoff with North Korea.        Pompeo told CBS that the CIA had an important function as a       part of the national security team to keep U.S. elections       secure and democratic. ``We are working diligently to do       that. So we're going to work against the Russians or any       others who threaten that very outcome,'' he said.        Trump said on Saturday that he planned an active year on       the campaign trail on behalf of Republican candidates running       in the mid-term elections, in which all of the House of       Representatives and one-third of the Senate will be up for       election. Republicans hold majorities in both.                                   ____                        [From The Hill, Jan. 5, 2018]    FBI Ruled McCabe Had No Conflict of Interest in Clinton Probe: Docs                           (By Julia Manchester)         The FBI said in documents released Friday that Deputy       Director Andrew McCabe did not have any role in the probe       into Hillary Clinton's private email server while his wife       ran as a Democrat for state office in Virginia.        The documents note that Jill McCabe announced her candidacy       for state Senate in Virginia in March 2015, while Andrew       McCabe's role as deputy director started in February 2016,       three months after his wife lost her electoral bid.        Andrew McCabe had asked ethics officials if his wife's       candidacy would lead to a potential conflict of interest       while he was working as an assistant director at the FBI       Field Office in Washington, D.C., the documents show.        ``From the first contemplation that his wife would run for       office in Virginia, [McCabe] sought out and consulted with       ethics officers, which included briefings on the Hatch Act,''       the records state.        A ``system of recusal'' was also put in place to prevent       any potential conflicts of interests, according to the       documents.        The release of the documents comes after President Trump       and other Republicans have claimed McCabe had a conflict of       interest due to his wife's electoral bid, noting that her       campaign was supported by a super-PAC associated to Virginia       Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a Clinton ally.        ``How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in       charge, along with leakin' James Comey, of the Phony Hillary       Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted       emails) be given $700,000 for wife's campaign by Clinton       Puppets during investigation?'' Trump tweeted last month:         ``How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in       charge, along with leakin' James Comey of the Phony Hillary       Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted       emails) be given $700,000 for wife's campaign by Clinton       Puppets during investigation?'' 3:27 PM-Dec. 23, 2017         Trump's tweet and others he sent targeting the No. 2 FBI       official amid the federal Russia probe came after it was       revealed McCabe would be retiring from his post in the coming       months.        Trump interviewed McCabe to be FBI director in May after he       fired James Comey from the top post. The president ultimately       tapped Christopher Wray for the bureau's top spot.                                   ____                   [From the New York Times, Jan. 2, 2018]                    The Republicans' Fake Investigations                  (By Glenn R. Simpson and Peter Fritsch)         A generation ago, Republicans sought to protect President       Richard Nixon by urging the Senate Watergate committee to       look at supposed wrongdoing by Democrats in previous       elections. The committee chairman, Sam Ervin, a Democrat,       said that would be ``as foolish as the man who went bear       hunting and stopped to chase rabbits.''        Today, amid a growing criminal inquiry into Russian       meddling in the 2016 election, congressional Republicans are       again chasing rabbits. We know because we're their favorite       quarry.        In the year since the publication of the so-called Steele       dossier--the collection of intelligence reports we       commissioned about Donald Trump's ties to Russia--the       president  [[Page S98]]       has repeatedly attacked us on Twitter. His allies in Congress       have dug through our bank records and sought to tarnish our       firm to punish us for highlighting his links to Russia.       Conservative news outlets and even our former employer, The       Wall Street Journal, have spun a succession of mendacious       conspiracy theories about our motives and backers.        We are happy to correct the record. In fact, we already       have.        Three congressional committees have heard over 21 hours of       testimony from our firm, Fusion GPS. In those sessions, we       toppled the far right's conspiracy theories and explained how       The Washington Free Beacon and the Clinton campaign--the       Republican and Democratic funders of our Trump research--      separately came to hire us in the first place.        We walked investigators through our yearlong effort to       decipher Mr. Trump's complex business past, of which the       Steele dossier is but one chapter. And we handed over our       relevant bank records--while drawing the line at a fishing       expedition for the records of companies we work for that have       nothing to do with the Trump case.        Republicans have refused to release full transcripts of our       firm's testimony, even as they selectively leak details to       media outlets on the far right. It's time to share what our       company told investigators.        We don't believe the Steele dossier was the trigger for the       F.B.I.'s investigation into Russian meddling. As we told the       Senate Judiciary Committee in August, our sources said the       dossier was taken so seriously because it corroborated       reports the bureau had received from other sources, including       one inside the Trump camp.        The intelligence committees have known for months that       credible allegations of collusion between the Trump camp and       Russia were pouring in from independent sources during the       campaign. Yet lawmakers in the thrall of the president       continue to wage a cynical campaign to portray us as the       unwitting victims of Kremlin disinformation.        We suggested investigators look into the bank records of       Deutsche Bank and others that were funding Mr. Trump's       businesses. Congress appears uninterested in that tip:       Reportedly, ours are the only bank records the House       Intelligence Committee has subpoenaed.        We told Congress that from Manhattan to Sunny Isles Beach,       Fla., and from Toronto to Panama, we found widespread       evidence that Mr. Trump and his organization had worked with       a wide array of dubious Russians in arrangements that often       raised questions about money laundering. Likewise, those       deals don't seem to interest Congress.        We explained how, from our past journalistic work in       Europe, we were deeply familiar with the political operative       Paul Manafort's coziness with Moscow and his financial ties       to Russian oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin.        Finally, we debunked the biggest canard being pushed by the       president's men--the notion that we somehow knew of the June       9, 2016, meeting in Trump Tower between some Russians and the       Trump brain trust. We first learned of that meeting from news       reports last year--and the committees know it. They also know       that these Russians were unaware of the former British       intelligence officer Christopher Steele's work for us and       were not sources for his reports.        Yes, we hired Mr. Steele, a highly respected Russia expert.       But we did so without informing him whom we were working for       and gave him no specific marching orders beyond this basic       question: Why did Mr. Trump repeatedly seek to do deals in a       notoriously corrupt police state that most serious investors       shun?        What came back shocked us. Mr. Steele's sources in Russia       (who were not paid) reported on an extensive--and now       confirmed--effort by the Kremlin to help elect Mr. Trump       president. Mr. Steele saw this as a crime in progress and       decided he needed to report it to the F.B.I.        We did not discuss that decision with our clients, or       anyone else. Instead, we deferred to Mr. Steele, a trusted       friend and intelligence professional with a long history of       working with law enforcement. We did not speak to the F.B.I.       and haven't since.        After the election, Mr. Steele decided to share his       intelligence with Senator John McCain via an emissary. We       helped him do that. The goal was to alert the United States       national security community to an attack on our country by a       hostile foreign power. We did not, however, share the dossier       with BuzzFeed, which to our dismay published it last January.        We're extremely proud of our work to highlight Mr. Trump's       Russia ties. To have done so is our right under the First       Amendment.        In is time to stop chasing rabbits. The public still has       much to learn about a man with the most troubling business       past of any United States president. Congress should release       transcripts of our firm's testimony, so that the American       people can learn the truth about our work and most important,       what happened to our democracy.     I now yield, per the pending agreement, to my  distinguished friend from Connecticut.
