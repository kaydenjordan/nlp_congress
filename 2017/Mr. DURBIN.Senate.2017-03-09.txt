It was interesting when he said the courtesies that were extended to  President Clinton and President Obama when it came to Supreme Court  nominees; he left out 1 year--last year.   Last year, when there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court when Antonin  Scalia passed away and President Obama sent the nomination of Merrick  Garland to the floor of the Senate, it was refused by the Republican  leader to even give him a hearing, let alone a vote. So there was an  omission in his call for courtesy when it comes to Nominee Gorsuch, a  very grievous omission from the point of American history.   For the first time in the history of the U.S. Senate--for the first  time--Republican leaders in the Senate refused to give a hearing and a  vote to a Supreme Court nominee sent by President Obama. Many of us  came to this floor pleading that we follow tradition and the  Constitution. I am going to stand by that. Even though I think Merrick  Garland was treated poorly by the Republican majority, I believe that  Neil Gorsuch is entitled to a hearing and a vote. I made that argument  before; I will make it again.                          Republican Healthcare Bill    Mr. President, the second point I want to make, and very briefly, is  that we now have seen the Affordable Care Act repeal that has been  brought forward by the Republicans in the House. We still do not know  its fiscal impact. The Congressional Budget Office, which traditionally  scores legislation, tells us the impact it will have both on the  deficit as well as on the American economy. In this case, we believe we  will learn as early as next week what that impact will be. There are  several things we know for certain. The Republican approach to changing  the Affordable Care Act is going to reduce health insurance coverage in  America, and it is going to raise the cost.    The cost, incidentally, will be especially hurtful to those over the  age of 55. If you are a senior citizen or over the age of 55, this  Republican bill says that your health insurance premiums can be  substantially increased. There is a limit in the current law that you  can't have a disparity of more than 3 to 1 in premiums between people  of different age groups. That is changed by the Republican bill to say  that older people can be charged up to five times  [[Page S1705]]  the premiums that are being paid by those in younger groups. That is  substantial.   Secondly, it is painful and hurtful to Medicare. Don't take my word  for it; the American Association of Retired Persons has come out  against the Republican healthcare plan, saying that it is going to  reduce the number of years of solvency for the Medicare trust fund.  That is not a positive thing; it is a negative thing for the tens of  millions of Americans who count on Medicare.   We also know that when it comes to this bill, there are provisions in  here which are inconsistent with our goal to increase coverage across  America. My Republican Governor in Illinois, who has been very careful  to be critical of Republicans in Washington, came out this week and  said that the elimination of Medicaid coverage and reduction in  Medicaid coverage would create a budget hardship in our State.   I might add that it will be a hardship on the thousands of people in  Illinois who rely on Medicaid to provide for their medical expenses.  That includes not only the children and mothers in lower income groups  but, substantially, seniors who are in nursing homes who have no place  to turn. They are living on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  That is how they survive. Reducing the Medicaid coverage is a danger to  them when it comes to continuing on in a safe and healthy environment.   In addition to that, we know that Medicaid for many low-income  Illinoisans and low-income Americans is the only health insurance they  have. Many who work hard every day don't make enough money to buy  health insurance, and their employer doesn't provide it. Medicaid came  to their rescue under the Affordable Care Act, and it is going to be  severely restricted. That is why my Republican Governor has come out  against this Republican healthcare bill, and many others feel the same.   When we take a look at this bill when it comes over here--first, I  plead with my colleagues, don't rush it through. Let's take the time to  look at it carefully. It will affect the healthcare of millions of  Americans. Second, let's hold to the standard that whatever changes we  make will provide more healthcare protection in America and make a  serious effort at reducing cost. We can only do that if we have the  time to honestly debate it on a bipartisan basis.   Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Missouri for giving me this  opportunity.   I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.                           American Health Care Act     Mr. President, today I come to the floor in opposition to  the resolution to repeal regulations that help States and districts  implement important provisions of the Every Student Succeeds Act.   In the last Congress, Members of Congress did what seems nearly  unimaginable today. We passed a bipartisan bill, the Every Student  Succeeds Act, or ESSA, to fix No Child Left Behind. After 14 years,  Democrats and Republicans in both Chambers came together on compromise  legislation to reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act (ESEA). It gave States and districts flexibility to  develop their own plans for holding schools accountable and encouraging  improvements. At the same time, it included important Federal  guardrails--including through regulatory authority--to fulfill the  civil rights legacy of the original ESEA, ensuring that all students  have equal access to high-quality public education.   Today, we should be focusing on the implementation of ESSA and  providing critical resources to students, teachers, and schools. But,  instead, we are on the Senate floor debating a Congressional Review Act  resolution of disapproval that would gut the regulations that help  maintain the important balance that ESSA strikes between local control  and making sure that States are held accountable for educating our  students.   After listening to teachers, parents, principals, and  superintendents, the Obama Administration issued the final  accountability regulation last November. Among other things, this  regulation provides important information to help States draft their  State plans and develop accountability systems to determine whether  children are actually learning. It gives more flexibility to States to  develop academic standards, to measure student achievement, and to  determine intervention strategies when subgroups of students are  consistently underperforming. It also lays out how States should comply  with important provisions of the law, including identifying low- performing schools for improvement.   Eliminating this regulation would roll back the Federal role in  education that has been in place for more than 50 years. In 1965, when  President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act, it created an extraordinary opportunity for our Nation  to make an even deeper commitment to civil rights. It ensured that all  children, regardless of their ZIP Code, background, disability, or  family wealth, would have a right to a quality education. Repealing  this regulation would overturn 52 years of progress. We should be  committing ourselves to advancing equity in education, but instead  Republicans are using a political tool--the Congressional Review Act-- to remove important Federal protections for students. I believe it is a  betrayal of the bipartisan framework that underpins ESSA.   Striking this rule could also send States into chaos. Many States,  including my home State of Illinois, have prepared their State plans to  align with this regulation. Without the guidance and clarity that this  regulation provides, states will not have the support they need to  successfully implement ESSA. It could ultimately lead to greater  liability for States and districts that are responsible for complying  with the law but are left to interpret how to implement the law for  themselves. If this partisan CRA effort is successful, the Education  Department will not be able to promulgate new rules related to these  issues. Instead of policy that is subject to the public scrutiny and  review of the formal Federal rulemaking process, repealing this rule  gives incredible latitude to an administration that wants to dismantle  public education.   When I voted for ESSA, it was with the understanding that the law  allowed the Secretary of Education to promulgate rules to implement the  bill's accountability provisions. Gutting these regulations swings the  pendulum way too far in the direction of local control. Giving States  more control with a blank check from the Federal Government is not  responsible Federal policy. We should maintain critical Federal  guardrails to hold States accountable for educating our children. We  should uphold our vital role in protecting the civil rights of all  children. Anything less says to our children that they don't matter. I  urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this resolution.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, one of the most significant bipartisan  accomplishments of the last Congress was the Every Student Succeeds  Act, the long-overdue reauthorization of K-12 education law. The Every  Student Succeeds Act returned more flexibility to States while ensuring  accountability to ensure that every child gets a quality education.   Today, however, the majority has brought before the Senate a measure  that would take a step backward. This Congressional Review Act  resolution would repeal Department of Education regulations that the  Department put in place to give States and school districts clarity  about their responsibilities under the law and guidance to ensure that  students receive their guaranteed civil rights protections. The  regulations resulted from of a year of stakeholder feedback. States are  already using this guidance to write their State plans.   If we pass this resolution today, we would pull the rug out from  under the very local stakeholders that we promised to empower with the  Every Student Succeeds Act. Passing this resolution would disrupt their  planning process and interfere with their operations. This resolution  would also hurt our most vulnerable students by weakening  accountability and protections for students with disabilities and  students of color.   As the National Disability Rights Center has said, ``To rescind these  regulations would not only be a disservice to the spirit of ESSA and  diminish the efficacy of the law, but would also serve to undermine the  equity of educational opportunity for all students, including students  with disabilities.''   The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights concurred,  arguing: ``The underlying accountability and state plan regulation will  help states, districts, and schools to faithfully implement the law and  meet their legal obligations to historically marginalized groups of  students. . . .''   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also opposes repealing this regulation,  saying: ``Just as we believe the Every Student Succeeds Act  incorporates our principles, we believe the [accountability]  regulations do as well. And they provide states with the clarity they  need to move forward.''   The Every Student Succeeds Act was the result of years of painstaking  work and bipartisan compromise. The implementing regulation was the  product of stakeholder input. We should not undermine that important  progress and throw our education system into chaos with this  resolution. I urge a ``no'' vote.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.                      Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare     Mr President, I am proud to introduce the Fairness in  Federal Disaster Declarations Act today, together with my colleague  Senator Duckworth, to try to bring some transparency and fairness into  FEMA's disaster declaration process.   The inspiration for this bill was a tragic one. On February 29, 2012,  a category F-4 tornado tore through southeastern Illinois, causing  major damage in the towns of Harrisburg and Ridgway. Eight people in  Harrisburg died in that event and 15 people were killed in total. Winds  reached 175 miles per hour. It is not too much of a stretch to say  these two small towns were almost wiped off the map.   And just last week, on February 28, 2017, another tragedy struck the  small towns of Ottawa and Naplate after a category F-3 tornado tore  through North Central Illinois. Two people in Ottawa died in last  week's storm and at least 50 homes were damaged or destroyed.   Requests for Federal assistance after a disaster are made by the  Governor of each State based on State emergency management damage  assessments. In the case of the Harrisburg and Ridgway tornado, the  Governor's request for a Federal emergency declaration for individual  assistance was denied, as was the State's appeal of that decision. With  that denial, individuals whose homes or properties were damaged were  precluded from direct Federal help.   When I asked FEMA why it denied the Governor's request, I was told  that the disaster did not meet or exceed the State's per capita figure.  Currently, FEMA multiplies the number of people in a State by $1.43 to  determine a threshold of the amount of damage a State would incur to be  considered for Federal assistance. In Illinois, that figure is more  than $18 million. In other words, because Illinois is a highly populous  State, it is presumed it can absorb the costs of cleanup and recovery  from disasters up to more than $18 million.   From 2002 to 2012, Illinois was denied Federal disaster assistance  seven times. Texas was denied 13 times. Florida was denied Federal  disaster assistance eight times during that period, and California, New  Jersey, and New York were each denied four times.   FEMA's formula does not work for large, populous States, particularly  those with a concentrated urban area, like Illinois.   Illinois ran into this issue again in November 2013 when tornadoes  swept through the State. That time, six people were killed and whole  neighborhoods were nearly destroyed. The cities of Washington, Gifford,  and New Minden, Illinois, experienced some of the worst tornado damage  I have ever seen. Their infrastructure was decimated, but because  Illinois did not meet one of FEMA's criteria, we were denied Federal  public assistance.   In the case of last week's tornado in Ottawa and Naplate, Illinois,  may not even be able to request federal help because damage assessments  are too low to reach anything close to FEMA's per capita requirement.  But for these small towns, covering losses and cleaning up damage of  this magnitude can put a real strain on the community.   The Fairness in Federal Disaster Declaration seeks to improve the  disaster analysis by assigning a value to each of the factors FEMA must  consider when determining whether Federal disaster assistance will be  made available. When it comes to individual assistance--funding to help  people repair and rebuild their homes--the breakdown would be as  follows:   Concentration of damages--the density of damage in an individual  community--would be considered 20 percent of the analysis. Trauma--the  loss of life and injuries and the disruption of normal community  functions--would be 20 percent. Special Populations--including the age  and income of the residents, the amount of home ownership, etc.--would  comprise 20 percent. Voluntary agency assistance--a consideration of  what the volunteer and charitable groups are providing--would make up 5  percent. The amount of Insurance coverage--20 percent. And average  amount of individual assistance by State, which includes the per capita  analysis, would make up 5 percent of the analysis.   The bill also would add a seventh consideration to FEMA's metrics-- the economics of the area, which will receive 10 percent consideration.  This includes factors such as the local assessable tax base, the median  income as it compares to that of the State, and the poverty rate as it  compares to that of the State.   For Federal public assistance, the breakdown would be similar, with a  greater emphasis placed on the localized impacts of the disaster, which  would warrant 40 percent of the analysis.   It is reasonable that FEMA should take into consideration the size of  the State requesting assistance, but current regulations penalize large  States. Assigning values to the factors will help ensure that the  damage to a specific community weighs more than a State's population.   Illinois is a geographically large State with a concentrated urban  area. And downstate communities are being punished for it.   If the cities of Ottawa and Naplate, Washington and Gifford, and  Harrisburg and Ridgway cannot qualify under FEMA's current criteria for  Federal assistance, something is wrong. The way FEMA evaluates whether  to declare an area Federal disaster is not effective. It is working  against small communities in States with large populations.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 600         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure that significantly more students graduate  college with the international knowledge and experience essential for  success in today's global economy through the establishment of the  Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program in the Department of Education;  to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, today, Senator Wicker of Mississippi and I  are reintroducing the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act. This  bill, named for a mentor of mine--the late Senator from Illinois,  embodies a vision Paul Simon believed in throughout his life: a vision  centered on our country's need for a culturally aware, and globally  knowledgeable population and workforce.   Senator Simon saw these characteristics as essential to our country's  economy, society, and national security. He believed that by building  meaningful relationships with people around the world, America would  grow even stronger as a nation. In his words, ``America's incompetence  in foreign languages and cultural awareness jeopardizes our Nation's  future in global affairs. This lack of global perspective damages  America's ability to compete in world markets. The more our country  becomes competent in foreign languages and cultures, the more enhanced  our foreign policy decisions will become.''   He also believed that to truly be educated, our students needed more  than a minimal understanding of the world around them. To be truly  educated, they need to immerse themselves in the beliefs, customs,  language, and environment of a culture other than their own. I share  these beliefs with Senator Simon and many Republicans in this Chamber  share them as well.   At a time when there are calls from some to shut out immigrants and  refugees and pull away from other parts of the world, these beliefs are  more important than ever. We need to continue to give our young people  the opportunity to interact with people from all over the world, so  they can develop their own informed opinions and beliefs.   Undergraduate study abroad programs are a popular source for this  type of engagement. Unfortunately, far too few students take advantage  or have the means to take advantage of this opportunity. Annually, less  than 2 percent of undergraduate students participate in study abroad.   Those who do study abroad don't reflect the incredible diversity of  our postsecondary institutions. Minority students, first-generation  college students, community college students, and students with  disabilities are significantly underrepresented in the study abroad  population. These students miss out on the valuable personal and  educational growth that comes from a study abroad experience, including  interacting with other cultures, developing foreign language skills,  and expanding international knowledge through firsthand experience.   We also know that those who currently study abroad do so mostly in  highly developed countries. In fact, over 50 percent of students who  study abroad each year do so in Europe. Increasing the diversity of  study abroad destinations to include countries in Asia, the Middle  East, Africa, South America, and Latin America will help American  students develop a global perspective and build the insight and skills  needed to better understand the global challenges of the 21st century.   In 2004, Congress took the first step towards expanding study abroad  when it authorized the Commission on Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad  Fellowship Program to provide recommendations to Congress and the  President on expanding study abroad programs.   The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act combines the vision  of Senator Simon with the recommendations of the Abraham Lincoln Study  Abroad Commission. It establishes a competitive grant program for  institutions of higher education to encourage the sustainable expansion  of study abroad opportunities for students in the United States.   Over the next 10 years, this grant program aims to increase the  number of undergraduate students stud g abroad each year to one million  students. It also emphasizes increasing opportunities for  nontraditional students, minority students, and students with  disabilities so that the demographics of students who study abroad more  closely reflect the population of current undergraduate students.   This bill also focuses on getting students to study abroad in  nontraditional destinations particularly in developing countries. We  need to send more students to developing nations because these are the  places that America needs to better understand. This legislation takes  important steps toward expanding and diversifying participation in  study abroad.   Senator Wicker and I are pleased to be joined today in introducing  this bill by Senators Reed, Cochran, Merkley, and Brown. I am also  pleased that several organizations have endorsed this bill including  the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, the Association  of International Educators, the American Council on Education, the  Association of American Universities, and the Hispanic Association of  Colleges and Universities.   In today's increasingly interconnected world, study abroad  participation is an important element of a meaningful undergraduate  education. Expanded access to study abroad opportunities is necessary  to prepare the next generation of Americans with the global knowledge  and skills needed to succeed. I hope other colleagues will join us in  that effort.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 601         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study       Abroad Program Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) To prepare students for success in the modern global       economy, opportunities for study abroad should be included as       part of a well-rounded education.        (2) Study abroad programs provide students with       unparalleled access to international knowledge, an unmatched       opportunity to learn foreign languages, and a unique       environment for developing cultural understanding, all of       which are knowledge and skills needed in today's global       economy.        (3) Less than 2 percent of all enrolled postsecondary       students in the United States study abroad for credit in any       given year, and minority students, first generation college       students, community college students, and students with       disabilities are significantly underrepresented in study       abroad participation.        (4) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission       on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program       pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations       and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199).       Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted to       Congress and the President a report of its recommendations       for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at       institutions of higher education in the United States to       study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing       nations.        (5) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[e]xperience       shows that leadership from administrators and faculty will       drive the number of study abroad participants higher and       improve the quality of programs. Such leadership is the only       way that study abroad will become an integral part of the       undergraduate experience.''. A competitive grant program is       necessary to encourage and support such leadership.       SEC. 3. PURPOSES.         The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to ensure that significantly more students have access       to quality study abroad opportunities;        (2) to ensure that the diversity of students studying       abroad reflects the diversity of students and institutions of       higher education in the United States;        (3) to encourage greater diversity in study abroad       destinations by increasing the portion of study abroad that       takes place in nontraditional study abroad destinations,       especially in developing countries; and        (4) to encourage a greater commitment by institutions of       higher education to expand study abroad opportunities.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include  automated fire sprinkler system retrofits as section 179 property and  classify certain automated fire sprinkler system retrofits as 15-year  property for purposes of depreciation; to the Committee on Finance.    Mr President, I am proud to introduce the Fairness in  Federal Disaster Declarations Act today, together with my colleague  Senator Duckworth, to try to bring some transparency and fairness into  FEMA's disaster declaration process.   The inspiration for this bill was a tragic one. On February 29, 2012,  a category F-4 tornado tore through southeastern Illinois, causing  major damage in the towns of Harrisburg and Ridgway. Eight people in  Harrisburg died in that event and 15 people were killed in total. Winds  reached 175 miles per hour. It is not too much of a stretch to say  these two small towns were almost wiped off the map.   And just last week, on February 28, 2017, another tragedy struck the  small towns of Ottawa and Naplate after a category F-3 tornado tore  through North Central Illinois. Two people in Ottawa died in last  week's storm and at least 50 homes were damaged or destroyed.   Requests for Federal assistance after a disaster are made by the  Governor of each State based on State emergency management damage  assessments. In the case of the Harrisburg and Ridgway tornado, the  Governor's request for a Federal emergency declaration for individual  assistance was denied, as was the State's appeal of that decision. With  that denial, individuals whose homes or properties were damaged were  precluded from direct Federal help.   When I asked FEMA why it denied the Governor's request, I was told  that the disaster did not meet or exceed the State's per capita figure.  Currently, FEMA multiplies the number of people in a State by $1.43 to  determine a threshold of the amount of damage a State would incur to be  considered for Federal assistance. In Illinois, that figure is more  than $18 million. In other words, because Illinois is a highly populous  State, it is presumed it can absorb the costs of cleanup and recovery  from disasters up to more than $18 million.   From 2002 to 2012, Illinois was denied Federal disaster assistance  seven times. Texas was denied 13 times. Florida was denied Federal  disaster assistance eight times during that period, and California, New  Jersey, and New York were each denied four times.   FEMA's formula does not work for large, populous States, particularly  those with a concentrated urban area, like Illinois.   Illinois ran into this issue again in November 2013 when tornadoes  swept through the State. That time, six people were killed and whole  neighborhoods were nearly destroyed. The cities of Washington, Gifford,  and New Minden, Illinois, experienced some of the worst tornado damage  I have ever seen. Their infrastructure was decimated, but because  Illinois did not meet one of FEMA's criteria, we were denied Federal  public assistance.   In the case of last week's tornado in Ottawa and Naplate, Illinois,  may not even be able to request federal help because damage assessments  are too low to reach anything close to FEMA's per capita requirement.  But for these small towns, covering losses and cleaning up damage of  this magnitude can put a real strain on the community.   The Fairness in Federal Disaster Declaration seeks to improve the  disaster analysis by assigning a value to each of the factors FEMA must  consider when determining whether Federal disaster assistance will be  made available. When it comes to individual assistance--funding to help  people repair and rebuild their homes--the breakdown would be as  follows:   Concentration of damages--the density of damage in an individual  community--would be considered 20 percent of the analysis. Trauma--the  loss of life and injuries and the disruption of normal community  functions--would be 20 percent. Special Populations--including the age  and income of the residents, the amount of home ownership, etc.--would  comprise 20 percent. Voluntary agency assistance--a consideration of  what the volunteer and charitable groups are providing--would make up 5  percent. The amount of Insurance coverage--20 percent. And average  amount of individual assistance by State, which includes the per capita  analysis, would make up 5 percent of the analysis.   The bill also would add a seventh consideration to FEMA's metrics-- the economics of the area, which will receive 10 percent consideration.  This includes factors such as the local assessable tax base, the median  income as it compares to that of the State, and the poverty rate as it  compares to that of the State.   For Federal public assistance, the breakdown would be similar, with a  greater emphasis placed on the localized impacts of the disaster, which  would warrant 40 percent of the analysis.   It is reasonable that FEMA should take into consideration the size of  the State requesting assistance, but current regulations penalize large  States. Assigning values to the factors will help ensure that the  damage to a specific community weighs more than a State's population.   Illinois is a geographically large State with a concentrated urban  area. And downstate communities are being punished for it.   If the cities of Ottawa and Naplate, Washington and Gifford, and  Harrisburg and Ridgway cannot qualify under FEMA's current criteria for  Federal assistance, something is wrong. The way FEMA evaluates whether  to declare an area Federal disaster is not effective. It is working  against small communities in States with large populations.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 600         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(c) Effective Date.--The amended rules issued under       subsection (a) shall apply to  [[Page S1747]]       any disaster for which a Governor requested a major disaster       declaration under the Robert T.

This  bill, named for a mentor of mine--the late Senator from Illinois,  embodies a vision Paul Simon believed in throughout his life: a vision  centered on our country's need for a culturally aware, and globally  knowledgeable population and workforce.   Senator Simon saw these characteristics as essential to our country's  economy, society, and national security. He believed that by building  meaningful relationships with people around the world, America would  grow even stronger as a nation. In his words, ``America's incompetence  in foreign languages and cultural awareness jeopardizes our Nation's  future in global affairs. This lack of global perspective damages  America's ability to compete in world markets. The more our country  becomes competent in foreign languages and cultures, the more enhanced  our foreign policy decisions will become.''   He also believed that to truly be educated, our students needed more  than a minimal understanding of the world around them. To be truly  educated, they need to immerse themselves in the beliefs, customs,  language, and environment of a culture other than their own. I share  these beliefs with Senator Simon and many Republicans in this Chamber  share them as well.   At a time when there are calls from some to shut out immigrants and  refugees and pull away from other parts of the world, these beliefs are  more important than ever. We need to continue to give our young people  the opportunity to interact with people from all over the world, so  they can develop their own informed opinions and beliefs.   Undergraduate study abroad programs are a popular source for this  type of engagement. Unfortunately, far too few students take advantage  or have the means to take advantage of this opportunity. Annually, less  than 2 percent of undergraduate students participate in study abroad.   Those who do study abroad don't reflect the incredible diversity of  our postsecondary institutions. Minority students, first-generation  college students, community college students, and students with  disabilities are significantly underrepresented in the study abroad  population. These students miss out on the valuable personal and  educational growth that comes from a study abroad experience, including  interacting with other cultures, developing foreign language skills,  and expanding international knowledge through firsthand experience.   We also know that those who currently study abroad do so mostly in  highly developed countries. In fact, over 50 percent of students who  study abroad each year do so in Europe. Increasing the diversity of  study abroad destinations to include countries in Asia, the Middle  East, Africa, South America, and Latin America will help American  students develop a global perspective and build the insight and skills  needed to better understand the global challenges of the 21st century.   In 2004, Congress took the first step towards expanding study abroad  when it authorized the Commission on Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad  Fellowship Program to provide recommendations to Congress and the  President on expanding study abroad programs.   The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act combines the vision  of Senator Simon with the recommendations of the Abraham Lincoln Study  Abroad Commission. It establishes a competitive grant program for  institutions of higher education to encourage the sustainable expansion  of study abroad opportunities for students in the United States.   Over the next 10 years, this grant program aims to increase the  number of undergraduate students stud g abroad each year to one million  students. It also emphasizes increasing opportunities for  nontraditional students, minority students, and students with  disabilities so that the demographics of students who study abroad more  closely reflect the population of current undergraduate students.   This bill also focuses on getting students to study abroad in  nontraditional destinations particularly in developing countries. We  need to send more students to developing nations because these are the  places that America needs to better understand. This legislation takes  important steps toward expanding and diversifying participation in  study abroad.   Senator Wicker and I are pleased to be joined today in introducing  this bill by Senators Reed, Cochran, Merkley, and Brown. I am also  pleased that several organizations have endorsed this bill including  the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, the Association  of International Educators, the American Council on Education, the  Association of American Universities, and the Hispanic Association of  Colleges and Universities.   In today's increasingly interconnected world, study abroad  participation is an important element of a meaningful undergraduate  education. Expanded access to study abroad opportunities is necessary  to prepare the next generation of Americans with the global knowledge  and skills needed to succeed. I hope other colleagues will join us in  that effort.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 601         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study       Abroad Program Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) To prepare students for success in the modern global       economy, opportunities for study abroad should be included as       part of a well-rounded education.        (2) Study abroad programs provide students with       unparalleled access to international knowledge, an unmatched       opportunity to learn foreign languages, and a unique       environment for developing cultural understanding, all of       which are knowledge and skills needed in today's global       economy.        (3) Less than 2 percent of all enrolled postsecondary       students in the United States study abroad for credit in any       given year, and minority students, first generation college       students, community college students, and students with       disabilities are significantly underrepresented in study       abroad participation.        (4) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission       on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program       pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations       and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199).       Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted to       Congress and the President a report of its recommendations       for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at       institutions of higher education in the United States to       study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing       nations.        (5) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[e]xperience       shows that leadership from administrators and faculty will       drive the number of study abroad participants higher and       improve the quality of programs. Such leadership is the only       way that study abroad will become an integral part of the       undergraduate experience.''. A competitive grant program is       necessary to encourage and support such leadership.       SEC. 3. PURPOSES.         The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to ensure that significantly more students have access       to quality study abroad opportunities;        (2) to ensure that the diversity of students studying       abroad reflects the diversity of students and institutions of       higher education in the United States;        (3) to encourage greater diversity in study abroad       destinations by increasing the portion of study abroad that       takes place in nontraditional study abroad destinations,       especially in developing countries; and        (4) to encourage a greater commitment by institutions of       higher education to expand study abroad opportunities.
