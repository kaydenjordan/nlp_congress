 Madam Speaker, Halloween is 9 days away. It is a holiday  that happens in the dark. It is about fear, deceit, and witch hunts-- anything to hide who you truly are.   Back home, Texans are stunned. How can the majority party of the  House use a kids' holiday, Halloween, as a model for the most dramatic  action Congress can take: impeaching a sitting President? The ghouls  and goblins of the House majority are now the Halloween party and make  up this process as they go along.   Impeachment demands an inquiry vote by the full House, a full vote by  the full House. The Democrat majority did that with Richard Nixon in  the 1970s, and the Republican majority did that with Bill Clinton in  the 1990s.   The House Halloween party allowed 41 Members of this body of 435 to  go forward with impeachment. This party is following the Wizard of Oz.  If they pursue this witch hunt, the House will fall down on November  2020. The witch hunt will be over.                            ____________________
