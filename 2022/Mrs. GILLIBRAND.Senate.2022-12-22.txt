 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of my  amendment, the 9/11 Responder and Survivor Health Funding Correction  Act. This amendment is a bipartisan compromise that we have worked out  to make sure there is not a shortfall in funding for this health  program.   This health program was stood up about 10 years ago, and we created a  formula that was based on inflation. Unfortunately, the rate of  inflation for healthcare has been higher. This is something that was  unanimously agreed on from its inception, and I really hope you can  support this.   As you know, our 9/11 first responders have been suffering from lung  cancer and different kinds of pulmonary diseases and respiratory  diseases, and this healthcare is lifesaving. If they have to worry that  the money is not there for their cancer treatments, it just creates  more anxiety and PTSD for these individuals.   It is really important that we fully fund this program. This funding  will  [[Page S10074]]  allow for the next 5 years to be covered. It is not everything we need,  but it is enough to get us started.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.    Mr. President, to clarify the record, it was not an  unlimited amount of money appropriated; it was an authorization. This  is the money--   --to pay for the shortfall, and--   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time--   --it is fully paid for.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time has elapsed.                   Vote on Amendment No. 6607, As Modified
