 Madam Speaker, I rise today regarding the ongoing threat  posed by COVID-19.   After 22 months of this pandemic, we cannot be complacent. In order  to prevent further spread of the virus, either someone has to die,  which I don't consider a very good alternative, or everybody else who  isn't vaccinated ought to get their vaccines. By doing so, you prevent  more suffering and death.   In Ohio, COVID-19 is ripping across the State. Our emergency rooms  are full of patients, and our ICU staffs are overworked. Ninety-five  percent of COVID hospitalizations are among unvaccinated individuals-- 95 percent. This is costing our healthcare system billions of dollars  and wear and tear on all of our medical professionals.   However, only 61 percent of Ohio residents have received their first  dose. That means the majority aren't pulling with the crew.   I urge all of us to think about the safety of our family, our  friends, and our neighbors and do what we must to assist the well-being  of those who are working overtime now for almost 2 years in our  healthcare facilities. They are serving on the front lines.   We all have a duty to be patriotic, and that means saving lives, not  taking them, and making sure that you get your vaccine.                            ____________________
