 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the efforts of  countless volunteers and public servants across north Texas who helped  ease the burden of last week's tornadoes.   When natural disaster strikes, families suffer. It takes a strong  community to bring hope out of the wreckage.   Communities with solid foundations do more than just rebuild homes,  businesses, and schools. They help relieve heartache that follows  catastrophic loss.   Countless faith-based and nonprofit organizations, including the  Network of Community Ministries, the American Red Cross of North Texas,  and Texas Baptist Men, have risen to meet the needs of our community.  Alongside partners such as Atmos Energy and Oncor Electric, they have  started the arduous process of rebuilding our communities.   Likewise, city leaders, like those in Richardson and Dallas, have  banded together to show support and provide valuable resources, proving  once more that we are always stronger together.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to  join me in thanking volunteers and leaders throughout our region, not  only for helping to bring relief to those who have been displaced from  their homes and schools, but also for providing hope.                            ____________________
