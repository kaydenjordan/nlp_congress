 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida's 26th  District for yielding.   On the heels of a global pandemic, which crippled small businesses  and hurt workers, President Biden has offered a budget that doesn't  address the problems that we so desperately confront as Americans.   There is not any additional funding for border security at a time  right now when our border is in crisis, despite the fact that this  budget has the highest sustained tax burden and is the largest budget  ever in the history of this country. It is the largest budget to ever  be before this body.   The prescription in that budget is exactly the opposite of where we  need to be going. As our economy comes out of the fits and starts of  recovering from COVID, this threatens to overheat even further our  economy.   We know our economy is overheated. Let me give you a couple of  examples.   Since May 2020, home prices have increased by almost 13 percent. Used  car and truck prices are up over 20 percent. Lumber prices are up over  300 percent. Cold rolled steel has gone from $630 a ton to $1,450 a  ton.    Our economy is overheated. The last thing we need is the massive $55  trillion of taxes and spending that is in the budget today in front of  this body. You heard me correctly, Mr. Speaker, $55 trillion directly  from the pockets of Americans who are already struggling to pay these  higher gas prices and to pay for higher prices for groceries. This is  all a result of President Biden's misguided fiscal policies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Democrat colleagues to please reconsider your  support for Biden's broken budgeting methods. In the great State of  Texas, small businesses and families live within their means. We must  do the same.
