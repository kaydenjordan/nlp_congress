 Mr. Speaker, in July of 1969, Neil Armstrong, Buzz  Aldrin, and Michael Collins achieved something once thought impossible:  successfully landing on the Moon and returning safely to the Earth.   They succeeded despite the many dangers they faced and the countless  things that could have gone wrong during their pioneering 240,000-mile  journey.   As we mark the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11, I take special pride in  representing Neil Armstrong's birthplace, Wapakoneta, Ohio, home of the  Neil Armstrong Air and Space Museum.   The museum has on display many artifacts from the mission and other  [[Page H7095]]  items from Mr. Armstrong's life and career. The museum's yearlong  celebration of the Apollo 11 anniversary culminates this weekend in a  series of events, ranging from meet-and-greets with active and retired  astronauts to the Run to the Moon 5k and 10k races, special exhibits at  the museum, and the grand finale concert.   Mr. Speaker, Neil Armstrong died in 2012 at the age of 82, but the  impact of his journey is still felt today in rural Auglaize County,  Ohio, and throughout the world.   I am pleased to join the people of Wapakoneta in celebrating the man  who took a small step but left a giant legacy.                            ____________________
