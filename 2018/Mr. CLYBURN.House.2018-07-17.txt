 Madam Chair, I rise in support of the Sewell amendment.  This proposal would increase funding for grants from the Historic  Preservation Fund to preserve the sites and tell the stories of the  civil rights movement.   I want to thank my colleague Terri Sewell for her leadership on this  issue, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their  support of this program in the past.   First funded in fiscal year 2016, this program has met a great need  in rural communities across our Nation that are struggling to preserve  and protect their legacies.   Last year, the program funded a $500,000 grant to preserve Trinity  United Methodist Church, which will help secure the church's legacy and  preserve its history for future generations. I was a student at South  Carolina State University in Orangeburg, South Carolina, during this  time, and I know well the role that Trinity played in our meetings and  our rallies, many of them attended by luminaries like Martin Luther  King, Jr., Roy Wilkins, Thurgood Marshall, and many others.   This is but one example of several successful grants in South  Carolina and throughout the Nation. There is much more work to be done  to fully preserve this history.   Madam Chair, I strongly support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment would increase by $2 million  the Historic Preservation Fund to restore and preserve buildings and  sites on the campuses of Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  It is offset by a minor reduction in the administration account for the  Department of the Interior.   Most HBCUs were founded after the Civil War to provide higher  education to African Americans, most of whom were newly freed from  slavery. These institutions continue to serve a vital purpose and have  deep historical connections with African Americans and American  history. Most of them have sites and structures of historical  significance that are in dire need of restoration and preservation.   Early in my tenure in Congress, I worked with my colleagues in the  Congressional Black Caucus and in leadership of this committee and the  Committee on Natural Resources to authorize and appropriate funds to  the GAO to study the breadth of this issue. The GAO identified 712  endangered historic buildings at an approximate cost of restoration of  $755 million.   My amendment today will increase the funding in the bill for this  important program by $2 million, to a total of $7 million, still $3  million below the level authorized by the House-passed bill.   I have seen the transformational power of historic preservation in my  congressional district, where buildings like Ministers' Hall at Claflin  University and Chappelle Auditorium at Allen University were restored  after decades of abandonment to their original glory as iconic  institutions of their communities.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms.  Sewell).  [[Page H6439]]         Madam Chair, may I ask how much time I have left.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the ranking member of the subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I thank Ranking Member McCollum. I thank  the chairman of the subcommittee, Ms. Sewell, and Congresswoman Adams  for their support of this legislation.   As a proud graduate of an HBCU, with a daughter who is an HBCU  graduate, I am very much supportive of restoring and preserving the  tremendous history of these institutions.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
