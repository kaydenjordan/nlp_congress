 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a  constituent and friend, Roger Begin. Roger serves as the Honorary  Consul of France in Providence. In September, the French Government  will award him the Legion of Honor, the country's highest order of  merit, for his long and distinguished career in public service. I  congratulate Roger on earning this recognition and thank him for his  many contributions to civic life in Rhode Island.   As the Honorary Consul of France, Roger is a liaison to the French  Government and helps Rhode Islanders with passports, immigration, and  other government business. Roger previously had a lengthy and  productive career in public service. A son of Woonsocket and graduate  of CCRI and Bryant University, he was elected to the Rhode Island House  of Representatives at the age of 19. After serving several terms, he  went on to win election as Rhode Island's general treasurer and then  Lieutenant Governor.   I served as legal counsel to Governor Bruce Sundlun during tumultuous  years of crisis and reform, while Roger was Lieutenant Governor.  Serving in government in times of crisis is a bonding experience.   Outside of his time in government, Roger has served on the boards of  many mission-driven organizations in our community. From the Meeting  [[Page S5561]]  Street School, to the Rhode Island Historical Society, to the Rhode  Island Hospital Association, there is hardly a comer of the State that  has not been made better by Roger's energy and contributions.   Roger also enjoyed a successful business career in the financial  sector. He is truly a man of many parts. And he is a gregarious,  cheerful good person on top of it all.   I wish Roger all the best as he accepts the French Legion of Honor  and look forward to celebrating with him next month.                            ____________________
