 Madam Speaker, I rise today as Black History Month has  come to a close in order to honor some of the most impactful Black  leaders Central Florida has ever seen.   They blaze trails in my home State, making history by being the first  Black Floridians to graduate from local schools, to serve on local city  councils, run for city commissioner posts, and pass constitutional  amendments.   Camille Evans, Sonya Hill, Dr. LaVon Bracy, Dr. Reverend Randolph  Bracy, Commissioner Mable Butler, Dr. Alzo Reddick, Byron Brooks, Dr.  Bridget Williams, Chester Glover, Denise Diaz, Representative Kamia  Brown, and Barbara Chandler.   Each one of them has dedicated their lives to service in one way,  shape, or form. Because of that, our State, community, and Nation are a  better place.   Today and always, we celebrate their achievements and continue to  honor Black excellence.                            ____________________
