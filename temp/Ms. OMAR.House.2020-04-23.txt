 Madam Speaker, people in my State of Minnesota are hurting,  and I am sure everyone represents a State that is hurting.   It is indefensible for us not to support to replenish the PPP, but it  is also indefensible for us not to focus on replenishing the coffers of  Americans and focus on making sure they are able to support paying  their rent, making sure that our cities and States are not going  bankrupt, and making sure American families are not dying of hunger.
