 Mr. Speaker, today House Republicans and President Trump  will try to keep a political promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act,  despite the plainly obvious and harmful impact this bill would have on  hardworking Americans.   It is really sad that, after 7 years, my friends on the other side of  the aisle still don't have a bill that they are publicizing, that we  can read, that we can carefully analyze. It is sad that we can't work  together on this.   This Republican bill would raise premiums while increasing out-of- pocket costs, forcing Americans to pay more for less coverage, attack  women's health, threaten retirement savings, force those over age 50 to  pay thousands more because of the age tax, and cause 14 million  Americans to lose health insurance next year.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  New York.    Mr. Speaker, In my district alone, 76,700 would lose  coverage, including nearly more than 5,000 children and nearly 18,000  adults with employer-sponsored coverage.   This isn't health reform. It is a political game. Lives are at stake.  I hope we vote ``no'' on this bill.
