 Mr. President, I call up the Coons amendment No. 1955 to  the Schumer amendment No. 1958.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:   [[Page S932]]              The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for Mr. Coons,       proposes an amendment numbered 1955 to amendment No. 1958.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading  of the amendment be dispensed with.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.   (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, February 13,  2018, under ``Text of Amendments.'')                      Recognition of the Minority Leader    The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is  recognized.    Mr. President, this is immigration week in the U.S.  Senate, and we are preparing today's procedural moves to bring bills to  the floor for consideration as early as today, perhaps tomorrow at the  latest. It is an unusual time when the Senate is focused on such an  issue and actual bipartisan amendments and substitutes are being  offered.   We are at this point at this moment in time because of a decision by  President Trump on September 5 of last year when he announced he was  ending the DACA Program. DACA was a program created by President Obama  by Executive order, which allowed those who had been brought to the  United States as children, infants, and toddlers to be able to stay  legally in the United States on a temporary visa renewable every 2  years. It was called DACA, and 780,000 young people stepped up and paid  the filing fee of almost $500, went through a criminal background check  and an interview and received DACA protection. They then went on with  their lives, with 90 percent of them going to work or to school,  enlisting in the military--undocumented in America, willing to hold up  their hands and take an oath that they would die for America. That is  how much they love this country. Twenty thousand of them went to work  as school teachers across the United States of America. Perhaps they  are teaching your children or grandchildren today. They are doing  important things in this country. But President Trump announced last  September 5 that the program that protects them and allows them to work  will end.   Then he challenged us. He said to the Senate and the House: Do  something about it. Pass a law. Isn't that what you are there for? The  President is right. That is our job.   This week we are going to try to pass a law to end this crisis, which  is going to reach a head on March 5 of this year when the DACA Program  officially ends and 1,000 young people a day lose their protection. We  have less than 3 weeks. So we are going to move today, I hope, or  tomorrow or this week, at some point to consider some alternatives to  solve this problem.   I am sorry to say that there is no plan in the U.S. House of  Representatives to even address the problem--none. I don't understand  it. They know that lives hang in the balance, and they know that  overwhelmingly the American people want to give DACA and the Dreamers a  chance. The numbers come rolling in; 75, 80, 85 percent of Americans  agree that these young people should be given a chance to earn their  way to legal status and citizenship. Even 60 percent of those who voted  for President Trump agree with what I just said. It is a popular  political issue on both sides, and it also is the right thing to do.   What the President has proposed as his alternative, from my point of  view, is unacceptable. Let me tell you why. Two weeks ago the White  House released a one-page framework on immigration reform and border  security. The White House claimed that this is a compromise because it  includes a path to citizenship for Dreamers--some of them. That, of  course, as I mentioned, is supported by a majority of Americans. The  reality is that the Trump plan would put the administration's entire  hard-line immigration agenda on the backs of these young people. These  young, DACA-protected people are being held as political hostages for  President Trump's hard-line immigration agenda.   For example, the White House wants to dramatically reduce legal  immigration by prohibiting American citizens from sponsoring their  parents, siblings, and children as immigrants. We are talking about  literally millions of relatives of American citizens who entered this  system legally and are following our immigration laws. Some have been  waiting for as long as 20 years to immigrate to the United States.   The conservative Cato Institute says the following about President  Trump's proposal:         In the most likely scenario, the new plan [from the Trump       administration] would cut the number of legal immigrants by       up to 44 percent or a half million immigrants annually--the       largest policy-driven immigration cut since the 1920s.       Compared to current law, it would exclude nearly 22 million       people from the opportunity to immigrate legally to the       United States over the next five decades.    You have to go back in history to a time when there was a proposal  that passed on the floor of this Chamber that cut as many legal  immigrants to the United States. The year was 1924. Calvin Coolidge was  President of the United States. We had just seen the end of World War  I. There was a growing fear that because of all of the damage that was  done in Europe, Europeans would come to the United States. There was  also a concern that the wrong people were coming to the United States,  in the eyes of some of the Members of Congress.   The Immigration Act of 1924 passed, and it set quotas for countries,  and it set quotas for people. It was expressly designed to exclude  certain people from around the world from entering the United States of  America. It was a notorious piece of legislation. Those who were to be  excluded from America included people from Italy, Eastern Europe,  Japan, Asia, and Jewish people. That was the immigration policy of the  United States of America because of that bill in 1924. That is the last  time this Chamber has made such a dramatic cut in legal immigration to  America. It was a source of embarrassment for decades. The United  States established quotas and said: We want America to look a lot  different than it would look if other immigrants came to this country.   Thankfully, in 1965, it was changed. Thankfully, we gave up the  quotas that had been criticized roundly as being insensitive to the  realities of the world population and the reality of the population of  America.   Now the Trump administration wants to cut legal immigration to the  United States again, by 44 percent, the biggest cut--as the Cato  Institute tells us--since that horrible bill was passed in 1924.    Let me tell you what else the Trump immigration proposal would do. It  would create an unaccountable slush fund of $25 billion of American  taxpayers' money for a border wall that, as I remember correctly,  Mexico was supposed to pay for--$25 billion. I have to double check,  but I think that is almost the annual appropriation for the National  Institutes of Health. The President wants $25 billion and wants no  strings attached. He wants to be able to spend it where, when, and how  he wants. That is an invitation for fraud and waste. It is an  invitation for money to be spent for something other than its purpose.  It is an invitation for taxpayers to be the ultimate losers with this  slush fund for President Trump's famous Mexican wall.   The President's proposal on immigration, in the midst of the worst  refugee crisis on record in the world, is now calling for fast-track  deportations without due process of women and children fleeing gang and  sexual violence. I can't tell you how many times we have had this  conversation with members of the Trump administration. They create a  scenario. The scenario is of a 6-year-old child who is swooped up in  some Central American country. The parents give thousands of dollars,  their life savings, to a smuggler who says: I will get this child to  the border of the United States. The child is then taken off by the  smuggler in a car or truck or bus to the border. The child then comes  out of the car, is pointed toward one of our Federal employees with the  Border Patrol, and the child walks up and hands a piece of paper to the  Border Patrol agent with the name of someone in the United States. That  process then unfolds, and the child ultimately, in many cases, ends up  with that relative while a decision is made about the status of the  child.   Is there exploitation in this system? You bet there is. Is there  abuse in this system? For sure. Is there actual human trafficking  taking place? Yes.  [[Page S934]]  Are atrocities committed against these children in the course of this  journey? All true. Should we be dedicated to cleaning this up? Sign me  up, on a bipartisan basis.   Let me tell you another scenario, another story that has a different  origin than turning over a child to a smuggler. Let me tell you about  cases we know of in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala where, because  of the rampant crime, gang activity, and violence that takes place,  parents, desperate to save their children--some of whom have daughters  who have been victims of rape by these gangs--send them to the United  States in the hope that they can save their lives. They show up at the  border, having lived in fear of this violence in their countries, and  they are accepted into the United States to determine whether that fear  can be established in a hearing.   These are two different cases--a little child being exploited by a  smuggler, a young girl escaping violence and perhaps death because her  parents have nowhere to turn to save her life. Should we treat them  both the same? I don't think so. Historically, we have said that when  it comes to asylum seekers, who come to this country with a credible  fear for their own lives, the United States has given them a chance to  be protected. We have said that over and over again. We said it to the  Cubans who were escaping Fidel Castro. We have said it to the Soviet  Jews who wanted to have freedom of religion and came to the United  States, believing this was the only chance they had in the world.   The Trump immigration proposal does not make a clear distinction on  those two cases. In fact, what it does is end up with fast-track  deportations without due process. Accepting the Trump approach will  literally return many of these folks who have come to our border to  harm and in some cases death.   There are fast-track deportations in the Trump proposal without due  process for millions who have overstayed their visas. An estimated 40  percent of the 11 million undocumented fit in this category. So even if  they have no criminal record, without considering their legal claims to  remain in the United States, they would be deported. It dramatically  cuts immigration from sub-Saharan African countries.   We have a diversity visa program. It is far from perfect, but it is a  program that was created years ago, so countries that do not have an  opportunity to send people to the United States for legal immigration  would have a chance. Immigrants who come from these countries are  limited in number. They have to go through the background checks,  criminal background checks, biometric investigations--all of the  investigations and interviews that we would expect in order to make  sure we do everything humanly possible to cull out those who would be  any danger to the United States. They face that same scrutiny, and they  should. Many of them are rejected. They can't make the case for their  lives and what they have done with them, and they are not given a  chance to come. The President wants to eliminate the diversity visa  program. For those living in sub-Saharan African countries, huge  countries, about 12,000 to 15,000 come to the United States each year  through this program. By eliminating this program, the Trump  administration sadly is going to deny those immigrants from Africa even  a chance to apply for this opportunity.   In the past, many Democrats have been willing to support some of the  President's proposals, changes in our immigration system, eliminating  the diversity visa lottery, but when we made that offer 5 years ago, it  was part of comprehensive immigration reform with give and take and  compromise that tried to make sense out of senseless immigration laws.   In 2013, a Democratic-led Senate passed a comprehensive immigration  reform bill with a strong bipartisan vote of 68 to 32. The bill was a  product of months of negotiations, with committee and floor debate.  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the House of  Representatives refused to even consider the bill. Now we are being  asked to accept the administration's proposal with no conditions, no  compromise, no give and take; rather, take it or leave it.   Democrats have shown they want to comprehensively fix our broken  immigration system, but right now we have to fix our focus on the DACA  crisis created by President Trump with his announcement of September 5.  That has to be our priority.   In the next day or two, we expect the so-called Grassley proposal,  which is the Trump immigration plan, to come to the floor. I want to  say for the record, Democrats support comprehensive immigration reform,  but we will not stand by and allow Dreamers to be held political  hostage to the administration's entire immigration agenda.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                      Parkland, Florida, School Shooting     Mr. President, every day in America we face the  devastating reminder of the toll of gun violence. Today, we are  watching the horrific scenes at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in  Parkland, FL, where yet another school shooting has taken place. It is  gut-wrenching. We know that so many families have just had their worlds  and lives changed forever by senseless gun violence. Ironically, this  is the 10th anniversary of a similar shooting at Northern Illinois  University in DeKalb, IL. Our prayers go out to the victims, to the  families, to the first responders, and, of course, to the Parkland  community.                        Honoring Commander Paul Bauer    Yesterday, Mr. President, in the city of Chicago, which I am honored  to represent, we lost one of our finest, Commander Paul Bauer of the  Chicago Police Department. He was shot and killed by a gunman in the  Chicago Loop.   Commander Bauer was a 31-year veteran of the CPD and the commander of  the 18th police district in the Near North Side. He was a pillar of  that community. He was well-known in his district. He had been  commended by the city council last year for a charity holiday party he  helped to host for underprivileged kids.   He was a husband to his wife Erin and a father to a 13-year-old  daughter named Grace. Commander Bauer was at a training session  yesterday in the Loop, but he didn't hesitate to help out his fellow  officers when they were pursuing a fleeing suspect. Commander Bauer was  shot several times by the suspect, and he died from his wounds.   Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson said this was an  extremely difficult day for the Chicago police family. Commander Bauer  was a hero in life. He made the ultimate sacrifice to help protect the  city he served and the city he loved. His loss is a tragedy.   Our prayers go out to the commander's friends, colleagues, his loved  ones, and, of course, his family and daughter.          10th Anniversary of Northern Illinois University Shooting    As I mentioned, Mr. President, today marks the 10th anniversary of  one of the most devastating shootings ever to occur on a college campus  in America. On February 14, 2008, a gunman with a history of mental  instability walked into a lecture hall at Northern Illinois University  in DeKalb and opened fire. His bullets killed five students and wounded  17 more. It was a horrific mass murder, and it shocked the entire  Nation.   The five young Illinoisans we lost that day all had bright futures  ahead of them: Gayle Dubowski, 20 years old, from Carol Stream, who  worked as a camp counselor and was a talented singer in her church  choir; Catalina Garcia, of Cicero, 20 years old, a smiling, outgoing  young woman who planned to be a teacher; Julianna Gehant, of Mendota,  32 years old, who served our country in the U.S. Army and Army Reserve  and who went to NIU to study to be a teacher; Ryanne Mace, of  Carpentersville, a 19-year-old, who was funny and fun to be with and  who aspired to work as a counselor; and Daniel Parmenter, 20 years old,  from Westchester, a rugby player, who lost his life because he shielded  his girlfriend from the shooter.   It is heartbreaking to think what these five young people could have  accomplished in the 10 years since that horrible day. We mourn their  loss and, again, our hearts go out to their families.   We remember and honor the wounded who still bear the scars of that  terrible day. We renew our thanks over and over to the law enforcement  officers and first responders who headed toward the sound of gunfire  that day and who treated the victims as they were wounded.   We commend the many members of the NIU community who stepped up in  the days that followed, working to persevere through this tragedy, with  heavy hearts but unbroken spirits and moving ``forward, together  forward,'' in the words of that Northern Illinois University Huskie  fight song.   It is devastating to think that in this great country, students and  educators could be gunned down in our schools. But it happens so often  that I am afraid a numbness is setting in.   Just in the last few months, we have had fatal shootings of students  at Aztec High School in Aztec, NM; Wake Forest University in North  Carolina; Marshall County High School in Benton, KY; and then, today,  in Florida.   Other tragedies have been narrowly averted because of well-trained  staff. At Mattoon High School in Illinois, a heroic teacher named  Angela McQueen stopped a student gunman from causing a massacre there  last September.   The threat of shootings in our schools is ever present. According to  a tally kept by the group Everytown, there have been at least 18  incidents so far this year where a gun has been fired on a school or  college campus.   Schools and colleges are doing the best they can to prepare and  protect their students. I salute the educators and administrators who  are working hard, but is Congress doing all that it can to keep our  Nation's students safe from gun violence? Not even close.   Of course, there is no single reform that could stop every shooting  in America, but we know there are big gaps in our laws that make it  easy for criminals, abusers, and mentally unstable people to get their  hands on guns that hurt innocent people. Congress has done nothing-- nothing--in recent years to close those gaps and make America safer.   Congress hasn't even closed the gun show loophole that the 1999  Columbine, CO, killers used to buy their weapons, and we did nothing in  response to the murder of 20 first graders and 6 educators at Sandy  Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.   In fact, the only vote taken by the Senate on gun laws in this  current  [[Page S959]]  Congress was to weaken gun law safety provisions on the books. That was  a vote that Senate Republicans brought up last year that prevented the  Social Security Administration from alerting the FBI's gun background  check system about people with mental illness.   It is likely that before this year is over, the Republican majority  will call up more bills to weaken gun safety laws. That is the wrong  response to the epidemic of gun violence in America.   I am not going to give up on trying to close the loopholes in our gun  laws. I am going to keep fighting for universal background checks,  tougher straw purchasing laws, and better laws to prevent gun theft. I  am not going to give up because of people like Patrick Korellis, who  was shot in the head 10 years ago at the tragedy at Northern Illinois  University. Luckily, Patrick survived, and since that day, he has been  a leader in Illinois, fighting for commonsense gun reform. I have come  to know and admire him for his efforts.   No one should have to go through what Patrick went through and so  many others went through on that day in DeKalb, IL, 10 years ago. We  owe it to Patrick, to the other NIU victims and families and community  members, and to the hundreds of thousands more across America who have  been killed and wounded by guns this past decade to keep trying to  reduce the toll of gun violence.   Maybe we can't stop every shooting, but if we do our best to keep  guns out of dangerous hands, we will save lives. I intend to keep doing  my best to achieve that goal.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, last week marked the 25th anniversary of  the Family and Medical Leave Act, a landmark law that resulted in an  important victory for working families in Illinois and across the  country. I am proud that I supported this bill in 1993 while serving in  the House of Representatives.   Before passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act, being a working  parent meant that you might have to choose between keeping your job or  taking care of yourself and your family. This is an impossible choice  that no hard-working American should have to make. This legislation  extended important protections to workers so that they would no longer  have to risk losing their job in order to care for a new child or a  loved one who is seriously ill or to address their own serious health  condition.   But for too many hard-working Americans, taking unpaid leave is still  not an option. These workers could be fired for taking time to care for  a loved one, meaning they can't buy food, clothes for their kids, or  pay medical bills. In Illinois alone, unpaid leave through the Family  and Medical Leave Act is inaccessible for 60 percent of working adults.  I have heard from many of these constituents. They are worried about  the impossible choices they are forced to make in order to take care of  themselves and their loved ones.   Additionally, just 15 percent of American workers have access to paid  family leave. These gaps cost nearly $21 billion in lost wages  annually, making it more difficult for parents and family caregivers to  boost their earnings and savings over time.   At the same time, the responsibilities of the American workforce have  changed in the past 25 years. As working Americans get older, they are  more likely to require medical care and support from their loved ones  to recover from illness. At the same time, more and more women are  becoming the breadwinner for their families; among women of color in my  home State, this trend couldn't be clearer. Eighty-four percent of  Black mothers and 49 percent of Latina mothers in Illinois are the  breadwinners in their family.   In Congress, we must do more to ensure that family leave is widely  accessible and fits the needs of today's workforce. I am proud to be a  cosponsor of the FAMILY Act, which would create a national paid family  and medical leave policy. Expanding access to paid family leave makes  it easier for parents and caregivers to return to their jobs and stay  in the workforce. It also means they have more money to spend and put  back into their local economies. This policy doesn't just make moral  sense, it makes economic sense.   As we mark the 25th anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave Act,  I hope that Congress can come together on this issue and expand paid  family and medical leave to cover more Americans. I am committed to  doing my part to ensure fairer workplaces and better health and  financial security for hardworking families across the country.                            ____________________
