Sec. 7.  House Resolution 379 is hereby adopted.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, for the purposes of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purposes of debate only.                                General Leave     I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met yesterday and  reported a rule, House Resolution 380, providing for consideration of  H.R. 2547, the Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act, under a  structured rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Financial Services or  their designees. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from  Chairwoman Waters, makes in order 14 amendments, provides en bloc  authority for Chairwoman Waters or her designee and provides one motion  to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 1065, the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act, under a closed rule, which provides 1 hour of  debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member  of the Committee  [[Page H2227]]  on Education and Labor or their designees, and provides one motion to  recommit.   The rule deems as passed H. Res. 379, a resolution to dismiss the  election contest in Illinois' 14th Congressional District.   Finally, the rule provides the majority leader or his designee the  ability to en bloc requested roll call votes on suspension bills  considered on May 11 or May 12. This authority lasts through May 14.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are here today to provide consideration  of two important bills to protect and support our constituents. First  is the Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act, which will create  protections for servicemembers, small businesses, students, and other  consumers against mistreatment by debt collectors. Debt collection is  consistently one of the top complaints made to the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, and the pandemic has further exposed weaknesses in  current consumer protection laws.   In March, the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial  Institutions, which I chair, held a hearing on protecting consumers  during the pandemic. We heard expert witnesses discuss how many debt  collectors have seen record profits in the pandemic, despite many  families and individuals continuing to struggle.   H.R. 2547 is comprehensive legislation to update consumer protections  in debt collection across many different issues. For example, the bill  codifies and expands protections for small and minority-owned  businesses and prohibits debt collectors from threatening a  servicemember with reduction in rank or other military disciplinary  actions. Additionally, it protects private student loan borrowers with  disabilities, would prohibit entities from collecting medical debt or  reporting it to a credit reporting agency without giving the consumer  notice about his or her rights, and clarifies that entities in  nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings are covered by the Fair Debt  Collection Practices Act.   This legislation is sponsored by Financial Services Committee  Chairwoman Maxine Waters and incorporates bills from committee members,  Representatives Nydia Velazquez, Madeleine Dean, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna  Pressley, Emanuel Cleaver,  Greg Meeks, and Jake Auchincloss. The bill  is supported by many consumer and civil rights organizations, including  Americans for Financial Reform, Center for Responsible Lending, Color  of Change, Consumer Federation of America, National Consumer Law  Center, Public Citizen, U.S. PIRG, and others.   This legislation will update and improve debt collection consumer  protection laws, and make sure that small businesses, families, and  individuals are treated fairly as we all work to come out of this  pandemic stronger.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 1065, the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act. Claims of pregnancy discrimination have been on  the rise for two decades and affect all industries and regions across  the country. This bipartisan bill will strengthen workplace protections  and promote the well-being of pregnant workers by creating a new right  to pregnancy accommodation in the workplace.   Temporary modifications at work, like regular breaks, a stool to sit  on, or an exemption from heavy lifting, can be the difference between a  healthy pregnancy and pregnancy complications. When pregnant workers  are denied reasonable workplace accommodations, they are often left to  choose between their financial stability and a healthy pregnancy.   Currently, only 30 States require employers to provide reasonable  accommodations for pregnant workers, including, thankfully, my home  State of Colorado. But this has created a confusing patchwork of local,  State, and Federal laws, leaving many pregnant workers with few  protections.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act enjoys support from both worker  advocates and business groups because it is good for families, it is  good for business, and it is good for the economy. The House passed  this bill last Congress in a broad, bipartisan vote of 329-73, and I  hope more of my colleagues join us in passing the bill this year.   I urge all my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying  bills. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I include in the Record a letter dated May 10, 2021, from about 85  different public interest and financial organizations supporting H.R.  2547.  [[Page H2228]]                                                       May 10, 2021.      Re H.R. 2547, the ``Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement           Act'' (Waters), which includes:      HR 2540, the ``Small Business Fairness Lending Act''           (Velazquez).      HR 1491, the ``Fair Debt Collection Practices for           Servicemembers Act'' (Dean).      HR 2498, the ``Private Loan Disability Discharge Act''           (Dean).      HR 2537, the ``Consumer Protection for Medical Debt           Collections Act'' (Tlaib).      HR 1657, the ``Ending Debt Collection Harassment Act''           (Pressley).      HR 2572, the ``Stop Debt Collection Abuse Act'' (Cleaver).      HR 2628, the ``Debt Collection Practices Harmonization Act''           (Meeks).      HR 2458, the ``Non-Judicial Foreclosure Debt Collection           Clarification Act'' (Auchincloss).       Representative Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Representative Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: The 85       undersigned public interest, legal services, consumer, labor,       and civil rights organizations write in support of HR 2547       and urge you to support this legislation when it comes up for       a vote on May 13th.        Prior to the pandemic, the Urban Institute reported that       more than 68 million adults in the U.S. had one or more debts       in collection on their credit report, and consumer debt has       continued to grow during the pandemic, reaching $14.56       trillion at the end of 2020.        Debt in collection can wreak havoc on consumers, subjecting       them to harassing debt collection calls and potential       lawsuits. Despite the enactment of the federal Fair Debt       Collection Practices Act (``FDCPA'') in 1977, debt collection       remains a frequent source of complaints to the Consumer       Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, and       other state and federal agencies.        Data from the Urban Institute also show racial disparities       in debt collection, with 39 percent of residents in       communities of color with debt in collection compared to 24       percent of residents in white communities. These statistics       highlight the fact that consumer protections for consumers       with alleged debts in collection are also a racial justice       issue.        Additionally, other groups may be particularly vulnerable       to abusive debt collection practices including       servicemembers, older consumers, and consumers with limited       English proficiency.        To better protect vulnerable consumers, this bill would       enact a wide variety of critical reforms, including:        Prohibiting the use of confessions of judgment as an unfair       credit practice that eliminate notice and the right to be       heard;        Prohibiting certain abusive collection practices directed       at servicemembers, including threats to reduce rank or revoke       security clearance;        Requiring discharge of private student loans due to total       and permanent disability;        Prohibiting collection of medical debt for the first two       years and credit reporting of debt arising from any medically       necessary procedures;        Requiring debt collectors to obtain consent before using       electronic communications and provide written validation       notices;        Amending the FDCPA to expand and clarify coverage,       including extending coverage for all federal, state, and       local debts collected by debt collectors;        Adjusting statutory damages in the FDCPA for inflation and       indexing them to index for inflation in the future; and        Clarifying FDCPA coverage for non-judicial foreclosures.        Enactment of H.R. 2547 will protect vulnerable consumers       from abusive debt collection practices, and we thank the       House of Representatives for considering legislation to       address these important issues.        Please feel free to contact April Kuehnhoff at the National       Consumer Law Center, regarding this legislation.

I appreciate my friend from Pennsylvania's comments,  but, apparently, consumer protection is not high on the list of  priorities for the other side of the aisle.   I would just say, this particular piece of legislation, H.R. 2547,  has many good aspects, a number of which are bipartisan in nature:   It codifies the protections that currently exist under the FTC  regulation for consumer loans prohibiting the use of confessions of  judgment that waive due process protections, and extends those  protections to commercial loans to protect small and minority-owned  businesses.   It prohibits debt collectors from threatening a servicemember with  reduction in their rank and revoking their security clearance or  prosecuting them under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and  requires a GAO study on the impact of debt collection on  servicemembers.   It requires discharge of private student loans for both the borrower  and cosigner in the case of permanent disability of the borrower,  extending protections that currently exist for Federal student loans.  So it assists people with serious disabilities.   It requires private lenders who are notified the Federal Government  has discharged the Federal student loans of a borrower to discharge the  private student loans of that same borrower.   It bars entities from collecting medical debt or reporting it to a  consumer reporting agency without giving the consumer a notice about  their rights.   These are so simple, and you would expect that there would be  universal acceptance of this, but apparently not.   It provides a minimum 1-year delay from adverse information reported  and a 2-year delay before collection attempts are made on these medical  bills.                                time  1430    We heard last night in committee even Dr. Burgess talking about the  normal practices of medical professionals allowing people to have time  to pay their bills, especially when we are in the middle of a pandemic  or as we are coming out of a pandemic.   It bans the reporting of medical debts arising from medically  necessary procedures. This was something that Ralph Hall, a Republican,  championed for years.   It prohibits a debt collector from contacting a consumer by email or  text message without a consumer's consent to be contacted  electronically.   It requires the CFPB to analyze and annually report on the impact of  electronic communications utilized by debt collectors.   The provisions of this bill are simple, consumer-oriented efforts to  provide information to the consumer debtor and to take into  consideration that we are in a pandemic and medical bills have piled up  for so many people.   This is a very simple bill. It has bipartisan provisions in it. It  should be passed, as should the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as to H.R. 1065, there are at least 20,  if not more, Republican cosponsors of that piece of legislation. I want  the Record to reflect that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Ross), a member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I want to remind my friends on the Republican side of the  aisle that we passed a bill about 2 months ago called the American  Rescue Plan. Not one Republican voted for that. That had money to  support law enforcement and local governments and cities and States  that saw their tax revenues fall off a cliff.   Mr. Speaker, when my friend, Mr. Reschenthaler, says, oh, a billion  dollars was cut from the funding here, or $150 million cut from there,  he forgot to talk about the fact that tax revenues across the country  for local governments and State governments were cut to the bone  because of the pandemic.   If my friends really wanted to put their money where their mouths  are, then they would have supported the American Rescue Plan because it  provided $350 billion to State and local governments so that they could  increase funding to the police, to law enforcement, to social services,  to a whole variety of agencies and needs. But, apparently, they chose  not to. Instead, they choose to bring claims that Democrats want to  defund the police, which couldn't be further from the truth.   We put our money where our mouths are, and we said we support law  enforcement. We support local government employees. We support State  government employees. We provided in the American Rescue Plan, which  not a single Republican voted for, hazard pay because it has been so  difficult for law enforcement and for so many others to conduct their  services, to be out in the community during this particular pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I just would suggest to my friends, next time they get  an opportunity to actually provide funding to law enforcement, they  vote for it and not just say they are supportive of it. Let's put their  moneys where their mouths are.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Lois Frankel).                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two Statements of Administration  Policy. One on H.R. 2547, and the other one on H.R. 1065, both in  support of the bills that are under consideration.                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 2547--Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act--Rep. Waters,                         D-CA, and seven cosponsors         The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2547, the       Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act. This       legislation would expand necessary safeguards to ensure       working families and small businesses are protected from       predatory debt collection practices.        As our Nation works to recover from the worst economic and       public health crises of our lifetimes, many families and       small businesses are dealing with outstanding debts. In       addition to providing robust relief, the government must also       protect Americans from abusive and predatory practices.        H.R. 2547 would extend existing consumer protections       against predatory lending arrangements to small businesses,       prohibit debt collectors from threatening service members       with a reduction in rank, prosecution or loss of security       clearance, and restrict contact to consumers by email or text       messages. The legislation would require discharge of private       student loans for both the borrower and cosigners in the case       of permanent disability for the borrower, establishing       greater parity in protections for private and Federal student       loan borrowers. The bill also clarifies protections for       consumers in the case of non-judicial foreclosure       proceedings.        The Administration applauds these steps to strengthen       consumer protections for hardworking Americans and their       families, and we look forward to working with the Congress       further on the details of this legislation.                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 1065--Pregnant Workers Fairness Act--Rep. Nadler, D-NY, and 228                                 cosponsors         The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R.       1065, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. Pregnant workers are       too often unable to access simple changes to their working       conditions that would allow them to keep doing their jobs and       do so safely. This can create risks to their health as well       as economic consequences. No worker should be forced to       choose between a paycheck and a healthy pregnancy.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would provide basic, long       overdue protections to ensure that pregnant workers and job       applicants are not fired or otherwise discriminated against,       or denied reasonable accommodations that allow them to work.       Such protections promote family economic security by helping       women stay in the workforce, including for those, often women       of color, who are the sole or primary breadwinners in their       families. Approximately two million women have left the       workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic, eroding more than 30       years of progress in women's labor force participation, and       this Administration is committed to ensuring that women can       both care for and support themselves and their families.        H.R. 1065 is a bipartisan bill that requires certain       employers to make reasonable accommodations for qualified       employees and job applicants with known limitations related       to pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.       These accommodations might include simple modifications, such       as modifying a no-food-or-drink policy, providing additional       break time to use the bathroom, or helping avoid the lifting       of heavy objects, depending on the circumstances. The bill       would require employers to provide reasonable accommodations       for qualified pregnant workers unless doing so would pose an       undue hardship to the employer. It would also provide for an       interactive process, where necessary, between employers and       pregnant workers to determine appropriate and effective       reasonable accommodations, and would protect pregnant workers       from being denied employment opportunities, or from       retaliation or interference, because they request or use an       accommodation.        The Administration encourages the House to pass this       bipartisan, commonsense legislation and looks forward to       working with the Congress to protect pregnant workers across       the country.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friends on the other  side of the aisle trying to find a subject to talk about, since  apparently they don't really have too many objections to either of the  bills that are being discussed in the rule today.   Obviously, it doesn't seem like there is much conversation about H.R.  1065, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. And there isn't much  discussion about the Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act.  Because those things are commonsense. They should be passed by this  House. We thank so many Republicans for being cosponsors of the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.   Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier in my opening remarks, a number of the  provisions in the Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act are  really bipartisan, including the one Mr. Hall used to champion when he  was a Member here in the Congress.   So you want to go off and talk about something else. I wonder where  the outrage for brutality against our police was when a rightwing mob  stormed this Capitol. And the only one of the people that really is  speaking of the truth today in the Republican Caucus--Ms. Cheney from  Wyoming--was ousted from her leadership position because she talked  about the truth and the fact there was a mob, and our police were  beaten by a rightwing mob.   Mr. Speaker, so I would just say to my friends on the other side of  the aisle: Take a look in the mirror, and let's support our police  across the board. Because I certainly support the law enforcement in  Colorado. I support our Capitol Police, our FBI--particularly, the FBI.   President Trump would always undercut the FBI.   So I would suggest to my friends: Take a look in the mirror. Let's  all support our law enforcement because they are important members of  our community.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my friend from Nebraska for condemning-- finally, somebody condemning the riot and the attack that occurred  against all of us and against our police, the Capitol Police, on  January 6. I would also like to see more members of the Republican  Party stand up and do exactly that same thing.    Mr. Speaker, I would also like to see them do what Ms. Cheney did,  and condemn the ex-President, Donald Trump, for his role in inciting  that whole mob action on January 6, and then we could start getting  things back together.   Instead, my friend from Pennsylvania, reading a resolution that  condemns racist policing that may have existed for a very long time,  and I can't believe that he supports policing that is delivered in some  kind of racist fashion. We have had too many people killed across this  country. I know that is not what he meant.   So I just would urge us to focus on the bills that are at hand, which  is the Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act and the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act, because those are important pieces of legislation  that should be considered immediately by this House. And when we pass  this rule, they will be considered.   So I oppose the gentleman's suggestions that we move to a different  previous question. I appreciate Mr. Bacon's comments about his bill.  There are provisions in there that are really outstanding, but we are  here to deal with debt collections and we are here to deal with  pregnant workers' fairness.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, during this week, applaud our law enforcement  and our first responders, but particularly law enforcement right now  for their valor, for their protection of our communities. I appreciate  the gentleman for bringing up that subject at this time.   But we are here on a rule dealing with the Comprehensive Debt  Collection Improvement Act and Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The  treatment of consumers in the collection of debts and businesses and  military personnel is a very important subject, especially during this  time of COVID when so many families are struggling.   We have thousands and thousands of people who were laid off. In fact,  where millions of people are still out of work a year and a half after  COVID started. And, as a consequence, a lot of folks need assistance  and need help, and they don't need to be hounded in improper ways as  they go through this struggle.   So the Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act is very  important for the financial health of our consumers and people across  the country. The provisions in the bill are bipartisan ideas to protect  consumers from abusive debt collection practices. They also ensure  pregnant women can receive reasonable workplace accommodations to  ensure that they can stay in the workforce.   According to the CFPB 2021 Annual Report, more than one in four  Americans have a third-party debt collection item attached to their  credit report. And, last year, the CFPB received 82,700 consumer  complaints about debt collection. It is time for Congress to act.   And based on the gentleman from Pennsylvania's argument, which has  nothing to do with that particular bill or the facts as we have seen  them develop during this pandemic, that should be an easy vote for  everybody, whether they are Democrat or Republican.   The Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act provides important  consumer protections to stop abusive debt collection practices, and it  ensures that small businesses, families, and individuals are treated  fairly.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is necessary to support the more  than 80 percent of women who will give birth to a child at some point  during their working years. These women deserve to have reasonable  accommodations, which oftentimes cost businesses little to no money to  implement. So we can help pregnant women stay in the workforce. This  bill passed on broad bipartisan vote last Congress, and I hope it  passes with even more support again this week.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.
