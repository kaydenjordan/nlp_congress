 Mr. Speaker, in light of the undeniable  spikes in hate speech and hate crimes and conversations we have had in  the House over the past few days, I rise today in memory of Ari  Halberstam, a young neighbor of mine whose life was taken 25 years ago  this week when anti-Semitic hatred morphed into terrorism.   Tragically, on March 6, 1994, Ari passed away at age 16 due to  gunshot wounds to the head after a terrorist attack on the ramp leading  to the Brooklyn Bridge.   Mr. Speaker, we must confront hatred in all of its manifestations, be  it anti-Semitic attacks that took our beloved Ari's life or the hate- fueled neo-Nazi march through Charlottesville that took the life of  Heather Heyer.   Devorah Halberstam, Ari's mother and my dear friend, is a crusader  for justice and a forceful advocate in New York State for the passage  of Ari's Law as part of a comprehensive gun control bill prohibiting  interstate gun trafficking.   Determined to bring about something symbolic of resilience,  tolerance, and beauty, in 2004 Ms. Halberstam established Brooklyn's  iconic Jewish Children's Museum in my district in memory of Ari. The  award-winning children's museum is Ari's legacy. It is our legacy.   The uptick in acts of anti-Semitism targeting Jewish communities are  truly alarming, but must be confronted. Let us remember that these acts  are in no way reflective of who we are as a Nation and/or our core  values of tolerance, respect, and human decency.   Let us celebrate Ari's life and legacy by coming together in respect,  tolerance, and, above all else, love.                            ____________________
