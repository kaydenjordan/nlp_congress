 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  resolution.   Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib is one of only two Muslim-American women  elected to this body, and the only Palestinian-American in Congress.  She has fought tirelessly and successfully to get clean drinking water  for her constituents and to ensure that people have housing and  environmental justice.   If we truly want Congress to be a diverse body that represents the  diversity of views across this country, then we have to be willing to  stand up for those diverse views to be expressed. We don't have to  agree with them, but we do have to protect the right to the freedom of  speech which this body is absolutely required to do.  [[Page H5501]]    Our country and our world are in crisis. People are suffering  everywhere. Historic and present traumas for Jews, Muslims, Arabs,  South Asians, Sikhs, and so many others are playing themselves out, and  we as the elected Representatives of the people should be working  together to protect the rights of every American to say what they  believe and ensure that we preserve our democracy.   Vote ``no'' on this terrible resolution.
