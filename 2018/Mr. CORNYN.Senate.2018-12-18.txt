 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate has before it a bill called the  FIRST STEP Act. The name is significant because it shows that this is  not a comprehensive fix for the problems of our criminal justice system  but, rather, a first, critical step in the right direction.   A study by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found that nearly half of  the people released from Federal prison in 2005 were arrested again in  the next 8 years--half of the people released from Federal prison since  2005 were rearrested within 8 years.   Considering that 95 percent of State and Federal prisoners at some  point will be released, those odds are pretty bleak, but here is the  reality: Almost everybody in prison will serve their time and get out  of prison. The question for us is, Will they be better prepared to live  life on the outside in a productive way or will they simply reengage in  a turnstile--or as one gentleman referred to himself in Houston, TX, a  few years ago when we were talking about this issue--he called himself  a frequent flyer in the criminal justice system.   Unfortunately, we see that in the Federal system, according to the  U.S. Sentencing Commission, half of the people repeat their mistakes  within 8 years. This is bleak but not hopeless because we know there  are reforms that will work that help improve the chances that more  people will be able to live a lawful life productively outside a prison  system and will not reoffend.   We have seen these changes implemented across the country at the  State level, including my home State of Texas, which has yielded  incredible results. This might cause some people a little bit of a  shock because Texas, of course, has a reputation for being tough on  crime. People don't run for public office saying: I am going to be soft  on crime in Texas and get elected. But what we have seen is that people  have said: I think we can be smarter about crime and produce better  results at a lower cost. That message and those things that have  followed have been enormously successful. So let me talk about that a  little bit.   In Texas, the initial interest in criminal justice reform was first  cost-driven. In other words, people were wondering: How are we going to  continue to pay for 17,000 more prison beds that we think we are going  to need because of our growing population? The growing prison  population was simply outpacing the corrections budget, so State  legislators were faced with a very difficult financial choice. But as  it turned out, the reforms that we adopted did a lot more than  alleviate the budget strain on the criminal justice system.   Using recidivism reduction programs, including job training and  vocational education, we reduced our incarceration rate and our crime  rate by double digits at the same time.   So using the sorts of recidivism reduction programs that are included  in the FIRST STEP Act at the State level, we were able to reduce our  incarceration rate and our crime rate by double digits at the same  time.   I remember a few years ago, when former Attorney General Michael  Mukasey testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he said  that the single most important measurement of whether the sentencing  practices are working is the crime rate--the crime rate. This was at a  time when people were talking about ``Well, we put too many people in  prison, so we have to let some out,'' but they weren't paying attention  to how that impacted the crime rate.   That stuck with me over these many years because I think he is  exactly right. If these programs do not protect the public safety, then  we shouldn't be doing them. If they don't lower the crime rate, they  are not worth the effort. But our experience in Texas, Georgia, North  Carolina, Rhode Island--in places that have implemented these programs,  they have seen their incarceration rate and their crime rate drop at  the same time. So we are trying to replicate those successes at the  Federal level through the FIRST STEP Act.   In so doing, we hope to allow people to transform their lives as we  allow low-risk offenders to lead productive lives in their communities  once they leave prison, assuming they comply with all of the rules and  regulations. I believe this legislation will lead the way for  additional steps that we will take afterward, but this is an important  first step.   This bill will provide funding for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to  develop risk assessment tools to pair individuals with programs proven  to reduce the risk of recidivism.   This isn't just social engineering or some hope that we have. This is  based on proven examples of programs that will help people, for  example, deal with their drug or their alcohol addiction.   Senator Cassidy from Louisiana has put in this bill some very  important provisions relating to the diagnosis and treatment of people  with dyslexia.   I am convinced that there are people in prison who were told as they  were growing up that they were too stupid to go to school because they  couldn't read, and they simply dropped out, and their dyslexia, which  was holding them back, was not diagnosed and properly treated. So I am  grateful to Senator Cassidy for some of the provisions in the bill  relating to the identification of people with dyslexia and providing  them access to programs that will help them learn and succeed and  improve their lives and, at the same time, reduce the likelihood that  they will end up back in prison after having been arrested again.   By spending time in prison, completing evidence-based programming, as  I have mentioned--education, job training, drug treatment, life skills,  faith-based programs--we can give people an opportunity to prepare  themselves for their transition to life after prison.   This is because the incentives in this program are really important.  I think we, as human beings, all operate based on incentives, and the  incentive for prisoners is to go through the program, gain the earned  credit so that they can be released--not to shorten their sentence but  in less confining conditions, for example, a halfway house.   I want to remind our colleagues that not all offenders, of course,  are eligible for these credits. The bill specifically lists 48 offenses  that disqualify offenders from earning time credits, including crimes  like murder, assault, carjacking that results in injury and death, and  the unlawful possession or use of a firearm by violent criminals and  drug traffickers.   In other words, by focusing our efforts on low-risk offenders and by  giving them the opportunity to access these programs--these education  programs, these addiction treatment programs--we can focus our  attention and our money on the truly violent and high-risk offenders,  which I think is also an important feature of this legislation.  [[Page S7747]]    But it is important to remember that just because a specific crime is  not included in the exclusion list of 48 offenses, it doesn't mean that  the offender is automatically entitled to the earned-time credit.   The person must first be determined to be low risk; in other words,  that is the failsafe. But notwithstanding whether the offense is  listed, if you are not a low-risk offender, as determined by the  testing that is done by the Bureau of Prisons, you will not be eligible  for these less confining conditions.   This is not a determination made by Washington bureaucrats or even  politicians. It is left to experienced law enforcement officers and  wardens who work with these individuals on a daily basis.   We want to give the opportunity to those who would take advantage of  it to turn their own lives around, but we will not do so at the cost of  public safety. That is exactly what these risk assessment tools are  designed to do, to tell us who is at highest risk of reoffending.   I believe this legislation is an investment with the potential for  astronomical returns. We are not just talking about money, we are  talking about human potential. We are investing in the men and women  who want to turn their lives around once they are released from  prisons, and we are investing in so doing for stronger and more viable  communities. We are investing tax dollars in a system that helps  produce stronger citizens.   When it comes to positive results, don't take my word for it. There  is plenty of research that shows how valuable these programs can be.  For example, in 2013, a study by RAND Corporation found that prisoners  who participated in education programs were 43 percent less likely to  return to prison than those who did not. Employment after release was  13 percent higher among prisoners who participated in these programs,  and those who participated in vocational training were 28 percent more  likely to be employed after they were released.   Our prisons should be more than just a warehouse for human beings.  They should also serve as places where rehabilitation takes place, and  hopefully people can take advantage of the opportunity once they have  made a mistake and served their time to transform their own lives into  productive citizens. That is what this legislation tries to do, and  that is why it has gained such broad support on both sides of the  aisle.   By investing in these education and training programs and these  recidivism reduction programs, we can ensure that of the people who get  out of prison, more will actually stay out of prison.   This bill is our opportunity to make meaningful changes in our  criminal justice system, our opportunity to begin fixing a problem that  plagues our country, and an opportunity to take a model that has been  working in the States for more than a decade and use it to benefit all  Americans. The odds of these individuals leaving prison and becoming  more productive members of society should be higher than the odds of a  coin flip.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and I look forward  to voting yes when it comes up for a vote later today or tomorrow.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
