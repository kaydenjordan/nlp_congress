 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of burdened  borrowers throughout the Massachusetts Seventh Congressional District  and borrowers everywhere.   I rise today on behalf of the third grade teacher who spent a decade  in the classroom, month by month making their student loan payments; on  behalf of the mother juggling three part-time jobs, trying her best to  stretch her paycheck to cover rent and to pay down her student debt;  and for the one in four Black borrowers who will have their student  loans fully canceled under President Biden's historic plan.   You see, Mr. Speaker, student debt cancellation can and will change  and save lives. This isn't hyperbole. It is reality.   A diverse coalition of voters came together to press for  cancellation, critical payment pauses, and updates to the essential  Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.   Under this cruel measure, 260,000 public service workers could see  their debt reinstated--nurses, educators, firefighters, and military  servicemembers.    Let me make it plain: The President has the legal authority to cancel  student debt.   Let me say this. I took out loans, and I paid off those loans. It  took me 20-plus years while being a caregiver to my mother and while  working three jobs sometimes. I took out those loans, and I paid them  off, but I want an easier road for the next person.   The cost of higher education has increased by 150 percent, so I do  not call it student debt forgiveness because borrowers have done  nothing wrong. They don't need to be forgiven anything, but they are  deserving of and do need relief.    Mr. Speaker, to anyone who seeks to mislead the public  and to use the court's harmful measures to gut essential relief, take a  seat. The people deserve and demand this relief.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
