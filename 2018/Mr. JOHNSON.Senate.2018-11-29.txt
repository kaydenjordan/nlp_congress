 Mr. President, I am here today to ask my colleagues to  approve a bill to reform and reauthorize the Chemical Facility Anti- Terrorism Standards Program, commonly known as CFATS.   This CFATS Program regulates chemical facilities to help prevent  terrorists from carrying out an attack with dangerous chemicals--a  worthy goal. However, since 2006, watchdogs have identified significant  problems with the program. In 2013, the Government Accountability  Office found that CFATS had a 7- to 9-year backlog to review more than  3,000 security plans and a flawed methodology to assess security.   The inspector general and Congress have questioned whether the  program successfully reduces risk, enhances security, and warned of  serious management problems. That is why each time Congress has  reauthorized the program, it has done so only for a limited duration.  Coming from a manufacturing background, I agree with that approach.  That is exactly how you help ensure continuous improvement.   In 2014, when the program was last set to expire, the Committee on  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs--under the chairmanship of  Senator Carper--and Congress did their job. They did oversight. They  made reforms and extended the program for another 4 years, until  January 2019.   Under my chairmanship, our committee also took its oversight and  reauthorization responsibilities seriously. Over the last 2 years, we  have conducted extensive oversight on CFATS to evaluate the program's  effectiveness and develop a plan to make it better. We enlisted the  help of GAO to conduct a nonpartisan review of the CFATS Program to  help inform our work. We held a roundtable with DHS, GAO, a CFATS  chemical inspector, and multiple companies and industry groups. We had  an important, frank discussion about the program's strengths and  weaknesses. The committee also held numerous briefings with chemical  facility owners, trade groups, DHS, and other relevant agencies.   After gathering information and talking directly with stakeholders,  here is what we have learned: DHS has made significant progress under  the 2014 reforms by eliminating the backlog and improving management of  the program, but more work is necessary.   It is still far from clear that CFATS actually reduces the risk of  terrorist attack, and DHS does not measure whether it actually does so.  The program forces some explosive material companies to spend hundreds  of thousands of dollars complying with CFATS regulations that are  duplicative of Justice Department regulations and subject companies to  frequent, unnecessary site inspections. These practices are extremely  costly and neither reduce risk nor enhance security.   The program fails to give credit to companies that already comply  with other private sector-specific programs that require high standards  of care. Recognizing these exceptional programs would significantly  reduce the regulatory burden on companies without reducing security.   DHS needs to do more to make this expedited approval process  available to reduce unnecessary costs on both the companies and the  American taxpayers, and it needs to be more transparent about how it  classifies facilities to help companies understand what rules to even  follow.   After conducting this oversight, I introduced a bill to address these  issues and reauthorize the program for 5 years. Representatives Katko,  Moolenaar, and Cuellar introduced a similar, bipartisan bill in the  House.   Our legislation brings much needed regulatory relief to U.S.  businesses by exempting explosive materials that are also regulated by  the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, reducing the  frequency of audits and inspections, and reducing the burden of  compliance for companies that participate in CFATS' recognition  program, all while ensuring safety and security. It improves  transparency by requiring DHS to provide information to companies on  why their regulatory tier changed. It requires more DHS and independent  assessments of how successful the program is at reducing risk and  enhancing security. It also reauthorizes the program for 5 years.   After going through a thorough process of discussion and compromise,  our committee approved the bill unanimously by voice vote in September.   The bill is supported by a wide range of private sector stakeholders,  including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Chemical Council,  the National Association of Manufacturers, and numerous others.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows;                                                 September 25, 2018.      Hon. Ron Johnson.      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental           Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Johnson: The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism       Standards (CFATS) Coalition comprises a diverse group of       trade associations and companies impacted by CFATS       regulations. Coalition members represent major sectors of the       American economy, including chemical production, chemical       distribution and storage, manufacturing, oil and gas       refining, utilities, mining, and agricultural goods and       services. The businesses we represent are an integral part of       the American economy, making our modern society possible. Our       members have no higher priority than ensuring the safety and       security of our products, our people, and our communities.        We applaud your leadership on this important security issue       by introducing the ``Protecting and Securing Chemical       Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2018'' (S. 3405).       This legislation is an important marker in the       reauthorization process, and we look forward to working with       you and your colleagues to develop legislation that will       provide additional improvements and efficiencies to the CFATS       program. By reauthorizing the program for five years, S. 3405       would provide needed certainty to the regulated community and       enhance the security of our nation.        Since the inception of the CFATS program in 2007, our       industries have invested millions of dollars and instituted       thousands of new security measures at our facilities. The       ``Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist       Attacks Act'' of 2014 (P.L. 113-254), which for the first       time provided CFATS a multi-year authorization, further       enhanced these efforts by establishing regulatory certainty       to both industry and the Department of Homeland Security       (DHS). This stability allowed DHS to increase efficiencies in       the program while streamlining the information submission       process for regulated facilities.        On January 19, 2019, the current authorization will expire.       The CFATS Coalition wants to ensure the continued viability       of the CFATS program without interruption and the       introduction of S. 3405 is a significant first step in this       process. Thank you for your leadership on this issue and we       look forward to working with you towards a successful CFATS       reauthorization.            Sincerely,        Agricultural Retailers Association, American Fuel &       Petrochemical Manufacturers, American Petroleum Institute,       Institute of Makers of Explosives, International Warehouse       Logistics Association, National Association of Chemical       Distributors, Society of Chemical Manufacturers & Affiliates,       U S Chamber of Commerce, American Chemistry Council, American       Gas Association, Edison Electric Institute, International       Liquid Terminals Association, Interstate Natural Gas       Association of America, National Association of       Manufacturers, National Mining Association, The Fertilizer       Institute.                                   ____                                                 September 21, 2018.      Re ARA and TFI Support for Protecting and Securing Chemical           Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2018 (S. 3405).       Hon. Ron Johnson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental           Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Claire McCaskill,      Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and           Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member McCaskill: The       Agricultural Retailers Association (ARA) and The Fertilizer       Institute (TFI) strongly support the ``Protecting and       Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of       2018'' (S. 3405).        Thousands of ARA and TFI member facilities are subject to       the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS)       program administered by the Department of Homeland Security       (DHS) because they store, handle, and sell certain CFATS       chemicals of interest (COI), such as anhydrous ammonia and       ammonium nitrate.        Safety and security of facilities--to protect workers and       the surrounding communities--is paramount to ARA and TFI       members. That is why ARA, TFI, and our members created the       ResponsibleAg stewardship program. ResponsibleAg is a       voluntary, industry-led initiative committed to helping  [[Page S7225]]       agribusinesses properly store and handle farm input supplies.       The program helps members ensure they are compliant with       federal environmental, health, safety, security, and       transportation regulations, including CFATS, to keep       employees, customers and communities safe.        The CFATS program provides an important framework to ensure       facilities are taking appropriate steps to be safe and       secure. The current Congressional authorization for CFATS is       set to expire in January of 2019. Any lapse in authorization       of the CFATS program would subject our members to uncertainty       in an already volatile agricultural market and environment.        S. 3405 makes several improvements to the CFATS program. We       are pleased to see the legislation requires DHS to conduct       notice and comment rulemakings to make changes to Appendix A.       This requirement will ensure a thorough exchange of       information is done so the most informed decisions can be       made.        ARA and TFI also appreciate the inclusion of Section 7,       which would make the Personnel Surety Program requirements of       CFATS optional for tier 3 and 4 facilities. Tiers 3 and 4       facilities do not face the same insider threat possibility as       tiers 1 and 2. This provision gives industry the flexibility       to find a personnel surety solution that best fits their       facility and security needs.        ARA and TFI also strongly support Section 5, entitled,       ``CFATS Recognition Program.'' This portion of the       legislation will allow DHS to utilize and focus limited       resources, while incentivizing other facilities to       voluntarily come into compliance through stewardship       programs. Stewardship programs, like ResponsibleAg, are       already working to identify gaps in CFATS compliance at       agricultural retail facilities. When gaps in compliance are       identified, ResponsibleAg works with the facility on a timely       and thorough corrective action plan to bring that facility       into compliance. A ``CFATS Recognition Program'' would be a       great ``win-win'' and strengthen the collaborative       partnership between industry and government.        Finally, thank you for your leadership regarding       reauthorization of the CFATS program. We appreciate all of       you and your staffs' efforts to make a good government       program better.        Should you have any questions, please reach out to our       staff, Kyle Liske at ARA.            Sincerely,      Daren Coppock,        President and CEO, Agricultural Retailers Association.      Chris Jahn,        President and CEO, The Fertilizer Institute.                                   ____                                Institute of Makers of Explosives,                                 Washington, DC, September 12, 2018.      Hon. Ron Johnson,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Johnson: Yesterday our nation marked another       somber milestone, the 17th anniversary of the terrorist       attacks of September 11, 2001. That tragedy led to great       changes in our government, including the establishment of the       Department of Homeland Security (DHS). As directed by       Congress, DHS focuses on securing high-risk chemical plants       through the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards       (CFATS) program. The members of the Institute of Makers of       Explosives (IME) fully support your legislation that       reauthorizes this important program, the Protecting and       Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of       2018 (S. 3405), and we urge the Senate to approve the       legislation.        Founded in 1913, IME is the safety and security institute       for the commercial explosives industry, a charge we do not       take lightly, as evidenced by the industry's excellent       security track record and work with the Bureau of Alcohol,       Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, among other agencies. IME       represents manufacturers of commercial explosives and other       companies that distribute explosives or provide related       services. Commercial explosives are used in every state and       are distributed worldwide. The ability to manufacture and       distribute these products safely and securely is critical to       this industry and to the mining, construction, and oil & gas       industries that use our products. IME takes an active role in       promoting responsible practices through the full life cycle       of commercial explosives and regularly publishes, updates,       and distributes free of charge, our series of Safety Library       Publications (SLPs), including SLP 27, Security in       Manufacturing, Transportation, Storage and Use of Commercial       Explosives, to the benefit of our workers and the general       public.        Your leadership, as demonstrated by including improvements       identified during the June CFATS roundtable oversight hearing       which you chaired, is greatly appreciated. The commercial       explosives industry looks forward to work with you and the       Committee to reauthorize the CFATS program. We believe that       S. 3405 enhances national security while reducing blatantly       duplicative regulations; clearing the path for government to       focus resources on highest priority threats to our national       security while allowing industry to invest their time and       resources in a regulatory system that has proven to be       effective.        IME fully endorses S. 3405 and urge the Senate to pass this       common-sense solution without delay. We welcome the       opportunity to work with you to advance this important       legislation.            Respectfully,                                                       John Boling,                              Vice President of Government Affairs.     Having gone through all this work, all this oversight,  taking that responsibility seriously, I recently have been asked to  support a 1-year reauthorization of the program without any reforms.  Without any consultation, Secretary Nielsen just sent me a letter  completely ignoring the work our committee has done and informing of  her support for a ``short-term'' extension.   Today, I was told the House plans to pass not a 1-year but a 2-year  extension with no reforms. The House is claiming they cannot possibly  consider reforms because there is simply not enough time, because they  haven't done any oversight, because they didn't mark up a bill in this  Congress. Yet the House Committee on Homeland Security has had years to  act.   My committee did the work. We did act. Now I am being threatened with  a false choice: Either reauthorize the program as is, without much  needed reforms, or let it die. In fact, there is a much better third  choice: Pass S. 3405, the bill our committee passed unanimously, the  bill that provides unanimous reforms that strike the right balance  between security and efficiency.   Again, our committee did the work. We did act. And I have to tell all  my colleagues here, this is the only option I will support.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 670, S. 3405. I  further ask that the committee-reported substitute amendment be  withdrawn; the Johnson substitute amendment at the desk be considered  and agreed to; the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time  and passed; and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    I am happy to respond.   The Senator from Delaware is well aware that we have been working. We  have already agreed on three improvements from your standpoint. We  increase the frequency of inspections for companies participating in  CFATS recognition programs. We have added a third-party study to look  at how workers can be made more aware of the fact that their facilities  are covered by CFATS. We had a future GAO study to look back at how our  provision exempting explosive materials covered by both CFATS and ATF  is affecting the program.   We are already making movement. If you want to discuss this for a few  more days, fine. Time is, obviously, running out.   I do want to make everybody aware of the fact that because we have  done this work, because we have passed this out of our committee  unanimously, I am not in any way, shape or form, accepting some of the  typifications in terms of the fact that we have not communicated. We  have been trying for months to work with the House. There has just been  no yield whatsoever. There has been no give whatsoever. There has been  very little desire on its part to do anything other than to have a  ``take it or leave it,'' a ``let's extend this,'' a ``no reforms.''  That is, simply, unacceptable to me.   I have great respect for President Ronald Reagan. I don't want to  prove him wrong. I, actually, want to reauthorize this thing. Yet if we  can't come to an agreement with a reformed, reauthorized CFATS Program,  I am more than willing to prove Ronald Reagan wrong when he said, to  paraphrase, that the closest thing to eternal life on this Earth is a  government program. I will let the program expire because I really do  not think it really enhances the security of our Nation. It, certainly,  has not been proven in that way, and without reforms, I am happy to let  this program go by the way of the dinosaur.   I yield the floor.    Will the Senator yield?    Again, I am happy to do that, but we have not had that  kind of engagement. Right now, there is, basically, a gun to my head,  threatening me to take it or leave it. That is not collegial, and that  is not a very high-integrity approach. I am happy to sit down. Let's  continue working on this thing. This program needs reforms. We have  done the work, and I think that work needs to be recognized and  respected. Again, let's sit down and get our staffs together on this,  and let's reauthorize and reform the CFATS Program.    Will the Senator please yield?    Had the House put an ounce of effort--of work--into  this, I would have something to respect, but they have done nothing  other than, basically, just to threaten me with these types of tactics.  So, again, let's work together. Let's provide a product that we can  present to the House and that they can pass.    Mr. President, I am not withdrawing my unanimous consent  request. He can object to it, and we will work with him, but I will not  consider that the final say. We will work in very good faith to come up  with something better and come back to the floor, hopefully, with a  bill that we have agreed to.    The objection is taken in that spirit.
