 Madam Speaker, I pose a few questions to my friends and  colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   You certainly cannot be okay with criminals continuously being able  to access guns.   You can't be okay with terrorists being able to buy guns.   You can't be okay with sociopaths continuing to buy guns.   You certainly can't be okay with what has happened in Uvalde; before  that, Buffalo; what just happened in Tulsa, Sandy Hook, Parkland.   So if you are not okay with that, why the inaction? Why do you  continue to prevent commonsense gun safety legislation that would stop  sociopaths, terrorists, and criminals from obtaining weapons? Why don't  you work with us to pass commonsense legislation that, in many cases,  over 90 percent of the public supports?   So many gun owners that I have talked to all across north Texas,  people that are on the opposite end of the political spectrum to me,  tell me that they support this commonsense gun safety legislation.   You continue to show inaction to the American public. It is  unacceptable. We have got to do better. We have an opportunity to get  something done this time around, and it is about time. The American  public is sick of seeing nothing occur every time one of these  massacres takes place in our country.   Madam Speaker, I urge our Republican colleagues to work with us on  passing legislation that is long overdue and that the public is asking  for. We can't continue to watch this happen and do nothing. We need to  take action.
