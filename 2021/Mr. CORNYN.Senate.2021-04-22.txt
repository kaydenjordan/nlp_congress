 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a  cosponsor to this amendment.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, over the last few months, we have been  spending a lot of time talking about the surge of migrants at our  southern border and, as the Presiding Officer knows, we are having  bipartisan meetings here to try to figure out how to address that and  other challenges of our broken immigration system.   We know the spike in migration is not a new phenomenon, and sadly,  neither is the increase in the number of unaccompanied children. But  the current surge is unlike anything we have experienced in the past.  We are breaking all the wrong kinds of records, including the numbers  of unaccompanied children, total monthly border crossings, and capacity  levels at care facilities. And, of course, all of this is happening  during a pandemic which creates serious risks for our law enforcement  and for those caring for these migrants and for the migrants  themselves.   Unfortunately, the administration has not yet figured out how to stop  this flow of illegal immigration. The President and his team are  telling migrants: Don't come. But when it comes to his policies, all of  his policies say: Come while you can.   They haven't figured out how to replace Trump-era policies, and so  what they have done is left a void that is being exploited by everybody  from the coyotes, the human smugglers, the people who smuggle in drugs  into the United States, as well as the people who understandably want a  better life. Maybe they are fleeing poverty or violence. We all  understand why people want to come to the United States, but we also  believe the safest and fairest sort of immigration policy is legal  immigration into our country.   We are the most generous country in the world. We have naturalized  about a million people a year. It is one of our comparative advantages  compared to the rest of the world that restricts migration. Over the  last few months, like many of us, I have spent a lot of time listening  and learning from the folks on the ground in Texas who know the ins and  outs of this topic better than anybody else.   I have visited border communities and heard from Border Patrol  officers, mayors, county judges, and nongovernmental organizations that  try to help these migrants once they make their way to the United  States, and whose experience precedes this current surge.   I visited five of the facilities in Texas that are helping take care  of the record number of migrant children in Carrizo Springs, Donna,  Houston, Midland, and Dallas. I have heard about the heartbreaking  circumstances under which many of these children have arrived on our  doorsteps. I have seen the incredible ways that our nongovernmental  organizations, like Catholic Charities, are trying to ease the burden  of this crisis, even after a year of supporting their communities  through a global pandemic.   The reality of this situation is that we are quickly nearing a  breaking point. We lack the facilities, the personnel, the resources,  and the policies needed to manage this crisis. Law enforcement in  border communities are being overwhelmed by the sharp increase in  migration, and unless something changes, the entire system could  collapse.   The light is flashing red, and the time for action is now. That is  why today I am proud to introduce the bipartisan Border Solutions Act,  along with Senator Sinema, to address this crisis.   It is no accident that both of us represent border States and that  both of us have heard from our communities and stakeholders on the  ground about how important it is for Congress to step up and provide  some way to mitigate the current crisis.   On the House side, we have two of my friends in the Texas  delegation--Congressmen Henry Cuellar, from Laredo, and Tony Gonzales,  who represents one of the largest border districts in the country. So  we truly have a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation.   Our knowledge of this crisis doesn't just come from the news or  political talking points but, as I suggested, from real conversations  with the real people who are dealing with this and have dealt with  previous surges. We have heard from State and local leaders, law  enforcement, NGOs, as I said, and a range of property owners whose  property is being overrun by the coyotes and those who are involved in  this illegal immigration process. So their input has been the driving  force behind the bill, which includes, I believe, commonsense measures  to address this crisis.   It is not, admittedly, a comprehensive immigration bill, but we need  to put the fire out first and then build on our success, once we have  passed that legislation, to do the other things that I think we can  probably agree on, on a consensus basis, such as we discussed with the  majority leader and others last evening   The Bipartisan Border Solutions Act is not about scoring political  points. It is about solving a problem, and that problem is getting  bigger every day. The most immediate problem is our inability to  properly process the sheer number of people crossing our border.   Our Border Patrol and Health and Human Services, and the Office of  Refugee Resettlement are simply overwhelmed. In March, we saw the  highest number of border crossings on record: 172,000 individuals. That  was a dramatic increase from the eye-popping numbers in February, which  totaled 100,000.   As I said, we have seen these surges before but never a surge like  this magnitude. Now, the busiest months for people to cross the border  typically are April, May, and June but not February and not March. So  we know that this is only going to get worse based on our historical  experience.   If our facilities and people are already overwhelmed, imagine how the  strain will intensify if we do nothing. We already know that, in  processing these migrants, important steps are being skipped in an  effort to expedite the process.   Normally, if someone comes across the border seeking asylum, for  example, they will be processed and released with a notice to appear  for a future court hearing. That document includes important  information like when and where their first court date is set. In many  cases, right now, it just isn't happening.   Many migrants are being released in the interior of the United States  with incomplete paperwork, and they are not given any notice to appear  for a future immigration court date. And, you know, if they don't show  up in court, a  [[Page S2174]]  default order of deportation will be entered even if they have a  meritorious claim for asylum. So it has real consequences.   But what else can our government officials and our local communities  do? Unfortunately, they do not want us to continue releasing people to  the interior without a court date or information on what is needed in  order to assert your claim. And as I said, without appearing in court,  a migrant with a valid asylum claim won't be able to receive the relief  that U.S. law provides for them.   At one point, the situation was so bad, the Biden administration  considered flying migrants to less busy locations on the northern  border to be processed. So there is really no question we need to  improve our capacity and our process to handle these migrants more  thoroughly and efficiently.   Our bipartisan bill here in the Senate and in the House will  establish four regional processing centers in high-traffic areas along  the border to streamline the intake of migrants. One reason that is so  important, just beyond capacity issues, is that the smugglers who  smuggle people into the United States for a price--part of  transnational criminal organizations--they make a lot of money doing  this, and they are smart. They know if they flood the zone with  unaccompanied children, that the Border Patrol will go offline in order  to take care of those children, which we want those children taken care  of. But what the smugglers know and what the transnational criminal  organizations know is once those Border Patrol come off the frontline,  they are going to exploit that loophole by running drugs into the  United States or more migrants.   Last year alone--or the last 12 months alone, 88,000 Americans have  died from drug overdoses. And 92 percent of the heroin that comes into  the United States comes from Mexico, together with a lot of  methamphetamine, fentanyl, cocaine, and you name it. So we are dealing  with incredibly shrewd and crafty people who understand the border  perhaps better than most of us do.   One of the worst parts of the current crisis is the tens of thousands  of unaccompanied children who are making the dangerous trip from  Central America or Mexico without their parents. Many of us have seen  the heartbreaking video of a young boy, abandoned by smugglers in the  Rio Grande Valley, and he was asking for directions because he was  lost. Smugglers left him behind. I don't know why. Maybe he was injured  or ill or slowing them down, but these smugglers don't care about this  young boy or any other human being. All they care about is the money.   And we have also read the story about a young girl who drowned trying  to cross the river. And who can forget the young girls, ages 3 and 5,  who literally were dropped over the border wall by human smugglers?   The truth is, migrant children endure unimaginable abuse and trauma  in the hands of these criminal organizations. We need to try better,  and we need to do better to provide protections to these children and  ensure that they will not continue to be traumatized or abused once  they cross our borders.   For example, our bill also provides that children cannot be released  into the custody of a relative or sponsor who could potentially inflict  even more harm upon them. No sex offender, no child abuser, and no  other dangerous criminal should be given the responsibility to care for  one of these children.   We also need to remove some of the pull factors that encourage  migrants to make this dangerous journey to our border in the first  place. Many smugglers, known colloquially as coyotes, know our  immigration laws better than most Americans, and they know how to  exploit them, as I said.   There is no doubt our backlogged legal system is one of the pull  factors for these migrants. One of the biggest selling points for the  smugglers is the immigration court backlog, which is currently 1.3  million cases. On average, it takes 2\1/2\ years to get from the border  to an immigration judge.   A person or family can come here illegally and present weak or  virtually nonexistent asylum claims with an almost certain guarantee  that they will be able to stay in the United States for years while  their claims are being adjudicated. That needs to change. Our  legislation takes a number of steps to reduce the wait times and  eliminate the backlog as a draw for even more illegal immigration and  ensure that meritorious claims are recognized in a timely manner.   The first part of this is, we need to hire more people. We need more  immigration judges. We need more asylum officials. We need litigation  teams and other staff who play a role in these legal proceedings. The  only way to eliminate this backlog is to work through it, and this bill  allows us to hire hundreds of people to do just that.   Our legislation includes another important change to remove this  backlog as a pull factor. During surge events like we are experiencing  now, the cases of those arriving will be prioritized. In other words,  we will put them at the front of line, not the back of the line where  we will never get to them. For those with legitimate asylum claims,  that should be good news. About 10 or 12 percent of the people who show  up on our front doormat have legitimate asylum claims that are upheld  by immigration judges, and we should provide them a timely hearing in  front of a judge so they can receive the benefit of U.S. law.   But this will also serve as a deterrent for those who know their  asylum claims are weak. Why pay smugglers thousands of dollars to reach  the United States if your case will quickly be heard and dismissed for  lack of merit resulting in your return? That is one of the pull factors  that we can establish and we can improve to deter people from wasting  their hard-earned money with nonexistent or weak asylum claims.   And, finally, the bill will ensure that migrants are treated fairly  and humanely so we can be confident that our asylum system is working  as we intended. This legislation includes a large number of other  commonsense measures to alleviate staffing shortages, improve  coordination between Federal, State, and local officials, expand  language translation and legal orientation services for migrants, and  the list goes on.   Former Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost once described this surge in  migration as like holding a bucket under the faucet. It doesn't matter  how many buckets you have if you can't turn off the water. In the short  term, we do need a bigger bucket. That includes facilities to process  these migrants and personnel to adjudicate their asylum claims. But it  won't matter how big that bucket is if we don't stop the flow or at  least reduce it.   We need to eliminate the pull factors that encourage migrants who do  not qualify under our law for asylum from even attempting the dangerous  journey to our border in the first place. That is exactly why the  Bipartisan Border Solutions Act is the answer or an answer to the  crisis at hand.   This bill will deter illegal immigration without interfering with  legitimate claims. It will ensure that migrants' claims are processed  efficiently, without skipping important steps, and it will provide  critical protections for children who come here alone.   The fact that we have a bill that is bipartisan and bicameral is a  testament to the commonsense reforms included in this legislation, and  I have been proud to work with Senator Sinema, Congressman Cuellar, and  Congressman Gonzales on this bill, and we would invite our colleagues  to look at the bill and join us in cosponsoring it on a bipartisan  basis.   Now, one thing I can guarantee is this is not the end-all, be-all.  This is not some silver bullet that is going to solve all of our  problems, but what I think it will do is help restore public confidence  that we are serious about enforcing our laws, while remaining generous  in providing legal claims the benefit of a hearing and validation.   We are, in fact, the most generous Nation in the world when it comes  to legal immigration--naturalizing, roughly, a million people a year.  But the truth is, my State and all our States, those of us on this bill  currently, have borne the brunt of this crisis because of the failures  of the Federal Government to deal with them.   So we have developed a list of bipartisan cosponsors, and I hope the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee and  [[Page S2175]]  the minority leader will commit to working with us to solve this crisis  in a fair and humane way.   And the last thing I will say is, we are all ears if somebody has a  better idea, but so far we haven't seen anybody step up and say: I have  got an answer or at least a partial answer or response that has  bipartisan and bicameral support.   So I hope our colleagues will take a look at this, will work with us,  and if they have got a better idea, as I said, we are all ears                            ____________________
