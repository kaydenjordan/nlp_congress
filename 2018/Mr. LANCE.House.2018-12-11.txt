 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on  this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of the PREEMIE  Reauthorization Act. My partner in this effort over several years has  been the distinguished Congresswoman from California, Anna Eshoo.   There may be no greater calling than to help infants thrive in the  early days of their lives. Working together and getting this  legislation signed into law is a matter of essential importance. This  is good and important work and the kind of positive difference Federal  efforts can make in the lives of many.    We have a tremendous partner in the March of Dimes. For many  families, the March of Dimes and its network and advocates across the  country are beacons of light at dark moments. I thank the March of  Dimes and their supporters for being the great defenders and fighters  for mothers and for their infants.   This legislation will keep up the momentum to help pregnant women. We  need to reauthorize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's  research and data collection efforts and improve the Health Resources  and Services Administration. Doctors and the public need to have the  best information and care options available, and this bill does that.
