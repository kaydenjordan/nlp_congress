 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters for  this opportunity.   I rise in support of this resolution and join my colleagues in  opposition to the Trump administration's new rule that weakens  implementation of the Community Reinvestment Act.   It is an outrage that the Trump administration's OCC issued this rule  that guts a historic law in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic.   To add insult to injury, former Chairman Otting resigned his post  immediately after issuing the rule so that he will avoid cleaning up  the fallout from this mess. It is up to Congress to clean it up, and  that is what we are seeking to do.   The Community Reinvestment Act was enacted more than 40 years ago and  has been one of our most powerful tools against redlining and the  perpetration of systemic racism and poverty.   Like so much of our country's history, the story of the CRA runs  through Chicago, where a local community organizer in the Austin  neighborhood, Gale Cincotta, led the fight against discriminatory  housing injustice and earned the nickname ``Mother of the CRA.''  Through her work with her neighborhood association and National  People's Action, Cincotta fought against redlining and disinvestment  from our communities using some of the innovative and confrontational  tactics that we recognize in today's protest movements.   My district is a working-class immigrant district, and Gale Cincotta  and organizers like her across the country fought to pass the CRA so  that communities like mine would not be left behind by financial  institutions.   The OCC's rule allows lenders to count activities that have nothing  to  [[Page H2576]]  do with improving our neighborhoods toward their requirements to serve  low- and moderate-income communities, decrease transparency, and make  it even harder to hold these institutions accountable. That is why we  oppose it.
