 Mr. Speaker, the Moving Forward Act marks a  transformational investment in America's infrastructure that will  create millions of jobs and take bold action on the climate crisis.   In case anybody forgot, 2020 began with one of the worst wildfires in  the history of the world, devastating 45 million acres in Australia.  And now fires are raging in Siberia, and the temperature in the Arctic  Circle actually hit a record 100 degrees Fahrenheit. So it is past time  for Congress to act.   This is such a comprehensive bill. I want to thank Chairman DeFazio  for also including the Motor Vehicle Safety Title, and I include in the  Record a report from Consumer Reports on the lifesaving impact the  Motor Vehicle Safety Title will have.                   [From Consumer Reports, June 29, 2020]   Safety First--Car Crashes, Innovation, and Why Federal Policy Should         Prioritize Adoption of Existing Technologies to Save Lives                              Executive Summary         To provide a guide for policymakers and the auto industry       on how best to substantially and expeditiously reduce road       crashes, deaths, and injuries, this study analyzed the safety       benefits of currently available crash avoidance systems and       other existing motor vehicle safety technologies, including a       review of the safety research that has been conducted on the       topic. The focus of this analysis was the publicly available       fatality reduction benefits of safety technologies       extrapolated to the entire U.S. light vehicle fleet--with       systems evaluated that exist today, as opposed to creating       estimates of effectiveness based on simulated or idealized       technology. The analysis found that currently available       automatic emergency braking (AEB), lane departure warning       (LDW), blind spot warning (BSW), and pedestrian detection       technologies would be expected to combine for fatality       reductions of 11,800 lives per year once fully adopted       fleetwide. Two safety applications of V2V communications       technolog--intersection movement assist (IMA) and left turn       assist (LTA)--would be estimated to save more than 1,300       lives per year with full fleet adoption. One existing drunk       driving prevention technology, the Driver Alcohol Detection       System for Safety (DADSS), would be estimated to save 3,700-      7,400 lives under the scenarios assessed. Summed together,       existing motor vehicle safety technology would save 16,800-      20,500 lives per year if equipped across the full U.S. light       vehicle fleet. This totals approximately one-half of the       36,560 lives lost on U.S. roads in 2018. Therefore, to cut       roadway fatalities in half, policymakers should prioritize       requiring and setting strong performance standards for       existing vehicle safety technologies, and automakers should       equip effective systems standard across all trim lines of       their models as soon as possible.                                 Introduction         The United States faces a road safety crisis. In recent       years, motor vehicle crashes in the U.S. have accounted for       at least 36,000 deaths and 2.5 million injuries per year:       These crashes are the leading cause of death in the first       three decades of Americans' lives,  [[Page H2936]]       and they cost the nation an estimated $800 billion in direct       and indirect expenses per year.        Substantial reductions in motor vehicle deaths, injuries,       and crashes will be required for the U.S. to achieve a       transportation system in which people can readily get around       without fear that they or their loved ones will not make it       to their destination. As part of the pursuit of safer roads,       a suite of technologies has developed through auto industry       innovation that, over time, will revolutionize the       experience--and the safety--of driving a car. Various       existing crash avoidance systems are capable of automatically       applying the brakes to avoid a crash, warning drivers of a       vehicle in their blind spot, or detecting a pedestrian       crossing the street. These technologies are all on cars       today, providing major proven safety benefits to consumers.        To provide a guide for policymakers and the auto industry       on how best to substantially and expeditiously reduce road       crashes, deaths, and injuries, this study analyzed the       fatality reduction benefits of currently available crash       avoidance systems and other existing motor vehicle safety       technologies, including a review of the safety research that       has been conducted on the topic. The estimated lives saved on       U.S. roads depends greatly on the choices made by       policymakers; specifically, whether they choose to prioritize       mandating existing crash avoidance systems or expediting the       future deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) as envisioned       under previous legislation.                                  Background         For vehicle safety technologies to deliver in full on their       lifesaving potential, they must--by definition--be standard       equipment on all vehicles on our roads. It is also critical       for there to be strong performance requirements for these       technologies, so that safety innovation leads to systems that       consumers can trust to function when they need them.        Today, the U.S. still is far from these goals with respect       to crash avoidance technologies. Automatic emergency braking       (AEB), a version of which major automakers voluntarily       committed to equip standard on virtually all passenger       vehicles by 2022, now comes standard on just 67% of 2020       vehicle models more than four years after the commitment was       made. Pedestrian detection, an enhancement of AEB, comes       standard on 61% of 2020 models, while lane departure warning       (LDW) and blind spot warning (BSW) lag behind at only 49% and       29%, respectively. Furthermore, there are no current laws or       regulations in the U.S. requiring automakers to equip their       vehicles with lifesaving crash avoidance systems, nor are       there any requirements specifying how well the systems must       perform.        Several members of Congress have sought to use federal       policy to accelerate auto industry safety innovation and       ensure consumers continuously gain greater access to the       benefits of crash avoidance systems. For example, a bill       recently introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, the       21st Century Smart Cars Act, would require systems including       AEB with pedestrian detection, LDW, and BSW to come standard       on all new cars and to meet mandatory performance standards.       Another new bill, the Five Stars for Safe Cars Act, would       require upgrades to the government's New Car Assessment       Program (NCAP) so that it accounts for these and other auto       safety systems, including through the development of new       National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) test       procedures, devices, fixtures, and performance metrics.        There also has been significant manufacturer, investor,       media, and government attention in recent years devoted to       the role of vehicles with enhanced driving automation       systems, the most advanced of which are known colloquially as       A Vs or self-driving cars. AVs offer enormous potential to       improve safety and mobility by substantially reducing the       road crashes attributable to driver error. Similar to what is       needed for existing crash avoidance technologies, rigorous       performance requirements are essential for driving automation       systems to reach their full potential.        Currently, the real safety benefits A Vs will deliver for       consumers are largely unknown. These systems generally are       not yet commercially available, and public trust in A Vs is       low, with Americans somewhat optimistic about the future of       the vehicles while wary of the technology today. In addition,       there have been fatal crashes involving driving automation       systems, with the National Transportation Safety Board       publishing detailed crash investigation reports that found       insufficient safety protocols in place.        In 2017 and 2018, federal legislation was considered in       each chamber of Congress that would have expedited the       deployment of AVs on U.S. roads for commercial use--without       requiring completion of any mandatory standards or       performance requirements regulating the safety of these       vehicles. The legislation's approach to vehicle safety was       the target of significant criticism, including by CR, and       the bills were not approved before the end of the 115th       Congress.        Instead of establishing meaningful requirements for AVs to       provide greater occupant protection and crash avoidance       capabilities, the 2017-2018 legislation would have required       only that AVs provide a level of safety the same as the       average car on the road. For example, the House's SELF DRIVE       Act would have permitted AVs in commerce that could be exempt       from one or more federal motor vehicle safety standards if       they had ``an overall safety level at least equal to the       overall safety level of nonexempt vehicles.'' Nonexempt       vehicles--in other words, vehicles on the road today--      currently have the safety performance of more than 36,000       deaths, 2.5 million injuries, and 6 million crashes per year.                                 Methodology         Fatality reduction benefits were examined for four existing       crash avoidance technologies: automatic emergency braking       (AEB), lane departure warning (LOW), blind spot warning       (BSW), and pedestrian detection. Additionally, the fatality       reduction benefits of two safety applications for vehicle-to-      vehicle (V2V) communications technologies, as well as one       drunk driving prevention technology, were investigated. The       focus of this analysis was limited to the publicly available       fatality reduction benefits of safety technologies       extrapolated to the entire U.S. light-duty motor vehicle       fleet of about 250 million vehicles--with systems evaluated       that exist today, as opposed to creating estimates of       effectiveness based on simulated or idealized technology.        Recently, the National Highway Traffic Safety       Administration (NHTSA) conducted a comprehensive meta-      analysis on three of these technologies: AEB, LOW, and BSW.       NHTSA's analysis expanded on the work done by Leslie et al.       (2019), which estimated the effectiveness of crash avoidance       systems currently equipped on General Motors vehicles. In       order to translate these effectiveness rates into fatality       reductions, the agency expanded on the work done by Wang et       al. (2019), adding consideration for already expected       fatality reduction from existing technologies such as       electronic stability control (ESC).        Absent from the agency's meta-analysis are the estimated       safety benefits of pedestrian detection. However, in 2017       NHTSA published a report detailing the expected fatality       reduction from full fleet adoption of this technology. This       research was performed with then-available pedestrian       detection technology, and the effectiveness estimate was       derived from test-track evaluations of the systems combined       with contemporary observed crash scenarios and injury risk       curves. Further, this report focused only on two prominent       vehicle-pedestrian crash scenarios, which accounted for 60%       of all fatal pedestrian crashes. Since the publication of       this report, pedestrian detection technologies have improved;       however, in order to stay consistent with the selected       analysis inclusion criteria and more conservative estimates,       researchers chose to use the figures from 2017.        In addition to the four crash avoidance technologies AEB,       LDW, BSW, and pedestrian detection, researchers examined the       expected fatality reduction benefits of two safety       applications of vehicle-to-vehicle        (V2V) communications technology, as well as one drunk       driving prevention technology, if fully adopted throughout       the U.S. light vehicle fleet. While these two technologies       are not currently widespread on roads, they are the subject       of years of extensive testing and they offer a clear path to       saving lives.        To stay consistent with the selected approach to estimate       only the more conservative potential of these safety       technologies, just two V2V safety applications were used.       These two applications--intersection movement assist (IMA)       and left turn assist (LTA)--are those that NHTSA used in its       expected benefit analysis for its notice of proposed       rulemaking to require V2V-capable systems on all new cars,       which was finalized in late 2016 and formally published in       early 2017.i While additional V2V safety applications have       since been analyzed, this report only includes the       aforementioned two applications in the benefits analysis for       V2V because these two applications address hazards that would       not be addressed by other existing crash avoidance       technologies.        Additionally, researchers examined potential reduction in       road deaths through the use of drunk driving prevention       technology. An analysis of NHTSA's Fatality Analysis       Reporting System (FARS) was used to estimate the lives that       could be saved if one technology, the Driver Alcohol       Detection System for Safety (DADSS), prevented drivers from       operating the vehicle if they had a Blood Alcohol       Concentration (BAC) of 0.08 or higher. Two estimates were       produced: an upper estimate based on the FARS analysis, and a       lower estimate that was established by reducing that value by       half.        Researchers evaluated the fatality reduction benefits of       DADSS because the technology has been the subject of the most       extensive testing and published research among drunk driving       prevention technologies. Alternative approaches, such as       those based on the use of systems that monitor a driver's       performance, may also prove effective at detecting impairment       and preventing or limiting vehicle operation by drunk       drivers.        The target crash populations that would be addressed by       DADSS are separate from the target crash populations that       would benefit from AEB, LDW, BSW, pedestrian detection, or       V2V (e.g., in the fatality reduction benefits analyses for       these five technologies, all impaired driving crashes were       excluded). Therefore, the two technology effectiveness       estimates for DADSS (i.e., the upper estimate and lower       estimate) were added to the estimates of the other       technologies in order to determine an overall number of       expected lives saved if the technologies were fully adopted       throughout the U.S. light vehicle  [[Page H2937]]       fleet. These estimates can be summed because their crash       populations are exclusive, with no fatal crashes potentially       double-counted by the individual technology effectiveness       analyses.        A review of the papers on A Vs found no on-road research       establishing that vehicles driving themselves freely on fully       public roads provide a safety benefit compared to vehicles       operated traditionally by a human driver under the same       circumstances. While some AV developers report that they have       driven their vehicles many miles without crashes, their       detailed safety data is rarely, if ever, made public. The       specific conditions under which these vehicles are tested are       also not public, and potentially are unrepresentative of the       conditions these vehicles would encounter if deployed       nationally.                                   Results         The analysis found that currently available AEB, LDW, and       BSW technologies would be expected to combine for fatality       reductions of approximately 11,000 lives per year once fully       adopted throughout the U.S. light-duty motor vehicle fleet.       Currently available pedestrian detection technologies would       be expected to prevent at least an additional 800 fatalities       per year once equipped on every light vehicle, as well.       Additional research outside of this analysis has found that       with reasonable system improvements, more than 3,500 lives       could be saved annually by pedestrian detection; however,       this number was not used in the analysis as the authors of       this additional research assumed idealized systems. Two       safety applications of V2V communications technology--      intersection movement assist (IMA) and left turn assist       (LTA)--would be estimated to save more than 1,300 lives per       year with full fleet adoption. One existing drunk driving       prevention technology, the Driver Alcohol Detection System       for Safety (DADSS), would be estimated to save 3,700-7,400       lives under the scenarios assessed.        Summed together, these figures led researchers to conclude       that existing motor vehicle safety technology would save       16,800-20,500 lives per year if equipped across the full U.S.       light-duty motor vehicle fleet. This totals approximately       one-half of the 36,560 lives lost on U.S. roads in 2018.                                  Conclusion         This analysis makes clear that the path to substantially       and expeditiously reducing the enormous toll of U.S. road       crashes runs squarely through the full, fleetwide adoption of       currently available crash avoidance technologies and other       existing motor vehicle safety technologies. An alternative       approach--prioritizing the expedited deployment of AVs that       meet the minimum level of safety envisioned by Congress--      cannot be analytically supported given the lack of available       evidence establishing on-road safety benefits to vehicles       that drive themselves compared to traditionally-driven       vehicles.        Policymakers in Congress and at NHTSA should prioritize       requiring and setting strong performance standards for these       existing, lifesaving vehicle safety technologies to       accelerate auto industry safety innovation and ensure       consumers continuously gain greater access to the benefits of       the technologies. Automakers should prioritize equipping       effective versions of these features standard across all trim       lines of their models as soon as possible and continuing to       improve these technologies' safety benefits over time. Delay       by either the government or manufacturers would unduly leave       people at risk and effectively let essential auto industry       innovations go to waste.
