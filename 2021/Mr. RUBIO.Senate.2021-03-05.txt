 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1026 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of  debate equally divided.    Mr. President, I think we can all agree we have kids in  America who need to be in school who haven't been in school over a year  now, in some cases.   The science is clear that you can open up schools safely. Now, I know  different districts have different challenges about opening up. This  bill provides money for everybody to open up. We don't want to change  that. We want to help every district.   Under my amendment, every district in the country would get money,  but the more days of the week you are open, the more money you are  going to get, which makes all the sense in the world. If you are going  to open 4 days a week, you shouldn't have as much money as a district  that is going to open 5 days a week.   The purpose of the money that is being provided is so that schools  can fund the cost of opening safely. All this amendment tries to do is  create an incentive for these districts to open up more days because we  do have unions--to be fair, not all, but we do have teachers unions in  this country that are saying they are not going back until next year,  even if they are vaccinated, even if all the measures are put in place.   We have a crisis in this country. We have seen now a surge in mental  health problems, with young people showing up at hospitals, and across  the country, it is a terrible situation, not to mention the year of  lost learning. This amendment incentivizes us to get our kids back in  school.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    This is important to the intelligence community. I ask  that no one be a fly in the ointment here.
