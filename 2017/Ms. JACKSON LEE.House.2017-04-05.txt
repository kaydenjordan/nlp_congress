 Mr. Speaker, I rise as a mother. As I looked at the  video of young children trying to survive, trying to live in Syria-- this is one of the most potent pictures--I had to come and cry out for  the mothers and children of that vile and heinous act.   I am calling upon Americans and this government to stop talking and  to act, to begin to demand that Russia stop assisting President Assad-- himself a terrorist--against his people and begin to understand that  the chemical attack was driven by Assad's bombers.   No matter where it might have been, you have to know that families  are here.   To my Syrian neighbors in Houston, Texas, we are standing with you.  We must find a resolution.   Even as we are investigating Russian collusion and Russian  investigation into elections, the President must say to Vladimir Putin  to become a world citizen and not a thug. This is thuggish. We are  killing people.   The Syrian people and Syria deserve to live. We must stand up and  fight together, and I hope that we will immediately be able to respond  to this with the United Nations, with our surrounding neighbors, and  with legislation that brings sanctions against Russia and Assad.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Women's Caucus  Chairs: Susan Brooks and Lois Frankel, for hosting this bipartisan  special order focused on the Achievements and Importance of Women in  Congress.   I am proud to be a Woman Member of Congress representing the great  state of Texas.   And, as a member of the Women's Caucus, I am proud to be an original  co-sponsor of Congresswoman Brooks' commemorative resolution which  honors the life and legacy of the first woman to serve in i the United  States Congress, Jeannette Pickering Rankin, on the l00th anniversary  of her swearing-in to Congress, who famously said ``I may be the first  woman in Congress, but I won't be the last.''   It is critical today that we take pause to highlight the importance  and contributions of women Members in Congress; as well as:   1. Recognize the importance of the Suffragette Movement in achieving  opportunities for women;   2. Emphasize the imperative of promoting education for women in STEM;  and   3. Affirm our nation's commitment to expanding opportunities for  women in my home state of Texas and across the country.   This year marks the 100th anniversary of the first woman being  elected to Congress, Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana.   This resolution is a fitting way to honor Representative Rankin's  legacy, and to celebrate the many contributions of the female lawmakers  who have succeeded her in this institution.  [[Page H2740]]    Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer who broke barriers throughout her  lifetime and whose example continues to inspire women the world over.   She graduated from the University of Montana with a biology degree in  1902.   She later became active in the women's suffrage movement, organizing  the New York Women's Suffrage Party and working for the National  American Woman Suffrage Association.   In 1916, Representative Rankin became the first woman elected to  Congress, even before the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which  guaranteed the right to vote to women.   For all of her contributions to women's rights, to political  activism, and to this institution, it is only fitting to pay tribute to  her achievements.   This year also marks the 45th anniversary of the first woman in her  own right to represent Texas in the House of Representatives,  Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.   In 1972, Congresswoman Jordan, was the first African American elected  to the Texas Senate after Reconstruction, and the first Southern  African-American woman elected to the United States House of  Representatives.   Congresswoman Barbara Jordan was a lawyer, educator, an American  politician, and a leader of the Civil Rights Movement.   Today, it is with great honor that I serve in my mentor and friend's  former seat, continuing to carry the torch she elevated for so many and  for so many years, representing the outstanding constituents of  Houston, Texas.   We tend to think that before the Women's and Civil Rights Movements  minority Americans had no ability to represent themselves in  government.   Despite the tremendous obstacles of intimidation and harassment that  was faced by these brave Americans, they sought and won election to  political office.   Prior to her election to Congress, Jordan taught political science at  Tuskegee Institute in Alabama for a year before passing the Texas State  bar in 1960 and starting a private law practice by which she served her  community with pride.   In 1994, President Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of  Freedom and The NAACP presented her with the Springarn Medal.   She was honored many times and was given over 20 honorary degrees  from institutions across the country, including Harvard and Princeton,  and was elected to the Texas and National Women's Halls of Fame.   Congresswomen Jordan and Rankin both dedicated their lives to the  pursuit of unfettered democracy so that we all could have a voice and  use it freely.   Shirley Chisholm became the first African American woman elected to  Congress, when she was elected to represent the New York's Twelfth  Congressional District in 1968 running on the slogan, ``Fighting  Shirley Chisholm--Unbought and Unbossed.''   She reflected that spirit well during her 14 years in Congress.   During her first term she spoke out for civil rights, women's rights,  the poor and against the Vietnam War.   Her first term in Congress was set against the backdrop of the Civil  Rights Movement and the women's movement for equal rights.   Shirley Chisolm had an understanding that during those turbulent  times the nation required a determined leader to represent the voice of  so many Americans who felt dismay at their treatment.   She took an extremely active role in changing the way women were to  be judged from that point on.   She remarked that, ``Women in this country must become  revolutionaries. We must refuse to accept the old, the traditional  roles and stereotypes.''   This is a sentiment that I myself take to heart, women in this nation  are now told they have a right to determine the kind of life they want  to lead; Shirley Chisholm was at the core of this movement.   On January 25, 1972, Chisholm announced her candidacy for president.   She stood before the cameras and in the beginning of her speech she  said:   ``I stand before you today as a candidate for the Democratic  nomination for the Presidency of the United States.   I am not the candidate of black America, although I am black and  proud.   I am not the candidate of the women's movement of this country,  although I am a woman, and I am equally proud of that. I am not the  candidate of any political bosses or special interests.   I am the candidate of the people.''   Shirley Chisholm did not win the nomination; but she went on to the  Democratic Convention in Miami and received 151 delegates' votes.   More than that, she demonstrated the will and determination of so  many Americans who had previously felt forgotten, she had lighted a  fire under so many who had felt disenfranchised.   I am glad to walk in their footsteps and will continue to encourage  women to uphold the principles they taught us to fight for and cherish.   Because Representative Rankin is a graduate of the sciences from a  rural area, encouraging participation in programs such as the Jeannette  Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program is the perfect way  to honor her legacy as a woman of the sciences and the first woman  elected to Congress, and to inspire the next generation of women and  minorities from rural areas to take up STEM fields.   Following in the footsteps of so many astounding role models, we must  continue to encourage women, particularly those from underserved  communities across the country, to participate in research and projects  in all academic fields, and specifically in the sciences.   Women and minorities have been and continue to be underrepresented in  STEM fields.   Although women make up 47% of the total U.S. labor force, they  comprise only 36% of the computing workforce, 24% of the engineering  workforce, and 18% of the advanced manufacturing workforce.   Indeed, minority representation in STEM fields is even lower, with  African-American and Latino workers comprising 29% of the general  workforce, but only 15% of the computing workforce, 12% of the  engineering workforce, and 6% of the advanced manufacturing workforce.   The Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program is  one way that we can address these glaring disparities.   The program awards grants to universities and institutions of higher  learning to distribute to eligible applicants, and they prioritize  projects and programs of particular relevance to USDA.   Recipient institutions have used these grants for worthy endeavors,  such as:   1. establishing a Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM  Fields Program fellowship program for women and minority high school  students in rural areas;   2. providing mentorship and hands-on, service-based learning to high  school students and undergraduates in particular STEM fields; and   3. offering mentoring services to current undergraduates to help them  successfully complete STEM-based degrees.   These women were in positions of great responsibility during times  when this nation was under a great burden.   The true greatness of their story is not just that they overcame the  oppression they faced, but that they had the courage to help remedy a  nation that in many ways had spited them.   They refused to bend their principles to the hatred they faced; they  were true pioneers in leadership.   They are my role models in Congress because they represent the kind  of leaders that America has always needed at times of adversity, they  had a spirit and a courage that could not be broken, they had a vision  of America that exceeded that of most of their peers.   I am very proud to be a Member of Congress and to follow in the  footsteps of giants like Jeannette Rankin, Barbara Jordan, and Shirley  Chisolm.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from the great State of Maryland, a well respected theorist and  professor who has been such an addition to the Committee on the  Judiciary.   Let me say something not out of arrogance or even difficult pride  because pride goes before the fall, but I do believe the Committee on  the Judiciary in this Congress--both the House and the Senate--has, at  this moment, the highest responsibility for truth. I don't think there  should be one moment of partisanship in our committee. Certainly I am  delighted to be here with you and the Congressional Progressive Caucus,  but we both serve on the Committee on the Judiciary, and our ranking  member, Mr. Conyers, is a member of the Congressional Progressive  Caucus. I believe that we are here, as was the Congressional Black  Caucus just a few days ago, because it really behooves us to be able to  speak to an important point that I think that I would like to make, a  brief point.   First, I would like to indicate that none of this reflects on Mr.  Gorsuch's personality, character, or standing as a member of the  judiciary who has served in the 10th Circuit for any number of years or  the many accolades that he received from colleagues, but it does go to  the question of the temperament and the ability to withstand the easy  way of making decisions where you feel most comfortable. That is not  the Supreme Court.   The Supreme Court is to be able to look at the proceedings of the  lower courts, but also the facts, and make decisions regardless of  where you stand politically in your former life or where you feel  comfortable in your philosophy. And so my concern, and the reason why I  think there is courageous actions by my colleagues in the other body as  they proceed to filibuster--and filibuster sounds like an ugly word. It  sounds like here they go again, what obstructionists. But let me be  very clear. I have had the privilege to either read about great  jurists, or I have either lived through that period of time, and they  were not all appointed by Democrats. I am certainly a great admirer of  Chief Justice Warren, who led the Court for a number of years, a  Republican, and certainly I have watched Justice Kennedy for a period  of time and many others. But listen to the Leadership Conference on  Civil Rights; I want to take their words: ``Judge Gorsuch's decade-long  record on the Federal bench, as well as his writings, speeches, and  activities throughout his career, demonstrate he is a judge with an  agenda. His frequent dissents and concurrences show he is out of the  mainstream of legal thought . . .''   Now when we say mainstream, we are not suggesting that we dictate  what he wants to do, but the mainstream is where the American people  are. They are on Main Street, no matter who they are.   ``. . . the mainstream of legal thought and unwilling to accept the  constructs of binding precedent and stare decisis''--that is a key  element, not willing to accept what has been accepted by so many-- ``when they dictate results he disfavors. If confirmed to the Supreme  Court, which is closely divided on many critical issues, Judge Gorsuch  would tip the balance in a direction that would undermine many of our  core rights and legal protections.''   So let me make these two points in joining my colleague. The most  indicting decision where Judge Gorsuch was in the dissent--let me see  if the American people can understand this decision where, in fact, if  I am correct, the gentleman prevailed in the lower court, I believe,  and this is the truck driver, the freezing truck driver who was  freezing one night when the cargo part of his big, huge 18-wheeler was  attached to a bad working--I am trying to be a trucker here now--cab  that he sits in. The brakes didn't work.                                time  1745    I know a lot of truckers, and that is absolutely zero. You just don't  drive--icy roads, freezing. He tried to wait on the repair guys. They  did not come. He knew that if he had attached the large part of the 18- wheeler that it would be dangerous, and he might lose his life. He  drove the cab off and he was fired. His legs had been freezing. He had  been there for a long period of time.   Judge Gorsuch wound up being the dissenter on a decision that favored  not somebody's personality or ``I am a union member judge.'' No. It was  about the fact that he said employers could just fire you for whatever  reason whatsoever.   The plaintiff has not been able to work for 7 years. It has impacted  his whole life. But the other members of the court thought that he had  a legitimate reason and did everything that he could. That is Main  Street.   My final point is that we are in a very unique and challenging time.  There are investigations going on regarding this administration, and we  really don't know where the truth will wind up.   There are suggestions by committees--not this Member or not the  distinguished Congressman that is on the floor here with me--that  crimes have been perpetrated, criminal acts, someone may go to jail. I  believe Judge Gorsuch should not be confirmed until we determine the  conclusion of the investigations against the Trump administration. This  is not biased. This is not about picking one side versus another.   I just want to remind my colleagues: Would it happen if it were  President Obama? Would it happen if it were President George W. Bush?  Would it happen if it were President Clinton? These are the Presidents  I have had the privilege of serving with. No, it would not.   You cannot be the person who selects the person to a lifelong  position on the Supreme Court and your whole administration, the  context of the White House, is totally under investigation, including  your former national security adviser for lying to the Vice President  of the United States of America, your allegations that your former  President wiretapped you, which has been disapproved by the FBI  Director. I don't think so, and I don't think we can go forward.   So I would say that the nomination of Judge Gorsuch should be  filibustered as it is. I am saddened by the fact that it has to be  filibustered. I would hope that Mr. McConnell could pull it down, that  the President would understand that the whole nomination process was  compromised. There was no consultation with the Democrats, as all  Presidents have done. And, frankly, we call it: We are not ready; we  are not prepared; we are unready, if you will, to go forward with a  nomination by this President who is under complete investigation by the  FBI and various intelligence agencies in the United States.
