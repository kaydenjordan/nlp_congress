 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote to  begin consideration of this year's National Defense Authorization Act.  The NDAA is our most significant opportunity to set priorities for  competition with adversaries like China and Russia.   It is our chance to keep the Biden administration focused on critical  missions, like rebuilding America's defense industrial base, instead of  the woke partisan agenda of political appointees. It is our time to lay  the groundwork of robust investments in hard power.   For 62 straight years, from the thick of the Cold War through the  Global War on Terror, the Senate has used the NDAA to match tailored  solutions to evolving national security challenges.   This year is no different. Ranking Member Wicker, Chairman Reed, and  our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee considered 445  amendments  [[Page S2969]]  and adopted 286 of them. Here on the floor, the full Senate should do  the same. Senate Republicans are committed to exceeding the President's  woefully inadequate defense budget request and delivering the resources  our Armed Forces actually require. So I expect the Democratic leader to  allow thorough consideration for a range of important amendments as we  begin that work with the NDAA.   First and foremost, I would like to remind all of our colleagues that  the No. 1 piece of business on the Senate's agenda is actually already  overdue. So it is especially important that we begin this process  without further delay.
