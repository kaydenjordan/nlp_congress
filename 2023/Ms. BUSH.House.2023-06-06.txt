 Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today in defense of  Social Security because Republicans are trying to take it away.   Regular, everyday people in our country have long been promised that  if you take a part of your paycheck and contribute to Social Security,  you will be able to retire with grace and with dignity and you will  have enough money to put food on the table, pay your bills, and keep  the heat on in the winter.   Nearly 65 million people rely on Social Security benefits, including  131,000 in my home State of Missouri. People with disabilities, retired  workers, and their dependents are relying on a fully funded Social  Security program.   Instead of strengthening and protecting Social Security, extreme MAGA  Republicans in D.C. want to end Social Security as we know it. We are  talking about taking away from folks who rely on these benefits, who  rely on what this government allows. They want to be able to attack  that.   People are already relying on Meals on Wheels. They rely on the  Circuit Breaker program. They rely on them in ways that they should  have because they have given their hearts and their souls to working  for this country. Every single day for decades here in this country,  they rely on the fully funded Social Security program that extreme MAGA  Republicans want to end.   They would rather protect gas stoves than protect retired workers or  protect seniors. We cannot and we will not allow this to happen. We  must ensure that lifesaving social programs are here to stay.   As Democrats, we are committed to strengthening Social Security. As  Democrats, we are committed to strengthening Medicare, to strengthening  the programs that everyday people in this country rely on.   We will continue to fight back against any extreme MAGA Republican  attempts to cut these lifesaving benefits. We believe in saving lives,  and we show up that way because we are Democrats.
