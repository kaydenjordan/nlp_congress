 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Women's Health Protection Act which will provide--in law--the right for  people to make their own reproductive healthcare decisions.    The Supreme Court's Dobbs opinion overturning abortion rights is  infuriating, it is heartbreaking, and it is dangerous.   For almost 50 years, the intensely personal decision about whether to  bear a child or have an abortion was where it belongs--with the person  who is pregnant.   I remember the days before Roe v. Wade when abortions done without  medical care could, and often did, have tragic consequences.   Colleagues, make no mistake: Overturning Roe will not end abortions.   Make no mistake: Taking away the right to abortion care will  disproportionately hurt families and individuals who are already  struggling, and disproportionately hurt people in rural areas who will  struggle to get the care they need.   My colleagues, if you believe life begins at conception, don't get an  abortion. But that is a belief, it is not science, and others do not  share it.   I don't think anyone over here would ever force someone with your  beliefs to get an abortion, but you are forcing your beliefs on others,  and that is wrong.   We need to restore personal freedom and put the decision about  whether or when to bear a child back where it belongs.   Today, I will enthusiastically vote for the Women's Health Protection  Act.
