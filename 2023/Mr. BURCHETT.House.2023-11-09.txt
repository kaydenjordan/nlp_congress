 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a dear friend of mine,  Ronald Davis, Sr., who passed away on October 17 at the age of 73.   Ron grew up in West Knoxville to a great, great family. He had six  siblings who all learned a love of nature and the outdoors of east  Tennessee from their father.   Ron became the first Black person to receive a bachelor of science  degree in forestry from the University of Tennessee. He was very  involved with his community and held several positions at the Tennessee  Valley Authority. He also cofounded the Minorities in Natural Resources  Conservation organization.   Ron is survived by his wife, Dr. Maxine Thompson Davis; his daughter,  Renee, who is a dear friend of mine; his sons, Ron and Khary; and his  brothers, Edward, Stanford, Stephen, and Teddy. Stephen and Teddy went  to Bearden High School where my mama had them in class.   Ron had eight wonderful grandchildren.   Ron was a good man. He was really a great man, Mr. Speaker. He was  always very kind to me, and he will be dearly missed. I miss seeing him  all the time at Wright's Cafeteria with his wife. Those days will be  gone forever.                            ____________________
