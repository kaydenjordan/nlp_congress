 Madam President, I recognize Zhon Keith  Butterfield, a fall 2023 intern with my gulf coast regional office, for  the hard work he has done for my office and the people of Florida.   Zhon is currently a student at St. Petersburg College, where he is  majoring in public policy and administration. He is a dedicated and  diligent worker who was devoted to getting the most out of his  internship experience.   I extend my deepest gratitude to Zhon for his work with my office,  and I look forward to hearing of his continued good work in the years  to come.                            ____________________
