 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the queen of rock  and roll, the incomparable Tina Turner.   She passed away yesterday at 83 years of age after a career so bold  and sparkling, we are unlikely to see another star so bright.   What did love have to do with it? Everything.   Tina Turner loved and owned her own story. She unveiled the trauma of  domestic violence and turned it into a strength felt by women across  the  [[Page H2613]]  world. She was a true ambassador of the Buddhist practice, showed  female artists how to take ownership of their brand, and she used music  to speak and captivate us.   She was a constituent of the 37th District, having lived in View  Park, the heart of my district. Her passing is a true loss to the  global community.   In this moment, she would probably say to Republicans: Don't hide  this weekend. Stay and do your job. The American people deserve more  from you. They work hard and don't deserve to be blamed, lied to, and  defaulted on by a dysfunctional Republican Party who can't get its act  together. Lead, don't bleed the American people.   No, wait, I said that.                            ____________________
