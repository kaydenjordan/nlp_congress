 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senator Risch, both to the White House counsel and  the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Question from Senator Cassidy and Senator Risch to both parties,  beginning with the President's counsel first:         We saw a video of Mr. Nadler saying: ``There must never be       a narrowly voted impeachment or an impeachment supported by       one of our major political parties and opposed by the other.       Such an impeachment will lack legitimacy, will produce       divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to       come, and will call into question the very legitimacy of our       political institutions.'' Given the well-known dislike of       some House Democrats for President Trump and the stated       desire of some to impeach before the President was       inaugurated, and the strictly partisan vote in favor of       impeachment, do the current proceedings typify that which Mr.       Nadler warned against 20 years ago?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question. The simple answer is yes. These are exactly the sort of  proceedings that Manager Nadler warned against 20 years ago. It was a  purely partisan impeachment. And it has been clear that at least some  factions on the other side of the aisle--the Democratic side of the  aisle--have been intent on finding some way to impeach the President  from the day he was sworn in and even before the day he was sworn in,  and that is dangerous for our country.   To allow partisan venom and enmity like that to take hold and become  the norm for driving impeachments is exactly what the Framers warned  against. It is in Federalist No. 65. Hamilton warned against it. He  warned against persecution by an intemperate and designing majority in  the House of Representatives, and that is exactly what the Framers did  not want impeachment to turn into. Yet that is clearly what it is  turning into here.   Both Manager Nadler and Democratic Leader Schumer, in the video that  we saw, were prescient in forewarning that, if we start to go down this  road, one thing that seems to be sure in Washington is that what goes  around comes around. If it is done once to one party, it will happen  again to the other party and then to the other party once the Office of  the President changes hands. Then we will be in a cycle. It will get  worse and worse, and it will be more and more, and every President will  be impeached. That is not what the Framers intended, and this body  shouldn't allow it to happen here.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The evidence is overwhelming that President  Trump pressured a foreign government to target an American citizen for  personal and political gain as part of President Trump's corrupt effort  to cheat and solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.   There is a remedy for that type of stunning abuse of power, and that  remedy is in the Constitution. That remedy is impeachment and the  consideration of removal, which is what this distinguished body is  doing right now. That is not partisan. That is not the Democratic  Party's playbook. That is not the Republican Party's playbook. That is  the playbook in a democratic republic given to us in a precious fashion  by the Framers of the Constitution.   The impeachment in this instance, of course, and the consideration of  removal is necessary because President Trump's conduct strikes at the  very heart of our free and fair elections. As North Carolinian delegate  William Davie noted at the Constitutional Convention, ``If he be not  impeachable whilst in office, he will spare no efforts or means  whatsoever to get himself reelected.''   The Framers of the Constitution understood that perhaps this remedy  would one day be necessary. That is why we are here right now.   The American people should decide an American election, not the  Ukrainians, not the Russians, not the Chinese--the American people.  That is why this President was impeached. That is why it is appropriate  for the Democrats and the Republicans--both sides of the aisle--not as  partisans but as Americans, to hold this President accountable for his  stunning abuse of power.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Vermont.
