 Mr. Speaker, it has just been said that no one with a  preexisting condition will be denied treatment. That is a cruel  falsehood. Roughly 129 million Americans today have a preexisting  condition.   Here is what the AMA says to refute what was just said: ``The history  of high-risk pools demonstrates that Americans with preexisting  conditions will be stuck in second class health coverage, if they are  able to obtain coverage at all.''   Now we have a proposal for $8 billion. That is a deceitful fraud. I  intend going back home to travel the State of Michigan and elsewhere  and tell the American people that although those who have said that are  simply not being truthful, they essentially are turning their backs on  129 million Americans. We Democrats will never turn our back on the  people of the United States of America. When it comes to health care,  it is a vital need.
