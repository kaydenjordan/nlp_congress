 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  proceedings had during the recess be printed in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 3935.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, H.R. 3935, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in  American Aviation Act, is a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Federal  Aviation Administration and the Nation's aviation safety and  infrastructure program for the next 5 years.   I thank Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Ranking Member  Rick Larsen, Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Garret Graves, and Aviation  Subcommittee Ranking Member   Steve Cohen for working with me to  develop and introduce this legislation.   For over a century, the United States has led the world in aviation  safety and innovation. Unfortunately, our gold standard status is being  threatened by increasing global competition, by rapid developments in  technology, a shortage of aviation professionals, and the  inefficiencies and lack of leadership in the FAA.   H.R. 3935 is critical to keeping America a global leader in aviation.  It is vital to our economy, to millions of American jobs, and to the  850 million passengers that depend on our National Airspace System  every single year.   If Congress fails to act on a new long-term aviation measure by  September 30, when the current FAA law expires, key aviation programs  will cease to function.   H.R. 3935 provides the necessary long-term certainty that is demanded  by both the civil aviation system and the aviation community to  guarantee its safety and prosperity for decades to come.   This bill not only improves FAA's efficiency through reasonable  organizational changes but makes the agency more agile while  simultaneously prioritizing safety each step of the way.   The FAA is simply too slow in everything it does, from rulemaking to  aircraft registrations and from certifications to just simple  paperwork.   This bill ensures robust investment in infrastructure for airports of  all sizes, including the thousands of smaller and general aviation  airports that make up the bulk of our aviation system.   I am proud to say our bill includes the first ever General Aviation  title in the FAA reauthorization bill. GA is the foundation to our  civil aviation system. It is where many of our pilots, mechanics, and  other aviation professionals begin their careers, gaining valuable  experience along their journey in the aviation industry.   This bill recognizes the importance of GA and protects the freedom to  fly for every American.   As previously mentioned, growing shortages across the aerospace  workforce are a true threat to the future of American aviation.   H.R. 3935 addresses workforce challenges head-on by removing barriers  to entry for individuals and veterans interested in pursuing careers in  aviation, such as through the CAREER Program.   Bottom line, our bill encourages growth in the aviation workforce  through meaningful reforms, the most meaningful in decades.   What is more, H.R. 3935 maintains American leadership when it comes  to the development and integration of new and emerging technologies  into the airspace, such as drones and Advanced Air Mobility.   Specifically, this bill requires the FAA to stop endless testing and  pilot programs that go nowhere to integrate innovation, such as drones  and AAM into the National Airspace System.   As air travel recovers from the COVID pandemic, renewed growth in air  travel has come with some difficulties, obviously, for the traveling  public. Our bipartisan bill includes an entire title dedicated to  improving the flying experience for the traveling public, an issue that  each of our offices hear about from constituents probably on a daily  basis.   Finally, and most importantly, the bill recognizes that while our  aviation system is safe, we must continue to raise the bar for safety.  As such, this  [[Page H3708]]  bill includes a number of safety-focused provisions to ensure that  America continues to be the world's gold standard in aviation safety.   One of the most important safety features of this bill is a title for  5-year reauthorization of the National Transportation Safety Board, the  NTSB. It is this independent Federal agency that investigates all civil  aviation accidents and transportation accidents throughout this sector.   I believe the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American  Aviation Act is one of the most important pieces of legislation this  body is going to consider in the 118th Congress.   This bill is vital to America's airport infrastructure, to our  economy, and to the future of American leadership in aviation.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                      Washington, DC, July 6, 2023.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 3935, the       ``Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation       Act,'' which was introduced on June 9, 2023.        H.R. 3935 contains provisions within the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. As a       result of your having consulted with the Committee and to       expedite this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology will forego action on the       bill. This is done based on our mutual understanding that       doing so will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology nor is it a       waiver of any future jurisdictional claim over subject matter       contained in this bill or in similar legislation.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding and would request that you include a copy       of this letter and your response in the committee report and       in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of       this bill. Finally, I ask that you support the appointment of       Science Committee conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation. Thank you in advance       for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                    Frank D. Lucas,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                      Washington, DC, July 7, 2023.      Hon. Frank D. Lucas,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Lucas: I write to you concerning H.R. 3935,       the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American       Aviation Act, which was introduced on June 9, 2023, and       solely referred to the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure.        I appreciate you agreeing to withdraw your request for a       sequential referral of H.R. 3935, so that the bill may be       considered expeditiously. I acknowledge that forgoing your       referral claim now does not waive the right to jurisdictional       claims in the future on subject matter contained in this bill       or similar legislation. Further, I will appropriately consult       and involve the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology       as the bill moves forward on issues that fall within your       Rule X jurisdiction. In addition, should a conference on the       bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology represented on       the conference committee.        Finally, I will include a copy of our letter exchange in       the Committee Report and the Congressional Record when the       bill is considered on the House floor.        Thank you again for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                     Sam Graves,                                              Chairman, Committee on      Transportation and Infrastructure.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                      Washington, DC, July 7, 2023.      Hon. Frank D. Lucas,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Lucas: I write to you concerning H.R. 3559,       the FAA Research and Development Act of 2023. The bill was       referred primarily to the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology, with an additional referral to the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure. Specifically, provisions       of H.R. 3559 fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House of Representatives in an       expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo action on the       bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual       understanding that doing so will not prejudice the Committee       on Transportation and Infrastructure with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matter contained within the bill or       similar legislation that falls under the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure's Rule X jurisdiction.       Further, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I       appreciate your agreement to support my request to have the       Committee represented on the conference committee.        Finally, I would ask that a copy of this letter and your       response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the       bill be included in the Committee Report and Congressional       Record during consideration of H.R. 3559 on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                        Sam Graves,                                             Chairman, Committee on      Transportation and Infrastructure.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                     Washington, DC, July 10, 2023.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       3559. the ``FAA Research and Development Act of 2023,'' which       was referred initially to the Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology and sequentially to the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       bill. I recognize that the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure has a valid jurisdictional interest in certain       provisions of H.R. 3559, and that the Committee's       jurisdiction should not be adversely affected by your       decision to forego formal consideration of H.R. 3559. As you       have requested, I will support your request for an       appropriate appointment of outside conferees from your       committee in the event of a House-Senate conference on this       or similar legislation should such a conference be convened.        Finally, I will include a copy of your letter and this       response in the Committee Report and in the Congressional       Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you       again for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                    Frank D. Lucas,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  [[Page H3711]]  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the chair of the Subcommittee on Aviation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), the chairman of the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. D'Esposito).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Molinaro).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chair.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Chairman, it has been made clear through debate that H.R. 3935 is  a must-pass bill that provides a path for America's future success,  growth, and leadership in civil aviation.   This strong bipartisan, forward-looking legislation is going to  improve efficiency and operations at the FAA. It is going to strengthen  America's foundational general aviation sector, and it is going to grow  the aviation workforce.   It is going to invest in airport infrastructure across the country.  It is going to encourage domestic innovation in aviation, enhance the  passenger experience, and uphold America's gold standard in aviation  safety.   Before I yield back, Mr. Chair, I would like to recognize the work of  staff on both sides of the aisle in the development of this  legislation. I appreciate the many long days, weeks, and weekends, for  that matter, that staff, including the folks in the legislative  counsel's office, have put into this effort. I think it shows in the  quality of the legislation that we have before us.  [[Page H3717]]    On the Republican Subcommittee on Aviation, I thank staff director  Hunter Presti, Laney Copeland, Julie Devine, Andrew Giacini,  Christopher Senn, and Will Moore.   On the Republican full committee staff, I thank staff director Jack  Ruddy, Michael Falencki, Corey Cooke, Meghan Holland, Abby Wenk, Leslie  Parker, Chris Divine, Tyler Micheletti, Wills MacKay, Payton Palazzolo,  Justin Harclerode, Jake Murphy, and Kerry Goldberg.   I also thank Maggie Aryea of subcommittee chairman Garret Graves'  staff.   On the Democratic staff, I thank committee staff director Kathy  Dedrick, Helena Zyblikewycz--I am sorry; I apologize--Stanton Johnson,  aviation staff director Brian Bell, Alexandra Menardy, Adam Weiss, and  again, all the staff who worked on this complex and critical  legislation.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of the Securing Growth and Robust  Leadership in the American Aviation Act, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of the Graves-Larsen amendment. This amendment  makes several technical conforming and clarifying changes throughout  the underlying bill.   Furthermore, the amendment includes provisions that were the result  of bipartisan negotiations on several policy issues.   These provisions include additional requirements for FAA to further  coordinate the safe integration of new entrants into the National  Airspace System, adding pilot apprenticeship, internship, or  scholarship programs or veteran career transition nonprofits as an  eligible grant recipient under the aviation workforce development  program, protections on voluntary safety information disclosures, and  several other provisions that reflect the bipartisan work with our  colleagues across the aisle.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to  support this important amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 597,  I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of en bloc No. 1, containing 18  amendments from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This en bloc  contains a number of important amendments that address issues of  national importance as well as issues that are impacting individual  districts.   This package allows airports to use their Federal dollars to better  understand the communities which they serve and the length people  travel in order to take a flight.   It will instruct the FAA to test and evaluate means by which general  and business aviation can utilize technology to receive flight  clearances as opposed to using antiquated systems.   It also instructs the FAA to stand up a multidisciplinary task force  to review the impact that human factors have on aviation safety and to  make related recommendations.   In addition, this package instructs the Government Accountability  Office to consult with airports to review emergency response plans and  assess electrical resiliency for the safe operations of an airport  during emergency scenarios.   This en bloc includes a number of provisions from members of the T&I  Committee that were raised at markup but that we didn't have time to  resolve. I am very glad that we were able to work together to resolve  the few issues and support changes on a bipartisan basis.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of this bipartisan en bloc package and  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Yakym).    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support  this en bloc amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 597,  I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of en bloc No. 2, containing 20 amendments from my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This en bloc reflects the  bipartisan work of our committee, which has done what we have done to  address Members' priorities.   This includes bipartisan agreements on several amendments that we  considered during our markup, including requiring the FAA to develop  training materials to improve safety for airport ramp workers, and it  requires the GAO to conduct a study on air cargo operations in Puerto  Rico.   Furthermore, the en bloc package includes amendments to ensure the  Secretary responds to essential air service contracts in a timely  manner, allowing the FAA to provide weather observer training to  airport personnel and ensures that United States passengers on foreign  air carriers are protected in the same manner as they would be on  United States air carriers by avoiding Russian airspace.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan en bloc  package, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I don't have any speakers, so I  am prepared to close. I urge my colleagues to support these amendments  en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 597,  I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this en bloc, which contains 17  amendments to H.R. 3935 offered by my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle.   This en bloc package includes amendments that seek to require the  Government Accountability Office to study the pilot shortage, require  community feedback regarding aircraft noise matters, improve emergency  medical kits on board aircraft, require an audit of recent flight  cancellations that continue to plague passengers and travelers, as well  as many more things in this en bloc.   I urge support of this en bloc package and encourage a ``yes'' vote  by all Members.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers at this  time.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  amendment No. 10 offered by Mr. Langworthy.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, it is hard to even know where to begin. The sad thing  about it is that very few people have actually read the report on what  happened to Flight 3407.   Starting out, I have to say that I don't question anybody's motives  on whether they oppose or support, or whatever the case may be. The sad  thing about it is the wrong questions are being asked.   Now, what we are trying to do does not in any way change or weaken  the 1,500-hour rule. What we are trying to say is that simulator time-- which you can simulate anything--should be used in training pilots.   I am an ATP, and I will kind of explain how that process works. You  get your private pilot certificate, and then you move on to your  commercial certificate. After an instrument rating, you get the single- engine commercial rating, the multiengine commercial rating, and then  you move on to the ATP. It stands for airline transport pilot, and I  have that rating. I have flown all the profiles that anybody would have  to go through to achieve an ATP.   What is interesting in this whole process is that if you take a look  at the recommendations that came out of the investigation when it comes  to Flight 3407, the Buffalo accident, you have to wonder--again, this  is where the wrong questions are being asked.   The pilot had 3,379 total hours before the accident. This pilot  failed six checkrides, and not just checkrides that were recurrent. He  failed his initial instrument checkride. He failed his commercial  single-engine checkride. He failed his commercial multiengine  checkride. He failed at the Gulfstream Academy when he was checking out  in Gulfstreams. He failed his checkride in the Gulfstream. He failed  his ATP checkride and had to do remedial training. Then, ultimately,  when he was upgraded to the plane that was in the accident, he failed  his sixth checkride.   He didn't fail some of his checkrides when he advanced from one  rating to the next. He failed all of them and had to go to remedial  training.   I ask whether you would get on an airline or a flight or put your  family on a flight if you knew that the captain had failed all six  checkrides as he advanced through his process. No, you wouldn't, not in  a minute. Would you get on a flight if it was recommended that the  pilot have remedial training?   Here we are with a simulator. You can simulate anything. I remember  one of my simulator profiles, one of my simulator flights. We were  coming in. I was doing an approach and lost my autopilot as a result,  so I had to hand-fly the approach--zero visibility, 200-foot ceiling,  which is at the minimum.   As I am on approach, I lose sight of the runway because the ceiling  comes down. I have to execute a go-around to reestablish my approach.  This is all being done in the simulator.   As I am executing my go-around, I lose an engine. I have to execute a  go-around with one engine to minimums, and I have to get it on the  ground in zero-zero visibility.   You can't simulate that in a real airplane. You can't simulate any of  this, any emergency, in a real airplane.   First of all, in an airliner, that means the airplane is going to  have to be taken down because it is going to have to be checked. If you  do stalls in a full-blown airliner, you are going to have to take that  aircraft down to have the airframe inspected because of the stress that  is put on it.   Now, what I do want to point out is ALPA, the airline association  that represented the pilots, I got on their website and found it  fascinating. One of the things that they like to point out--I am glad  they were part of the board that was the ARAC. That is the Aviation  Rulemaking Advisory Committee, which is who we established to make  recommendations on exactly how much simulator time we should add. They  co-chaired the ARAC when it came to investigating this accident.    Do you know one of the things that they tout, one of the things that  they are very proud of on their website that they push? When it comes  to one of the recommendations made by the NTSB, additional training on  upset prevention and recovery, a new certification training program  course requirement. These new simulator-based training requirements  also include performing manual controlled maneuvers, procedures, slow  flight--all these things. They actually endorsed more simulator  training because you can simulate anything.   Today's simulators, by the way, are far and above what they were just  10 years ago.   I also have the testimony that the NTSB gave in the Senate hearing.  It is unfortunate, Mr. Chairman, because the testimony in the Senate  hearing says it all.   Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues not to  support this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong  opposition to this amendment and urge Members to vote ``no.''   The Essential Air Service program has proven to be a vital tool for  rural connectivity, and for decades, it has been providing commercial  air service to rural America.   It ensures our constituents in rural communities are connected to the  national air transportation system and provides businesses across the  country with the opportunity to grow their  [[Page H3827]]  businesses and families easier access to loved ones across the Nation.  It drives economic development in many of our districts.   This amendment most certainly eliminates air service to our smallest,  most rural communities. I have been a longtime, strong supporter of the  EAS program.   In order to ensure the program's long-term viability, smart and  targeted reforms are needed to ensure the program can continue to serve  our communities.   Those reforms are in this underlying bill. It phases in cost-saving  reforms to secure the program's long-term stability and ensures that it  will continue to meet the needs of communities served while reining in  the ballooning costs.   I, myself, have an EAS airport in my district that will be subject to  the cost-share provision beginning in fiscal year 2027. I fear that  without reducing costs, the entire program will cease to exist in due  time, thanks to the program's cost.   Let's do anything we can to attempt to save this program. I think  anything that we do if we are not attempting to save this program is  literally a disservice to our constituents. Please vote ``no'' on the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Carter of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Cammack, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  3935) to amend title 49, United States Code, to reauthorize and improve  the Federal Aviation Administration and other civil aviation programs,  and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
