 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter titled  ``Support the Paycheck Fairness Act'' written by The Leadership  Conference on Civil and Human Rights.                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                                     April 14, 2021.       Support the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R. 7--Vote No on Harmful                                 Amendments         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human  [[Page H1808]]       Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more       than 220 organizations to promote and protect the rights of       all persons in the United States, we urge you to vote for the       Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R. 7, without amendments that limit       its scope or undermine its critical protections. The Paycheck       Fairness Act is a priority of The Leadership Conference, and       we will include your vote on final passage in our Voting       Record for the 117th Congress.        Gender-based pay discrimination compromises the economic       security of millions of women in the United States--and for       women of color, the harm is exacerbated by their experience       of both race- and gender-based wage disparities. Women       working full-time, year-round in the United States are       typically paid about 82 cents for every dollar paid to men,       adding up to a loss of more than $400,000 over a lifetime.       Black women are typically paid only 63 cents for every dollar       paid to non-Hispanic white men, while Native American women       are paid only 60 cents, Latinas are paid just 55 cents, and       women in certain Asian American and Pacific Islander       communities are paid as little as 52 cents. Research shows       that the gender pay gap occurs across almost all occupations       and industries, develops very early in women's careers, and       grows over time.        Action to close the wage gap is long overdue, but in light       of the current economic crisis, it is even more critical that       Congress act now to strengthen protections against pay       discrimination, both as a matter of economic security and       fundamental fairness. The loss of income and savings from the       wage gap has exacerbated the harmful effects of the COVID-19       pandemic for women of color and their families. Black and       Brown women have been overrepresented in ``frontline'' jobs       during the pandemic--many in low-paid jobs at high risk of       exposure to COVID-19 and without benefits like paid leave and       employer-sponsored health insurance--but they are paid less       than non-Hispanic white men in the same jobs. Already       struggling to make ends meet, women of color in low-pay jobs       must also endure pay discrimination that artificially reduces       their overall earnings, making it even less likely for women       of color to amass the financial resources to withstand a       health emergency and putting entire families at risk of       economic insecurity. Almost 75 percent of Black mothers and       more than 45 percent of Latina mothers were breadwinners in       their families in 2018. At the same time, Black and Brown       women have faced staggering job losses during the pandemic.       The unemployment rate for Black women reached 17.4 percent in       May 2020, for example, and Latinas experienced the highest       unemployment rate of any group during the pandemic, at more       than 20 percent in April of last year. The unemployment rate       for Black women and Latinas remains exceptionally high.        The Paycheck Fairness Act would update and strengthen the       Equal Pay Act of 1963 to provide more effective protection       against sex-based pay discrimination. The Paycheck Fairness       Act would:        Prohibit retaliation against workers who discuss or       disclose wages;        Prevent employers from relying on salary history to       determine future pay so that pay discrimination does not       extend from job to job;        Close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act that have allowed       employers to pay women less than men for the same work       without any business necessity related to the job;        Ensure that women can obtain the same remedies for sex-      based pay discrimination as those available to people       subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity;        Provide for much-needed training and technical assistance       and require wage data collection.        Women and their families can no longer be shortchanged.       Given the importance of this bill, we urge representatives to       pass H.R. 7 without amendments that limit the bill's scope or       undermine its protections.            Sincerely,      Wade Henderson,        Interim President and CEO.      LaShawn Warren,        Executive Vice President for Government Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, for a quarter of a century, Chairwoman  DeLauro has been trying to get this bill passed. She is sick and tired,  I am sick and tired, and American women are sick and tired of being  treated like second-class citizens.   Imagine if the women here in Congress were being paid 60, 70, or 80  percent of what our male colleagues are making. Do you think we would  put up with it? Of course not. Somehow, American women are expected to  put up with that.   Do you want facts? Ask about Ms. Rexroat, from the State of Arizona,  who was paid less than her colleague because they decided that they  would base her salary on what she was making before, as opposed to the  job at hand.   We have a problem, Mr. Speaker. This has been going on for way too  long. It is time for us to fix it for all the women and children in  this country who want to be paid equally for equal work so that they  have money for childcare, rent, food, and education.
