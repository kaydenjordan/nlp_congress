 Mr. Speaker, our Nation has never seen anything like the  coronavirus outbreak.  [[Page H1838]]    At a time when our American businesses are forced to close and  American families face fear and uncertainty, we do what Americans do  best: We come together and support one another.   My background is business. I have run a small business and a large  organization. This bill puts workers first. It is good for American  business.   It puts workers first with an additional $600 a week in unemployment  insurance.   It puts families first, funneling $1,200 directly into the pockets of  Americans.   It supports small business with a $377 billion infusion for fast  relief through grants and loans.   This bill is what the American people and the American economy need.  It is time to come together as one Nation, united against this  outbreak. I urge support for this bill.
