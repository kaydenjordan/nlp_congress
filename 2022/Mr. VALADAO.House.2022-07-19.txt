 Mr. Chair, I request support from my colleagues on a  very simple amendment.   This amendment would prohibit the Department of Energy from sending  America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. Supporting this  language is common sense, especially since we need to focus on  increasing energy production and not supporting our adversaries while  Americans are still suffering from outrageously high fuel prices here  at home.   These reserves are meant to be used for emergencies only. They are  not meant to be used when our leadership has failed us by unnecessarily  restricting domestic energy production.   What is even more concerning is that under the Biden administration,  our Strategic Petroleum Reserve supplies have been severely diminished.  It does not make sense that we are using our already depleted energy  supplies to help China build up their own strategic reserves.   It is irresponsible and dangerous for the United States to provide  our foreign adversary with fuel that we desperately need to keep here  in the United States in case of an emergency. It seems the Biden  administration is helping to support China's national security at the  expense of our own.   It has been suggested that selling resources from the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve will help reduce fuel prices here at home. That is  simply not true.   What we should be doing instead is supporting our energy producers  here in the United States. We have abundant resources here that can and  should be used. We are deliberately holding our country back by  overregulating and stifling our domestic energy producers. The very  last thing we should be doing is sending our precious resources from  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. I urge all of my colleagues  to support the United States national security by supporting this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of this amendment.         At the end of division C (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to draw down and sell petroleum products from the       Strategic Petroleum Reserve to any entity that does not       certify to the Secretary of Energy that--        (1) it is not under the ownership, control, or influence of       the Chinese Communist Party; and        (2) such petroleum products will not be exported to the       People's Republic of China.    Mr. Chair, thank you for allowing me this time to talk  about the importance of the three amendments I submitted to this bill  that, unfortunately, we won't be voting on today.   The severe drought throughout the American West has been negatively  impacting my constituents and local community for years.   In the Central Valley, our farmers have had to turn to pumping  groundwater to protect their high-value crops. Towns have been forced  to pump more and more groundwater to meet their communities' needs. As  a result, these communities have experienced land subsidence at the  expense of critical water infrastructure.   In the worst cases, farmers are forced to fallow their fields and dry  out valuable orchards due to access to little or no water.   My constituents are farmers who feed the world, and with record-high  food prices, the inability for our domestic farmers to grow food is  going to impact the entire country. The situation is dire and only  getting worse.   We can't produce more water, but we can work with the water we  already have and apply commonsense solutions to make this water  available to our agricultural communities.   My first amendment would have addressed water storage capacity issues  by extending the storage provision of subtitle J of the WIIN Act. It  would have also created a program to assist in funding the repairs to  damaged canal facilities.   Unless these canals are completely restored, the issue of subsidence  and resulting unnecessary water loss will continue and conditions will  worsen.                                time  1530    My second amendment would codify the 2019 biological opinions that  were independently peer-reviewed and informed by the most accurate and  best-available science.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration's Bureau of Reclamation has  ignored science and reinitiated consultation with the BiOps with no  explanation. Codifying the 2019 BiOps would put an end to senseless  litigation and provide operational certainty for Valley farmers.   My third amendment was one focused on transparency and would direct  the Bureau of Reclamation to provide the Committee on Appropriations  with a justification on their decision to reinitiate consultation of  2019 biological opinions. We need to stop playing politics with a  resource that the Central Valley is so reliant on.  [[Page H6846]]    It is extremely disappointing that the majority rejected each one of  these amendments that would bring more water to the communities  throughout the Central Valley who are doing everything they possibly  can to survive these conditions and provide food for our Nation.
