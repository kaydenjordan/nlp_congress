 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 922 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 922         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1147) to amend the Richard B. Russell National       School Lunch Act to allow schools that participate in the       school lunch program under such Act to serve whole milk. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and       the Workforce or their respective designees. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. The amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on Education and the Workforce       now printed in the bill shall be considered as adopted in the       House and in the Committee of the Whole.

All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. No further       amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in order except       those printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution. Each such further amendment may       be offered only in the order printed in  [[Page H6829]]       the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such further       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill, as amended, to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and       on any further amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 357) to require       the head of an agency to issue and sign any rule issued by       that agency, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The amendment       in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on       the Judiciary now printed in the bill shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived.

Sec. 3.  Notwithstanding section 3(z) of House Resolution       5, on any legislative day of the second session of the One       Hundred Eighteenth Congress before January 9, 2024-- (a) the       Speaker may dispense with organizational and legislative       business; and (b) the Journal of the proceedings of the       previous day shall be considered as approved if applicable.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Scanlon), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, we are here today to debate the rule  providing for consideration of H.R. 357 and H.R. 1147. It provides a  structured rule for H.R. 1147 and makes in order bipartisan and  Republican amendments, provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and  provides one motion to recommit. The rule further provides for  consideration of H.R. 357 under a closed rule, with 1 hour of debate  equally divided and controlled by the Committee on the Judiciary and  one motion to recommit.   Under our Constitution, those who make the laws are accountable to  those who elect them. Career Federal employees are not beholden to the  voters of this Nation, and yet unelected bureaucrats across the Federal  agencies--in one case in particular, a single low-level career  employee--have been making thousands of rules that impact this  country's voters and taxpayers.   According to a recent Pacific Legal Foundation study, career  employees and unconfirmed officials issued over 70 percent of the rules  at the Department of Health and Human Services between 2001 and 2017.  These rules have economic impacts on the people of this country, just  as the laws we pass in this Chamber do, yet we are accountable to the  voters who elect us. Federal employees are accountable to no one.   Former President Trump addressed this issue with an executive order  that required agencies' informal notice-and-comment rules to be  initiated and signed by senior appointees, with exceptions. The Biden  administration has revoked that. As a result of revoking this order, in  2021, Congress passed just 143 laws while Federal agencies issued 3,257  rules, costing taxpayers $1.927 trillion, or the equivalent of $14,684  per household.   According to the study, only 2 percent of the Food and Drug  Administration's rules were issued by principal officers, and 25 of  these rules had an impact on the American economy of at least $100  million or had other substantial economic impacts. That means unelected  bureaucrats, who are not accountable to the taxpayers, are costing  those taxpayers thousands upon thousands of dollars.   This majority has made a commitment to ensuring our Federal  Government is held accountable. The Ensuring Accountability in Agency  Rulemaking Act would lessen the power of career civil servants who are  not accountable to the taxpayer. It would require, with exceptions,  that rules be issued and signed by presidentially nominated and Senate- confirmed appointees. This upholds the Constitution by putting  decisions in the hands of those who are held accountable to the  American people. It improves the ways this government is by the people  and for the people.   We are also here to discuss the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act. Mr.  Speaker, coming from one of the top dairy producing districts in the  country, I am proud to stand here in support of this legislation. The  bill expands milk options for the school lunch programs under the  Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to include flavored,  unflavored, whole, and reduced-fat milks.   Whole milk has been demonized as unhealthy, but it is full of the  calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and protein that growing kids need.  Since the misguided Obama-era regulations were put in place that the  Biden administration has chosen to continue, rather than seeing health  improve, we have continued to see child health decline. We also have  fewer people participating in the school lunch programs. Like many of  the regulations that took place at the time, the milk restrictions are  not having their intended effect.   Meanwhile, dairy farmers in my district are struggling. Milk prices  and demand remain stubbornly low, in most cases below the margin of  your average dairy farm. For what purpose? Because the Federal  Government places arbitrary restrictions on the meals our children can  enjoy?   This bill is a win-win for children and producers alike. It gets kids  the nutrients they need while giving schools more flexibility to meet  the needs of their students, and it provides a larger market for dairy  farmers to sell their delicious product they stand proudly behind.   Mr. Speaker, I support the underlying legislation, urge all Members  to do so, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to comment that rules and  rulemaking is one of the things that I hear from my constituents. It is  one of the most important things that they talk about and call me about  when they have concerns.   I think H.R. 357 simply makes the process accountable the way it  should be. We should not have bureaucrats making rules from D.C. for  farms in Minnesota or for a variety of streams and waterways in  Minnesota when they are not there seeing it.   I think this is an important part of the government being responsive  and accountable to the American people. I find it very important that  we need to get the rulemaking under control.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Langworthy).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I do just want to comment that I was in my district this weekend, and  I heard a lot about out-of-control rulemaking at the Federal level by  the government in general.   Do you know what, Mr. Speaker?   I did hear about whole milk, so I do think the issues we are dealing  with are of concern to the American people.   Moreover, I am proud of my colleagues for following through on their  commitments to the American people. The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act  directly responds to constituents who want to expand the options for  healthy drinks in our school. Expanding the Richard B. Russell National  School Lunch Act to include flavored, unflavored, whole, and reduced  fat milk options decreases the control Washington has over the day-to- day choices Americans make and increases the chance that a kid will  reach for a milk over a soda.   The Ensuring Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act holds the  government accountable by requiring rules made in Federal agencies to  be issued and signed by presidentially nominated and Senate-confirmed  appointees, ensuring the rules made in Federal agencies are beholden to  taxpayers' priorities.   Mr. Speaker, I support the rule and the underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Scanlon is as follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 922 Offered by Ms. Scanlon of Pennsylvania         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to consideration of the bill (H.R. 715)       to require a background check for every firearm sale. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto, to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary or their respective designees; and       (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 715.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
