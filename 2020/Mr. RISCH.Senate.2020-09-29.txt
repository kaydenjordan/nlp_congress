Transmittal No. 20-35    Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section                  36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The F-35A Conventional Take Off and Landing (CTOL)       aircraft is a single-seat, single engine, all-weather,       stealth, fifth-generation, multirole aircraft. It contains       sensitive technology including the low observable airframe/      outer mold line, the Pratt and Whitney F135 engine, AN/APG-81       radar, an integrated core processor central computer, a       mission systems/electronic warfare suite, a multiple sensor       suite, technical data/documentation and associated software.       Sensitive elements of the F-35A are also included in       operational flight and maintenance trainers. Sensitive and       classified elements of the F-35A CTOL aircraft include       hardware, accessories, components, and associated software       for the following major subsystems:        a. The Pratt and Whitney F135 engine is a single 40,000-lb       thrust class engine designed for the F-35 and assures highly       reliable, affordable performance. The engine is designed to       be utilized in all F-35 variants, providing unmatched       commonality and supportability throughout the worldwide base       of F-35 users.        b. The AN/APG-81 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA)       is a high processing power/high transmission power electronic       array capable of detecting air and ground targets from a       greater distance than mechanically scanned array radars. It       also contains a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which creates       high-resolution ground maps and provides weather data to the       pilot, and provides air and ground tracks to the mission       system, which uses it as a component to fuse sensor data.        c. The Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) provides       long-range detection and tracking as well as an infrared       search and track (IRST) and forward-looking infrared (FUR)       capability for precision tracking, weapons delivery and bomb       damage assessment (BDA). The EOTS replaces multiple separate       internal or podded systems typically found on legacy       aircraft.        d. The Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS)       provides the pilot with full spherical coverage for air-to-      air and air-to-ground threat awareness, day/night vision       enhancements, a fire control capability and precision       tracking of wingmen/friendly aircraft. The EODAS provides       data directly to the pilot's helmet as well as the mission       system.        e. The Electronic Warfare (EW) system is a reprogrammable,       integrated system that provides radar warning and electronic       support measures (ESM) along with a fully integrated       countermeasures (CM) system. The EW system is the primary       subsystem used to enhance situational awareness, targeting       support and self-defense through the search, intercept,       location and identification of in-band emitters and to       automatically counter IR and RF threats.        f. The Command, Control, Communications, Computers and       Intelligence/Communications, Navigation, and Identification       (C4I/CNI) system provides the pilot with unmatched       connectivity to flight members, coalition forces and the       battlefield. It is an integrated subsystem designed to       provide a  [[Page S5940]]       broad spectrum of secure, anti-jam voice and data       communications, precision radio navigation and landing       capability, self-identification, beyond visual range target       identification and connectivity to off-board sources of       information. It also includes an inertial navigation and       global positioning system (GPS) for precise location       information. The functionality is tightly integrated within       the mission system to enhance efficiency.        g. The aircraft C4I/CNI system includes two data links: the       Multi-Function Advanced Data Link (MADL) and Link 16. The       MADL is designed specifically for the F-35 and allows for       stealthy communications between F-35s. Link 16 data link       equipment allows the F-35 to communicate with legacy aircraft       using widely-distributed J-series message protocols.        h. The F-35 Autonomic Logistics Global Sustainment (ALGS)       provides a fully integrated logistics management solution.       ALGS integrates a number of functional areas, including       supply chain management, repair, support equipment, engine       support and training. The ALGS infrastructure employs a       state-of-the-art information system that provides real-time,       decision-worthy information for sustainment decisions by       flight line personnel. Prognostic health monitoring       technology is integrated with the air system and is crucial       to predictive maintenance of vital components.        i. The F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS)       provides an intelligent information infrastructure that binds       all the key concepts of ALGS into an effective support       system. ALIS establishes the appropriate interfaces among the       F-35 Air Vehicle, the warfighter, the training system,       government information technology (IT) systems, and       supporting commercial enterprise systems. Additionally, ALIS       provides a comprehensive tool for data collection and       analysis, decision support and action tracking.        j. The F-35 Training System includes several training       devices to provide integrated training for pilots and       maintainers. The pilot training devices include a Full       Mission Simulator (FMS) and Deployable Mission Rehearsal       Trainer (DMRT). The maintenance training devices include an       Aircraft Systems Maintenance Trainer (ASMT), Ejection System       Maintenance Trainer (ESMT), Outer Mold Line (OML) Lab,       Flexible Linear Shaped Charge (FLSC) Trainer, F135 Engine       Module Trainer and Weapons Loading Trainer (WLT). The F-35       Training System can be integrated, where both pilots and       maintainers learn in the same Integrated Training Center       (ITC). Alternatively, the pilots and maintainers can train in       separate facilities (Pilot Training Center and Maintenance       Training Center).        k. Other subsystems, features, and capabilities include the       F-35's low observable air frame, Integrated Core Processor       (ICP) Central Computer, Helmet Mounted Display System (HMDS),       Pilot Life Support System (PLSS), Off-Board Mission Support       (OMS) System, and publications/maintenance manuals. The HMDS       provides a fully sunlight readable, biocular display       presentation of aircraft information projected onto the       pilot's helmet visor. The use of a night vision camera       integrated into the helmet eliminates the need for       separate Night Vision Goggles. The PLSS provides a measure       of Pilot Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Protection       through use of an On-Board Oxygen Generating System       (OBOGS); and an escape system that provides additional       protection to the pilot. OBOGS takes the Power and Thermal       Management System (PTMS) air and enriches it by removing       gases (mainly nitrogen) by adsorption, thereby increasing       the concentration of oxygen in the product gas and       supplying breathable air to the pilot. The OMS provides a       mission planning, mission briefing, and a maintenance/      intelligence/tactical debriefing platform for the F-35.        2. The Reprogramming Center is located in the United States       and provides F-35 customers with a means to update F-35 EW       databases.        3. The AIM-9X Block II and Block II+ (Plus) SIDEWINDER       Missile represents a substantial increase in missile       acquisition and kinematics performance over the AIM-9M and       replaces the AIM-9X Block I Missile configuration. The       missile includes a high off-boresight seeker, enhanced       countermeasure rejection capability, low drag/high angle of       attack airframe and the ability to integrate with a helmet       mounted cueing system. The software algorithms are the most       sensitive portion of the AIM-9X missile. The software       continues to be modified via a preplanned product improvement       (P3I) program to improve counter-countermeasure       capabilities. Purchase will include AIM-9X Guidance Sections.        4. The GBU-54 Laser Joint Direct Attack Munition (LJDAM) is       a 500 pound JDAM which incorporates all the capabilities of       the JDAM guidance tail kit and adds a precision laser       guidance set. The LJDAM gives the weapon system an optional       semi-active laser guidance in addition to the Inertial       Navigation System/Global Positioning System (INS/GPS)       guidance. This provides the optional capability to strike       moving targets. The GBU-54 consists of a laser guidance set,       KMU-572 warhead specific tail kit, and MK-82 bomb body.        5. The GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB II)       is a 250-lb class precisionguided, semi-autonomous,       conventional, air-to-ground munition used to defeat moving       targets through adverse weather from standoff range. The SDB       II has deployable wings and fins and uses GPS/INS guidance,       network-enabled datalink (Link-16 and UHF), and a multi-mode       seeker (millimeter wave radar, imaging infrared) to       autonomously search, acquire, track, and defeat targets. The       SDB II employs a multi-effects warhead (Blast, Fragmentation,       and Shaped-Charge) for maximum lethality against armored and       soft targets. The SDB II weapon system consists of the AUR       weapon; a 4-place common carriage system; and mission       planning system application.        a. SDB II Guided Test Vehicles (GTV) is an SDB II       configuration used for land or sea range-based testing of the       SDB II weapon system. The GTV has common flight       characteristics of an SDB II AUR, but in place of the multi-      effects warhead is a Flight Termination, Tracking, and       Telemetry (FTTT) subassembly that mirrors the AUR       multieffects warhead's size and mass properties, but provides       safe flight termination, free flight tracking and telemetry       of encrypted data from the GTV to the data receivers. The SDB       II GTV can have either inert or live fuses. All other flight       control, guidance, data-link, and seeker functions are       representative of the SDB II AUR.        b. SDB II Captive Carry Reliability Test (CCRT) vehicles       are an SDB II configuration primarily used for reliability       data collection during carriage. The CCRT has common       characteristics of an SDB II AUR but with an inert warhead       and fuze. The CCRT has an inert mass in place of the warhead       that mimics the warhead's mass properties. The CCRT is a       flight capable representative of the SDB II AUR but is not       approved for release from any aircraft. Since all other       flight control, guidance, data-link, and seeker functions are       representative of the SDB II AUR, this configuration could be       used for any purpose where an inert round without telemetry       or termination capability would be useful.        6. This sale will involve the release of sensitive and/or       classified technology. The highest level of classification of       information included in this potential sale is SECRET.        7. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar advanced capabilities.        8. A determination has been made that Switzerland can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        9. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Switzerland.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The proposed sale will improve Switzerland's capability to       meet current and future threats. Switzerland currently       operates the Boeing F/A-18C/D, but that aircraft is reaching       end-of-life and will be replaced by the winner of       Switzerland's New Fighter Aircraft competition, for which the       F/A-18E/F is being considered. The primary missions of the       aircraft and associated weapons will be policing the airspace       above Switzerland and providing national defense       capabilities. Switzerland will have no difficulty absorbing       these aircraft into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be The Boeing Company, St.       Louis, MO; Northrop Grumman, Los Angeles, CA; Raytheon       Company, El Segundo, CA; Raytheon Missile Systems Company,       Tucson, AZ; General Electric, Lynn, MA; and The Boeing       Company, St. Charles, MO. This proposal is being offered in       the context of a competition. The purchaser typically       requests offsets. Any offset agreement will be defined in       negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of six (6) additional U.S. contractor       representatives to Switzerland on an intermittent basis for a       duration of the life of the case to support delivery of the       F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft and provide supply support       management, inventory control, and equipment familiarization.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result, of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 20-34       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is a single-seat and two-      seat, twin engine, multi-mission fighter/attack aircraft that       can operate  [[Page S5942]]       from either aircraft carriers or land bases. The F/A-18E/F       Super Hornet fills a variety of roles and provides air       superiority, fighter escort, suppression of enemy air       defenses, reconnaissance, forward air control, close and deep       air support, and day and night strike missions.        a. The AN/APG-79 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA)       Radar System provides the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft       with all-weather, multi-mission capability for performing       Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground targeting and attack. Air-to-Air       modes provide the capability for all-aspect target detection,       long-range search and track, automatic target acquisition,       and tracking of multiple targets. Air-to-Surface attack modes       provide high-resolution ground mapping navigation, weapon       delivery, and sensor cueing.        b. The AN/ALR-67(V)3 Electric Warfare Countermeasures       Receiving Set provides the F/A-18E/F aircrew with radar       threat warnings by detecting and evaluating friendly and       hostile radar frequency threat emitters and providing       identification and status information about the emitters to       on-board Electronic Warfare (EW) equipment and the aircrew.       The Operational Flight Program (OFP) and User Data Files       (UDF) used in the AN/ALR-67(V)3 contain threat parametric       data used to identify and establish priority of detected       radar emitters.        c. The AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing System is a       threat-adaptive dispensing system that dispenses chaff,       flares, and expendable jammers for self-protection against       airborne and ground-based Radio Frequency (RF) and Infrared       threats. The Operational Flight Program (OFP) and Mission       Data Files (MDF) used in the AN/ALE-47 contain algorithms       used to calculate the best defense against specific threats.        d. The AN/ALQ-214 is an advanced airborne Integrated       Defensive Electronic Countermeasures (IDECM) programmable       modular automated system capable of intercepting,       identifying, processing received radar signals (pulsed and       continuous) and applying an optimum countermeasures technique       in the direction of the radar signal, thereby improving       individual aircraft probability of survival from a variety of       Surface-to-Air and Air-to-Air Radio Frequency (RF) threats.       The system operates in a standalone or Electronic Warfare       (EW) suite mode. In the EW suite mode, the AN/ALQ-214       operates in a fully coordinated mode with the towed       dispensable decoy, Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), and the       onboard radar in the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in a       coordinated, non-interference manner sharing information       for enhanced information. The AN/ALQ-214 was designed to       operate in a high-density Electromagnetic Hostile       Environment with the ability to identify and counter a       wide variety of multiple threats, including those with       Doppler characteristics.        e. The AN/APX-111 Combined Interrogator/Transponder (CIT)       with the Conformal Antenna System (CAS) is a complete MARK-      XII identification system compatible with Identification       Friend or Foe (IFF) Modes 1, 2, 3/A, C and 4 (secure). A       single slide-in module that can be customized to the unique       cryptographic functions for a specific country provides the       systems secure mode capabilities. As a transponder, the CIT       is capable or replying to interrogation modes 1, 2, 3/A C       (altitude) and secure mode 4. The requirement is to upgrade       Switzerland's Combined Interrogator Transponder (CIT) AN/APX-      111 (V) IFF system software to implement Mode Select (Mode S)       capabilities. Beginning in early 2005 EUROCONTROL mandated       the civil community in Europe to transition to a Mode S only       system and for all aircraft to be compliant by 2009. The Mode       S Beacon System is a combined data link and Secondary       Surveillance Radar (SSR) system that was standardized in 1985       by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Mode       S provides air surveillance using a data link with a       permanent unique aircraft address. Selective Interrogation       provides higher data integrity, reduced Radio Frequency (RF)       interference levels, increased air traffic capacity, and adds       air-to-ground data link.        f. The Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) is a       modified HGU-55/P helmet that incorporates a visor-projected       Heads-Up Display (HUD) to cue weapons and aircraft sensors to       air and ground targets. In close combat, a pilot must       currently align the aircraft to shoot at a target. JHMCS       allows the pilot to simply look at a target to shoot. This       system projects visual targeting and aircraft performance       information on the back of the helmet's visor, enabling the       pilot to monitor this information without interrupting his       field of view through the cockpit canopy, the system uses a       magnetic transmitter unit fixed to the pilot's seat and a       magnetic field probe mounted on the helmet to define helmet       pointing positioning. A Helmet Vehicle Interface (HVI)       interacts with the aircraft system bus to provide signal       generation for the helmet display. This provides significant       improvement for close combat targeting and engagement.        g. The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) will provide       mission planning capability for support of military aviation       operations. It will also provide support for unit-level       mission planning for all phases of military flight operations       and have the capability to provide necessary mission data for       the aircrew. JMPS will support the downloading of data to       electronics data transfer devices for transfer to aircraft       and weapon systems. A JMPS for a specific aircraft type will       consist of basic planning tools called the Joint Mission       Planning Environment (JMPE) mated with a Unique Planning       Component (UPC) provided by the aircraft program. In       addition, UPCs will be required for specific weapons,       communication devices, and moving map displays. The JMPS will       be tailored to the specific releasable configuration for the       F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.        h.

This provides the optional capability to strike       moving targets. The GBU-54 consists of a laser guidance set,       KMU-572 warhead specific tail kit, and MK-82 bomb body.        oo. The GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB II)       is a 250-lb class precision-guided, semi-autonomous,       conventional, air-to-ground munition used to defeat moving       targets through adverse weather from standoff range. The SDB       II has deployable wings and fins and uses GPS/INS guidance,       network-enabled datalink (Link-16 and UHF), and a multi-mode       seeker (millimeter wave radar, imaging infrared) to       autonomously search, acquire, track, and defeat targets. The       SDB II employs a multi-effects warhead (Blast, Fragmentation,       and Shaped-Charge) for maximum lethality against armored and       soft targets. The SDB II weapon system consists of the AUR       weapon; a 4-place common carriage system; and mission       planning system application.        pp. SDB II Guided Test Vehicles (GTV) is an SDB II       configuration used for land or sea range-based testing of the       SDB II weapon system. The GTV has common flight       characteristics of an SDB II AUR, but in place of the multi-      effects warhead is a Flight Termination, Tracking, and       Telemetry (FTTT) subassembly that mirrors the AUR       multieffects warhead's size and mass properties, but provides       safe flight termination, free flight tracking and telemetry       of encrypted data from the GTV to the data receivers. The SDB       II GTV can have either inert or live fuses. All other flight       control, guidance, data-link, and seeker functions are       representative of the SDB II AUR.        qq. SDB II Captive Carry Reliability Test (CCRT) vehicles       are an SDB II configuration primarily used for reliability       data collection during carriage. The CCRT has common       characteristics of an SDB II AUR but with an inert warhead       and fuze. The CCRT has an inert mass in place of the warhead       that mimics the warhead's mass properties. The CCRT is a       flight capable representative of the SDB II AUR but is not       approved for release from any aircraft. Since all other       flight control, guidance, data-link, and seeker functions are       representative of the SDB II AUR, this configuration could be       used for any purpose where an inert round without telemetry       or termination capability would be useful.        2.
