 Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of  H.R. 3094, a bill to designate the National Pulse Memorial.  [[Page H2546]]    On June 12, 2016, a shooter hatefully took the lives of 49 people at  the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Those who died were sons and  daughters, brothers and sisters, mothers, fathers, and loving members  of Florida's communities.   This tragedy brought grief and pain to all parts of the Nation, to  Florida, including my very own district, and to the LGBT community.   That evening at the nightclub was Jerry Wright. His parents, MJ and  Fred, are part of our community in south Florida. They described Jerry  as a wonderful, loving, and caring son. He was there that evening, like  any other evening, enjoying Latin music with friends, and from 1 minute  to the next, his life was cruelly taken from him. He was only 31 years  old.   We all know that Jerry did not deserve this. His parents and family  did not deserve this.   I am very close friends now with the Wright family, and I know  firsthand the anguish and the pain that they go through every single  day, Mother's Day, Father's Day. That pain never goes away.   I know that personally, Madam Speaker, because I have also lost a  loved one tragically to gun violence. So the pain that the families and  the friends of 48 other people who lost their lives the same way is  still present today.   Just over 4 years later, now it is time that we designate the Pulse  nightclub as a national memorial.   This memorial will honor the memory of those who died that evening.  It will ensure that loved family members like Jerry Wright are never  forgotten. It will reflect on the pain that their families are still  suffering. But most importantly, it will serve as a reminder that we as  a country have to stop this violence and disarm hate.   This memorial is a testament to those who died, and it is a mandate  that we do more to stop it from happening again.
