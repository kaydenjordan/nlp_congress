 Mr. Speaker, I want to take this moment to go down a  very tough, and for many families, humiliating journey down memory  lane.   Memories full of sick mothers and fathers, sick children, and maybe  even those who lost their life because they could not get affordable  healthcare.   Apparently, this administration doesn't understand; for those of us  who were here before the Affordable Care Act, the years and years of  work, the thousands of pages of testimony, the many different  committees--even my committee, the Committee on the Judiciary--we heard  the pain and cries of those who did not have health insurance.   Maybe he doesn't know--the administration--the story of the 8-year- old girl whose family actually took her to the office of the insurance  company--she had leukemia--to beg for coverage. And they denied her,  and she died.   Maybe they did not hear the story of the mother whose son had  hepatitis because he had not been able to overcome his drug addiction,  even though he was a lawyer, and his only basis of healthcare was the  emergency room in a city hospital;   Or maybe the doctor who drove to another city hundreds of miles away  to get his intern son, put him in the backseat of his car and drive him  all the way back so that he could be inside the jurisdiction in which  his healthcare covered.   Maybe the administration and the President do not know about junk  insurance policies, that when you get to the hospital, as they look  over you in the emergency room and say, There is no room at the inn for  you because your insurance doesn't cover hospitalization.   Or the tap on the door of your hospital room while you are in the  bed, and although you are still ill, you are evicted because your  insurance has capped.   All of that was eliminated with the Affordable Care Act.   What a disaster for this administration to proudly and arrogantly  stand up to take a stand to destroy the Affordable Care Act in my  State, in Texas v. Azar, and how sad it is that State officials from  the moment they got elected in my State, Republicans, every day have  been fighting to destroy the Affordable Care Act.   And my own county health department is begging for relief; begging  for the expanded Medicaid; begging to serve the many thousands upon  thousands that are in need who are working poor, but my State refused  to accept the expanded Medicaid. And now, with great hubris,  pompousness, this Government--it is supposed to be for the people, of  which we are--has decided to take a stand to destroy the Affordable  Care Act.   Rather than do what we are attempting to do as Democrats and  protecting preexisting conditions and to expand and improve on  healthcare, we are looking to lower health insurance premiums,  strengthen protections for people with pre-existing conditions, stop  insurance companies from selling junk health insurance plans, and  reverse the administration's healthcare, sabotaging needlessly driven- up premiums and uninsured rates and empower States to innovate and  invest in enrolling more people.   Outreach. I have been engaged in outreach and education, and the  families are excited when they are eligible for insurance.   All of the people that I mentioned, and some who died, had  preexisting conditions. Over 50 percent of the American people--maybe  upwards of 65 percent--have preexisting conditions.   In 2012, there were 45 million uninsured persons, but the Affordable  Care Act was making its way so much so that we have reduced the amount  of uninsured persons, as the numbers show in 2018, down to about 28  million, and we were making steady progress.   What kind of caring attitude do you have?   Where is your humanity, that you would take insurance away from sick  children, families, and the elderly, and that you would allow their  prescription drugs to shoot through the roof, which is what will happen  when you destroy and implode the Affordable Care Act.   It is not an overnight success. 50 years America was trying to work  on a system that would work, beyond the Medicare system, and Medicaid.   We are supporting--many of us--a way to provide healthcare for all,  like Medicare for all. I am supporting this legislation, but what is  happening in the administration is nothing but an implosion of a  lifeline for the American people.   We need to stop that now.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding,  the chairman of the full committee, I acknowledge the ranking member,  and indicate that, as all of us who have come to the floor, this is an  enormously historic day.   For those of us who know the history of equal pay for women in  America, this is a journey long in coming and continuing--first with  the Equal Pay Act of some 50-plus years ago; then with the Lilly  Ledbetter Act 10 years ago; and now with this historic legislation, the  Paycheck Fairness Act--to make good on the idea that women should not  be getting less than their male counterparts: African American women  earning 61 percent, Latina women earning 53 percent, and Hawaiian and  Pacific Islanders earning 62 percent versus White, non-Hispanic men.   The most important part of this legislation is the protection given  to women today, requiring employers to prove that pay disparities exist  for legitimate, job-related reasons other than sex. It bans  retaliation against workers who wish to discuss their wages. It removes  obstacles in the Equal Pay Act to allow workers to participate in  class-action lawsuits and improves the Department of Labor tools for  enforcing the Equal Pay Act.     Madam Chair, it is important to note that no one, as  a woman, can ask you what your previous pay was--how denigrating that  is--and use it as a basis to not pay you what you really deserve in  this new position.   Also, women are heads of household; they deserve the ability to  provide for their family.   Madam Chair, this is not a lawsuit bill. This is an opportunity bill.  This is a fairness bill. This is the ability to go into court to  receive justice. And, yes, as part of justice, class-action lawsuits  can work.   I believe that the Paycheck Fairness Act should be passed, promptly  going to the other body, and be signed by the President of the United  States, because women, too, have the responsibilities to serve and  provide for their family.   This is an historic piece of legislation. I thank Rosa DeLauro.
