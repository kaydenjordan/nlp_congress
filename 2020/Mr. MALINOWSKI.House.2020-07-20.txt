 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of amendment  122 offered by Mr. Deutch of Florida, which adds the Robert Levinson  Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act.   Madam Speaker, this amendment is named for Bob Levinson, the longest  held American hostage. I have the honor of representing one of Bob's  daughters in Congress.   He was a 25-year FBI veteran who disappeared from Iran on March 9,  2007. Time and again, the Levinsons watched as other Americans came  home from Iran, and Bob was left behind.   After 13 years, his family learned this March that a determination  was made  [[Page H3499]]  that he was no longer alive. It was a heart-wrenching moment for them  and for everyone who had worked on their behalf.   The amendment before us today will ensure that families receive the  support they need, that the U.S. Government will have a coordinated and  coherent hostage policy, and that the position of Special Envoy for  Hostage Affairs will be permanently codified in law, and it authorizes  sanctions against those who engage in hostage-taking.   Madam Speaker, I thank the many bipartisan cosponsors of this  amendment for recognizing that we have no higher national security  responsibility than the protection of Americans.
