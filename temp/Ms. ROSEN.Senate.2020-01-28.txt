 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a  great Nevadan, American, and member of the Greatest Generation,  Carmella Wood, who passed away on January 26, 2020 at the age of 97 in  Las Vegas, the city she called home in the Silver State since 2003.   Carmella, like many others of her generation, answered her country's  call during World War II, volunteering to serve in the fight against  tyranny. When the U.S. Army would not take her because of her 4-foot  11-inch height, she joined the war effort, working in a factory on the  east coast building Corsair Bombers. Carmella's dedication to serving  her country is reflected in the fact that even though the factory she  was assigned to was 20 miles from her home, she never missed a day,  sometimes having to walk in the snow the rest of the way to work when  the bus she rode on could not completely reach the factory. She and the  women she worked with day in and day out kept our troops in the fight,  and these women would eventually come to be collectively and  affectionately known as Rosie the Riveters. Rosies like Carmella  produced over 297,000 airplanes, 102,000 tanks, 88,000 warships, and  countless other pieces of wartime equipment which helped American and  Allied troops defeat enemy forces both in the European and Pacific  Theaters, winning the war and bringing an end to the terror Nazi  Germany and Japan had inflicted upon countless countries.   After the war Carmella, like many other Rosies and members of the  ``greatest generation'', returned to living their lives. They married,  had kids of their own, and worked outside the home. However, Carmella  never forgot her time as a Rosie. Over 20 years ago, she started  attending national Rosie the Riveter Association reunions and other  events where she was able to share her experiences and teach current  generations about how these dedicated women kept America fighting in  the war so their sacrifices and work are not forgotten or overlooked.   Mr. President, please join me in honoring and remembering Carmella  Wood, one of our legendary Rosie the Riveters of World War II, a true  Nevadan and American patriot who answered her Nation's call to service,  someone who reflects the high ideals of this country. Her spirit,  perseverance, and dedication are an inspiration to all Americans, and  she will be truly missed.  [[Page S634]]                                ____________________
