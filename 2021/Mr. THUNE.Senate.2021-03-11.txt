 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I voted for a number of President Biden's  nominees--his nominee for Treasury Secretary, for Defense Secretary,  for Attorney General, for Director of National Intelligence, for  Agriculture Secretary, and others. These candidates were not the ones I  would have picked if I were President, but I believe it is important  for our country that our President have a team in place.   As long as a President's nominees aren't raising serious concerns, I  think a President of either party is entitled to have the people he or  she chooses serving in his or her administration, but by the same  token, if a President's nominee does raise serious concerns, I think we  have a responsibility as Senators to oppose him or her. Today, I rise  to oppose the President's nominee to head the Department of Health and  Human Services.   A number of President Biden's nominees have been qualified,  mainstream candidates. Xavier Becerra is not a mainstream candidate. He  is an extremist who has used the offices he has held to advance an  aggressively pro-abortion agenda and to target religious liberty and  freedom of conscience. Mr. Becerra does not represent the views of the  majority of Americans; he represents the views of the radical, pro- abortion wing of the Democratic Party.   The Planned Parenthood wing of the Democratic Party would like  Americans to believe that unrestricted abortion on demand up to the  moment of birth is a no-brainer, an unqualified good, but the truth is,  despite decades of trying to convince Americans of this, Americans  simply don't agree.  [[Page S1481]]    Just 29 percent of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in  all circumstances. The vast majority of Americans believe that abortion  should either be illegal or that there should be at least some  restrictions, undoubtedly because on some level, every American is  aware that when we talk about abortion, we are talking about killing a  human being. Mr. Becerra, on the other hand, does not seem to support  any restrictions on abortion. If he does, I would sure like to hear  about them.   As a Congressman, he earned perfect ratings from Planned Parenthood  and NARAL. He assembled an overwhelmingly pro-abortion voting record,  even opposing a ban on partial-birth abortion--a procedure so heinous  and repulsive, it is difficult to even describe.   As California attorney general, he aggressively crusaded in favor of  abortion. He is known for defending California's law forcing crisis  pregnancy centers to advertise abortion--a case he lost at the Supreme  Court on First Amendment grounds. But his activities were hardly  limited to California abortion law. This was not a case of an attorney  general simply defending the laws of their own State. No. As California  attorney general, Mr. Becerra repeatedly--repeatedly--inserted himself  into abortion debates in other States. He joined other attorneys  general to file amicus briefs challenging abortion laws in Missouri,  Arkansas, Louisiana, and other States, and he frequently led these  efforts himself--a fact he proudly highlighted in press releases.   Mr. Becerra's extremist views on abortion would be enough of a red  flag, but to that we have to add Mr. Becerra's record on religious  liberty and freedom of conscience--most famously his efforts to force  religious people, including nuns, to offer health insurance benefits  that violate their religious beliefs.   At a Finance Committee hearing, Mr. Becerra tried to downplay his  actions in this case. ``I never sued [an order of] nuns,'' he claimed.  ``I have [sued] the federal government.'' Well, that is an answer only  a lawyer could love. Yes, he didn't sue nuns; he sued the Federal  Government to force nuns and other religious people to offer health  insurance benefits that violate their consciences. That was the aim of  his lawsuit--to force nuns and other religious Americans to act  contrary to their consciences.   When an order of nuns, the Little Sisters of the Poor, joined the  case in an effort to ensure their right to live according to their  faith was protected, Mr. Becerra apparently had no hesitation in  continuing his suit.   Mr. Becerra's extremist views on abortion and his record on religious  liberty would be troubling in any nominee, but they would matter a lot  less if we were talking about a nominee for, say, Secretary of  Transportation. But that is not what we are talking about. We are  talking about putting Mr. Becerra in charge of a Cabinet Department  entrusted with interpreting and applying laws protecting religious  freedom and freedom of conscience.   Nothing I have seen suggests to me that Mr. Becerra can be relied on  to provide robust protection for these cherished rights. In fact, I am  profoundly concerned that Mr. Becerra would use his office to limit  Americans' religious freedom. Under Mr. Becerra's HHS, are nuns going  to be forced to offer health insurance benefits that violate their  religious faith? Will healthcare professionals be protected from having  to perform procedures, like abortions, that violate their consciences?   Given Mr. Becerra's record, I am concerned about the answers to these  questions. In fact, there is a reason to be concerned. A prime reason  for nominating Mr. Becerra was his radical abortion advocacy and his  attacks on religious liberty.   It is difficult to find another reason for nominating Mr. Becerra  during a global health emergency. Mr. Becerra is not a doctor. He has  not worked in the healthcare field. He is not a virologist or a vaccine  expert. He does not have a background in public health. It is not  unreasonable to conclude that his appeal to the abortion left, one of  the most powerful interest groups in the Democrat Party, was a prime  reason for his nomination.   NARAL and Planned Parenthood certainly give credence to that idea  with their enthusiastic statements in support of Mr. Becerra, which  highlighted his aggressive abortion advocacy. I also have to say that  it is pretty interesting to nominate someone to head HHS who, in his  last job, proudly sued HHS repeatedly.   I know that President Biden is a man of faith, but he is doing a  great disservice to people of faith and to the First Amendment with  this nomination. He is also doing a disservice to the American people  by nominating a candidate whose views on abortion are so radical and so  out of step with the views of most Americans.   Days ago, three of my Democrat colleagues broke ranks with their  party to stand up for the many, many Americans who don't want their tax  dollars going to pay for abortions. I urge them and all of my  colleagues to join me in opposing the nomination of Xavier Becerra.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Burr).
