 Madam Speaker, President Trump has committed an illegal  and unconstitutional act of war, pushing our Nation headlong into a war  with Iran without any authorization from Congress, a war that would be  so costly and devastating, it would make our wars in Iraq and  Afghanistan look like a picnic.   In doing so, he has undermined our national security in two critical  ways: number one, Iran is no longer complying with the Iran nuclear  agreement and is quickly speeding forward in developing their nuclear  weapons capability, putting us and the world at greater risk.   Number two, our troops in Iraq are no longer focusing on preventing a  resurgence of ISIS and al-Qaida. Instead, all of their efforts are now  focused on Iranian forces and Iranian-backed Shia militias.   Congress must act today to stop further escalation of this war. Vote  ``yes'' on H. Con. Res. 83 to uphold the Constitution which we all took  an oath to support. Vote ``yes'' to stop Trump's war with Iran.
