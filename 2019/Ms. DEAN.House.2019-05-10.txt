 Madam Speaker, this week, the Congressional PFAS Task  Force, including Representatives Kildee, Tonko, and Fitzpatrick, joined  me in my district to address clean water and to address PFAS water  contamination. I thank them for joining me. We visited Naval Air  Station Joint Base Willow Grove.   Like hundreds of other military installations across the country,  Willow Grove used firefighting foam with PFAS chemicals for decades.  Today, polluted water continues to flow off this base and into our  region's water table.   PFAS is associated with serious health risks, including cancer and  impaired immune system performance. The manufacturers, EPA, and DOD  have known about some of the dangers for a long time. By the early  2000s, it was clear that PFAS was contaminating drinking water, yet  PFAS remains in use, and EPA still has not established a maximum  contaminant level.   This week, I introduced H.R. 2600, the Toxic PFAS Control Act. This  bill phases out PFAS by banning the manufacturing and processing of  these chemicals and will require EPA to regulate its disposal.   I thank Chairman Tonko for his commitment to this issue to live up to  our obligation to provide clean drinking water to our families and  communities.                            ____________________
