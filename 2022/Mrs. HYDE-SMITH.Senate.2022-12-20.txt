 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay  tribute to a very special man who was held dear by many Mississippians,  Mississippi State University head coach Mike Leach, who passed away on  December 12, 2022.   Today, thousands of Mississippians and people from across the country  will gather in Starkville to celebrate the life of Mike Leach, who  began his coaching at Mississippi State in 2020.   Coach Leach's quirkiness, youthful spirit, and dynamic coaching style  immediately endeared him to football fans across my State. His likeable  and unique personality broke barriers among schools. Whether you were  cheering for Mississippi State, Jackson State, Ole Miss, Southern, or  any other  [[Page S7793]]  school, you couldn't help but chuckle at the entertaining sideline  interviews or admire how his ``Air Raid'' offense was changing the  game.   Coach Leach was an attorney. He started his coaching career shortly  after graduating from law school. Mike Leach made a lasting impact on  the game of football, to be sure, but, more importantly, his  extraordinary leadership and passion for the game made a lasting impact  on his players, his colleagues, and his loved ones.   These remarks can't fully encompass Mike Leach's life as a husband,  father, grandfather, scholar, mentor, and charitable man. Still,  Mississippi is blessed to have been able to call Mike Leach one of our  own these past years.   While our State mourns, we remain grateful for the memories and the  stories his legacy leaves.   My heart goes out to his family and the entire Bulldog family.   Hail State, and rest in peace, Coach.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I object.    Madam President, I object.
