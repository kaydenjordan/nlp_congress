 Madam President, I request unanimous consent to enter into  a colloquy with the Senator from Oklahoma. As the chairman and ranking  member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, we rise to commemorate  and celebrate the distinguished career of Ms. Cheryl M. Black of the  Department of Defense.    A native of California, Cheryl joined the Army in 1977 and  worked at every echelon since, to include the U.S. Army Military  Personnel Center; Immediate Office of the Secretary of the Army; the  Army Office Legislative Liaison. After retiring from the Army in 1998,  Cheryl served on the personal office staff of Senator John Warner and  then went back to her roots at the Department of Defense in 2001, where  she has served as the Deputy Director General and Flag Officer Matters.  In every assignment, she was known to her colleagues as a dedicated  leader and an expert of her craft.    Cheryl did not serve alone, however. Throughout her career,  she was supported by her family, friends, and colleagues. We owe a  special debt of gratitude to Cheryl's son, Damion, and his family, who  supported her with strength and love. Her contributions to the Nation  were possible because of their support.    Madam President, I rise today to honor a great American and  an exceptional member of the U.S. Air Force.   Lt. Col. Nathan ``Nate'' Kitzke has distinguished himself through his  professional character and dedication by serving this Nation in  uniform. A leader and expert communicator, he has provided  distinguished service to our country while assigned to the Air Force  Senate Liaison Office. He is an outstanding leader and a great airman  to represent the Air Force on Capitol  [[Page S6688]]  Hill. A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Nate has served in the  Air Force for over 18 years. As a deployed squadron commander and C-130  pilot, Nate has led thousands of airmen in support of U.S. Air Force  missions worldwide.   Throughout his career, Nate has demonstrated exceptional, unrivaled  officership. He is a senior pilot with over 2,150 flying hours in the  C-130E/H and has flown more than 1,000 combat hours over five  deployments in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom,  New Dawn, and Inherent Resolve. Prior to his current assignment, Nate  had the privilege of being a deployed squadron commander at the 407th  Expeditionary Operations Support Squadron, where he led two teams of  airmen and civilians in managing two strategically essential Kuwaiti  airfields.   As a legislative liaison in the Air Force Senate Liaison Office from  June 2020 to June 2022, Lieutenant Colonel Kitzke performed his duties  well and without reservation supporting the 116th and 117th U.S.  Congresses. His strategic thinking and foresight helped to strengthen  and improve our national security. Nate accomplished this utilizing his  in-depth Air Force knowledge with numerous engagements between Congress  and the Department of the Air Force.   Nate expertly conveyed Department of the Air Force positions on the  Air Force Future Design that included the future bomber, tanker, and  fighter force. Nate's direct support provided the U.S. Senate critical  information necessary for three National Defense Authorization Acts.  His efforts helped establish the U.S. Space Force, ensure the  confirmation of the 26th Air Force Secretary, the 22nd Air Force Chief  of Staff, and ensured the Department of the Air Force support of the  National Defense Strategy in our return to great power competition.   Lieutenant Colonel Kitzke planned and led delegations for Members of  Congress on visits all over the world to include the bicameral Reagan  National Defense Forum. Nate's significant efforts led to successful  engagements between this governing body and senior Department of  Defense Officials including the Secretary of the Air Force. All of  these engagements helped U.S. Senators understand defense equities and  their impact on national security. Due to his direct involvement and  stewardship, Members of Congress were able to make informed decisions  and ensure the Department of the Air Force was properly resourced and  funded.   After serving in this crucial role for the past 2 years and becoming  a fixture on Capitol Hill, Lieutenant Colonel Kitzke will move to his  next assignment, attending Air War College at Maxwell AFB, AL, a  selection reserved only for the top echelon of Air Force leaders. Nate,  his wife Gileanne, and their son Diego have sacrificed much as a family  in service to our Nation. I am thankful for Nate's service and his work  with my office and the Senate over the past 2 years on issues of vital  importance to this great Nation. I salute this American patriot whose  selfless service has kept our country safe and strong.                            ____________________
