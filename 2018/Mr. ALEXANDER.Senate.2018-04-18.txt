 Mr. President, later this afternoon, the Senate will  finally vote to confirm Carlos Muniz--a well-qualified nominee--to be  general counsel at the U.S. Department of Education.   I came to the floor last week to ask for this vote because I believe  Mr. Muniz has been subject to unreasonable delays. For example, Mr.  Muniz was nominated by the President on June 6th of last year--316 days  ago. He has been pending on the floor since we reported him out of the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on October 18, 2017-- 182 days ago. In other words, he has been waiting for 6 months,  following his approval by the relevant committee, for the Senate to  consider this nomination. So it is time to confirm him. It is time to  give Secretary DeVos an attorney and a general counsel.    Mr. Muniz has extensive experience as an attorney and in government.  From January 2014 to February 2018, he was a partner at the law firm of  McGuireWoods in Florida.   Prior to that, from January 2011 to 2014, he was Deputy Attorney  General for the State of Florida and Chief of Staff to Attorney General  Pam Bondi. There, he managed a 400-lawyer agency and oversaw all  functions, including litigation, policy development, legislative  affairs, and communications. He was also General Counsel for Florida's  Department of Financial Services and Deputy General Counsel for  Governor Jeb Bush.   Mr. Muniz graduated from the University of Virginia with high honors.  He earned his law degree from Yale, where he was an editor of the Yale  Law Journal. After law school, he served as a law clerk to two Federal  judges, one on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the  other for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. In  other words, he is exactly the kind of person that we hope would serve  in public life.   I am delighted that he chose to accept the President's nomination and  that we will have a chance this afternoon to confirm him.   As general counsel, he will have the important job of providing legal  assistance to the Secretary concerning the programs and policies of the  Department and making sure that these policies follow the law, which  given his background, he has the experience to do.   He testified in his confirmation hearing that he is committed to  advising the Secretary to follow the law as Congress wrote it.   I am glad we are having this vote today. I support his nomination. I  urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his courtesy in  allowing me to speak before him.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, our country lost a bright,  caring, independent lady, and my wife, Honey, and I lost a good friend.  Barbara Bush set a wonderful example as mom, wife, First Lady, and  advocate for adult literacy. We express to the Bush family our sympathy  and great respect for the life of Barbara Bush.   Jon Meacham wrote the biography of George H.W. Bush, Barbara Bush's  husband, to great acclaim. He had access to the diaries of President  Bush and Barbara Bush that was almost unparalleled in any Presidential  biographer's experience. So it was a plain and unvarnished biography  that told us a lot about those two individuals. I thought a better name  for Jon Meacham's book--it was named ``Destiny and Power,'' and it must  have been properly named because it sold a lot--would be ``The Last  Gentleman.'' If I were to make a really accurate suggestion about the  title for the book, I would call it ``The Last Gentleman and His Lady''  or maybe ``The Last Gentleman and His Very Independent Lady'' because  Barbara Bush was a very independent lady.    I remember it was 1991. It was a sunny day, and we were walking on  the south lawn of the White House. I was the Education Secretary, and I  was walking with the President and Mrs. Bush to the announcement of his  GI Bill for Kids, which was a school choice program for low-income  children. As we walked along, Barbara Bush turned to President Bush and  said, ``George, you've got on the wrong pants.'' He had a suit coat on  from one suit, and he had pants on from another suit. So she said to  the President ``You go on back in and change clothes, and Lamar and I  will wait here for you,'' which we did and he did.   On another occasion, President Bush invited my wife and me to join  Barbara and the President at Ford's theater. Of course, the President  traveled with great security in a big car. As the protocol goes, he got  out first, and as she was about to get out, she said, ``I'll get the  door, George.''   On still another occasion, I was sitting next to Barbara and George  Bush, and the President was called on to make some remarks. He leaned  over to his wife and said, ``Barbara, what should I talk about?'' And  she whispered very loudly, ``About five minutes, George.''   Barbara Bush was quite a woman. She said what she thought. When the  second one of her sons decided to run for President, she was reported  to have said, ``We've had enough Bushes.''   When I ran for President in 1999 against her other son, I made what I  thought--certainly by today's standards--some very mild comments  disagreeing about something, and I heard  [[Page S2248]]  from Barbara Bush about what I had said about her son, George W. Bush.   Not many of us think how difficult it must be to be the spouse of a  President of the United States with all that one goes through, but  think how much harder it must also be to be the mother of a President  of the United States and the mother of another distinguished son who  was Governor of a large State and who ran for President of the United  States. Barbara Bush was the anchor of her family, and a very  successful and remarkable family it was.   I was Education Secretary for President Bush in 1991 when the  National Literacy Act was enacted. Let's use Barbara's own words to  define the event. She wrote in her memoir, ``I must say I got more  credit than I deserve.''   I don't agree with that, but she continued:         I heard that George was going to give the pen to me, but       before he could, Senator Simon spoke up and said, ``That pen       ought to go to Barbara.'' I donated it to the George Bush       Presidential Library Center. In the end, however it's not       pens and pictures that count; it's the National Literacy Act       that really counts. It was the first piece of legislation--      and to date, the only one--ever enacted specifically for       literacy with the goal of ensuring that every American adult       acquires the basic literacy skills necessary to achieve the       greatest possible satisfaction professionally and personally.       But even more than that, the act seeks to strengthen our       nation by giving us more productive workers and informed       citizens.    In his biography of President George H.W. Bush, John Meacham wrote of  a ``generational controversy,'' in his words, that Barbara Bush endured  in May of 1990. She was invited to Wellesley College to speak at  graduation and receive an honorary degree, but she was being criticized  by Wellesley's young women, as President Bush put in his own diary-- these are President Bush's words--``because she hasn't made it on her  own--she's where she is because she's her husband's wife. What's wrong  with the fact that she's a good mother,'' President Bush wrote in his  diary, ``a good wife, great volunteer, great leader for literacy and  other fine causes? Nothing. But to listen to these elitist kids there  is.''   Meacham writes:         Mrs. Bush invited [Mrs.] Gorbachev along with her to       Wellesley. There, [she] confronted the issues of work versus       family and the role of women head-on, delivering a well-      received commencement address.    She put the audience at ease early on by saying: One day, I am sure  that someone in this audience will grow up to become a spouse of the  President of the United States, and I wish him well.   Meacham continues:         ``Maybe we should adjust faster, maybe we should adjust       slower,'' she told the graduates. ``But whatever the era,       whatever the times, one thing will never change: Fathers and       mothers, if you have children--they must come first. You must       read to your children, and you must hug your children, and       you must love your children. Your success as a family, our       success as a society depends not on what happens in the White       House, but on what happens inside your house.''    Barbara Bush said that to the Wellesley graduates in 1990.   The country is expressing to the Bush family, as I am trying to  today, our great respect for Barbara Bush's life.   President Bush, George H.W. Bush, has sent a response to those of us  who sent our condolences, and I would like to close with the  President's own words about his wife Barbara. This is what George H.W.  Bush said:         I always knew Barbara was the most beloved woman in the       world, and in fact I used to tease her that I had a complex       about that fact. But the truth is the outpouring of love and       friendship being directed at The Enforcer is lifting us all       up. We have faith she is in heaven, and we know life will go       on--as she would have it. So cross the Bushes off your worry       list.    I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.
