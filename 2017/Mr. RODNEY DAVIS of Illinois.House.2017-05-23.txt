 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life and memory of a lifelong resident of my hometown of Taylorville,  Illinois, my good friend, Michael Welge. Mike was a veteran, public  servant, devoted husband to his wife, Judy, father, grandfather, and,  again, my friend.   Mike passed away on May 4, but he left a long legacy of dedication to  his family, his country, and his community. As an Army veteran who  served his country, Mike continued his service to military members as  the commander of American Legion Post 73.   Mike worked at Peabody Mine No. 10 for years before beginning a 22- year career at the Illinois Department of Corrections. Mike served as a  member of the Taylorville Planning and Zoning Committee for 25 years  and was a member of many groups like the Taylorville FFA Association,  the American Farm Heritage Museum in Greenville, ABATE, and Moose Lodge  1516.   Mike is survived by his wife, Judy, son, grandson, and brother. He  will be truly missed by all who knew him, and I consider myself blessed  to have known Mike Welge as a friend.                            ____________________
