 Madam President, while returning to Washington, DC, on  September 12, my flight was temporarily grounded by inclement weather,  delaying my return to Washington, DC. As a result, I was unable to  attend the vote on the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar  No. 1043, Arianna J. Freeman, of Pennsylvania, to be United States  Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit.   I would have voted yea on the confirmation had I been able to attend  the vote.                            ____________________
