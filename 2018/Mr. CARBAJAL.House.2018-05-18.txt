 Mr. Speaker, this week marks 3 years since the Refugio/ Plains pipeline failure spilled more than 100,000 gallons of crude oil  along the Gaviota coast in my district. Black oil slick coated our  beaches and marine life, costing over $96 million to clean up and  hurting our local economy.   That spill occurred 3 years after Congress unanimously passed the  Pipeline Safety Act of 2011. This law directed PHMSA to update key  pipeline safety standards, requiring the installation of automatic and  remote control shutoff valves, including leak detection technology.   However, nearly 7 years later, 20 of the pipeline safety directives  in that legislation have not been enacted. During the Plains oil spill,  it took operators over 2 hours to find the source of the leak.  [[Page H4235]]    Yesterday I joined Senator Feinstein, directing the agency to answer  why these requirements have not been implemented to date to ensure we  are improving pipeline safety.                            ____________________
