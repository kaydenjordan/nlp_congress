 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Andrew  Morin of Nashua as June's Granite Stater of the Month. Andrew cofounded  the ReGenerative Roots Association, which runs community farms, farm- to-school programs, and a food hub to help Nashua families thrive.   When Andrew was about 5 years old, his father gave him his first  tomato seed to plant in their backyard. What started as an ingenious  way to encourage Andrew to eat his vegetables turned into Andrew  developing a lifelong passion for agriculture and local food systems.   About 10 years ago, Andrew and a group of high school friends, who  were also lifelong Nashua residents, became interested in tackling  local food security and sustainability. Using their connections in the  community, they founded the ReGenerative Roots Association with a  4,000-square-foot garden plot, a couple of volunteers, and some high  school interns. Today, the nonprofit is on its seventh growing season,  with three community farm sites that are on pace to grow 15,000 pounds  of food this year. The land is open to use by refugees and new farmers,  and all who farm on the land donate 10 percent of their produce to the  Nashua Children's Home or Nashua Soup Kitchen.   In addition to community farms, ReGenerative Roots also has robust  farm-to-school programs that teach students about the importance of  local food systems and healthy eating through hands-on experiences in  school gardens. Its newest program, the Food Hub, sells produce from  local New England vendors and also has a food pantry to help people and  families who can't afford the food that they need.   Andrew Morin has made an incredible difference in the Nashua area,  providing healthy fruits and vegetables to families and creating a  sense of community and economic empowerment for newly arrived refugees.  I commend him for his determination in tackling the challenging issue  of food insecurity and healthy nutrition and for his generosity in  giving back to the community. Andrew's work exemplifies the Granite  State spirit, and I look forward to seeing how ReGenerative Roots  continues to touch the lives of even more Granite Staters in the years  to come.                            ____________________
