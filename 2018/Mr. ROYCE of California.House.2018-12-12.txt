 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the  outstanding service of Amy Porter, my chief of staff for 17 years,  including the last 6 years on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Amy is a  skillful manager and leader who has been central to everything I have  accomplished in Congress.   Amy has been a tremendous asset to my office in no small part because  she has the heart for tackling some of the toughest issues and the  drive to see them through. She ensured that issues like combating human  trafficking and protecting children in adversity were front and center  to our agenda.   When I became chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, she encouraged  us to use this platform to call attention to the plight of  disadvantaged groups around the world, particularly women and girls.  This included holding a series of hearings on ways the United States  could support women's empowerment around the globe, from promoting  girls' education to women's inclusion in peace processes.   But, of course, Amy made sure we didn't stop there. She pressed us to  develop solutions that would make a difference. As a result, the  committee has passed many pieces of legislation--the READ Act; the  Women, Peace, and Security Act; and the Women's Entrepreneurship and  Economic Empowerment Act--that will give more women and girls a voice  in decisions affecting their lives.   Amy traveled during her personal time to Cambodia and to India to  work in orphanages and shelters, helping young girls subjected to human  trafficking. She was relentless in helping me press governments on  human rights, from the discriminating treatment toward those some still  call the untouchables, the Dalits of India, to the genocide of the  Rohingya of Myanmar, to female victims of trafficking and abuse  worldwide.   From day one, Amy has understood how to reach out and connect with my  constituents. When she announced over a decade ago that I should hold  an annual event for women in my district to network and learn more  about what I was doing in Washington, others were quickly dismissive.  They questioned whether women who weren't already involved in politics  would be interested in attending lectures on various policy issues or  foreign affairs. However, 1,000 women in my district came to our  seventh annual conference to hear former Secretary of State Condoleezza  Rice discuss lessons from her career.   That is the amazing thing about Amy. For her, it is never enough to  point out a problem. She possesses an unshakeable drive to make this  world a better place, and the vision and leadership to realize even the  most lofty ambitions.   It is thanks to her dedication that we were able to bring hundreds of  adopted children home from Congo to their legal parents in the United  States after their exit visas were suspended. Children stuck in filthy  and underfunded orphanages were dying. Amy heard about it and traveled  to Kinshasa on these children's behalf.   When she landed, she ran into a protest against the government. She  continued on, made her case, and was rebuffed. She vowed to return.   She returned with a congressional delegation, which I led, and thanks  to her effort, hundreds of American families now have new members whose  lives are better beyond comprehension. These families thank Amy. My  constituents thank Amy.   Thank you, Amy Porter, for your 20 years of service to this country.   Mr. Speaker, I know when her daughter, Sara Jo, is old enough, she  will thank Amy for what she has done for the empowerment of women and  for what Amy has done for Sara Jo.                            ____________________
