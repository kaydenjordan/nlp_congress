 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan  legislation with my colleague Senator Portman that would align HUD  homeless assistance with existing Federal children and youth programs  and provide flexibility to local communities to use available resources  to meet the needs that they identify.  [[Page S1781]]    According to the U.S. Department of Education, approximately 1.2  million children were homeless during the 2014 to 2015 school year;  this is a 34-percent increase from the 939,903 homeless students in the  2009 to 2010 school year.   In California, over 229,000 children experienced homelessness in  2015, nearly four times the 65,000 homeless children in the State in  2003.   Unfortunately, the numbers reported by the HUD Point-in-Time count  fail to reflect these increasing numbers.   According to the national 2015 HUD Point-in-Time count, there were  only 206,286 people counted as homeless in households that included  children, a fraction of the true number.   This is important because only those children counted by HUD are  eligible for vital homeless assistance programs and included in local  planning efforts. The rest of these children and families are simply  out of luck.   The Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2017 would allow HUD homeless  assistance programs to serve extremely vulnerable children and  families, specifically those staying in motels or in doubled-up  situations because they have nowhere else to go.   These families are especially susceptible to abuse and trafficking  because they are often not served by a case manager and thus remain  hidden from potential social service providers.   As a result of the current narrow HUD definition, communities that  receive Federal funding through the competitive application process are  unable to prioritize or direct resources to help these children and  families.   This bill would provide communities with the flexibility to use  Federal funds to meet local priorities. The bill requires the Secretary  to assess the extent to which Continuums of Care use separate,  specific, age-appropriate criteria for determining the safety and needs  of children and unaccompanied youth and divert people to safe, stable,  age-appropriate accommodations.   And I would note that the bill does not impose any new mandates on  service providers.   Finally, this legislation improves data collection transparency by  requiring HUD to report the point in time PIT count and the Annual  Homeless Assessment Report, AHAR to include data on all categories of  homelessness.   Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Rob Portman has joined me as  an original cosponsor on this bill. Homelessness continues to plague  our Nation. If we fail to address the needs of these children and  families today, they will remain stuck in a cycle of poverty and  chronic homelessness.   It is our moral obligation to ensure that we do not erect more  barriers for these children and families to access services when they  are experiencing extreme hardship. I believe this bill is a commonsense  solution that will ensure that homeless families and children can  receive the help they need.                                  ______                                         By Mr. LEE (for himself and Mr. Hatch):   S.J. Res. 38. A joint resolution providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to  ``Approval, Disapproval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation  Plans; Partial Approval and Partial Disapproval of Air Quality  Implementation Plans and Federal Implementation Plan; Utah; Revisions  to Regional Haze State Implementation Plan; Federal Implementation Plan  for Regional Haze''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan  legislation with my colleague Senator Portman that would align HUD  homeless assistance with existing Federal children and youth programs  and provide flexibility to local communities to use available resources  to meet the needs that they identify.
