 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I seek  recognition to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the  privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   H. Res. 489, censuring and condemning Adam Schiff, Representative of  California's 30th Congressional District.   Whereas the allegation that President Donald Trump colluded with  Russia to steal the 2016 Presidential election has been revealed as  false by numerous in-depth investigations, including the recent report  by Special Counsel John Durham, which documents how the conspiracy  theory was invented, funded, and spread by President Trump's political  rivals;   Whereas Representative Adam Schiff, who served as ranking minority  member and then chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence of the House of Representatives, HPSCI, occupied positions  of extreme trust, affording him access to sensitive intelligence  unavailable to most Members of Congress;   Whereas for years Representative Schiff abused this trust by citing  evidence of collusion that, as is clear from reports by Special Counsel  Robert Mueller, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael  Horowitz, and Special Counsel Durham, does not exist;   Whereas by repeatedly telling these falsehoods, Representative Schiff  purposely deceived his committee, Congress, and the American people;   Whereas Representative Schiff lent credibility to the Steele dossier,  a collection of debunked collusion accusations funded by President  Trump's political rivals, by reading false Steele allegations into the  Congressional Record at an HPSCI hearing on March 20, 2017;   Whereas once again abusing his privileged access to classified  information, Representative Schiff composed a false memo justifying the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, warrant application on  Trump associate Carter Page, which Inspector General Horowitz later  found was riddled with 17 major mistakes and omissions, provoking FISA  court presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer to state unequivocally that the  Federal Bureau of Investigation misled the FISC;   Whereas by publicly smearing Carter Page as a Russian collaborator  and justifying spurious investigations of him, Representative Schiff  contributed to the gross violation of a United States citizen's civil  liberties, thereby committing the very abuses HPSCI is tasked with  identifying and thwarting;   Whereas as HPSCI ranking minority member and chairman, Representative  Schiff behaved dishonestly and dishonorably on many other occasions,  including by falsely denying that his staff coordinated with a  whistleblower to launch the first impeachment of President Trump;   Whereas as part of his impeachment efforts, during an HPSCI hearing  on September 26, 2019, Representative Schiff recited a false, concocted  rendition of a phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy;   Whereas Representative Schiff exploited his positions on HPSCI to  encourage and excuse abusive intelligence investigations of Americans  for political purposes;  [[Page H2822]]    Whereas Representative Schiff used his position and access to  sensitive information to instigate a fraudulently based investigation,  which he then used to amass political gain and fundraising dollars;   Whereas the American taxpayers paid $32 million to fund the  investigation into collusion that was launched as a result of  Representative Schiff's lies, misrepresentations, and abuses of  sensitive information; and   Whereas if it is determined by an investigation conducted by the  Committee on Ethics that Representative Schiff lied, made  misrepresentations, and abused sensitive information, he should be  fined in the amount of $16 million:   Now, therefore, be it   Resolved, that:   (1) the House of Representatives censures and condemns Adam Schiff,  Representative of California's 30th Congressional District, for conduct  that misleads the American people in a way that is not befitting an  elected Member of the House of Representatives;   (2) Representative Adam Schiff will forthwith present himself in the  well of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure;   (3) Representative Adam Schiff will be censured with the public  reading of this resolution by the Speaker; and   (4) the Committee on Ethics shall conduct an investigation into  Representative Adam Schiff's lies, misrepresentations, and abuses of  sensitive information.
