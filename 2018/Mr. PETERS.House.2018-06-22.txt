 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I want to take a moment to say a special thank you to  Mr. Pallone and his committee staff for their tireless work to address  this crisis.   The opioid crisis has ravaged our Nation. It twice has been declared  a national public health emergency under Federal law. More than 100  people will die from an overdose just today.   That is why this bipartisan effort to address it is so important.  There is certainly work to be done, but I am happy that legislation  that I worked on with my colleague, Dr. Bucshon, is included in this  bill, and it aims to stop addiction where it frequently begins: after  surgery. Millions of Americans are prescribed opioids following routine  surgeries because they are cheap and accessible, and nearly 70 percent  of those pills go unused.   Our bill reverses the perverse incentive that put so many cheap pills  in people's hands in the first place. It allows innovators to receive  extra compensation for nonaddictive opioid alternatives if they can  show that their alternative therapies have substantial clinical  benefit.   In the short term, the policy reduces the incentive to simply use the  cheapest postsurgical pain treatment, which is typically an opioid. In  the long term, it will spur innovation by providing additional  compensation for the future development of nonaddictive alternatives.  That means as long as this crisis takes to solve, there will be an  incentive to continue to develop nonopioid alternatives.   Of course, access isn't enough. These treatments must also be  affordable. We will continue to work with CMS and FDA to ensure that  safer and more effective nonopioids are affordable for the people who  need them most. We must find better ways to treat this problem where it  starts.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
