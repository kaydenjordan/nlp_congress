 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chair, I am grateful that the  chairman and lead sponsor will, I anticipate, lend his support to this  amendment. It will close a loophole that would defeat the purpose of  the bill. In fact, absent this amendment, the bill would inadvertently  validate the very conduct this bill aims to stop.   Emerging evidence, most notably the Twitter files, depicts what one  expert has termed the largest censorship program in U.S. Government  history. On the pretext of protecting election infrastructure or  enforcing the Foreign Agents Registration Act, personnel of the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA; the Department  of Homeland Security, DHS; the FBI, the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence; the CIA; the Global Engagement Center from the  State Department, which most Americans had never heard of; and even the  CDC practically embedded themselves with operators of social media  platforms and corporate media to manage and curate Americans' public  discourse, to induce Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, et cetera,  to take down lawful and First Amendment protected speech of Americans  time and again and again.   In so doing, these omnipresent Federal agencies established working  relationships with a small cadre of supposed internet research groups,  affiliated in some cases with well-known universities and NGOs, but  loaded with political partisans, who purported to create black-box  analytical efforts to identify social media accounts that amplified  content from Russia.   But these purported experts, like Hamilton 68, didn't identify  Russian-amplifying bot networks, as they claimed, through some  sophisticated algorithm. They just found a bunch of American Trump  supporter accounts and labeled them that. And for months and months, as  they became a trusted source for media that cited Hamilton 68, Twitter  ``trust and safety executives'' like Yoel Roth stood quietly by knowing  that Hamilton 68 was a fraud.                                time  1630    Guess what? Follow the money. Part of the working relationship  between the agencies and the research groups was funding that flowed by  the millions in government grants. Each day, it becomes clearer that  between these three pillars--Federal security agencies, media  operators, and internet analysts--a new Washington revolving door has  emerged to facilitate the same people moving between them and profiting  from the scam.   The base text of this bill would allow exactly this process to  continue, but there is never a legitimate law enforcement purpose for  Federal agents to take down speech that the First Amendment protects.   We have now seen agencies of the Federal Government once again  targeting Americans for their political views. In the government's  attempt to stop Russian misinformation, they have targeted and attacked  Americans for simply voicing opinions that they disfavor. Their actions  violate our First Amendment principles, and Congress must take this  action to stop it.   The amendment will address the flaw in the bill, but it is odd to me  that Democrats who used to so revere the First Amendment are no longer  concerned about it. In Lamont v. Postmaster General in 1965, which  Democrats lauded, the Court held that Americans have a right to receive  communist propaganda from abroad. The Democrats loved it then. Now,  they don't even want Americans to be able to post their views on social  media. How abhorrent.   We will fix it. This bill will fix it. The amendment will fix the  bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of  my time.
