 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  New York for yielding and all my colleagues for their continued  leadership on this incredibly important issue.   The 118th Congress has begun, and the differences between our side of  the aisle and the other side of the aisle couldn't be any clearer.   Let me, of course, reiterate that, as Democrats, we look forward to  trying to find common ground whenever and wherever possible to solve  issues of consequence on behalf of the American people, but we will  oppose extremism whenever it rears its ugly head.   Democrats have made clear that we are going to continue to work on  issues like lowering costs, better-paying jobs, safer communities,  defending democracy, protecting the public interest, ensuring economic  opportunity in every single ZIP Code, and, yes, fighting for  reproductive freedom.   My Republican colleagues, you promised to come to Washington to fight  for the American people but have spent a lot of time fighting each  other on politics, power, and personality, not working on issues  related to the public interest. That is what the last few days have  indicated, an extreme MAGA Republican agenda.    Now that you are getting into substance, on Monday, you passed a bill  designed to allow the wealthy, the well-off, and the well-connected to  cheat on their taxes, subsidize the lifestyles of the rich and  shameless, benefit millionaires and billionaires, not working-class  families, not middle-class families, not low-income families, not  veterans, not everyday Americans, the wealthy, the well-off, and the  well-connected. That was on Monday.   Then, on Tuesday, you came to the floor and passed a select committee  on insurrection protection, a committee that is clearly designed, in  the words of some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, to  obstruct justice as part of your evident desire, as many of you have  said, to eventually defund the FBI. That was Tuesday.   Now, on Wednesday, you come to the floor with nothing on inflation,  nothing on quality-of-life issues for the American people, nothing even  on public safety. You come to the floor as part of your march to  criminalize abortion care, to impose a nationwide ban, to set into  motion government-mandated pregnancies.   That is the distinction for today. As Democrats, we believe in a  woman's freedom to make her own reproductive healthcare decisions,  period, full stop, decisions that should be between a woman, her  family, and her doctors, period, full stop.   We believe in Roe v. Wade. Do you wonder about our position? That is  it. The Women's Health Protection Act, that is it. Freedom to make your  own reproductive healthcare decisions, that is it. As compared to a  clear effort--that is what this bill is about today, a march toward  criminalizing abortion care, a nationwide ban, government-mandated  pregnancies, part of an extreme MAGA Republican agenda.                                time  1400    So, yes, we continue to extend our hand of partnership if you truly  want to work on quality-of-life issues, but we haven't seen it. We  haven't seen it on Monday, we haven't seen it on Tuesday, and we are  not seeing it today.   Madam Speaker, we oppose this bill. We oppose an extreme MAGA- Republican agenda. Let's get back to the business of the American  people.
