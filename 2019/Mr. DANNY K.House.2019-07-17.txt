 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I strongly support  this bill to eliminate the 40 percent tax on high-quality healthcare  benefits.   Americans are facing a healthcare affordability crisis. Employers and  insurers are already using this tax to justify raising the cost of  healthcare for hardworking Americans by increasing copays, deductibles,  and out-of-pocket expenses.   In the last decade, annual deductibles for families have exploded by  212 percent, and spending on coinsurance has increased nearly 50  percent. A Kaiser Family survey reveals that these changes create  alarming barriers to healthcare for working families, with almost 50  percent of respondents indicating that someone in their family  postponed care due to costs.   I stand with the 43 national labor unions and the dozens of patient  organizations, healthcare advocates, and business leaders who support  this important bill to protect healthcare benefits for American  workers. Healthcare is a right. I am pleased to support this bill.
