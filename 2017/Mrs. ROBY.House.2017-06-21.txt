 Mr. Speaker, I think everyone would agree with me when I  say that, in the midst of the tragedy and horror last week, there are  also special moments that brought us together and reminded us of what  is really important. One was right here in this Chamber, where we heard  touching speeches from Paul Ryan and Leader Pelosi; another was at the  baseball game when the entire Capitol Hill community gathered in an  amazing show of support for our friend, Steve Scalise, our Capitol  Police officers and their heroic acts; as well as Matt, Zack, David,  and Crystal; and all of those who were involved.   That spirit of unity and togetherness is a big part of why we play  this softball game. Our relationships as Members of Congress are  stronger because of this game. I don't think we can have too many  reminders about the importance of unity and friendship.   I encourage all Members and staff to come join us tonight and go to  bat for this great cause. Unlike the baseball game, Republicans and  Democrats don't compete against each other. We team up against one  opponent we can all agree on: the press.   So, beat cancer, beat the press.
