 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of  Dr. Manderline Scales of Winston-Salem, North Carolina.   During Black History Month, we especially remember the enduring  contributions of great Americans like Dr. Scales, who is one of four  Black teachers to integrate Winston-Salem schools.   Dr. Scales worked in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools for  over 20 years and spent nearly 30 years in various roles at Winston- Salem State University. She brought the first Spanish programs to these  schools and was known for her belief that every encounter was an  opportunity to impact students in a positive way.   Additionally, she served on numerous boards, including the YMCA of  Northwest North Carolina, Delta Fine Arts Center, and Northwest Child  Development Center.   Dr. Scales passed away last month, but her legacy as a dedicated  educator and selfless community leader will endure through the many  lives she touched in her 91 years.                            ____________________
