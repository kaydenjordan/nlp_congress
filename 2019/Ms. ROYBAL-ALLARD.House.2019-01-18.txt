 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  chairwoman of the Committee on Appropriations may insert in the  Congressional Record, not later than today, such material as she may  deem explanatory of H.R. 648.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at noon, Tuesday, January 22,  2019, for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 10 o'clock and 36 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday,  January 22, 2019, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
