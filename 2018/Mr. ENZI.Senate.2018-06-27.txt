 Madam President, I am so glad that you are presiding at  this time because I know you are part of the Joint Select Committee on  Budget Reform. I want to address that a little bit.   Earlier this week, the Senate passed its version of the fiscal year  2019 Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction  and Veterans Affairs spending bills. Prior to this week, the last time  the Senate had passed its version of a regular appropriations bill--not  a supplemental or an omnibus bill--was more than 2 years ago.   I commend Chairman Shelby and the members of the Appropriations  Committee for their work in getting us this far and for their  commitment to restoring a more regular process for the consideration of  appropriations measures. I hope that in the weeks to come, we will be  able to process more such measures in a similarly productive manner.   It was a long road getting to this point. Last February, after a  brief government shutdown that followed an immigration policy dispute  and a yearlong stalemate on appropriations, Congress and the  administration agreed to legislation establishing new discretionary  spending caps for this fiscal year and the next and providing a process  for budget enforcement--something normally done by the Budget  Committee.   This latest budget agreement follows a string of 2-year budget deals,  each reached under the threat of a shutdown. In fact, frustration with  the current process has grown so great that through the February  legislation, Congress created the Joint Select Committee tasked with  improving our broken budget and appropriations process. I commend the  Joint Committee and its leaders, Co-Chairman Womack and Co-Chairwoman  Lowey, for their work on this subject. Our budget and appropriations  process is clearly in need of reform, and I wish them success in this  effort.   Today, I rise to share some of my thoughts and experiences on this  subject, having led bipartisan efforts in the Senate Budget Committee  to explore and reform the budget process.   As my colleagues know, the Senate Budget Committee sets the top-line  spending levels that the Appropriations Committee then divides each  year among the various departments and accounts. The Appropriations  Committee does the specific spending. While there are many potential  improvements we could make in this process, I will focus my remarks at  this time on just three points.   First, the annual spending process will never truly improve so long  as we are willing to hold it hostage to larger ideological or political  battles. Both sides have been guilty of this in the past, and until we  are willing to say ``no more,'' no process reform will succeed. I am  hopeful that the progress we are seeing now on fiscal year 2019  appropriations bills is a sign that we have reached a tipping point and  are willing to work together, as the American people expect us to do.   The second topic I want to address is the need to move to a biennial  funding cycle. I have been pleased to hear some members of the joint  committee voice support for this concept, and I hope that consensus on  this point continues to build.   The appropriations process--the spending process--has rarely worked  as intended. In all but 4 years between 1977 and 2018, continuing  resolutions, or CRs, were enacted because of the failure of Congress to  complete all of the regular appropriations bills before the beginning  of the new fiscal year. We have actually had more than 180 continuing  resolutions signed into law over the last four decades. In this fiscal  year alone, we required five.   These short-term continuing resolutions keep the government funded  while we continue our work, but their recurring nature demonstrates the  problems with our current process. The individual agencies have to  operate on last year's budget until something new is approved. All too  often, by the time Congress can agree on how to appropriate money for a  given year, the result is a massive omnibus that funds the entire  government. Members are  [[Page S4473]]  then presented with a choice--either pass the bill or shut down the  government.    I have long believed that one of the most important things we can do  is fix this process. The way to do that would be to move to a biennial  appropriations system. By providing funding for 2 years instead of 1,  Congress would immediately make the consideration of regular  appropriations measures more likely. Instead of subjecting itself to a  nearly perpetual annual cycle of developing and attempting to pass 12  appropriations bills for the next fiscal year, which starts October 1,  Congress could spread those bills over 2 years, allowing more time to  develop and scrutinize them and give 2 years' worth of planning to  everybody.   Not only would a biennial appropriations process help Congress  execute its power of the purse, it would also benefit the Federal  agencies too. Agencies would have more time to devote to developing and  to executing long-term strategies and would finally have some certainty  in their budgets.   Nowhere is the need for this more obvious than at the Department of  Defense. The Budget Committee has heard repeatedly from Defense  Department leaders that the one thing they want more than anything is  budgetary certainty. Annual spending fights and the inability to plan  under continuing resolutions have wreaked havoc on the Department's  workforce and contracting efforts.   Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer recently delivered public  remarks in which he identified $4 billion in waste due to a lack of  financial stability. He said:         Since 2001, we have put $4 billion in a trash can, poured       lighter fluid on top of it, and burned it. It's enough money       that it can buy us the additional capacity and capability       that we need. Instead, that $4 billion of taxpayer money has       been lost because of inefficiencies [caused by] continuing       resolutions.    Transitioning to a biennial appropriations process could help solve  that problem.   Last Congress, I introduced legislation that would continue the  budget resolution process on an annual cycle in order to allow for top- line adjustments and reconciliation instructions as events warrant but  would move toward a bifurcated biennial appropriations process. Under  such a proposal, appropriations would continue to be divided among 12  different bills, 6 of which would be adopted in the first session of  Congress, and 6 would be adopted in the second session. Maybe we could  even make it so the six toughest ones would be done right after an  election and the six easier ones, just before an election, to take more  of the politics out of it.   By cutting in half the number of bills required to be adopted  annually, Congress could create space for itself to devote more time  and attention to oversight and other national priorities. If adopted, I  believe this proposal would yield a more sustainable and successful  budget and appropriations process--a goal I believe both parties share.   I thank Speaker of the House Ryan for his comments this morning in  which he suggested that we should do it on a biennial basis and that  they should be divided into two segments of six, each for a 2-year  period, so they would stagger how they are approached.   My third suggestion is a minor one but could have some of the most  significant impact on the budget. The first one is, change the name of  the Budget Committee. People think that we actually make all of those  spending decisions. We don't. We set the top line for the  Appropriations Committee, which is also improperly named, so they can  do their work. My suggestion would be that we stop calling the Budget  Committee the Budget Committee and call it the Debt Control Committee.  We ought to be and are responsible for seeing how much revenue is  coming in and what some of the different allocations are and doing a  lot of reviews of that and checking to see what the debt-to-GDP ratio  is going to be and how much the debt limit is going to go up, which  becomes another subject of debate. If that were the Debt Control  Committee, all of that could be done in committee, with one approval  here on the floor.   The other half of that suggestion is that the Appropriations  Committee ought to be called the Budget Committee because they really  are the ones in control of the spending, in control of the budget. In  every State in the Nation, the committee that actually does the  appropriations is the budget committee. That would stop the flood of  people who come in right after the President's budget comes out and  before the Senate Budget Committee does their work, where they think  they have to come in and ask for the details on their expenditures at  that time. If it was the Debt Control Committee, they would have a  whole different perspective on what it was that committee is trying to  do, and they would take their suggestions to the appropriate committee,  which would be the Appropriations Committee, renamed the ``Budget  Committee'' so they would understand what they are doing.   As the Joint Select Committee continues to work, I encourage my  colleagues here and in the other body to consider biennial  appropriations as a necessary reform. I wish them success in their  endeavor.   I yield the floor.
