 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.  [[Page H6584]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My amendment requires the VA to conduct an outreach campaign to  veterans to make them aware of the full range of fertility treatments,  procedures, and services covered under the VA's medical benefits  package.   I emphasize that this amendment was included in the fiscal year 2022  House-passed NDAA as part of an en bloc package and received  overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle.   Our veterans, who served our country honorably, deserve every  opportunity to begin the family of their dreams. A study released last  year on reproductive-aged veteran women found that the rate of  infertility among veterans is more than 50 percent higher than among  the general female population.   For years, the VA has provided a range of fertility treatments and  services to veterans. Many veterans have brought to my attention the  issue that because they are unaware of the fertility services covered  by the VA, they instead seek out expensive private care to help them  begin a family.   This amendment is simple. We provide critical funding to the VA to  offer comprehensive medical care to our veterans. The VA should be  doing outreach to all veterans to ensure that they are fully aware of  the critical healthcare services covered by the VA.   Those who have served our country honorably and now struggle with  infertility as a result of their service deserve assistance in trying  to build a family.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
