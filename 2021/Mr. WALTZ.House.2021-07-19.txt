 Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand with the people of  Cuba. I rise today to stand with these brave people who are risking  everything, their lives, their families, their livelihoods.   Standing for freedom in Cuba isn't an academic exercise. They not  only put their lives on the line, they put their entire family's lives  on the line. And as they do this they are reading from the Constitution  of the United States of America, they are reading from the Declaration  of Independence, they are waving the American flag. They are not waving  flags of Europe or other countries. They are waving the American flag,  the international symbol of freedom.   Madam Speaker, socialism does not work, is not working, has never  worked anywhere around the world. The only place in the world where the  Cuban people are not succeeding is in Cuba. We must stand with them. We  will stand with them. And the Cuban people will be free.                            ____________________
