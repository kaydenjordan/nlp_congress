 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of  God's Pit Crew, a Virginia crisis response team of Fifth District  constituents who have done incredible work providing aid and support in  response to over 130 natural disasters across the country and around  the globe.   Their work began in 1999 when Randy and Terri Johnson drove three  truckloads of supplies to Oklahoma City after a devastating tornado.  Twenty years later, their coalition of friends and neighbors has grown  to over 400 members who have volunteered their time and skills to help  those in need.   Most recently, these Danville residents provided aid to the Bahamas  after Hurricane Dorian this summer and the wildfires in Paradise,  California, late last year.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing these  Virginians for their service to our communities and the work they have  done for those in need.   God bless God's Pit Crew.                            ____________________
