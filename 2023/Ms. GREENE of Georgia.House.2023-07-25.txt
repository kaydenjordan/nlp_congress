 Mr. Speaker, on January 21, 2021, I introduced  Articles of Impeachment against Joe Biden, and less than 2 weeks later,  I was kicked off all of my committees by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  They said it was for Facebook comments and replies and likes, but we  all know the truth. It was because my Articles of Impeachment on Joe  Biden were correct. He was indeed abusing his power as Vice President  of the United States.   Now we have more information to prove that not only was I right then,  but it was more damning than we already knew, but I will roll back.  President Trump was wrongfully impeached twice, and both of these  impeachments must be expunged by the House of Representatives.                                time  1230    Mr. Speaker, what I would like to talk about is the difference in the  type of information we have. The Democrats brought out the Steele  dossier. The Steele dossier was written as a Democrat political  opposition research paper. The information was written by a contractor,  and it was fed to the FBI with no transparency on sub sources. The  contractor had no primary source information, and the FBI  operationalized uncorroborated claims to secure FISA warrants on  political campaign officials of the opposing political party.   Information was later debunked by Congress, the Inspector General,  and special counsel investigations; but the mainstream media won  Pulitzer Prizes on the bogus Russian narrative, and then they led the  witch hunt leading to impeaching President Trump over a phone call with  the President of Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, let me tell the House what type of information we  actually have. We have an FBI form called an FD-1023 form. Here is the  difference for the public listening. On the FD-1023 form, the  information originated from an FBI informant who had been relied on for  many years and was considered the FBI's top informant and was also paid  roughly $200,000 over multiple years by the FBI.   Information was written by the FBI agent on the official FBI form and  relied on with no additional sub sources. The FBI informant was a  direct ear- and eyewitness to the information provided.   The FBI apparently took no action to further the investigative claim.  The FBI has refused to describe any investigative steps to assess the  investigative information; therefore, it has not been debunked despite  the White House's lies and false claims.   The mainstream media has largely ignored the story or parroted the  White House false claims.   What does the FD-1023 form tell us?   I will tell you exactly what it says, Mr. Speaker, because not only  have I read it, but I also have it in my possession right here.   This is a form that the American people and the entire public should  have because it is unclassified. Nevertheless, Christopher Wray, the  Director of the FBI, forced us to read it in a SCIF and would not hand  it over to us.   Thankfully, Senator Chuck Grassley released this form because it was  provided to him by a brave whistleblower. This form entails the damning  information that then-Vice President Joe Biden took a $5 million bribe  from  [[Page H3903]]  the oligarch that owns Burisma. Not only did Joe Biden take a $5  million bribe, so did Hunter Biden.   What did Joe Biden deliver as Vice President of the United States?   He got Viktor Shokin, the Ukrainian prosecutor general, fired from  his job.   How did Vice President Joe Biden get that done?   He threatened to withhold $1 billion of USAID to Ukraine until Viktor  Shokin was fired.   Do you know what, Mr. Speaker? He was fired.   In 2016 Joe Biden himself bragged to the foreign council and told  them that he got him fired. He bragged about it. It is on video.   Even so, that is not all they have done. Hunter Biden has also gotten  his father on the phone over two dozen times to talk with his business  partners and talk with them about the business that they are doing.   Even more so, in our possession through our investigations on our  Republican-led committees, we also have a WhatsApp chat from Hunter  Biden which says: I am sitting here with my father, and we would like  to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled.   Who is his father?   Joe Biden.   It continues on: Tell the director that I would like to resolve this  now before it gets out of hand, and now means tonight.   What I am demanding is that the Republican-led House of  Representatives move forward on an impeachment inquiry on Joe Biden  because this type of corruption should never be allowed to stand.   We must expunge President Trump's wrongful impeachments, and we must  impeach Joe Biden.
