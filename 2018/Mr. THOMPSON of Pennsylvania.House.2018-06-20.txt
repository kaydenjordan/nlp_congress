 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Ms. Micki Elliott Tucker on her retirement. She is the  nursing home administrator at Sweden Valley Manor in Coudersport,  Pennsylvania.   Micki has been a dedicated leader, and she is well loved by the  residents and staff alike. She has been instrumental in the development  of the Charles Cole Transitions of Care Committee in Potter, McKean,  and Cameron Counties. Micki was the liaison between the transitional  care team and the implementation of the PenTec LPN Clinical Program at  Sweden Valley Manor.   The nursing home also received numerous awards over the years with  Micki at the helm. In 2014, the American Health Association awarded  Sweden Valley with a National Bronze Commitment of Quality award. In  2008, Sweden Valley Manor was named Coudersport Business of the Year.  In 1994, it received the Outstanding Employer award from the  Pennsylvania Department of Labor.   Mr. Speaker, these are just some of the highlights of a long-spent  career caring for others. To say she will be missed is an  understatement.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly wish Micki Elliott Tucker the best in  her well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
