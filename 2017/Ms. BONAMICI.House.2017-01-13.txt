 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this budget  resolution. The Affordable Care Act saves lives.   Today I want to talk about Mark Rouska from Tualatin, Oregon. Mark  was diagnosed with stage IV renal cancer, and doctors told him the  cancer had metastasized to his lungs. He had to resign from a job he  loved as a special education teacher. Without chemotherapy, he would  probably not be alive. That treatment costs about $20,000 a month, but  because he has insurance through the Affordable Care Act, Mark pays  about $175 a month. At the end of this month, Mark and his wife,  Patrice, will celebrate their 31st anniversary.   Repealing the Affordable Care Act will endanger health coverage for  millions of people. One of them is Mark. I will do everything in my  power to protect the many Oregonians who rely on the Affordable Care  Act. I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution.
