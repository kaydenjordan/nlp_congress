 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of former Georgia State Representative John Yates, who passed away on  December 11 at the age of 96.   Representing Griffin, Georgia, just south of Atlanta, he was first  elected to the Georgia General Assembly in 1988, and over time became  one of the most inspiring officials in the State.   When he retired from government, Representative Yates was the only  World War II veteran serving in the Georgia General Assembly. He was  drafted into the Army in 1942, and flew a Piper Cub airplane, a small  plane with a top speed of less than 100 miles an hour. He flew 200  missions adjusting artillery fire on the enemy, including at the Battle  of the Bulge, earning six Air Medals and four battle stars.   After the war, he went back to school to earn his college degree and  embarked on a 35-year journey with Ford Motor Company, eventually  becoming a depot manager.   Representative Yates served the State of Georgia with the most humble  attitude and went to great lengths to help Georgia's veterans. Anyone  who was lucky enough to know Representative Yates could learn from his  attitude, knowledge, and experience.   Mr. Speaker, I had the honor and privilege of serving with  Representative Yates. He was a great American, a true American hero,  and a fine man. He will be missed.                            ____________________
