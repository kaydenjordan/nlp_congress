 Madam Speaker, we mark the beginning of Gun Violence  Awareness Month clouded in tragedy and heartbreak as our Nation yet  again mourns the loss of innocent life and confronts another act of  senseless gun violence.   As a Nation, we grieve with the Virginia Beach community. We must now  ask ourselves how many more lives will be allowed to be lost before we  finally say enough is enough? How many children, how many neighbors,  how many colleagues and friends must we lose before we finally take  action to make commonsense gun reform a reality?   ``Run, hide, and fight'' should no longer be a phrase our children  must learn along with their ABCs. Each day that passes without  universal background checks, without a ban on military-style assault  weapons, without safe storage and red flag laws, we risk the loss of  more innocent life.   This Gun Violence Awareness Month should serve as a wake-up call to  all Americans. What are we waiting for? The time to act is now.                            ____________________
