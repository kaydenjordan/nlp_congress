 Mr. President, It is easy for me to brag about  Idaho's small businesses because they are consistently making national  news for their innovative ideas. Just last month, the Office of  Advocacy announced Idaho ranked third in the Nation for the fastest  growth of small businesses, creating jobs and economic opportunity  across the State in 2018. Globally, Idaho is renowned for our ``Famous  Idaho Potatoes,'' and recently, Idahoans have begun using their vast  knowledge of the potato to innovate. As a result, new market-altering  products are emerging, such as BioLogiQ, Inc.'s sustainable bioplastic  resin. As a member and former chairman of the Senate Committee on Small  Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my pleasure to recognize BioLogiQ,  Inc., as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for September 2019.   BioLogiQ of Idaho Falls was founded in 2011 by an Idaho native, Brad  LaPray. Like so many Idahoans, LaPray spent a lot of his youth playing  and working outdoors and developed a passion for nature and the  agriculture industry. He moved away for a while and developed an  interest in bioplastics, but eventually came back home to Idaho where  he saw an opportunity to use his interest in bioplastics and his  passion for the agriculture industry to create a business. LaPray  understood that a percentage of all potatoes is turned into starch and  not used for human consumption. His company, BioLogiQ, uses excess  potato starch to create a sustainable bioplastic resin.   LaPray created BioLogiQ to provide people with environmentally  friendly plastic products made from renewable resources and reduce  plastic waste globally. As stated on their company's website,  ``BioLogiQ, Inc. is a plant-based manufacturer focused on bringing  sustainable packaging solutions to brand owners, retailers, and the  plastics industry. Using its proprietary process, BioLogiQ's makes a  low moisture content plasticized starch resin pellet called NuPlastiQ.  We make NuPlastiQ in pellet form so plastic product manufacturers can  use them like other traditional plastic resin pellets using their  standard production equipment. BioLogiQ's NuPlastiQ pellets are  designed to be blended with conventional petroleum-resin pellets to  make BioBlends that increase the sustainability of all plastic  products.'' NuPlastiQ technology makes it possible to reduce the  thickness of plastic bags and is most widely seen in TaterMade Bags at  retailers such as Walmart and Sam's Club.   Through their hard work, expertise, and desire to make a difference,  BioLogiQ is now an industry-leading sustainable bioplastic resin  provider. BioLogiQ is reshaping the bioplastic market, and I have full  faith they will continue to be successful. I would like to extend my  sincerest congratulations to Brad LaPray and all of the employees at  BioLogiQ, Inc., for being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the  Month for September 2019. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
