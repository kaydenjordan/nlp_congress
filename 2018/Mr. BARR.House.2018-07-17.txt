 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the JOBS and  Investor Confidence Act of 2018, and I thank the chairman for his  leadership.   If America wants to compete in the 21st century economy, then we need  21st century capital formation rules.                                time  1545    Currently, many of the securities regulations governing startups and  investors arise from 1930s-era statutes. Because of this outdated legal  architecture, the number of business startups is at a 40-year low, and  the number of companies going public is the lowest it has been in 20  years. The result is fewer high-paying jobs, less retirement security,  slower capital formation, and weaker economic growth.   Fortunately, the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act modernizes our  regulation of capital markets, enabling greater access to capital for  small businesses and entrepreneurs. Coupled with historic tax cuts and  major banking reform that was enacted into law earlier this year, this  JOBS bill represents the next step in robust economic growth that will  boost wages, unleash startup enterprises, and finance the future of  American small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the JOBS and Investor  Confidence Act of 2018.
