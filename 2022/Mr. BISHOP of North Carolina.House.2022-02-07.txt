 Madam Speaker, I am pleased with this  amendment by the gentleman from Colorado. It has my full support in the  Judiciary Committee.   I also appreciate the chairman's non-opposition to the amendment. I  believe it makes the bill better, and it makes the bill one that I am  going to be eager and pleased to support.   The problem before was that the bill possibly made unenforceable  arbitration agreements going well beyond sexual harassment disputes.  But for sexual harassment disputes, I am in full agreement that the  victim in every case should have the opportunity not to arbitrate,  notwithstanding an arbitration agreement.   Therefore, this amendment succeeds. I am going to be glad to support  the bill in full, and I am sure many others will as well.
