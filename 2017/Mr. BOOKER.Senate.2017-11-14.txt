 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the  votes on confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 254 and the motion to  invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 383.   On vote No. 272, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 254.   On vote No. 273, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 383.                            ____________________
