 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California  for his words of support and also thank the gentleman from Arizona for  the courtesy of yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express strong support for my bill, H.R. 1037,  the National Emergency Medical Services Commemorative Work Act. This  bipartisan legislation will create a National Emergency Medical  Services Memorial Foundation to establish a commemorative memorial  located here on Federal land in Washington, D.C., that will highlight  and honor the commitment and sacrifice of emergency medical personnel  across the United States.   As the chairman noted, each year, there are 850,000 first responders  of the emergency medical services who answer over 30 million calls  while serving 22 million Americans who are in need of lifesaving care.   Americans rely on the courage and selfless sacrifice of the men and  women of the emergency medical services, and we all deeply appreciate  their commitment to maintaining safety and medical security in our  country.                                time  1800    Mr. Speaker, this memorial will serve as a symbol of their sacrifice  during the darkest moments in our Nation's history.   For example, this September will mark the 17th anniversary of the  attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. On that day, within  minutes of the attack, more than 100 EMS units and dozens of private  ambulances raced to the site, setting up triage centers to treat the  wounded. Of the nearly 3,000 victims that died on September 11th, 10  were courageous EMS personnel.   More than a decade later, in my home city of Boston, Massachusetts,  [[Page H6339]]  EMS providers were literally on site within seconds of the explosions  during the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. As a result of their swift  and well-coordinated rescue efforts, led by my dear friend and South  Boston native, the late Boston EMS special ops director Captain Bob  ``Sarge'' Haley, EMS personnel were able to treat the 260 people who  were injured.   Lauded for his skills in designing and implementing world-class  special ops measures in the city of Boston, Captain Sarge Haley's  leadership during the events of that day no doubt saved dozens of lives  and is just another example of the sacrifice and heroism that H.R. 1037  seeks to memorialize.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, EMS personnel have been first on site for some  of our Nation's deadliest mass shootings. During the Las Vegas shooting  at the Route 91 Harvest music festival last fall, EMT Brittany Speer,  who was attending the event with her family, set up a triage center  after the shooting occurred.   For years, EMS providers like Ms. Speer have treated and transported  victims in a professional and compassionate manner. This efficient and  effective response is a result of countless mass casualty exercises  that EMS personnel undertake.   Mr. Speaker, this memorial is long overdue. These examples are just a  small fraction of the countless instances in which EMS personnel have  sacrificed and served our Nation. Every day, EMS personnel are exposed  to countless risks and dangers in order to provide critical care for  those who are in need.   It is proper to recognize the efforts of our dedicated EMS first  responders and memorialize the personal sacrifice made by more than 600  members of the Nation's emergency medical service and, in turn, by  their families and loved ones.   As Members of Congress, we should pass this bipartisan bill and begin  the creation of the commemorative memorial to EMS personnel. These  individuals have rightfully earned this recognition, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand as one and pass H.R.  1037. Again, I thank the gentleman from California for his support.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
