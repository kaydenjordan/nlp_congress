 Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs  Committee, I am absolutely flabbergasted at the announcement that just  came out of the White House that President Trump is canceling his  meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea.   The world held out hope that the Trump administration's diplomatic  engagement with North Korea would bear fruit. But you cannot have thin  skin if you want to make progress with a difficult adversary such as  the Kim regime. Imagine how different the course of history would look  if every chance for peace was scuttled because one party was too mean  to the other.   To make matters worse, the President's bizarre letter returns to the  same bellicose rhetoric that last year heightened tensions and raised  the specter of war. Any type of military conflict on the Korean  peninsula would come with horrific consequences.   After a year of alienating friends and allies, unwinding our  commitments, and drawing back from the world stage, it is clear what  the Trump motto of ``America First'' actually means ``America Lashing  Out,'' leaving America last and alone.   American leadership on the global stage has been laid low, not by a  rival, but by a President who has sidelined diplomacy, shut out  expertise, and thrown out any rational approach to making policy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 18 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Friday, May 25, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
