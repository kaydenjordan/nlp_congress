 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lou Alvarez, an  incredible patriot, Long Islander, and 9/11 first responder who  inspired so many just last week in front of the House Judiciary  Committee in support of the Never Forget the Heroes Act, which will  reauthorize and fully fund the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund.   After his appearance in D.C., Lou rushed home for his 69th round of  chemo. Let me repeat that: After coming all the way down to Washington  to beg for the benefits that he and so many others were promised, Lou  Alvarez had to rush home for his 69th round of chemo.   Unfortunately, when he got home, things did not go as expected. This  morning, I am sad to report, Lou is in hospice, watching us here on the  House floor.   Lou is one of the many first responders who raced to Ground Zero on  September 11 without a second thought, who, in the weeks following,  worked 12-hour shifts on the pile, aiding in the rescue and cleanup  efforts.   Lou, like so many of his fellow first responders, was diagnosed with  one of the thousands of cancers attributed to the inhalation of toxic  air and debris at Ground Zero.   We have lost more 9/11 first responders since 9/11 than we lost  people on 9/11 itself. We must fully fund and reauthorize the 9/11  Victim Compensation Fund.   Last Tuesday, like so many times before, Lou once again made the trip  to Washington to testify in front of the committee, begging Congress to  fully fund the compensation fund.   It wasn't his first time to D.C., not by a long shot. It wasn't his  second or third time. Unfortunately, it may have been his last.   The wait has been a disgrace to these first responders, to their  families, and to our Nation.   This isn't just a New York issue, and I thank Bill Huizenga for  staying around for Lou. This isn't a Democratic or Republican Party  platform or a political football.   This is a responsibility that we all shoulder as Americans, first and  foremost. This is the spirit of our country. It is who we are as a  people.   Last Wednesday, following Lou's testimony, the Never Forget the  Heroes Act passed committee unanimously. This floor and the Senate need  to pass it to make this bill law right away.   I would like to sign off today the way Lou signs off nearly  everything he writes, the way he lives his life each and every day,  until his very last. Lou Alvarez says, ``Still here, still breathing,  still fighting.''                            ____________________
