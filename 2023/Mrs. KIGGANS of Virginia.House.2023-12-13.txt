 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  the fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act. As a member of  the House Armed Services Committee, I have had the honor of working on  this important legislation for months and am proud of the final  bipartisan bill we produced to strengthen our national security.   One of the main reasons I came to Congress was to restore America's  military strength and improve the quality of life for our servicemen  and -women. This bill takes several critical steps to help us achieve  that goal.   In total, this year's NDAA authorizes $886 billion in national  defense discretionary programs with the focus on improving our  readiness and recruitment, supporting our servicemembers and their  families, strengthening partnerships with our allies, increasing the  lethality of our Joint Force, equipping our warfighters to successfully  complete their mission, and ensuring vigorous oversight of taxpayer  dollars at the Pentagon.   I wanted to speak specifically to a few components of the NDAA, why  it is a great bill, why I am excited to support it and encourage my  colleagues to do the same.   First of all, a large component of the NDAA is about supporting our  servicemembers and their families. It secures the largest pay raise in  20 years for our servicemembers at 5.2 percent. We continue to see our  servicemembers struggling with the economy. They are unable to afford  things, not just gas and groceries, but things like buying a new home,  buying a new car. We have servicemembers that still qualify for things  like SNAP benefits and WIC benefits. We still see food pantries that  exist on our bases. Providing that important pay raise, again the  largest in over 20 years, was a very important component of taking care  of our men and women.   This NDAA also authorizes $356 million over the President's budget  request to renovate and build new barracks. We had a GAO report come  out recently that really highlighted some of our insufficiencies when  it comes to housing, especially unaccompanied housing--the mold issues,  the pest issues, and the out-of-date infrastructure that is old and  dilapidated. We can do better for our servicemen and -women. This bill  provides just that.   It is a starting point. There is a lot to do, but I am excited to  support it for that reason. The NDAA also includes a parents bill of  rights at DOD schools.   I represent Virginia's Second Congressional District, so it is kind  of the birthplace of the parents' rights matter movement. We were able  to incorporate why it is important to have parents involved in their  children's school into this NDAA piece so that it applies to DOD  schools as well.   The bill also authorizes DOD to reduce the out-of-pocket childcare  expenses for military families and provides $153 million over the  President's budget request for the construction of new childcare  centers. In my district, I have Naval Air Station Oceana. Our base has  over 1,600 people on the waiting list. That is not acceptable, and my  base is not alone.   If you were to look at other bases, they have the same amount on  their waiting lists. We can do better than this. It is an important way  to support our servicemembers and their families.   This bill also authorizes an additional berthing barge to provide a  safe and healthy housing alternative for Navy servicemembers during  dry-dock availabilities. We just had an article come out about the USS  Stennis in Newport News, which is where the shipyard is. It will be the  first to have off-ship housing, free WiFi, and better parking. We have  to take care of our servicemen and -women who are in these extended  port periods, especially when their ships are being repaired. This bill  does just that.    This NDAA also provides oversight for taxpayer dollars. It cuts $37  billion in inefficient weapons systems, Defense programs, and Pentagon  bureaucracy. It requires mandatory DOD audits, and it also establishes  a special inspector general to oversee and monitor security assistance  going to Ukraine.   I have been a supporter of Ukraine. I think we need to continue to  support that fight in Ukraine; however, it cannot be a blank check.  There has to be some accountability, and this inspector general will do  just that.   This NDAA also improves readiness and recruitment, and this is  something I have been focused on. We have a recruitment, retention,  quality of life task force that has been part of our Armed Services  Committee. We have been focusing on that for several months now. This  NDAA is a good place to start.   It creates a grant program to expand the capacity of our shipyards.  We see  [[Page H6928]]  that we are behind in our shipbuilding capacity. We know that China is  outpacing us. China is rapidly approaching 400 ships, while we are  hovering at just under 300. It is so important that we invest in that  shipbuilding piece and, additionally, supporting our ship repair  industry.   This bill also increases the number of Junior ROTC programs and  instructors at U.S. high schools. That is such an important part of our  recruiting for our Armed Forces. I want people to be in our great Navy  and Army and Air Force and to join our great military. It is a great  way for people to have jobs and education benefits and healthcare.  Plus, there is no better place to advertise for our military than  starting with our young people. Putting that investment in the JROTC  programs is so important, and this NDAA does that.   This bill also extends military recruitment and retention bonuses and  special pay authorizations. We have got to stay competitive with  civilian jobs that are out there. I know there is a lot of competition  in workplaces, and this NDAA will help the military to stay  competitive.   It also rejects the Biden administration's efforts to reduce the size  of our Navy by protecting four battle force ships with years of service  life remaining. The President had asked to decommission eight ships,  and we reduced that number to four. We really can't afford to  decommission any ships, in my opinion, but we cut it to four. We have  to make sure that we are providing oversight of the money and  investment that we are putting in ship repair. We need to watch that  our ships are getting repaired and they are getting repaired on  schedule because we need every single one of them.   This bill also establishes enlisted training pilot programs at  community colleges offering more educational opportunities for our  enlisted servicemen and -women. It prohibits DOD from contracting with  any CCP or Chinese-owned or controlled company operating in the U.S.,  which is such an important piece of national security.   This NDAA also strengthens partnerships with our allies. We need our  friends now more than ever. This bill fully funds our Pacific  Deterrence Initiative. It provides for the implementation of the AUKUS  agreement with Australia, unlocking over $3 billion in Australian  investments in the U.S. submarine industrial base.   It authorizes over $987 million in INDOPACOM Commander priorities,  which were left unfunded in the Biden budget. It strengthens training  and advising for the military forces of Taiwan and extends authority  for the transfer of weapons systems, as well as precision-guided  munitions to Israel.   This NDAA also protects our own national security. We do have some  border wins that we were able to get and secure in this NDAA. It fully  funds the deployment of National Guardsmen in support of Border Patrol  activities. It extends the Pacific Deterrence Initiative to enhance  U.S. deterrence and defense posture in the Indo-Pacific region. It  funds initiative of $14.7 billion, an increase of $5.6 billion over the  budget request. It prohibits the DOD from reducing the number of  intercontinental ballistic missiles below 400 or reducing the  responsiveness or alert status of the arsenal.   I am also proud that my colleagues from both sides of the aisle  supported my effort to include critical provisions from my Sailor  Standard of Care Act in our Nation's most important Defense bill. These  provisions will directly benefit servicemembers and their families in  Hampton Roads and throughout the country by improving our  servicemembers' quality of life by increasing access to mental health  care.   As a nurse practitioner, focusing on mental health care, especially  for our military members and especially for our veterans, has been  something that I fight for every single day. We had provisions of the  Sailor Standard of Care Act get into the NDAA and into the Conference  version, which we will be voting on tomorrow.                                time  1830    Some of those provisions are that it examines reimbursement rates for  mental health care providers under TRICARE.   When I meet with mental health care providers in my district, and  throughout the country really, they have that same concern, they want  to be reimbursed. There are not enough of them.   We want them to be partners in care for our military members and our  veterans, so we need to make sure we are providing that reimbursement,  and we are providing it in a timely manner.   This bill also directs the Navy to look into constructing and  managing a dashboard to track quality-of-life programs and their  utilization rate. So we are looking at things like healthcare,  childcare, spouse employment, housing, and we are making sure we are  providing the best services we can, again, for our military.   This bill requires a report on the feasibility of expanding TRICARE  for life to include a benefit for the SilverSneakers program, mimicking  the existing benefit that is included under some of our Medicare  Advantage programs.   We had constituents that asked for this program. They want to utilize  public gyms and recreation facilities, and so we would like the TRICARE  program to cover it for our older adults who would love nothing more  than to go exercise.   This bill also assesses the feasibility of providing additional  mental health resources to limited-duty sailors. In Hampton Roads, we  saw an increase in the suicide rates for sailors that we took out of  the workplace, that we took out of the mission, and we kind of had them  in a waiting area.   In this bill, we are looking at how long is that taking to medically  process people out?   Are we providing those mandatory mental health screenings?   Are we taking care of them? Who is providing that care?   This bill is going to look at expanding that care so that chaplains  can do it and corpsmen can do it. There is a shortage of mental health  care providers. So really looking holistically at how we are providing  the mental health services to our servicemen and -women and providing  them with the best mental health services that we can.   The harsh reality is that the world is a dangerous place. The United  States and its allies are facing unprecedented and rapidly evolving  threats across the globe. China is outpacing us in warship production.  China has 350 ships and is quickly moving to 400 ships compared with  our 293.   Iranian proxies have attacked American bases and troops stationed  overseas over 46 times since October 17. Israel is countering the most  horrific attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.   North Korea launched its first military reconnaissance satellite into  orbit last month with the help of Russia. Russian aggression continues  in Ukraine, with Putin threatening to go after NATO member countries  next.   Now more than ever, we must prioritize and project American strength  across the globe. This legislation goes a long way in achieving that  goal. The goal of this legislation is deterrence, it is all about peace  through strength. America leads the world in peacekeeping forces, and  it is so important. I can think of no other country that I would want  to have this role than our great Nation, the United States.   In closing, Madam Speaker, the fiscal year 2024 National Defense  Authorization Act ensures our military can remain the best in the  world. It refocuses our Nation's efforts on advancing military  readiness and quality of life to make sure our men and women in uniform  are ready to fight tonight.   As a former Navy helicopter pilot, as a third-generation veteran,  military spouse, and mother to children who serve, I will always be the  loudest voice for our military men and women in Congress. I urge all of  my colleagues to support this critical legislation.   Passing this year's NDAA by a wide bipartisan margin would send an  important signal to the men and women defending our freedom that those  of us in Congress will rise above our differences to prioritize their  needs and our national security above all else.
