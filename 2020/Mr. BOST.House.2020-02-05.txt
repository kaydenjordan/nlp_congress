 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The United States Postal Service has a history as old as our Nation.  Our Nation's Founders believed that it was so important that they put  it in the Constitution and many people back home don't realize that. Of  course, you know, that is the most quoted, least read document around  here.   The rural communities in southern Illinois and across our country  depend on the Postal Service. It is often the only means for small  businesses to engage in commerce, and for rural residents to receive  packages.   The Postal Service is facing many challenges, but it is taking  several important steps to provide new services mandated by the modern  economy. Unfortunately, it can't accomplish these reforms with one hand  tied behind its back.   The Postal Service is the only entity with this requirement. I doubt  that any Federal agency would be able to meet its goals and obligations  to citizens and taxpayers if they were likewise required to prefund  their health benefits.   The underlying legislation helps correct this. It does not impose  additional costs on taxpayers, and it will help ensure the Postal  Service can continue to serve our communities as it has since our  Nation's founding.
