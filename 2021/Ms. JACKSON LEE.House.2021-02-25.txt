 Mr. Speaker, none of us can rise to the floor of the  House and talk about the cruciality of the American Rescue package and  the absolute imperative nature of this particular legislation passing  without acknowledging 500,000 lives--not numbers, but names of mothers  and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers, aunts and uncles and  cousins, sisters and brothers, just plain good friends, and loved ones  that extend beyond one's family. And then for the love of this country,  just our fellow Americans.   Mr. Speaker, these are hardworking people, many of them essential  workers on the front lines. Unfortunately, with the horrific and  insulting effort that was made by the last administration, essential  workers were out and about in grocery stores and delivery trucks, first  responders, and no one attempted to stop the community spread. We had  no testing protocol, and it was in my Congressional district that I  worked with United Memorial Hospital to ensure that we had testing  sites and opened the first testing site in my Congressional district to  reach hard-to-serve areas on March 19.    Mr. Speaker, since that time, we have done 55 with UMMC, a small  hospital that I call, ``the little red engine that can.'' But that was  all done by the energy and determination in a city that was clearly one  of the hotspots as part of the State of Texas, complete inertia by our  leadership until we began to see the high numbers of loss of life in  the African-American and Latinx community.   Mr. Speaker, I am on the floor today to reinforce my continued and  emphatic support for the American Rescue Plan, because I don't see the  500,000 lives as just numbers, I see them as persons who are in need.   This plan will mount a national vaccination program that includes  setting up community vaccination sites nationwide. It will also take  complementary measures to combat the virus, including scaling up  testing and tracing, addressing shortages of personal protective  equipment--a real fight against COVID-19 and all of its variants,  including the UK, South Africa, and one that is just starting up. It  delivers immediate relief to working families. It will give the  $1,400--that will make it $2,000, increase in the minimum wage as well,  and continued unemployment.   Mr. Speaker, let me cite the city of Houston, that we have lost jobs  in 9 key service sectors:   Healthcare, 391,000 jobs lost; retail, 303,600 jobs lost; food  services, 267,000 jobs lost; finance, 166,000; private education,  63,000; art and entertainment 37,000-plus; accommodations, $28,000; air  transportation, $20,200.   One of the reasons my motion passed in the Budget Committee to ensure  the protection of the public funding where Harris County will receive  $141 billion plus. The city of Houston will receive $141 billion plus,  because we are desperate to provide these dollars for our public  resources, our municipal workers, our healthcare workers, our  firefighters, our paramedics, our law enforcement, police. We are all  in need to continue this fight. We need this money to support  struggling communities, as indicated with the loss of jobs in Houston  and Harris County.   Mr. Speaker, the plan will provide crucial support for the hardest  hit small businesses, and I am glad we have worked to target these  small businesses, especially those owned by entrepreneurs from racial  and ethnic backgrounds that experienced systemic discrimination, along  with EIDL grants that my faith communities and nonprofits are asking  about, and as well, the expanded eligibility for those entities and  resources for jobs, to protect the jobs of first responders, as I  indicated.   Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear: We are hard hit. If we do not pass  the American Rescue Plan, which I intend to support enthusiastically,  we will end up with 4 million fewer jobs. It will take us more than a  year to return to full employment. We will lower the lifetime earnings  of our young generation. Millions of parents, particularly mothers-- women have been hurt by this even more--will be forced to stay at home,  and another 4 years of suffering before real returns come.   Mr. Speaker, we had to experience this, but we are not going to  continue to experience it. Let's support the American Rescue Plan as  the Biden administration has asked us to do.  [[Page H629]]                                ____________________     Madam Speaker, does anybody know what it means to be  called names; to be thrown out of your apartment; to be thrown off of a  job; and most sadly, to not be allowed to love the person that you  love?   In the Hodges case, that was settled when they determined that no  union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest  ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family. And then they  ruled. They asked for equal dignity in the eyes of law; the  Constitution grants them that right.   I rise in support of the Equality Act because I know what it means to  be thrown out, to be looked at, and to be undermined. Our friends in  the LGBTQ community every single day experience that. Trans women who  are African American have been murdered.   This gives us equal dignity under the law. We could keep a job. If  you are in that community, you can be married already, obviously, but  you can keep a job. You can get healthcare; you can ensure that you can  keep an apartment. You can walk in dignity.   We need the Equality Act as we have needed civil rights laws  throughout this Nation.   If we are the place of ``We the People,'' if this Nation is based  upon, we the people, then we will pass the Equality Act today. We will  pass it now.   I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for his leadership and the  gentleman from New York.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary  and an original cosponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the  ``Equality Act of 2021.''   Let me thank my colleague on the Judiciary Committee, Congressman  David Cicilline of Rhode Island, for introducing this landmark  legislation and his tireless efforts in making this day a reality.   Madam Speaker, our nation's long but inexorable march towards  equality reaches another milestone today.   For as long as our national charters have been in existence, we have  endeavored to ask ourselves: what do we mean when we say ``We the  People?''   How expansive do we hold our pledge that all are entitled to the  blessings of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   To be certain our nation has come a long way, but as we debate this  critical bill, I am reminded of the Supreme Court's decision in  Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015), and its  powerful conclusion explaining the profound power of love and marriage,  and the desire to be seen as equal in the eyes of the law:         No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies       the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,       and family. In forming a marital union, two people become       something greater than once they were. As some of the       petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a       love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand       these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of       marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it       so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for       themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in       loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest       institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the       law. The Constitution grants them that right.    Despite significant legal advances over the past several years,  including marriage equality, LGBTQ Americans remain vulnerable to  discrimination daily and too often have little recourse.   In the 116th Congress, the Equality Act had the bipartisan support of  Members of Congress, with nearly 240 co-sponsors, as well as the strong  support of the business community, and most important, the overwhelming  support of the American people.   In the 117th Congress, the Equality Act was reintroduced with 223  original cosponsors.   More than 70 percent of American support the Equality Act.   This has been a long journey; the first Equality Act was introduced  nearly 46 years ago.   It is long past time to secure the civil rights of LGBTQ people  across the country and accord them full membership in the American  family.   With the Trump Administration rolling back protections at the federal  level and anti-equality opponents continuing to push discriminatory  bills at the state level, LGBTQ people cannot wait another year for  affirmation that they are worthy of the dignity of their peers and  deserving of equal protection of the laws.   Today, too many LGBTQ Americans in too many places remain too  vulnerable to discrimination daily with too little legal recourse.   Fifty percent of the national LGBTQ community live in states where,  though they may have the right to marry, they have no explicit non- discrimination protections in other areas of daily life.   The Equality Act extends the full anti-discrimination protections of  the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other key pillars of fairness  and justice in our country to LGBTQ Americans.   Sexual orientation and gender identity deserve full civil rights  protections, not just in the workplace, but in every place: in  education, housing, credit, jury service, public facilities, and public  accommodations.   Today, there are only 21 states have explicit laws barring  discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, housing, and  public accommodations, and only 20 states have such protections for  gender identity.   In most states, a same-sex couple can get married on Saturday, then  be legally denied service at a restaurant on Sunday, and be fired from  their jobs on Monday, and evicted from their apartment on Tuesday.   Madam Speaker, let me take a moment to discuss in more detail several  of the important elements of the Equality Act.   The Equality Act amends existing federal civil rights laws to  explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and  gender identity in education, employment, housing, credit, Federal jury  service, public accommodations, and the use of Federal funds.   It does so by adding sex in some places where it had not previously  been protected,  [[Page H640]]  and clarifying that sex includes sexual orientation and gender  identity.   Specifically, H.R. 5, the ``Equality Act of 2021'' amends:   Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide basic protections  against discrimination in public accommodations by adding sex,  including sexual orientation and gender identity;   Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide basic protections  against discrimination by recipients of federal financial assistance by  adding sex, including sexual orientation, and gender identity;   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Service Reform  Act of 1978, the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, and the  Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to make explicit protections  against workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or  gender identity;   The Fair Housing Act of 1968 to make protections against 1 housing  discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity explicit;   The Equal Credit Opportunity Act to make protections against 7 credit  discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity  explicit; and   The Jury Selections and Services Act to make protections against  discrimination in federal jury service based on sexual orientation or  gender identity explicit.   The march towards equality has been long and has awoken passions  passion from many quarters for various reasons.   Well-intentioned people from all walks of life have had difficulty as  progress washes over the debate surrounding protections for same sex  individuals.   At times, the debate has seen input from members of the faith  community, who strive to reconcile their love for all of God's sons and  daughters, with the script of their sacred text.   I understand this tension, but I have carefully studied the text and  am confident that passage of the Equality Act will not adversely affect  any person's freedom of worship of the free exercise of their faith.   The Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity to  federal civil rights law and sex where it is missing.   But the same statutory exemptions that are already in place in the  Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act will remain in place after  enactment and the guarantees of the United States Constitution remain  untouched.   The U.S. Constitution provides ample protections for religious  freedom and nothing in this bill would, or could, infringe upon the  protections afforded by the Constitution, as the principal sponsor of  the bill, Congressman Cicilline, confirmed during a colloquy we held  when the bill was marked up in the Judiciary Committee in the 116th  Congress.   Specifically, the provisions relating to Title VI of the Civil Rights  Act (federal funding) include the original exemptions for  discrimination based on religion.   Religious organizations (not just houses of worship) are free to  limit participation in wide array of activities and services to only  members of their faith.   This same exemption applies to public accommodations.   Houses of worship could be considered a place of public accommodation  only if they offer their space or services for commercial public use.   This does not include religious services.   Nothing in this bill alters the ability of houses of worship or  religious leaders to practice or carry out their faith.   No member of the clergy will ever be compelled to perform a religious  ceremony that conflicts with their beliefs, including marrying same-sex  couples.   The DOJ Title VI Manual and relevant and relevant case law clearly  provide that a religious organization that is not ``principally  engaged'' in providing social services is only bound by  nondiscrimination requirements related to the program for which they  receive funding if that funding is targeted in order to provide a  specific program or service, i.e. disaster relief, rather than to the  entity ``as a whole.''   Nothing in the Equality Act changes that rule.   There is a longstanding ministerial exemption in federal civil rights  law that exempts religious organizations from complying with employment  nondiscrimination provisions for ministers, rabbis and any other person  who is ``carrying out the faith''.   The Equality Act does not alter that exemption in any way.   The Equality Act does not repeal the Religious Freedom Restoration  Act (RFRA).   The Equality Act clarifies that RFRA cannot be used to defend  discrimination in public settings or with federal funds.   The Equality Act does not alter or amend the RFRA standard for any  other kinds of claims.   Federal civil rights laws and the United States Constitution provide  many exemptions for religious organizations.   It bears stating again that the statutory exemptions that are ,  already in place in the Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act will  remain in place and the United States Constitution remains untouched.   Courts have long-rejected religious claims as a reason to deny civil  rights protections, including those based on race and sex, and the same  analysis applies to all other protected characteristics.   Specifically, religious belief did not exempt restaurants or hotels  from complying with the civil rights laws passed in the 1960s and  cannot do so today.   RFRA explicitly contemplates that Congress would exempt certain laws  from its application.   The clarifying language in the Equality Act is necessary to ensure  that courts do not misinterpret the intended interaction between RFRA  and our civil rights laws.   RFRA will still be available to address burdens on religious beliefs  and practices in other contexts.   And any individual or organization that is concerned that their  religious beliefs or practices are being unjustly burdened retains the  ability to bring a claim under the First Amendment.   The time has come to extend the full blessings of equality and the  majesty of the law's protection to all our brothers and sisters,  including those in the LGBTQ community.   Madam Speaker, it been said that ``the moral arc of the universe is  long but bends toward justice.''   Today, with passage by this House of H.R. 5, the Equality Act of  2021, we bend that arc even more in the direction of justice.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this life-changing and  life-affirming legislation and urge all members to stand on the right  of history and vote for its passage.
