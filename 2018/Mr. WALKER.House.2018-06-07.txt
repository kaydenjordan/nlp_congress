 Mr. Speaker, everyone knows that the government has a  spending problem. We have a moral responsibility to take every  opportunity to help right the ship. In recent years, rescissions have  been used as budget gimmicks to hide higher spending in appropriations  bills. Today, the rescissions of unspent funds will instead be used for  deficit reduction for the American taxpayers.   At the Republican Study Committee, we have been working with the  Office of Management and Budget on these spending cuts since last Fall.  I am glad that those conversations led to something tangible in the  form of the largest rescissions package in American history.   I commend President Trump, Director Mulvaney, and House Leadership  for their efforts in developing this package and securing the votes to  bring this across the finish line.   True, today's package is just a drop in the barrel of our total debt  but this should be just the first of many rescissions packages. The  members of the Republican Study Committee hope that this is true and  that as we pass several rescissions packages, we can begin to bend the  trajectory of our spending curve in the right direction.
