 Madam Speaker, gas prices across the country have  reached yet another record-breaking high. The pain at the pump my  constituents are facing is a direct result of this administration's war  on American energy.   Unfortunately, the administration continues to pass the blame for a  crisis of their own making.   In California, we are suffering with out-of-control prices that  reached over $6.30 per gallon this week. That is nearly $1.50 higher  than the national average; thanks, in part, to the State's gas tax.   Central Valley families are struggling to drive their kids to school,  get themselves to work, and buy groceries to feed their families. Any  reduction in prices would provide much-needed relief.   I am, once again, calling on the State to immediately suspend the 51  cent per gallon tax. We need to unleash the power of our domestic  energy production and suspend the gas tax to get these prices under  control for Central Valley residents.                            ____________________
