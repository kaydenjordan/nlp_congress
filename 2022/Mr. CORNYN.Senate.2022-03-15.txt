 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  complete my remarks.    Mr. President, as all of America knows, prices at the gas  pump are skyrocketing. Over the weekend, the average gas price in Texas  exceeded $4 a gallon, and we typically have some of the cheapest  gasoline in the country. We didn't even cross that line during the  great recession of 2008. But we know that gas prices are not the only  [[Page S1164]]  commodity that is growing and that family budgets are strained by.  Consumers are also paying more for everything from groceries to  clothes, to appliances.   Folks in Texas and across the country want to know, what is President  Biden's plan to address high gasoline prices? Last week, the President  was, appropriately enough, asked this very question. His response? He  said:         Can't do much right now. Russia is responsible.    That is a quote--``Russia is responsible.'' Well, people across the  country know that the price of gasoline, the spike that we are  experiencing now, preceded the invasion of Ukraine.   Folks across the country can't afford to fill up their gas tanks to  get to work, and the President points the finger at Vladimir Putin.  Well, there is no question that the war in Ukraine exacerbated what was  already an existing problem with the price of gasoline, but certainly  it was not the cause of it. But the President conveniently omits the  fact that gasoline prices were a problem long before Ukraine was  attacked. For example, the week the President took office, Americans  were paying an average of $2.38 a gallon. Month after month, those  prices steadily climbed. By mid-May, the average price exceeded $3.10 a  gallon, and by Thanksgiving, it was $3.30 a gallon. Just as a reminder,  this was months before Russia invaded, which did not happen until  February 24 of this year. Even in the last full week before the  invasion, gas prices were painfully high at $3.50 a gallon.   So, yes, prices have risen since the invasion, and there is no  question that the Russian aggression is a factor behind price jumps in  the past few weeks, but this was a preexisting problem for which  apparently the President had no solution. It is disingenuous for the  administration to blame recordbreaking prices entirely on Russia.  During Biden's first year in office, from January of last year to  January of this year, gas prices increased 40 percent--40 percent.  Those increases had nothing to do with President Putin and had  everything to do with President Biden.   One of the President's first actions after taking office was to  cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline. This pipeline would have given  Canadian crude a quick and affordable path to refiners and processors  in the United States and then to global markets through the Gulf of  Mexico. This increased supply would add to the domestic markets and top  off the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and even make its way to our  friends and allies overseas. Given the state of the world's energy  security today, it is easy to see how the Keystone XL Pipeline would  have helped if the President had given it an opportunity.   This project would have also brought serious economic gains in the  form of good-paying jobs right here in America, increased tax revenue,  and benefits for communities along the pipeline's route. But with the  stroke of a pen, the President killed the Keystone XL Pipeline and the  many benefits that would have been provided in terms of our energy  security and the price of gasoline at the pump.   Unfortunately, that was the beginning but not the end of the  administration's flawed energy policies. Just a few days later, the  Biden administration placed a temporary moratorium on all new leasing  permits on Federal lands, effectively sending more business to Russia  and OPEC producers whom he actually called upon to produce more oil.  That is right. Before the Russian invasion, President Biden called on  OPEC--of which Russia is a member and of which Saudi Arabia is a  dominant producer--to produce more oil overseas rather than to unleash  American energy right here at home.    Well, the administration later attempted to set the ``social cost''  of carbon, as they call it, at $51 a metric ton--a high and arbitrary  figure designed to hamper fossil fuel production right here at home-- and then it suspended oil and gas production in both Alaska and New  Mexico.   The administration even took aim at refiners. The United States  relies on an expansive network of refiners to supply gasoline, diesel  fuel, and other petroleum products. The renewable fuel standard  requires refiners to blend a certain amount of renewable fuel, which is  simply untenable for many small refiners. And small refiners  disproportionately actually produce gasoline, which means that the  pressure on these small refiners actually has a disproportionate impact  on higher gasoline prices.   The Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to grant  temporary exemptions to small refiners if compliance would cause them  to suffer serious economic hardship. Those exemptions used to be pretty  standard practice. President Obama and President Trump each granted  dozens of exemptions while in office. But so far, President Biden has  refused to grant a single exemption to small refineries. Small  refineries are hurting, and unless President Biden finally grants some  of these exemptions, some of them may be forced to close their doors,  exacerbating again high energy prices. If fewer refiners are operating,  gasoline prices will go up, not down.   President Biden and his administration aren't the only ones who have  taken aim at oil and gas production here in America in the last year.  Many of our colleagues who have argued that oil and gas production is  somehow unnecessary or obsolete and could be replaced today with solely  renewable energy have been misleading the American people in believing  that we could make that transition today or anytime in the near future.  While renewable energy is an important part of our energy sources--in  Texas, we produce more electricity from wind than any other State in  the Nation--we believe in an ``all of the above'' energy policy.   I actually have heard members of the administration say one of the  solutions for eliminating the importation of Russian oil would be to  move entirely to renewables. Well, the Energy Information  Administration, which is the official spokesman on these matters for  the U.S. Government, says that by the year 2050, 74 percent of our  energy sources in America will still be fossil fuel. That is four times  the amount of energy that can be produced by renewables.   That doesn't mean we are going to stay stuck on where we are now. We  will continue to look for new and innovative ways to add to our energy  diversity and improve our climate and environment at the same time. But  to suggest disingenuously to the American people that one way we can  deal with cutting off Russian imports is simply to do away with oil and  gas in America is a ludicrous statement.   Other regulatory measures promoted by the administration have also  discouraged American energy production, like the reckless tax-and- spending spree to pile even more costs and regulations on American oil  and gas; for example, a methane tax on energy companies, banning  offshore drilling, increasing onshore royalty fees, and putting  domestic oil and gas producers in a choke hold.   Now that gas prices have gone through the roof, some of our  colleagues have come up with another unhelpful solution. They want to  temporarily suspend the gas tax through November, which happens to be  the elections. That is no coincidence. This idea has been soundly  rejected a number of times over the years by both Republicans and  Democrats.   In 2008, gas prices were soaring and the then-Presidential candidate,  Barack Obama, attacked his opponents for endorsing a gas tax holiday,  as many of our colleagues here in the Senate have endorsed currently.   At the time, Candidate Barack Obama, Senator Barack Obama, said:         This isn't an idea designed to get you through the summer,       it's an idea designed to get [you] through an election.    In short, this isn't a fix for high gas prices; it is a talking point  for political campaigns and candidates.   This is a gimmick to create the illusion of action, while really  doing nothing but draining the highway trust fund that we rely upon to  build our roads and bridges.   Still, a few of our colleagues in the Senate have offered a bill that  would suspend the gas tax through the end of the year. I am sure it  comes as no surprise that a majority of the bill's sponsors are on the  ballot this year.   For more than a year now, Republicans have warned about the potential  consequences of the attack on domestic energy production. We have  highlighted the ways the policies could  [[Page S1165]]  drive up prices, harm our energy security, and threaten that of our  allies. Even as gas prices rose month after month, the Biden  administration did nothing. They didn't attempt a midcourse correction.  They didn't open this topic up for debate. They just stayed the course.   Back in November, the Secretary of Energy was asked about increasing  U.S. oil production. She literally laughed and said:         That is hilarious.    Well, it certainly isn't funny now. Gas prices are now averaging  $4.32 a gallon, and our allies are frantically trying to reduce their  reliance on Russian oil and gas, which in many cases is their sole  source.   President Biden has tried to pin these problems squarely on Russia  and Vladimir Putin, but the American people are smart. They know the  truth. They know that high prices predated Russia's invasion of  Ukraine, and they know about the war being waged on domestic energy  production by some of our colleagues across the aisle.   And they are smart enough to know that you can't believe President  Biden when he says you can't do much about it because Russia is  responsible.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
