 Mr. Speaker, George Herbert Walker Bush asked all  of us to be light in this world, to be gracious, to be diligent, and to  be honest. And then he led the way by example.   His patriotism was innate. It was his guiding light, Mr. Speaker. And  Barbara was his soulmate, his compass, and part of his true north.   Mr. Speaker, George H.W. Bush was one of our last great statesmen, a  member of the Greatest Generation. His love for his Nation was bested  only by his love for his family. This enduring love for both is how we  will long remember George H.W. Bush, Mr. Speaker, and, oh, that we  would emulate him.   President Bush could walk into a room and make everyone feel like  they belonged. He was the epitome of the true Southern gentleman, even  though he wasn't born in the South. The South did adopt him, however, I  might add, Mr. Speaker. His mannerisms and his convictions gained him  respect far and wide--worldwide, in fact.   This great and good man brought us together and led the way, once  again,  [[Page H9814]]  in that, during our time of mourning his passing, his example quieted  some of the divisiveness that is on display all too often, Mr. Speaker.   We have a lot to learn from his mission and his life. Oh, that we  would emulate him in that.   Last week, George H.W. Bush arrived at his final, kindest, gentlest  resting place with Barbara and Robin. He is home.   Mission accomplished, Mr. President.   George Herbert Walker Bush, Mr. Speaker, is worth emulating. Oh, that  we would all do so.                                time  2015
