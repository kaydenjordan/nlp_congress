 Madam Speaker, I want to give a story to my good  friends in the press corps because they always feel they have a  shortage of interesting things in the paper. This concerns the  excessive inflation we have under the current administration.   The current administration claims that inflation last year was 8.6  percent. I am going to focus on two different parts of that, one is 5.5  percent for housing and 16.1 percent for used cars.   I ask the press corps to call some local builders or builders  anywhere around the country--builders, landlords, and assessors--and  see if you can find anybody who thinks the cost of housing has only  gone up by 5.5 percent in the past year. My goodness, the cost of  interest by itself has almost doubled in that time. The cost of many  parts of a house has gone up. There is no way that it is only 5.5  percent. I think if you look around and ask builders and Realtors, they  will laugh at that number.   I would also ask you to call some car dealers around the country and  see what they think about the idea that used cars have gone up 16.1  percent in the last year. They, as well, laugh at that. The number has  to be significantly higher.   So there is a gift to my friends in the news business.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, we will talk a little bit about the  border again and what I think is kind of an inappropriate way to handle  some recent events that happened down there.   First of all, we have got to give the backdrop, right. We are all  familiar with the most recent statistics available. For April of 2022,  184,000 people crossed in the country that were not appropriately  vetted and we do not particularly want here.   A year ago, that 184,000 number was at 66,000. Two years ago, under  the prior administration, it was 5,700. So, first of all, the American  public should kind of let that sink in: 5,700 a month to 66,000 a month  to 184,000 a month. Horrific.   Part of monitoring the border is showing respect for the Border  Patrol. I have been on the border eight times over the last 2 years,  and I think they are the most professional of law enforcement agencies  I have run into.   Last September, when potential Haitian immigrants tried to cross the  Rio Grande and get up on shore, agents on horses used reins to protect  the Haitians from the horses' hooves.    Every agent I have talked to felt this was an entirely appropriate  way to protect the Haitians who were trying to come into our country.  But President Biden, the new expert on horsemanship, felt that the new  immigrants were strapped, whatever that meant, and said that they would  have to pay.   Now, the Department of Homeland Security claims that the Border  Patrol agents should be disciplined for protecting the Haitians from  the horses' hooves.   Since then, President Biden's budget, the last budget which he  signed, the last appropriation bill, provided millions of dollars for  monitoring and disciplining the Border Patrol.   This is kind of a mental problem we have seen before in Washington.  It reminds me when we had record murders in our big cities, and  Washington responded by saying that we had to pass a bill making it  easier to sue the police. In other words, all these people dying,  records in the last 2 years in Milwaukee--which is adjacent to my  district, and they think the problem is the police.   In any event, that is what the Biden administration did. They claimed  the police were racist, making it easier to sue police. Obviously, that  is inappropriate.   The other thing I think is inappropriate is we hired a new Border  Patrol head who used to be a police chief. When he was a police chief,  he wouldn't cooperate with ICE when they had problems with people who  they were trying to deport or people who were here illegally.   I mean, can you imagine what type of effect that has on the Border  Patrol agents when the person who is supposed to be the boss doesn't  seem to be on board with the underlying mission?   I believe he also had a problem in which he was accused of some  harassment in his prior job. Now, we have got to hire some more Border  Patrol agents here, and the way to do it is to not have the  administration treat these brave, honorable people inappropriately.   So I call upon Congress to try to weigh in with the President. If you  have taken a trip down to the border, tell him how great the Border  Patrol agents are.   Make that an attractive job because we need top-flight agents to save  our country from people who don't belong here and also to save our  country from the sea of fentanyl that is flowing in here and that  apparently is not something that concerns Congress a whole lot.
