 Mr. Speaker, during the last Congress, Mr.  Burchett and I introduced this important bill as part of a two-bill  microloan major impact package.   Together, these bills would increase the number of microloan lenders  in our communities, increase access to capital, and ensure greater  transparency around how taxpayer dollars are being spent by the SBA.   I look forward to continuing to work with the chairman and the  ranking member, as well as Congressman Burchett to again advance these  pieces of legislation.   Today, I rise in support of the Microloan Transparency and  Accountability Act, and I look forward to working with them to advance  the Microloan Improvement Act in the 118th Congress, as well.   I have heard from a diverse range of businessowners across New  Jersey's Third District about how just small increases in access to  capital could make an enormous impact for them.   These businessowners aren't asking for the moon. Many of them are in  communities that are underserved and may not have a credit history,  extensive past business experience, or the luxury of coming from  wealth, but they have a dream. They are entrepreneurial, and with a  small investment, a microloan to get started in some cases, they can  launch their business, chase their dreams, create jobs, and transform  communities.   By passing this bill, we can help enhance microloans in rural areas  and provide greater transparency to ensure we are using taxpayer  dollars efficiently and effectively.   This bill will help make sure the SBA's microloan program is reaching  those most in need, best serving America's small businessowners, and  giving them a fair shot at success.   I thank Congressman Burchett for leading this effort and for the  support of the Small Business Committee. I urge all of my colleagues to  support small businesses across this country and vote ``yes'' on this  bill.
