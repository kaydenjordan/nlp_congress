 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Albert Edward Pelham,  a beloved community leader and student advocate from my town,  Montclair, New Jersey.   Al was known for bringing people together. His work aided and  inspired generations of Montclairians, and he leaves behind a beautiful  legacy.   Al was raised in Montclair and graduated from Montclair High School.  He served our country in the U.S. Army before returning to New Jersey  and graduating from Bloomfield College.   From his leadership in the Montclair NAACP, the Montclair  Neighborhood Development Corporation, Statewide Parent Advocacy  Network, Montclair African-American Heritage Foundation, and more, he  dedicated himself to making his community a better and fairer place.   One of Al's many achievements was the creation of Project Oasis,  which offers year-round educational and recreational opportunities for  students. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Al adapted the program and  organized a remote learning space so that all students had access to a  computer to attend their virtual classes.   He also created a program for students who were suspended to provide  them with academic training and counseling as an alternative to staying  at home.   Al worked to ensure that all students, regardless of their  background, had opportunities to excel.   Al fought tirelessly for racial justice and inclusivity, guiding both  the Montclair NAACP and the Montclair African-American Heritage  Foundation through especially difficult times in our country. In 2019,  he was recognized for these efforts with the Essex County Dr. Martin  Luther King Jr. Leadership Award.   Al's dedication to his community was matched by his deep commitment  to his family. Al took any opportunity he could to be with his wife,  Audrey; his children, Dwayne and Rhonda; his grandchildren, Charles and  Cameron; his sisters; and extended family.   On August 19, 2021, Al passed away after a battle with cancer. His  selfless commitment to making Montclair a better place will not soon be  forgotten. I was honored to have known Al and to have called him my  friend. The counsel he gave me and so many others over the years will  continue to impact us and the entire Montclair community for  generations to come.                            ____________________
