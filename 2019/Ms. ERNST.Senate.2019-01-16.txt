 Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined on the floor by  Senator Blunt, Senator Wicker, and Senator Fischer to speak about the  importance of protecting and celebrating life.   This Friday, Americans from every State in our Nation, from our tiny  rural towns to our bustling urban cities, will gather in our Nation's  Capital to participate in the 46th annual March for Life.   Each year, I am amazed and inspired by the immeasurable strength,  compassion, and support demonstrated by the pro-life community, as  hundreds of thousands of its members come to Washington, DC, and  tirelessly work to protect the most vulnerable in our society--the  unborn.   As members of the Senate Values Action Team, throughout the year, we  are blessed with the opportunity to work with and hear from so many who  are committed to protecting human life at all stages.   I thank my colleagues for sharing this message of life today, and at  this time I would like to yield to the Senator from Missouri.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Thank you very much to my colleagues, the Senator from  Nebraska, the Senator from Mississippi, as well as our other colleague,  the Senator from Missouri. Thank you for joining us on the floor today  to express our support for those who march for life. Thank you so much.   As my colleagues can attest, the invaluable message being shared by  the pro-life community this week has implications far beyond that of  simply the March for Life. As I travel across my home State of Iowa, I  see this life-affirming message in our pregnancy resource centers,  maternity homes, and adoption agencies. These comprehensive on-the- ground services provide women and families with service options that  are changing and saving lives every single day.   These life-affirming services are the foundation of the pro-life  movement across our Nation, and I sincerely thank those centers and  agencies for their critical work to fight for vulnerable lives  throughout the year.   I see the same message in the remarkable stories of individual  families, such as the Pickering family from Newton, IA. I have had the  opportunity to share the phenomenal story of Micah Pickering on the  Senate floor before. As you may recall, Micah was born at just 20 weeks  postfertilization. He was only about the size of a bag of M&M's--the  size of the palm of my hand. That was Micah. Yet Micah was also a  perfect, fully-formed baby boy, with 10 fingers and 10 toes. In fact,  no one makes his case more eloquently than Micah himself.   When I first met Micah, I had a picture of him displayed in my office  from the day that he was born--again, the size of the palm of my hand.  Micah immediately ran up to that picture. He pointed at it, and he  said: ``Baby.''   Micah recognized right away that even at just 20 weeks  postfertilization, the humanity of the child was undeniable.   Micah's parents and the doctors and nurses at the University of Iowa  Hospitals & Clinics recognized this humanity, as well, and were  dedicated to his survival. Today Micah is a happy, healthy, and  energetic 6-year-old boy.   Stories like Micah's are extraordinary reminders that the life- affirming services, for which the pro-life community marches, have real  and significant impacts on the lives of families across America.   Since coming to Congress, I have also tried to do my part to ensure  that this message from those in my home State of Iowa and from other  communities all across the Nation is taken back and turned into action  in Washington. For me, that has meant supporting crucial pro-life  initiatives, such as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,  which would prevent abortions after 20 weeks of development--the very  same age at which my dear Micah was born.   Another critical piece of legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act, would create concrete enforcement provisions  to hold abortionists accountable if they do not provide the same degree  of care to a baby who survives an abortion as they would any child born  naturally premature at that same age.   Fighting for commonsense legislation that protects innocent life has  been a priority of mine in the Senate. But Congress must also do more  to ensure that taxpayers are not forced to subsidize abortion or the  abortion industry giants, such as Planned Parenthood.   During the 115th Congress, I led the fight in the Senate to pass  critical legislation, which was signed into law in 2017, that ensures  States are not forced to provide entities like Planned Parenthood, the  Nation's single largest provider of abortions, with Federal title X  dollars.   I am grateful to have worked with former Congresswoman Diane Black,  my Senate colleagues, and President Trump to make sure States are not  forced to award providers like Planned Parenthood with taxpayer dollars  like title X family planning grants.   As I have stated time and again, taxpayers should not be forced to  foot the bill for roughly one-half billion dollars annually for an  organization like Planned Parenthood, which exhibits such disrespect  for human life. With that in mind, today I reintroduced legislation  that would defund Planned Parenthood while still protecting vital  funding for women's healthcare services. Contrary to what they claim,  Planned Parenthood is not the Nation's preeminent provider of women's  healthcare. In fact, Planned Parenthood facilities do not even perform  in-house mammograms; something so simple is not performed by Planned  Parenthood.   On the other hand, just as my colleague the senior Senator from  Nebraska stated, community health centers continue to greatly outnumber  Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide and provide more comprehensive  preventive and primary health services, including cervical and breast  cancer screenings, diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, well  childcare, prenatal and postnatal care, immunizations, and so much  more. Access to comprehensive health services is absolutely critical to  women and families across this Nation, and federally qualified health  centers offer such services, regardless of a person's ability to pay.   A recent GAO study that I requested, along with many of my colleagues  in both the House and the Senate, showed that over a 3-year period,  federally qualified health centers served 25 million individuals  compared to only 2.4 million individuals that Planned Parenthood  served. That is more than 10 times more people served by those  healthcare centers.   Furthermore, a recent Marist poll shows that 54 percent of Americans  do not support taxpayer dollars going toward abortions. While there are  Federal regulations that prevent Federal dollars from directly covering  abortion, these laws are governed by a complicated patchwork of  policies and funding riders that must be reapproved during the  appropriations process every single year.   Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has been attached to appropriations  bills in order to block Federal funds from paying for abortions.  However, this policy, which once drew widespread bipartisan support,  has recently been under attack. For the first time ever, the Affordable  Care Act authorized and appropriated funds that bypassed the Hyde  amendment funding restrictions. In 2016, the Democratic Party added the  repeal of the Hyde amendment protections to its Presidential platform.   The Hyde amendment is a longstanding and critical provision that  protects Federal dollars and ensures that taxpayers are not footing the  bill for abortion procedures. That is why I support the No Taxpayer  Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of  2019, which was recently reintroduced in the Senate. This legislation  would permanently codify the Hyde amendment, ensuring that funding  restrictions remain in place and are applied to all Federal programs.  Furthermore, this bill takes important steps to eliminate certain tax  benefits related to abortions and improve disclosure requirements  related to insurance coverage of abortion.   Preventing our taxpayer dollars from paying for abortion procedures-- a position that a majority of Americans agree with--should not be a  complicated process vulnerable to partisan  [[Page S276]]  attack. Congress must take steps to ensure that permanent protections  apply governmentwide.   As such, I urge the Senate to consider the No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion and Abortion Insurance Disclosure Act on the floor in order to  protect not only our taxpayer dollars but the innocent lives of our  most vulnerable.   I appreciate all of the marchers who will be coming to Washington,  DC, in the following days and spending their time in a most worthy  effort, which is our annual March for Life. God bless them all. Of  course, God bless my Iowans for that journey.   Thank you very much.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Mr. Markey):   S. 151. A bill to deter criminal robocall violations and improve  enforcement of section 227(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation.
