 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the  city of West Jefferson in North Carolina's Fifth District on yet  another successful Christmas in July Festival. For the last 33 years,  the festival has taken place on the first weekend of July to celebrate  Ashe County's vibrant and nationally renowned Christmas tree industry.   The dedicated volunteers of the festival committee and board of  directors bring together this wonderfully patriotic community around  America's independence and the best Christmas trees in the country. As  a former Christmas tree grower myself, I can attest to the importance  of recognizing this often overlooked, yet highly significant, farming  industry, not just during the Christmas season, but all year round.   It is not only an honor to represent these patriots and tree growers,  it is an honor for me to share this tradition with them every year.                            ____________________
