 Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States should  have the power to appoint judges to the FISA Court. This would lead to  a more ideologically diverse court, more transparency in oversight, and  better FISA outcomes.   Mr. Speaker, this isn't just my argument. It is the argument of the  gentleman from California, the ranking  [[Page H1357]]  member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; and this is  the gentleman from California making that very argument on Russia  Today.   Here, YouTube has actually had to say:         Russia Today is funded in whole or in part by the Russian       Government.    So my question is this, Mr. Speaker: If it is good enough for a bill  to be filed by the gentleman from California in 2013, and if it is good  enough to talk about it on Russia Today, why is it not good enough to  give President Trump the very same powers that he wanted to give to  President Obama?   That is my question. I am waiting for an answer.                            ____________________
