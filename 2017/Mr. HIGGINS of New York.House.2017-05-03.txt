 Mr. Speaker, for the third time in 90 days,  Republicans are trying to take away patient protections for Americans  with preexisting medical conditions. Fifty percent of all Americans and  86 percent of Americans ages 55 through 64 have preexisting conditions.  There is a genetic influence in many people who have preexisting  conditions, meaning that tens of millions of Americans are born into a  predisposition for certain diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and heart  disease.   The Republican healthcare scam would obliterate protections for  preexisting conditions. For example, if you have a dad with a kid who  is stuck with childhood cancer, the dad could buy a policy, but that  policy would not have to cover his kid's cancer treatments. That, Mr.  Speaker, is a deliberate intent to deceive the American people.                            ____________________
