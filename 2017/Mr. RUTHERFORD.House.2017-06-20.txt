Annual employee award program.''.       SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.         (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act or the issuance of a report by the       Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security on       the extent to which the Department has an equitable and       consistent disciplinary process, whichever is later, but in       no case later than one year after such date of enactment, the       Comptroller General of the United States shall utilize, if       available, such report and investigate whether the       application of discipline and adverse actions are       administered in an equitable and consistent manner that       results in the same or substantially similar disciplinary       outcomes across the Department for misconduct by a non-      supervisory or supervisor employee who engaged in the same or       substantially similar misconduct.        (b) Consultation.--In carrying out the investigation       described in subsection (a), the Comptroller General of the       United States shall consult with the employee engagement       steering committee established pursuant to subsection (b)(1)       of section 710 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (as added       by section 3(a) of this Act).

SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON NEW FUNDING.         No additional funds are authorized to carry out the       requirements of this Act and the amendments made by this Act.       Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts       otherwise authorized    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2283. According to the  Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, after 6 straight years of decline,  DHS improved by 3 percentage points in 2016, from 53 percent in 2015 to  56 percent. However, since its inception, DHS has consistently reported  low employee job satisfaction and today remains last out of large  agencies in employee satisfaction.   According to the FEVS, the Department slightly improved its overall  response rate to about 50 percent in 2016. Former Secretary Jeh Johnson  attributed much of the success to the Department's employee engagement  steering committee and efforts he and other leaders have made in  strengthening employee morale and engagement. H.R. 2283 seeks to codify  many of these efforts.   The purpose of H.R. 2283 is to amend the Homeland Security Act of  2002 to improve morale within the Department of Homeland Security  workforce by conferring new responsibilities to the Chief Human Capital  Officer, establishing an employee engagement steering committee,  requiring action plans, and authorizing an annual employee award  program.   The security of our homeland depends on focused, efficient, and  dedicated individuals who feel confident and empowered in the  workplace.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson for introducing this legislation  and for working in such a bipartisan manner on it. I urge all my  colleagues to support this commonsense, thoughtful legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 2283, as amended.   I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 2283, the ``Department of  Homeland Security Morale, Recognition, Learning and Engagement Act,''  which will amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002.   This bill requires the Chief Human Capital Officer to develop and  implement policies related to leadership development, employee  engagement, and career progression.   The CHCO must evaluate strategic workforce planning efforts, identify  methods for managing and overseeing human capital programs, and  maintain a catalogue of available employee development opportunities.   It is imperative that employees be aware of the opportunities  available for them no matter what their current title or role may be.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will also authorize the Chief Learning and  Engagement Officer to assist the Chief Human Capital Officer on  employee development and will also authorize the Employee Engagement  Steering Committee.   The Employee Engagement Steering Committee will be comprised of  representatives from across the Department as well as representatives  from employee labor organizations.   Having a committee that is representative of the Department's  workforce will ensure that a diverse voice is representative in any  decisions made that will affect employees.   The Steering Committee will identify factors that have a negative  impact on employee engagement and morale and will monitor components'  efforts in addressing morale.   The Component heads are tasked with developing and implementing a  component-specific action plan that addresses employee engagement and  advances the overall Department action plan.   This bill will authorize the Secretary to establish an annual  employee awards program to recognize non-supervisory DHS employees who  have made significant contributions to the Department.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will also require the Secretary to provide an  independent assessment of DHS programs to Congress.   Congress must ensure that programs are working in the way that they  were created to.   This bill is endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council, the  National Treasury Employees Union, and the American Federation of  Government Employees.   These organizations have recognized that this bill is a step forward  in the right direction which helps employees of the Department have a  higher morale.   DHS was ranked low in best places to work in a recent poll conducted.   Recognition and employee engagement is important to reduce turnover,  improve team culture, and increase employee performance.   I urge my colleagues to also support this bill and help create a  Department of Homeland Security that is professional, efficient,  effective, and employee friendly.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2283, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2190) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct  the Under Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland  Security to make certain improvements in managing the Department's real  property portfolio, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2190         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2190, the  Streamlining DHS Overhead Act.   Despite being the Nation's third largest Federal department, the  Department of Homeland Security continues to struggle with challenges  from its integration of 22 different Federal departments and agencies.   One example of these challenges is the Department's management of its  real estate portfolio. DHS pays $2 billion a year to occupy more than  100 million square feet of space. Weak internal oversight and a lack of  property management processes have further intensified the problem.   Collaboration and coordination is important in these instances, and  doing nothing has led to a footprint larger than what DHS needs to  carry out its mission.   This legislation directly addresses these challenges by mandating the  development of regional real property strategies that focus on  consolidating leases, where appropriate, to the mission. It also gives  the Under Secretary for Management oversight tools to ensure DHS  property is being managed efficiently.   Another important part of this legislation is its outlining of  responsibilities for the Chief Facilities and Logistics Officer to  achieve cost savings.   As we have seen from the 2-year majority staff investigation,  increased accountability and promoting efficiency is needed so DHS can  more effectively use its resources to focus on its mission of securing  the homeland while also saving taxpayer funds.   Improving the Department's operation and promoting efficiencies  within its real property portfolio is an issue that both sides of the  aisle and the Department should be able to work together on.   H.R. 2190 is commonsense legislation. I urge my colleagues' support.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1915     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2190, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2190, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
