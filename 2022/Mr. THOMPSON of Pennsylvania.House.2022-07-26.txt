 Madam Speaker, yesterday, we celebrated  National Hire a Veteran Day. In 2017, the nonprofit Hire Our Heroes  established the day to highlight the many talented men and women who  served our country who are now seeking civilian employment.   Hire Our Heroes serves as a resource bank for veterans to seek  professional advice, discover new training resources, and search for  new job opportunities.   Veterans are an important part of our community. They sacrifice a  great deal to ensure that we live in a Nation that is free and safe.  While we may never be able to fully repay them for their sacrifice, the  very least we can do is help ease the transition back into civilian  life.   A big part of that transition is ensuring there are well-paying,  family-sustaining jobs available for our men and women in uniform when  they return home.   Our veterans are highly trained and highly skilled. They deserve our  support while deployed and when they return home. One of the best ways  to do that is to prepare them for the workforce outside of the  military.   Madam Speaker, the best way to thank a veteran is to hire a veteran.  The skills obtained during service are invaluable.                            ____________________
