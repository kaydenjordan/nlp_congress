 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, you are going to hear today and we have a series of  bills, many of them historic in nature, many of them--all of them-- worked in a bipartisan manner.   There has been a lot of talk lately of the one place in Congress that  is really functioning well, and that is in the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, and I would echo that. It is because of the commitment, the  dedication, and the end state that all of us agree on is the best  possible care for those warriors willing to put their lives in harm's  way, their families, and the care that was pledged to them.   Also, with that being said, democracy is hard. It requires us to do  the work here, with the stakeholders, and there is no issue that has a  more committed group of stakeholders than the veterans' community. Some  of the names you are going to hear of veterans service organizations  are a hallmark and a bedrock of not just veterans' issues, but of our  communities. We work with them hand in hand to make sure that this  Congress understands exactly what they need.   And democracy is hard. It is that old sausage-making adage sometimes.  It is a disappointment to me that we are on the floor because I think  we are just a little bit early; I think we are about a day. Like we  have before, we stood on this floor when we had a very important  accountability bill forward, and I said at that time we were going to  have to work with the Senate to make sure we got something passed. We  did that, it passed, and I am proud that we were able to do that.   It happened with the GI Bill that is coming up. The first run we went  at it did not work because we had not built that collaboration, and I  am disappointed today that I believe S. 114 has fallen into that.   This is a very fast-moving problem, because I want to be clear. What  this does is it extends veterans' access to care in the community  through the Veterans Choice Program without providing additional  resources for the Department of Veterans Affairs to enhance its  internal capacity.   I agree with my colleague who was very clear about the capacity of  the VA, what Choice does, and I would absolutely echo not funding this  program before we leave for the August recess is unacceptable. But not  getting a bill that the Senate can agree on, not getting a bill that  the President can sign, and not getting a bill that actually does what  we are supposed to do is also not acceptable.   The gentleman is also right: we have quadrupled the VA budget, and I  am proud of that. I also think it is probably not lost on anyone that  that started in 2001 at the same time that we fought America's longest  war and are still engaged around the world, with an aging population of  Vietnam, Korean, and World War II veterans.   As it became apparent that the Veterans Choice Program was facing a  funding shortfall earlier this summer, nine veterans service  organizations--Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion,  Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, AMVETS, Iraq  and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Military Officers Association of  America, Military Order of the Purple Heart, and Vietnam Veterans of  America--issued a letter which provided very clear guidance to House  and Senate leadership and House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees  in terms of a solution, and I include in the Record the letter from  these organizations.                                                      June 28, 2017.      Hon. Johnny Isakson,      Chairman, Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      Ranking Member, Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Phil Roe, M.D.,      Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Walz,      Ranking Member, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Isakson and Roe, Ranking Members Tester and       Walz: As leaders of the nation's largest veterans service       organizations, and on behalf of our combined five million       members and auxiliaries, we write to urge you to       expeditiously reach agreement on and advance legislation to       ensure continuous access to health care for millions veterans       enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health       care system, including care provided through the Choice       program. Specifically, we call on you to reach agreement on       an emergency appropriation and authorization bill that would       address urgent resource shortfalls endangering VA's medical       care programs--including Choice, community care and medical       services. Further, in order to prevent these problems from       recurring in the future, we call on you to equally invest in       modernizing and expanding VA's capacity to meet rising demand       for care, as well as finally address the glaring inequity in       law that prevents thousands of family caregivers from getting       the support they need to care for their veterans severely       disabled before September 11, 2001.        In recent weeks, VA Secretary David Shulkin has repeatedly       made clear in his public statements and congressional       testimony that current funding is no longer projected to be       adequate to meet the needs of an increasing number of       veterans seeking medical treatment directly through the VA       system as well as through community care programs,       particularly the Choice program. Secretary Shulkin has made       clear that rising demand for care by veterans has consumed       more VA resources than previously anticipated, threatening       the ability of VA to meet all of its obligations to ill and       injured veterans both this year and next. Although Public Law       115-26 extended the Choice program beyond its prior sunset       date of August 7, 2017, VA now projects it will likely run       out of funding prior to the end of fiscal year (FY) 2017       unless additional funding is made available. Further, based       on recent utilization trends, VA projects a higher demand for       both community care and Choice next year (FY 2018), and       anticipates additional funding requirements above the budget       request made just weeks earlier. In order to ensure       continuation of the Choice program--and absent an infusion of       new funding--VA has stated its intention to take       extraordinary budget  [[Page H6153]]       actions, including pulling back unobligated funding from VA       medical facilities and utilizing funding in FY 2017 that had       been designated as carryover funding for its FY 2018 budget       request, thereby further reducing available medical care       resources for next year.        Messrs. Chairmen and Ranking Members, our nation has a       sacred obligation to ensure the men and women who served and       sacrificed to defend our way of life receive timely, high-      quality health care through a fully-funded VA health care       system, which includes community care or Choice options       whenever and wherever necessary. With the Choice program       rapidly running out of funds and its successor community care       program still many months away, it is imperative that       Congress not allow veterans to go without needed care before       this transition is completed.        We note that VA's FY 2018 budget submission included a       request for $3.5 billion in mandatory funds to continue the       Choice program. In order to meet Congressional PAYGO       requirements, VA also included two legislative proposals we       vehemently oppose which would cut billions of dollars from       veterans disability compensation through changes to       Individual Unemployabilty eligibility and rounding down cost-      of-living adjustment (COLA) increases to ``pay'' for the new       Choice funding. We find it absolutely unconscionable to cut       benefits for disabled veterans to ``pay'' for their medical       care. Congress imposed these PAYGO rules on itself and       Congress has the authority to waive them by designating new       funding for the existing Choice program as emergency       spending, just as it did when the Choice program was created       in 2014 through Public Law 113-146, the Veterans Access,       Choice and Accountability Act (VACAA). It is our       understanding that the actual need to continue the Choice       program for the balance of this year and through the end of       FY 2018 is approximately $4.3 billion.        We remind you that the primary reason the Choice program       was created was to address gaps in access due to the lack of       clinicians and clinical space necessary to provide timely       access to health care for all enrolled veterans. As such,       VACAA not only included emergency funding to allow additional       access to community care outside VA, it also contained       funding to rebuild and expand capacity inside VA. Therefore,       we call on you to continue this commitment to strengthen and       modernize the VA by providing equal emergency funding to       address VA's infrastructure and personnel gaps. There are at       least 27 VA health care facility leases awaiting funding in       order to be activated. In addition, there are dozens of minor       and major construction projects that require billions of       dollars in funding to sustain and expand VA's capacity to       provide timely care to enrolled veterans. Furthermore, VA has       tens of thousands of vacant positions which will require not       just funding, but innovative new programs to recruit and       retain hard-to-fill clinical positions in many areas of the       country. Therefore, we call on you to include an equivalent       level of funding--$4.3 billion--to support VA's internal       capacity to deliver care.        Finally, since enactment of the Public Law 111-163 in 2010,       which created the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for       Family Caregivers (PCAFC), eligibility has been restricted to       caregivers of severely disabled veterans injured or made ill       on or after September 11, 2001. The clear intention of the       law was to initiate this program rapidly for post-9/11       veterans to address their urgent needs, thereafter working to       expand the program to meet the critical needs of family       caregivers of seriously disabled veterans of all generations       as soon as feasible. However seven years later, Congress has       yet to begin addressing the blatant unfairness facing       caregivers of severely disabled veterans injured prior to       September 11, 2001. As Secretary Shulkin and other experts       agree, supporting caregivers who allow veterans to remain in       their homes will save VA money that would otherwise need to       be spent for long term institutional care. Therefore, we call       on you to include both authorization and funding to eliminate       this indefensible inequity based on existing bipartisan       legislation in the Senate (S. 591) and the House (H.R. 1472,       H.R. 1802).        While the current funding crisis must be addressed in the       short term through emergency funding and authorization, we       remain focused on moving beyond the flawed Choice program as       soon as practicable. We continue to urge you to work with us,       Secretary Shulkin and other critical stakeholders to design       and implement a new paradigm for veterans health care built       around an integrated network, with a modernized VA serving as       the coordinator and primary provider of care, and community       providers addressing remaining gaps in access and services.       We further urge you to consolidate all community care       programs through a single unified discretionary funding       source that includes the necessary flexibility and       accountability to ensure that VA can deliver the highest       quality of care in the most appropriate clinical settings       within the network.        Messrs. Chairmen and Ranking Members, we recognize the       continuing attention and commitment you have all shown to       providing timely and accessible care to our nation's injured       and ill veterans, and we hope you will work with us and       Secretary Shulkin to address this urgent funding shortfall.       America's veterans have earned the right to high-quality,       timely and accessible health care. We believe that the       comprehensive plan outlined above will ensure our nation       continues to meet that sacred obligation and call on you to       support it.            Respectfully,          Garry J. Augustine, Executive Director, Washington             Headquarters, DAV (Disabled American Veterans); Robert             E. Wallace, Adjutant General, Veterans of Foreign Wars             of the United States; Joseph Chenelly, National             Executive Director, AMVETS; Dana T. Atkins, Lieutenant             General, U.S. Air Force (Ret.), President, Military             Officers Association of America; Rick Weidman,             Executive Director for Policy and Government Affairs,             Vietnam Veterans of America; Verna L. Jones, Executive             Director, The American Legion; Sherman Gillums, Jr.,             Executive Director, Paralyzed Veterans of America; Paul             Rieckhoff, Founder and CEO, Iraq and Afghanistan             Veterans of America (IAVA); Hershel Gober, National             Commander, Military Order of the Purple Heart.     In their letter from June 28, they wrote: ``Specifically,  we call on you to reach an agreement on an emergency appropriation and  authorization bill that would address urgent resource shortfalls  endangering VA's medical care programs--including Choice, community  care and medical services. Further, in order to prevent these problems  from recurring in the future, we call on you to equally invest in  modernizing and expanding VA's capacity to meet rising demand for care.  . . .''   Choice means choosing to go to the VA hospital and choice means  choosing to use community care. Both are equal opportunities for our  veterans to get the care they need.   The current bill before us does not meet the requirements asked for  by our veterans service organizations. In fact, in order to keep the  Veterans Choice Program going, House leadership and the Budget  Committee have refused to see this as an emergency and are requiring $2  billion in offsets to pay for the bill.   While the actual offsets being offered are noncontroversial and are  the ones the committee has used in the past, the fact that the  leadership is requiring offsets from VA programs to pay for private  care is wrong--all of this to appease a small vocal minority who simply  sees any spending as unnecessary.   On Friday, a number of the same VSOs listed above issued a joint  statement, which noted:   ``Veterans healthcare benefits have already been `paid for' through  the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wore our Nation's  uniform, millions whom suffered injuries, illnesses and lifelong  disabilities.''   I agree with them. Without emergency funding, robbing Peter to pay  Paul, an analogy used by the Paralyzed Veterans of America, is not a  viable path. It is actually robbing future Peter to pay current Paul.   Had it been apparent VA would be facing this shortfall, Congress  maybe would have never extended the Veterans Choice Program beyond its  sunset of August 7 and would have, instead, begun working on  legislation that would have consolidated VA's multiple community care  programs into one easy-to-understand and -use program.   I reiterate: Choice is not a permanent VA program. Now, it may end up  being that. It may be someone's wish, but it is not. It was a short- term fix that was testified we need to extend the program. Several  weeks later, leadership of the VA came back and told us they are 4- point-whatever billion dollars short and asked us to fix it. That is  not the chairman's fault; that is not the Members of this House's  fault; but it is our responsibility.   Now, the question is: How do we ensure that the care is continuous?  How do we make sure care is not interrupted? How do we make sure a  veteran who is getting chemotherapy in the private setting right now is  not told to not come back because we are not going to pay it?   The sense of urgency is with all of us. What I ask is that we try and  come back, take a look at what we can do. And I will say this: the  chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee in the House has made as  good faith an effort to do this as anyone could possibly ask. I  understand the challenges coming from a broader caucus and asking for  this. This, where we are at today, is significantly changed from where  we started, but it is apparent, in the Senate, that it will not pass.   We will not have money for the Veterans Choice Program, so we need to  [[Page H6154]]  decide: Do we stand and make a statement of ideological, fiscal,  whatever they want to call it, or do we come together, unanimously  agree on something we can move forward, build capacity into the VA to  assure that Choice is there, everything from the research into the VA  to the care in the communities, and come together to find that?   Moreover, these shortages are further reinforced in Choice when you  take into account veterans' reliance on VA's system for care has  steadily increased. While enrollment has been flat in fiscal years 2014  through 2016, the total number of veterans utilizing VA healthcare has  grown by 3 percent. The total appointments in VA increased by more than  5 percent during this period.   In order to address that need, since the Veterans Choice Program was  implemented, the total number of community care appointments has  increased by 61 percent, and more than 25 million appointments were  completed in fiscal year 2016. Over one-fifth of this care was  completed in the Veterans Choice Program. No disagreement. Community  care has always been there, and community care is an absolute staple of  the VA.   What is also not debatable is capacity inside the VA must remain  there. Any shortfall in capacity is going to distort where people are  getting their care.   While we are not here to oppose the premise of veterans having access  to care, members of my Caucus, as this stands right now, cannot go  forward until we figure out how we are going to come to a compromise  that gets the capacity as it should be in the VA and also allows us and  everyone--we should never have this discussion in this House. If we  can't find compromise that gets something across the finish line that  actually does something for veterans, everything else is just messaging  for politics.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to the chairman's words, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would just like to respond to the chairman.   I, too, have not made the argument on privatization. I do not believe  that is the goal here. I do not believe that is what we talked about.  If there are those that have that, that is not the intention of this  committee, the chairman, his staff, or anyone involved with this.   And when we did talk--and I think this could be an interesting way  for this House to listen to how we do this. There was transparency in  these negotiations, and we sat in front of people and did them. And one  of the issues in there was we had to build the capacity amongst the  VSOs.   We need to stop for a minute. There may be times we need to take  those hard votes against it, but I ask all of the Members to think  about this, Madam Speaker. All of the veterans service organizations  have lined up in opposition to this.                                time  1430    Now, that doesn't mean that they are totally right, and it doesn't  mean that there isn't something here we can talk and debate about. The  question is trying to get their goodwill.   I think when we talked the last time, we had some leases, and I am  not calling them token, but in the budget of the big VA, which I do  think in many cases is adequately funded, trying to get some of that to  show the sense of goodwill.   If I were counting on the decision being made strictly by the VA  Committee, I would encourage people to know this would get done, but I  am deeply concerned we are going to see a Frankenstein monster of  appropriation process this week that in no way resembles regular order.  That has nothing to do with this committee.   Again I would say, if it were left to us, bifurcating this issue and  coming back and fixing it, I have faith in that. In this House of  Representatives and the leadership now, I do not have that, nor do the  veterans service organizations.   So the question here is not questioning the motive, the question here  is not a false canard of privatization versus inside-the-VA care, it is  not even the discussion we are having right now of the adequacy overall  of the whole budget; it is a case of the VA leadership running a  program, running out of money way before they had, and coming to the  House and telling us that. And this is not and cannot be made that the  idea is you are going to go home without funding the VA. No one will  say that about you, and no one should say that about us. Everybody in  this House will get this thing done and get it funded. So it is not the  case.   I do understand this: we are against the wall, we are under the gun,  because they just handed us this. So it is our job to figure out how to  build everybody into this.   So the things that are being asked to do with the Choice Program, I  support that. The offsets and pay-for, I disagree with. To make that  work, our side was willing to say: Can we show some good faith and fund  some of these leases and get some payments for these folks in terms of  an emergency spending? But I understand the difficulty is if a spending  bill comes, there is going to be a vocal group of folks who are going  to make the case, as we have seen, that makes it very difficult to move  legislation.   Madam Speaker, you have witnessed it with healthcare, you have  witnessed it with other things, that we are going to have to  compromise. If we get into our corners, it is not going to work.   So I want to be very clear. The motives of the chairman to care for  our veterans is unquestioned, Choice being funded is unquestioned.  Making sure there is capacity and goodwill and the funding needs in  these leases and some of the things we are asking for is a necessity to  make sure the Senate can pass this, and that it shows them that we are  moving in the right direction.   So I would ask, give us a day, have us come back at this. Don't put  this thing on the board to fail and then let everyone else take the  message. Everyone here knows we are going to end up here and pass  something that can be signed into law, and that will happen. The  questions are: Do we do damage amongst ourselves; do we keep the  goodwill and the collaboration; or do we decide we need to make a  message first, then come back and then blame someone because they are  not funding the veterans? No one in here wants that to happen.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have left.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Minnesota has 8 minutes  remaining.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have left.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Minnesota has 8 minutes  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), the vice ranking member of the full Committee  on Veterans' Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, to be clear, we are very aligned on the goals here. I  am not implying that wait times went down if we didn't have Choice. I  was on the conference committee that created Choice as part of it.  There is community care that has been there. There is also a $12  billion shortfall in facilities rated D and F. We had sewer lines  breaking and running feces back into hospitals, those types of things.   I am not saying that maybe the money is not already there or they are  not using it correctly. The fact of the matter is this was a program  that was created out of the crisis of Phoenix. It did not stand up as  quickly as it could have; it was plagued with tons of problems that  many of us heard about. We kept committed to it. I would argue that  they are getting their legs under them and providing care in a timely  manner.   It grossly overspent where it was at. We have had no audit. And I  think we need to keep this in mind, that on this side of the aisle, I  will be the first to talk to anyone who grandstands this and makes this  as a case that this is a failure at the VA or the administration. I  don't know that yet.   What I would say is we are all in this together, so we want to get it  done. I am simply making the case today that in light of opposition  that is rarely seen from the VSOs in such opposition to this, that even  though the outcome is there, and nothing the chairman said was  incorrect, it is the spirit of what it takes to legislate that is  missing around here. You can go to the White House after passing a bill  in the House, and if the Senate doesn't do anything, it is not a law.   So we have other people to deal with: constituents, veterans,  veterans service organizations, Democrats in the Senate, Republicans in  the Senate, Democrats on this side.   So what I am asking is, just give a little on the side of what it  takes to build the coalition, get the thing passed, and then let's go  back and fund VA care and end this ridiculous argument of privatization  versus nonprivatization. Wherever a veteran can get the care and access  it as quickly, timely, and quality as possible is what we are trying to  shoot for. In many cases, that is in the VA; in other cases, it is in  the community. So this is not a drop-dead.   My hope on this is, is that a debate, when it comes to emergency  spending of money and depending on the Senate, is not going to split  the goodwill, the good work, and, I would argue, the fair democracy and  execution of how the House of Representatives is supposed to work.   So my final statements on this would be, I am in virtual total  agreement with the chairman on what needs to be done here. Our  differences lie in, he is right, when I went back and talked to people,  I could not sell to the VSOs the plan as it is, and they have every  right to speak out on that. And we could not sell the Senate at this  point.   So what I would ask the gentleman again is, don't make us oppose this  piece of legislation simply to make a statement for a few members.  Bring it back when we can have the Senate, the VSOs, and everyone in  and accomplish our goal.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in unwavering support of H.R. 3218.   It is interesting, we may prove a couple of things. One is that the  universe needs to be balanced, or God has an incredible sense of irony,  or our democracy is resilient and strong because, after our debate over  the last piece of legislation, I can tell you that, in the time I have  had the privilege of representing the people of southern Minnesota, I  am not sure there is a day that I feel more of that sense of pride and  honor than to be here today. Much of that thanks goes to a humble man  who won't say so himself.   The Colmery GI Bill, in any years past, and maybe with a different  chairman, would have been the Roe GI Bill, as the Sonny Montgomery GI  Bill; but the chairman is a man of humbleness and passing on thanks to  others, and it shows in giving the credit to so many Members who wrote  and were part of this legislation.   This is a real historic piece of work. It is hard to get big pieces  of legislation like this done. I saw somebody had written up recently  and said: Well, the VA Committee is moving a lot of things because it  is easy.   I think, after that last little debate and how this one has gone,  there is nothing easy about it because it is not supposed to be easy.  It is supposed to be a challenge building the coalitions necessary. It  is supposed to be thoughtful because we are impacting generations going  forward.   There are so many people to thank, and the chairman started hitting  on them; but I want to again as someone who, if not for the GI Bill,  would not have received my education, and our lives and the trajectory  of our lives are changed dramatically for that.   Somebody stood in these chairs years ago and thought about putting a  GI Bill in place that ended up benefiting me; and the idea of being  able to pay it forward from one veteran to another, or from this House  to another, is something that seems like it is lacking too much around  here.   When we get together, there is much we can do for this country. The  improvements in the bill are wide-ranging. I just want to mention a  couple because I think they need to be said and I think veterans are  paying attention, Madam Speaker, and maybe some of the folks watching  this.   I am happy to say we are able to remove the 15-year expiration date.  The idea of a lifetime GI Bill just goes to the reality of modern-day  warriors; many of them serving at different times, serving later in  life, not going right away when they get out, or even changing  professions; and having that benefit there and holding it and enhancing  their education is not only benefiting their lives, it benefits our  economy.   We know that when these wars started we had very high veteran  unemployment rates. We are trying to figure out different ways. And as  the chairman pointed out, using the GI Bill for STEM research and other  ways to get a skill set is just smart legislation.   I want to thank a few folks on the other side about understanding  that we have one force now. We do not have an active Army and a Guard  and Reserve that are two separate things. These warriors fight side by  side, and their call up, when they get called up, means the same thing.   Because of the way regulation was written, there were things in here  that created an inequality among them. And we were happy to have a  general with us in General Bergman, Representatives O'Rourke, Banks,  and Radewagen, along with someone who  [[Page H6167]]  is not a member of this committee but is a co-chair on the Guard and  Reserve Caucus. Mr. Palazzo worked to make sure that we offset those  things to make sure our Guard and reservists receive those same  benefits from when they were deployed.   So this is a rare opportunity, Madam Speaker, to pass a significant  piece of legislation that is fully paid for, compromised to in a  bipartisan manner. The Senate is going to pick this up, I think. And I  look forward to that day when President Trump, hopefully here towards  the end of summer or early fall, picks that pen up and signs this and  makes a difference in veterans' lives today and going forward.   So my thanks once again to the chairman and his leadership for  bringing together and building this coalition that made something that  many of us thought about for many years; we would like to have seen got  done. It is going to get done today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. Esty), my good friend and a stalwart supporter of  veterans, the ranking member of the Disability Assistance and Memorial  Affairs Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), the vice ranking member of the full Committee  on Veterans' Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the  Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan), my good friend, a member of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, and the voice of our Pacific Island  veterans.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna), a true supporter of veterans and new Member of  the House who came with a passion for veterans.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have left.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Tenney). The gentleman from Minnesota  has 9 minutes remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Once again, you heard from members of the committee, and Members of  this House about an important piece of legislation.   This past Saturday, I had the opportunity to meet with my hometown  Guard unit, the 2nd Battalion of the 135th Infantry, the Red Bull  Battalion. They came back from a mission in the Sinai.   When they left to go to the Sinai, because of the 12304(b) orders  that were in there, they were not eligible for certain benefits. The  entire time they were deployed, they continued to call and asked what  was happening on the bill. On Saturday, they had just returned, and I  was able to tell them that we were going to vote tonight, we were going  to move this thing, and that their questions had been responded to.   So, retroactively, we were able to get this back to 2013. There are  lots of good things in here that I think, as people spend a little more  time on this, they will see, smart stuff.   Generations of veterans have contributed to our country and bettered  themselves through the GI Bill. It is one of those things that a  grateful nation does, an earned benefit that has been improved with  time.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R.  3218, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 282. This is a commonsense  bill. It has received bipartisan support as it moved through the  committee. It simplifies the process for a spouse of a servicemember to  choose and change their State of residency for tax and voting purposes.   The bill is about removing additional headaches from servicemembers'  lives and doing right by them. There are enough issues being a member  of the military and for spouses and family. We don't need to add more  to it.   This is a smart piece of legislation. It does exactly what it says it  is going to do, and I support and encourage all Members to join me in  support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I again urge Members to support this smart  piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.  [[Page H6171]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 1058, as amended. The VA Provider Equity  Act is a commonsense solution to a really important problem that is  plaguing the VHA--a shortage of healthcare providers.   This legislation would allow VHA to attract the talented and  experienced podiatrists it needs to better treat conditions caused by  lower extremity injuries.   By allowing podiatrists the opportunity to advance within the VHA  while earning pay comparable to what private sector podiatrists earn,  VHA can better attract and retain these providers.   I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio, Dr. Wenstrup's, work  highlighting this, educating all of us on the committee, and making  sure that the treatments of podiatrists between VHA and the private  sector industry is aligned.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this good piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, this is a smart piece of legislation. I  thank the gentleman from Ohio for his work on this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1058, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2006, the VA Procurement  Efficiency and Transparency Act.   This legislation will require VA to record any costs or savings it  incurs as a result of using competitive procedures. The reporting  requirement is limited to contracts reported in the Federal procurement  data system and will ensure increased transparency in the VA.   It also requires VA to use standardized contracting templates  throughout the entire VA. This will create an efficient system for VA  contracting officers so they are not wasting man-hours developing  multiple documents to award VA contracts.   Anyone who has been a Member of Congress and has dealt with VA  contracts knows how difficult, confusing, and just, quite honestly,  frustrating this is. So having standardized forms will improve  oversight of these contracts so that all VA employees and contractors  follow the same requirements for the same type of contract.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this smart legislation,  efficiency in government, and help provide care in a more timely  manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its support, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Yes, Mr. Speaker, I was in the Lutheran hymnal and not the Baptist. I  apologize to the gentlewoman, and the next time I ask my 10-year-old to  not be on his phone, I will be duly chastised.   Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of H.R. 1690. The gentlewoman is  right. It is smart. The public demands transparency. Make sure that  there is an accountability in this, and make sure that we are tracking.   So I thank the gentlewoman for her tolerance of us getting ahead of  ourselves.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of  legislation also, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 1848, as amended, the Veterans Affairs  Medical Scribe Pilot Act of 2017, offered by Chairman Roe.   No one knows more about this, and I appreciate the chairman's  education that goes into learning about the practice of medicine.  Having a physician as the chairman is invaluable. This issue of scribes  and how it interfaces with the doctor providing the care and the  electronic medical record has been invaluable for me to understand.   I know that the chairman and many physicians have said they feel they  are spending too much time entering the data and not enough time on  patients. Chairman Roe's legislation would allow for the use of scribes  within the VA during a 2-year pilot program. It has been proven to  assist physicians and alleviate administrative burdens.   This is smart stuff, again. I appreciate the insight brought to us  and making more efficiencies in the system.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I feel so strongly about this, I am going to support it  again today. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2006, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this piece of legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this piece of legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2749, as amended, the  Protecting Business Opportunities for Veterans Act.   I thank General Bergman and Ms. Kuster of New Hampshire for  introducing this. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations has  worked hard to ensure that our service-disabled veteran-owned small  businesses are provided the protections and support they need from the  VA to remain competitive in the Federal contracting process.   Congress granted Federal Government contracting preferences to small  businesses owned by veterans and service-disabled veterans because we  want our veteran entrepreneurs to thrive.   This bill, introduced by Representatives Bergman and Kuster, closes a  loophole utilized by some that pass through contracts to non-veteran- owned businesses. This practice is unfair to the thousands of small- business owners who are actually serving and owned by service-disabled  veterans who play by the rules.   The bill ensures that only our veteran entrepreneurs get this  preference by closing the loophole. It is smart, it is the right thing  to do, and I urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this good piece of  legislation that is doing the right thing, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this good piece of  legislation that is doing the right thing, and I yield back the balance  of my time.

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2781. As said, the bill would  require the VA Secretary and the General Services Administration to  increase the number of veteran-owned small businesses and service- disabled veteran-owned small businesses on the Federal Strategic  Sourcing Initiative. The Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative  increases cost savings, value, and socioeconomic participation for the  sourcing of government contracts and ensures that our government has a  community of businesses to strategically source from.   Ensuring more veteran-owned small business and service-disabled  veteran-owned small businesses are on the Federal Strategic Sourcing  Initiative means that taxpayer dollars are spent on contracts that add  value to the U.S. Government, at the same time supporting veteran-owned  businesses--smart legislation, again, the right thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta), one of the coauthors of this bill and a  veteran himself and a champion of veterans since he has been in  Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. Again, I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 2781.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. Again, I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 2781.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
