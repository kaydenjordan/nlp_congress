 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay  tribute to a valued and long-standing member of my staff, Iyad  Shihadeh. After nearly 9 years of serving the people of California in  my San Francisco office, tomorrow will be Iyad's last day.   Iyad first joined my team in 2011 as a staff assistant and quickly  made an impression through his diligent efforts on behalf of the  Californians calling or visiting our office. Iyad was quickly promoted  to the position of constituent services representative, where he  managed as many as 200 casework requests simultaneously between the  Departments of State, Justice, and Homeland Security.   Iyad demonstrated an aptitude for problem solving on behalf of  individuals and organizations needing help navigating the Federal  bureaucracy. Additionally, Iyad took charge of the office's intern  program, guiding the dozens of students each year working in the San  Francisco office. Many of our former State interns and staff are  indebted to him for his thoughtful career advice as they made their  first forays into the field of public service.   In 2017, Iyad was promoted again to be the director of constituent  services,  [[Page S1070]]  in charge of a team of staff who receive, process, and advocate for the  casework needs of Californians seeking assistance from Federal  agencies. I have depended on Iyad's sound judgment, management  capabilities, and cool head in this critical function.   As all Senators know, your casework director needs to be a special  person. They represent you to constituents who are in need and often  have nowhere else to turn. I have been particularly lucky to have Iyad  in this role; he has performed with skill and with a deft personal  touch.   I am proud of our casework successes under Iyad's management in  recovering millions of dollars in benefits for those needing help with  Social Security checks, student loans, tax refunds, veterans' benefits,  and other payments from the Federal Government. He has worked on behalf  of countless constituents seeking visas or other immigration benefits.  When a constituent is in a foreign jail or has lost their passport  overseas, Iyad has been on the case, immediately, professionally, and  successfully.   I am particularly thankful for Iyad's help with Maria Mendoza, a  nurse from Oakland who is back in the United States with her children  after Iyad's work in securing an H1-B visa; also Maria Isabel Bueso, a  young woman from Guatemala who has lived in the United States for most  of her life in order to receive lifesaving medication, but who was  threatened last year with removal. Iyad worked with the family and with  Judiciary Committee staff, and now, Isabel has been given a stay from  deportation.   In addition to his casework efforts, Iyad has provided guidance in my  San Francisco office. His steady presence has been indispensable for  three State directors and four chiefs of staff.   Before joining my team, Iyad graduated from Purdue University with a  double major in history and political science in 2009. He received  academic honors, graduating in the top 10 percent of his class.  Following his lifelong passion of international issues, he dedicated  himself to his studies and wrote a dissertation titled, ``They Also  Served: The Untold Story of the Egyptian Labour Corps in World War  One.'' In 2010, he graduated from the London School of Economics, where  he received a master of science in the history of empires. His efforts  afforded him a deeper knowledge of economics and globalization, and  once again, he centered his academic curiosities on foreign affairs by  writing his thesis on ``Money, Arms, and Superpowers: British Foreign  Policy towards the War of Attrition.''   While I am sad to see him go, I am thrilled for Iyad's family as he  will join them in the day-to-day management of their restaurant in  south San Francisco. His energy, ideas, and ability to connect with  people will undoubtedly serve his family and community well for many  years to come. I am deeply grateful for the wisdom and dedication that  Iyad Shihadeh has brought to our office and his dedication on behalf of  the people of California. I thank Iyad and wish him all the best in his  future endeavors.                            ____________________
