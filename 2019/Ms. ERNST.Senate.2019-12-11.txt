 Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to SGM Derek  Gondek for his exemplary dedication to duty and service as an Army  congressional fellow and congressional budget liaison for the Assistant  Secretary of the Army, Financial Management and Comptroller. Sergeant  Major Gondek is retiring after 27 years of dedicated service to his  country and the U.S. Army.   A native of Lewiston, ME, Sergeant Major Gondek enlisted as an  infantry soldier in July 1992, attending infantry one station unit  training at Fort Benning, GA.   Sergeant Major Gondek has served in a broad range of assignments  during his Army career at all levels of command. Starting as a rifleman  with the 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment at Fort Polk, LA, Sergeant  Major Gondek led soldiers as a team leader, platoon sergeant, first  sergeant, and operations sergeant major across the Army. His highest  level of leadership was as a battalion command sergeant major of the  2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division at  Schofield Barracks, HI. He has also instructed at the Army's Jumpmaster  School and provided coaching to rotational units at the Army's Joint  Multinational Readiness Center in Hohenfels, Germany. Sergeant Major  Gondek has served forward deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan.   In 2017, Sergeant Major Gondek began his tenure with the U.S. Senate,  first as a Defense fellow and next in his subsequent assignment as a  congressional budget liaison for the U.S. Army. Sergeant Major Gondek  worked tirelessly with Members of Congress and their staffs to  accurately articulate the Army's budget positions to the Appropriations  Committees. His professionalism, diligence, and commitment to the  mission are unmatched, and his work both as a fellow and as a liaison  very effectively represented the U.S. Army and the Department of  Defense to the U.S. Congress.   The foundation of Derek's military success is his family. He is a  devoted husband to his wife Maura and committed father to his  daughters, Winnie, Ellie, and Zoey. Maura, Winne, Ellie and Zoey  provide the foundation for Derek's service. Their attitude of service,  sacrifice, and care for others permeates every organization and  activity they participate in. The Gondek family is truly an example of  servant leadership in the Army and the communities they engage.   Throughout his career, Sergeant Major Gondek has positively impacted  soldiers, peers, and superiors. Our country has benefited tremendously  from his extraordinary leadership, judgment, and passion. I join my  colleagues today in honoring his dedication to our Nation and  invaluable service to the U.S. Congress as an Army congressional  liaison.   It has been a genuine pleasure to have worked with SGM Derek Gondek  over the last 3 years. On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my  colleagues today in recognizing and commending Derek for his service to  our country, and we wish him all the best as he continues his service  in his future endeavors.
