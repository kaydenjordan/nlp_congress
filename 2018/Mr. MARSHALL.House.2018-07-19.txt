 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for introducing this  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this resolution. This anti- carbon tax resolution expresses the sense of Congress that a carbon tax  will be detrimental to the United States economy and certainly is not a  waste of anyone's time.   As a physician, typically, what I like to do is examine the risk and  benefit analysis of any treatment plan, and I apply that same standard  to a situation like this.                                time  0930    I want to know the risk and benefit of any new tax that might be  considered. A carbon tax would raise costs on everything Americans buy,  from electricity and gasoline to food and everyday household products,  with little or any benefit.   Mr. Speaker, when we introduce a new tax or consider a new tax, I  want to know who it would impact the most. Who I think this would  impact the most is that single mom I delivered about 10 years ago. She  has 2 children at home. She is working 60 hours a week. This is going  to impact her more than anybody else, because she is just trying to get  by with the income she is making.   This is going to drive the cost up for her children's school lunches.  It is going to drive the cost up for her gasoline to get to and from  work. That single mom will be impacted by this carbon tax.   This resolution will put Congress on record against a carbon tax,  which would result in massive job losses, lead to higher prices for  American families and small businesses, and jeopardize America's energy  security.   Mr. Speaker, this President and this Congress have been fighting for  American energy dominance, and a carbon tax would undermine that goal.  I am so proud of what my producers back home have done in the oil and  gas industry to have a cleaner product. What the refineries are doing  today compared to when I was growing up, a little boy in El Dorado,  Kansas, living between two refineries, I am proud of how the electrical  generation has improved ecologically as well.   This resolution will affirm the position of Congress that a carbon  tax  [[Page H6565]]  would counter the goals of American energy dominance, economic growth,  and national security.
