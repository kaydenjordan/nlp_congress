 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Newman for yielding.  It is a great honor to be here today under such somber circumstances.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Transgender Day of  Remembrance and Transgender Awareness Week. It is with a heavy heart  that I recognize that this has been the deadliest year on record for  our transgender sisters, brothers, and siblings. I want to share with  you the names of three individuals that we lost in my home State of  California. I grieve with the families, loved ones, and communities  that lost these young people far too early for no reason other than  hate.   Rayanna Pardo, age 26, was a beloved daughter and sister living in  East Los Angeles who left behind a family and community that loved her  deeply. She was lost in March of this year.   Natalia Smut, age 24, was a celebrated drag artist from Milpitas,  California. She gave captivating performances and had a courageous and  creative spirit, and she was described by those who knew her as a jewel  in her community. She was lost in April.   Poe Black, also known as Oliver Jackson and Legion, was an  indigenous, trans-masculine and two-spirit activist and artist. He was  a tireless advocate who used his social media platform to support  various social justice causes, including by documenting his transition  to educate and inspire his followers. He was lost in May.   Each of these young people leaves behind a network of family,  friends, and community upon which they have made an indelible  impression. I join their communities in honoring their light and legacy  and share in the grief that they were taken from the people who loved  them.   It is in remembrance of these three individuals that I say this:  Transgender Week of Awareness cannot only be about awareness. It also  must be about action.   We cannot pretend that the rhetoric heard here in this Chamber and in  statehouses across the country does not have a direct impact on the  lives of transgender people. This year, we have seen the introduction  of over 100 anti-trans bills in State legislatures, whipping up a moral  panic around the identities of adults and targeting children.   The dehumanizing debates over whether an individual should have  control over their own body, whether they should be allowed to compete  on the athletic field, whether they even exist, these arguments all  connect directly to the types of attacks that killed Rayanna, Natalia,  Poe Black, and so many more.   It is not enough to only recognize the devastating statistics. We  must also make policy decisions that recognize transgender people for  who they are.   Who are they? They are loved ones, community members, family members,  individuals who add depth and richness to our society and are defined  by far more than statistics, hatred, or bigotry.   So this Transgender Remembrance Day, remember those who were lost by  making noise. Raise your voice against the persistent and dangerous  misinformation about transgender identity. Raise your voice in  celebration of loved ones, friends, family, and community members who  are transgender.   Raise your voice to support the next generation of transgender and  nonbinary young people so that they may recognize the great beauty and  joy in their identity rather than living in fear or shame.                                time  1915    Now, we cannot bring those who have been lost back to their loved  ones, but we can play a role in ensuring that other friends, families,  and communities do not have to suffer a loss like Rayanna's, Natalia's  and Poe Black's communities did. So I call on my colleagues this year  to turn awareness into action because making policy that centers on  safety, equity, and prosperity for transgender people should not be an  effort that lasts only a week, but it should be all year round and  throughout the rest of our lives.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.
