 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman McGovern for creating  this opportunity for me to share a few remarks with you this evening.   For decades, we have failed to make the kinds of investments that  allow families to access equal opportunities and communities to thrive,  so I rise today in strong support of the Build Back Better Act to  deliver the urgent investments our country needs to thrive.   I have spent my career fighting for the dignity of safe and decent  homes for all. In 2019, I coined the phrase ``housing is  infrastructure.'' It hasn't been easy getting to this point, but I am  incredibly proud to discuss the more than $150 billion for housing  investments included in today's bill that will create or preserve over  1 million homes.   These investments include $65 billion to repair and rebuild our  Nation's public housing; $25 billion for new rental assistance to  support hundreds of thousands of people struggling to afford rent and  help people escape homelessness and domestic violence; $26 billion to  create and preserve hundreds of thousands of affordable and accessible  housing units; and $10 billion in downpayment assistance to make the  dream of homeownership possible for the millions of first-generation  home buyers.   Housing is at the heart of building back better.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``yes'' and help make safe,  decent, and affordable housing a reality for every family.                                time  2050
