 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  100-year legacy of Liberia, a historically Black neighborhood, rich  with culture, art, faith, strong families, and a rich legacy nestled in  the city of Hollywood, Florida.   This diverse community is filled with people of all backgrounds  today, but there was a time when Black residents were only afforded one  option: the Liberian neighborhood.   The Liberia name is fitting, as it represents freedom.   With this spirit of freedom imbued within the people, the community  was inhabited mostly by Black people from The Bahamas and the Southern  United States.   Through determination, faith, and resilience, the residents of  Liberia built a community with a strong foundation where they not only  could live but thrive.   Some of the early residents, such as Robert Mitchell and Henry Graham  and fourth-generation Liberia resident Commissioner Linda Hill  Anderson, were and are pioneers for progress for countless individuals  who emerged from Liberia to become successful professionals, elected  officials, athletes, artists, and role models.   I celebrate the perseverance and brilliance of this community today  and for generations to come.   I congratulate Liberia on 100 years. Here is to 100 more.                            ____________________
