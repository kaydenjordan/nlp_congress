 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today in support of the en bloc amendments and the Moving  Forward Act.   In the last few months, more than 47 million people in this country  filed for unemployment. They need our support. The Moving Forward Act  will help address our Nation's deteriorating infrastructure and will  help us transition to a clean energy economy while creating high- quality, good-paying jobs. My amendment will make meaningful  investments in our workforce through registered apprenticeships and  paid on-the-job training programs to fill those jobs.   Last year, I worked with Congressman Mitchell, Senator Kaine, and  Senator Portman to introduce the Building U.S. Infrastructure By  Leveraging Demands for Skills, or BUILDS, Act, to increase workforce  diversity in the transportation, infrastructure, and energy sectors.   My amendment includes language from this bill to provide individuals  who have historically faced barriers to employment, especially women  and people of color, with the support, services, and training they need  to succeed and to find better-paying jobs with preemployment services,  early employment support, and continuing employment services.   I thank Chairman DeFazio and Chairman Scott for their support and  leadership.   I urge my colleagues to support not only the en bloc amendments but  the underlying bill, as well.
