 Madam President, the Biden administration's reckless  policies have created chaos on our southern border, and further  mistakes from the Democrats are taking things from very bad to even  worse.   For more than 2 years now, President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas  have proven they are either incapable, unwilling, or uninterested in  defending and maintaining our borders. Illegal crossings at our  southern border have exploded under this administration--2.38 million  in fiscal year 2022 alone. And that is just the subset of people whom  the authorities actually found and stopped. It doesn't count the ones  who got away.   The vast majority of these crossers are single adults--not families,  not children but unaccompanied grownups.   Customs and Border Protection stopped 67 known terrorist suspects at  the southern border ports of entry last year alone, but they found 98  attempting to cross the border elsewhere--more than six times as many  as the previous year. As of March, authorities had already seized  nearly three times as much fentanyl this fiscal year as they had by  this time last year.   All of these terrible numbers have come with a stopgap pandemic  policy called title 42 actually in place. Every month of the Biden  Presidency, anywhere from 20 to 75 percent of the illegal crossers have  been turned right around and expelled, rather than apprehended and  processed in the typical way. But the Biden administration has failed  so badly that even with this stopgap in place, our border facilities  have still been overwhelmed and overrun.   Now, as the Democrats finally give up the COVID state of emergency,  title 42 is going away. That wouldn't pose a crisis for an  administration that was willing to get tough on its own and enforce  existing immigration law, but Democrats don't seem to be willing to do  that--just the opposite.   President Biden's team has designed a bizarre Rube Goldberg system  that amounts to a special concierge service to help even more illegal  immigrants come here more easily. It is a whole parallel system with  processing centers in foreign countries--not to make people come in our  front door but to help even more people surge in through the back door.  Now I understand there is even an official U.S. Government smartphone  app to help illegal immigrants along the journey--your taxpayer dollars  hard at work. Our colleague, the senior Senator from Missouri, has  correctly summarized the Democrats' plan as ``Ticketmaster for illegal  immigrants''--``Ticketmaster for illegal immigrants.'' Remember, things  are already at an unacceptable level before this new craziness.   According to one public report, the authorities are already  considering--listen to this--``street releases of migrants [into]  communities across [the] border if NGO shelters and CBP facilities do  not have the capacity to hold them . . . releases of migrants at bus  stops, gas stations, supermarkets, etc., in communities across the  border.''   Now, this week, some of our Democratic colleagues are feigning great  angst and indignation over title 42's demise. They claim to be outraged  that President Biden doesn't have a better plan. But every Senator had  a chance just last year to vote to keep funding title 42 measures.  Senate Republicans gave our Democratic colleagues that opportunity, and  every single Democrat voted in lockstep against it. Every Senate  Democrat voted in unison to let title 42 lapse with no better solution  in place. So the country reaps what Democrats sowed.                      National Defense Authorization Act    Mr. President, on another matter, the National Defense Authorization  Act is a must-pass piece of legislation, but Senate Democrats have  developed a bad habit of letting our national security actually  languish.   Last year, the 2023 NDAA spent 5 months in limbo. Even at the  eleventh hour, the Democratic leader refused to bring the Senate's own  bill to the floor. It took an informal conference between our  colleagues on the Armed Services Committee and their House counterparts  just to get this must-pass bill over the finish line.   Our Democratic friends like to invoke America's competition with  China whenever they are seeking to justify huge outlays of domestic  spending, but they push the nuts and bolts of actually defending  America to the back burner. Case in point: Chairman Reed just announced  the Armed Services Committee will wait an entire extra month before  beginning consideration of this year's NDAA. You can bet China isn't  waiting around and twiddling its thumbs, but apparently Leader  Schumer's Senate will do just that.   What would the Democratic majority have us do instead? Our colleagues  are making a push for a grab bag of left-of-center domestic priorities  they call another China bill.   Let's remember the last so-called China bill that we just passed last  year. The Commerce Secretary and other Biden administration officials  told us with great alarm that reshoring microchip production was a  hugely urgent national security priority. This was last year. Now, that  is a genuine bipartisan concern, and many of us Republicans actually  agreed. But since then, the administration's stated urgency has all but  disappeared.   President Biden's approach to implementing the law has been  atrocious--atrocious. They are violating congressional intent and  trying to attach extra strings to the microchip money to end run  liberal social policy through the private sector.   The Biden Commerce Department has tried to say that the semiconductor  companies can't get grants unless they tilt their hiring to benefit Big  Labor, unless they provide all kinds of free employment benefits to the  satisfaction of Washington bureaucrats--you get the picture. It reminds  me of a couple of months ago when Transportation Secretary Buttigieg  asserted that one important problem with building American  infrastructure is the racial and demographic composition of the  construction crews. For goodness' sake.   So Washington Democrats have spent trillions of dollars--trillions-- on a never-ending wish list of leftwing domestic priorities, heaping  historic inflation on the American economy, but not a penny of their  partisan bills built up our hard power.   If my colleagues were truly serious about competing with China, first  of all, they would prioritize the NDAA, not let it languish, and  second, Democrats would join Republicans in pushing for the strong,  commonsense policies that will actually help us build and make things.   So let's prioritize real, robust permitting reform--the Capito- Barrasso bills. Let's green-light domestic mining for our own critical  minerals and  [[Page S1612]]  reduce our dependence on Chinese supply chains. Let's unleash America's  abundant domestic energy reserves. Let's combat China's rampant  espionage and theft of high-tech research and intellectual property.   If our Democratic colleagues really want us to outcompete China, then  let's put first things first and stop using this issue as a Trojan  horse for unrelated liberal demands.
