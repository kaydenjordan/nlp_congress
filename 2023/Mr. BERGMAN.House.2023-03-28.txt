 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   H.R. 1 will unleash domestic energy production and reverse the Biden- led Democrat assault on American energy.   Democrat punitive policies have led to record-high gas prices,  limited supply, and unrelenting inflation. Folks back home in Michigan  are yearning for leadership that has been sorely  [[Page H1508]]  lacking in Washington these past couple of years.   H.R. 1 will streamline permitting, open up new markets to export  natural gas, and repeal billions in inflationary Green New Deal  giveaways. H.R. 1 will also protect the land we live on, the water we  drink, and the air we breathe.   Of great importance to me and my constituents is the provision  continuing the longstanding ban on drilling in our Great Lakes. As the  Representative for the district with the longest shoreline in the lower  48 States, including three of the five Great Lakes, I will continue to  fight and defend our Great Lakes for future generations.   As we talk energy, I live in the middle of copper country. As this  board shows, we need to control for our future the precious metals  necessary for what we do.
