 Thank you, sir.   I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself, Senators Crapo and  Graham, for the White House counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is from Senator Scott of South  Carolina and other Senators to the White House counsel:    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S674, January 29, 2020, third column, the following  appears: The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is from Senator SCOTT of  South Carolina and othet Senators to the White House counsel:      The online Record has been corrected to read: The CHIEF JUSTICE.  The question is from Senator SCOTT of South Carolina and other  Senators to the White House counsel:    ========================= END NOTE =========================            House managers claim that the Biden/Burisma affair has been       debunked. What agency within the government or independent       investigation led to the debunking?    Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate,  there is no evidence in the record about any investigation, let alone  debunked, shammed, discredited, or, as Manager Jeffries told you  tonight, phony.   The House managers haven't cited any evidence in the record because  none exists. A couple of days ago, I read to you a quote and statement  from Vice President Biden dealing with corruption in Ukraine. What I  didn't tell you was he made those statements before the Ukrainian  Parliament directly.   He spoke about the historic battle of corruption. He spoke about  fighting corruption, specifically in the energy sector. He spoke about  no sweetheart deals. He said oligarchs and nonoligarchs must play by  the same rules:         Corruption siphons away resources from the people. It       blunts economic growth, and it affronts the human dignity.    Those were Vice President Biden's words. So the real question is  this. Is corruption related to the energy sector in Ukraine run by a  corrupt Ukrainian oligarch who is paying our Vice President's son and  his son's business partner millions of dollars for no apparent  [[Page S675]]  legitimate reason while his father was overseeing our country's  relationship with Ukraine merit any public inquiry, investigation, or  interest? The answer is yes.   Simply saying it didn't happen is ridiculous. With all due respect to  the House managers and citing to our children, the message to our  children, especially when you oversee a corruption in trying to root it  out in another country, is to make sure your children aren't benefiting  from it. That is what should be happening--not to sit there and say  that it is OK.   The House managers don't deny that there is a legitimate reason to do  an investigation. They just say it was debunked; it is a sham; it is  delegitimate; but they don't tell you when it happened.   We all remember the email that Chris Heinz sent. Keep this in mind.  He is the stepson of the then-Secretary of State, John Kerry. He sends  an official email to the State Department, to the chief of staff to  John Kerry, and special assistant. The subject is Ukraine. There is no  question when you look at that email that it is a warning shot to say:  I don't know what they are doing, but we are not invested in it.   He is taking a giant step back.   Think about the words, and remember the video that we saw about  Hunter Biden. What did he say? I am not going to ``open my kimono''--I  am not going to ``open my kimono''--when he was asked how much money he  was making. In one month--in one month alone--Hunter Biden and his  partner made almost as much as every Senator and Congressman--just in  one month alone--what you earn in a year. And you don't think that  merits inquiry?   Does anyone here think, when they say it is a debunked investigation  that didn't happen, that we wouldn't remember if there was testimony of  Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, his stepson,  their business partner, his chief of staff, and special assistant? How  can you tell the American people it doesn't merit inquiry when our Vice  President's son is supposedly doing this for corporate transparency in  Ukraine? He is going to oversee the legal department of a Ukrainian  company; he is going to help them.   And if you look at his statement that I read to you beforehand, there  is another part of it from October 2019. If you want to know whether he  thought it dealt with outside of Ukraine in just Burisma--he said he  was ``advising Burisma on its corporate reform initiatives, an  important aspect of fueling Burisma's international growth and  diversity.''   Listen to this statement by Hunter Biden's attorney: ``Vibrant energy  production, particularly natural gas, was central to Ukraine's  independence and to stemming the tide of Vladimir Putin's attack on the  principles of a democratic Europe.''   Do you think he understood, when he was getting the millions of  dollars, what his father was doing? The only problem is, that statement  didn't come out until October of 2019. Only when the news stories  started to break, only when the House managers raised these issues, did  people start to talk about it.   Tell us where we saw Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and John Kerry testify  about it. Tell us where you did it when you did your impeachment  hearings. I don't remember seeing that testimony. I don't remember  seeing the bank records. We put the bank records in front of you. The  people are entitled to know exactly what was going on.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Oregon.
