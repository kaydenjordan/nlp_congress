 Mr. Speaker, when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act  in 2010, President Obama made a famous promise: that the American  people would be able to keep the plans they liked while paying less for  health insurance. But, Mr. Speaker, that famous promise was false, and  ObamaCare's consequences are still being felt to this day.   Over the preceding decade, premiums for individual coverage have more  than doubled, patient choice has declined, and State exchanges have  collapsed. This upheaval is a direct result of the law's rigid and  costly regulations that predated the Trump administration.   In order to bring down costs and increase choice, today I introduced  the Flexibility Through Lower Expenses Healthcare Act, or the FLEX Act.   The FLEX Act codifies into law the Trump administration's rules on  short term, limited duration, and association healthcare plans. This  will allow small businesses to band together to purchase affordable  plans and give consumers the freedom to purchase low-cost, short-term  plans if they need to.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to follow the Trump  administration's lead and make these rules permanent. All citizens of  our great country deserve affordable health insurance options that are  free from ObamaCare's crippling regulatory regime.                            ____________________
