 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3971.   Contrary to what is implied by its title, H.R. 3971 would not provide  regulatory relief to community banks. Instead, this bill would allow a  large number of mortgage services to drop important consumer  protections and set the stage for a return of the harmful practices of  the subprime meltdown and the worst financial crisis since the Great  Depression.   Dodd-Frank tasked the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with  implementing mortgage rules under the Truth in Lending Act that would  restrict the types of practices that led to the financial crisis. This  bill would harm consumers by raising the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau's exemption threshold on escrow accounts requirements for higher  priced mortgage loans. Mortgages are classified as higher priced if the  annual percentage rate--or APR--exceeds the average prime offer rate by  1.5 percent, and higher priced mortgage loans often reflect riskier or  subprime borrowers.   Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau issued escrow rules that require borrowers with higher priced  mortgage loans to escrow their homeowners insurance, property taxes,  and private mortgage insurance for at least the first 5 years of their  mortgage.   Escrow accounts are an important consumer protection mechanism,  especially for higher risk borrowers, because they ensure that  homeowners have funds for these expenses, thereby reducing mortgage  default or loss of the property. In fact, before the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau issued its final rule on escrow requirements in 2013,  a Federal Reserve study from 2011 found that consumers with higher  priced mortgages that did not have an escrow account in the first year  after the consummation of their mortgage had higher instances of  default.   Escrow accounts also keep homeowners from being blindsided by  additional costs at the end of each year and provide a more accurate  monthly cost estimate for homeownership when the loan is originated.  That is why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rules  are designed to ensure that homeowners understand and can meet the full  cost of homeownership.    Even though escrow accounts are particularly important for these  higher priced loans, they are certainly not unique. In fact, most  homeowners escrow these funds. Loans insured by the Federal Housing  Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture must have  borrower escrow accounts, and conventional mortgages with a loan-to- value ratio of 80 percent or higher require them as well.   I have not heard a single convincing argument as to what is so  burdensome about banks with $25 billion in assets ensuring that their  borrowers have enough money set aside every month to pay their taxes  and insurance.   Furthermore, banks with less than $2 billion in assets that serve  rural or underserved areas are already exempt from the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau's escrow requirements, which reflects the  Bureau's commitment to balanced and tailored regulations. This bill  would make a dramatic leap from the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau's targeted relief and exempt banks up to $25 billion in assets,  or over 98 percent of banks, from the escrow requirement. They would  get this exemption regardless of whether they are serving underserved  borrowers and without any evidence that this large exemption would  increase access to credit for those who need it.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also addressed the fact that  large servicers, especially servicers that serviced loans they did not  own for an extended period of time, often did not adequately  communicate with customers or appropriately track paperwork. During the  crisis, this contributed to millions of unnecessary foreclosures and,  later on, several billion-dollar settlements for abusive and fraudulent  business practices.   In its rule, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also provides  other flexibilities through exemptions to the Real Estate Settlement  Procedures Act loan servicing and escrow account administration  requirements to only small bank servicers, if they and their affiliates  own the loans they service, and service no more than 5,000 loans each  year. H.R. 3971 would increase this exemption by 500 percent, from  5,000 loans a year to 30,000 loans, allowing significantly larger bank  servicers to avoid these important consumer safeguards, and only  requiring the lenders to hold the loans in portfolio for 3 years.                                time  1230    So let's be clear, homeowners do not get to choose their own mortgage  servicer, and the least we can do is ensure that they are adequately  protected after they sign on the dotted line.   As we saw leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, servicers often  choose profits over people, and that is why we need the Consumer Bureau  to look out for the needs of consumers. The Consumer Bureau has  continued to do its job in spite of the unrelenting Republican campaign  to slow it down or eliminate it completely.   Simply put, H.R. 3971 would enable larger servicers, whose incentives  are not aligned with the owners of the loans or the borrowers, to be  able to revive the abusive practices involved with predatory lending  that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. This is the second time  in less than 2 weeks that I have come before you to discuss a bill that  would erode vital consumer protections under the Truth in Lending Act  for borrowers with high-priced mortgage loans.   I cannot support legislation that would keep consumers looking at  high-cost mortgages from the vital protections and scrutiny they  deserve. For all these reasons, I oppose H.R. 3971.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.    Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for us to realize that, in  present law, community banks of $2 billion or less are exempted from  requiring escrow accounts on higher priced loans if they serve rural  and underserved areas. So we are talking about present law that gives  this exemption. And not only does it exempt these real community banks  of $2 billion or less, the banks are required to serve rural  communities and underserved areas.   This is so important because, oftentimes, these are loans to riskier  customers. These are loans where they are charging a higher interest  rate. These are loans where they are taking more risk, and so when we  hear those on the opposite side of the aisle talking about different  ways to service the rural communities, this is one way that the law  allows that kind of attention to rural communities and underserved  areas. They say: Small community banks, you don't have to have escrow  accounts, and so what we are saying to you is give your attention to  these rural and underserved areas where they are higher priced loans,  they are riskier accounts, and we are not going to require you to have  to force upon these kinds of accounts the rules that will be forced  upon different kinds of financial institutions.   If we adopt this bill, it would not be about community banks at all.  And I have to disagree with my chairman of the committee who talked  about this, in some way, enhancing community banks' ability to service  rural and underserved areas. They are talking about expanding the  exemption from $2 billion or less to $25 billion. That is not a  community bank. We don't have any community banks that are worth $25  billion or more. I want everybody to be clear what this bill is  attempting to do.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to further explain what this  bill would do and why it could be harmful.   Under the present law, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act  would require that the servicers handle no more than 5,000 or less  loans. Why is this important? It is important because when you have  servicers that are handling a relatively small number of these kinds of  accounts, they can pay attention to them.    Don't forget, these are loans by community banks. They are riskier,  they are higher priced loans, they are directed toward rural  communities and communities that basically you have to pay a lot of  attention to when you give out these loans. And now this bill would  say: Yes, we know that when you are servicing a small number, 5,000 or  less, that the services have to pay attention because they are under  the rule of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and that act  says not only do you have to pay attention and you have to contact your  borrower when you are going to transfer the loan--and let me tell you  how important this is.   This is so important because when you transfer a loan, if you don't  give the kind of notification to the borrower that they will understand  that the originator of the loan no longer has the servicing or has the  same servicing contract that is now going to move to another servicer,  then people, oftentimes, end up not sending their payment to the right  place. And guess what, I have seen this go on for months, and then  people end up in a situation where they are defaulting on the loan, and  the new servicers are putting them in a position where now their homes  are in danger.                                time  1245    So this contact, this oversight, this attention that you pay to these  small borrowers is so important, and that is why the 5,000.   Now, with this bill, they want to take it up to 30,000. What does  that mean? It means that we are going to see the kind of problems that  we have seen in the subprime meltdown that we have gone through.   We have found that servicers caused us the most problems. Of course,  they didn't service the loans adequately. They lost them. They had  people applying over and over again.   First of all, we discovered that many of the servicers had no  training, that they were literally hired off the street, and that they  were basically saying to senior citizens, 75 and 80 years old: We lost  your paper. Reapply again. Reapply again. We are sorry.   It has been just an awful situation that was created because the  servicers could not handle the volume that they were contracted with,  oftentimes, for the financial institution that they were supposed to be  doing this work for.   So, here you have a bill that literally is not about community banks.  This is about increasing the number of banks that can now have the kind  of protection that we were giving to the very small community banks. So  don't believe this is about community banks.   In addition to that, what you are doing is you are changing the rules  and the laws under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act that  protects these rural borrowers and these small, high-risk loans that  are in these communities that need a special kind of help.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   It is important to understand why we have a Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau and why it is the centerpiece of the Dodd-Frank  reforms.   Prior to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, we did not have  anybody looking out for consumers, and so that led us into the crisis  that this country experienced in 2008 that took us into a recession and  almost a depression.   When I come before you with opposition to this kind of legislation,  it is because I know and understand--and we should all understand--what  we can do to protect our consumers and how we can work with community  banks and what that means when we are talking about a bill like this,  where real community banks of $2 billion or less are dealing with  populations that I have alluded to over and over again in the  presentation of my opposition to this bill: the rural communities and  those communities that are underserved and where these are riskier  loans and where they need not only the attention of the small community  banks, but the servicers who service these loans, and knowing that the  servicers who service a small number of loans can, in fact, pay the  attention to them that is required by RESPA and make sure that the  people are understanding, when there are transfers and they are in  contact with them constantly--and this goes for everything from  transfers to modifications--and how to deal with high-risk loans, who  may need to modify those loans, who they would talk to, how they would  talk to them.   I want to tell you, if you expand this, and you have servicers that  are handling 30,000 or more, these borrowers are not going to get this  kind of attention. So these escrows that we are talking about are  extremely important, and we should know exactly who we are protecting  and who we are not protecting.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I am paying special attention to this legislation, and I take pause  when I see bills like H.R. 3971 that are just a small part of  Republicans' relentless attack on the work of the Consumer Bureau.   The Consumer Bureau's work on high-cost loans and consumer  protections for them was well thought through and the result of careful  research.   Leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, many looking to fulfill the  American Dream and purchase a house were convinced to take out higher  cost loans without any regard for their ability to repay. They were  sold false promises about the costs of their mortgage without adequate  information and protections.   The Consumer Bureau took years to talk to experts, hear from  advocates, and do the research to come up with a strong rule to prevent  those types of abuses from occurring again, while also providing  regulatory relief to banks that serve rural and underserved  communities. So let me take pause and, again, focus everyone on rural  and underserved communities.   I am oftentimes appalled by the fact that we have too many  legislators who represent rural communities and underserved  communities, but when it comes to looking out for their financial  interests, they are not doing it. Yet they go back to these communities  and they talk about all the other kinds of issues. They talk about  people who are not saluting the flag properly. They will talk about  freedom of choice issues, and they will rally folks around everything  except their financial interests.                                time  1300    If rural communities are being hurt, oftentimes it is because the  very people who say they represent them are  [[Page H9804]]  not, indeed, representing them, and we can see this in this kind of  discussion.   So, again, we are focused on making sure that rural and underserved  communities are served properly, that they are not thrown to the wolves  and thrown into situations where they can't be paid attention to after  they take out these loans.   When they take out these loans, they need servicers who are trained,  servicers who are committed, servicers who understand why rural and  underserved communities need special protection, and who will work with  them, who will contact them, who will work with them to work out  situations where loan modifications may be required or requested.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to continue to oppose. I understand that  there are others who would like to open this up, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time I have left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's regulations  address many questionable practices that contributed to the collapse of  the housing market. Such practices were widespread in the mortgage  servicing industry. The Bureau's servicing rules apply across the  board, while providing a narrow exemption for small servicers.   This exemption minimizes the regulatory compliance burden on small  and community banks. Expanding current exemptions to larger  institutions, however, just opens the door wide to abuses by larger  banks primarily doing business not in the communities, the rural  [[Page H9805]]  communities and the underserved communities, but outside of the  communities where they are based, and by nonbanks, which still make  most of the riskier subprime mortgage loans.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to ask opposition to this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire again as  to how much time I have left.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to move now to say a word about what my colleague  is attempting to do. I appreciate my colleague from California (Mr.  Sherman), who is going to offer an amendment that would lower the  extremely high exemption thresholds in the underlying bill.   I think that, having talked to him, I do understand that he believes  that this is important to expand opportunity rather than to limit the  ability for protection for certain of our consumers who come from these  areas that I have described as rural and areas that are underserved.   This amendment that he is going to present would allow creditors,  again, with less than $10 billion in assets, to be exempted from escrow  requirements on higher priced mortgage loans if they hold loans in  portfolios for 3 years and allow servicers that service 20,000 loans or  less to be exempted from enhanced consumer protection requirements  under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.   His amendment changes it a little bit from $25 billion to $10  billion, that is still too much, and from 30,000 loans or less to  20,000 loans or less to be exempted from, again, enhanced consumer  protection requirements under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures  Act.   Although I am pleased that this amendment would tighten up the  language in the underlying bill somewhat, I remain concerned about the  impacts it could have on many consumers. The bill is called the  Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act of 2017, and the title  implies that it will relieve our Nation's smaller financial  institutions from regulatory burdens.   Now, we all know that community banking is not purely a function of  size, but when the Consumer Bureau conducted research for its escrow  requirements rulemaking, it found that none of the entities it  identified as operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas had  total assets as of the end of 2009 greater than $2 billion.                                time  1315    And when the Consumer Bureau researched mortgage service and  practices, it concluded: ``The problematic practices that have plagued  the servicing industry, particularly in recent years, are, to a large  extent, a function of a business model in which servicing is viewed as  a discrete line of business and profit center.''   However, they also found that approximately 96 percent of community  bank and small credit union services that only purchase a hold,  mortgage service, and rights for mortgage loans, they actually own or  originate service 5,000 or fewer loans. Yet this amendment would exceed  the Consumer Bureau's research base that sets that threshold by  billions of dollars and its carefully researched loan service and  threshold by 400 percent.   So if the amendment is adopted, I must continue to oppose the bill  because it would undermine the work of the Consumer Bureau and weaken  consumer protections in homeownership. Congress should not be complicit  in these acts by passing legislation that further erodes the rights and  protections of America's consumers. We must continue to do all that we  can to ensure mortgage loan borrowers are fully aware of the terms and  conditions of their mortgage loans and how much they will owe in  obtaining these loans.   If we are successful in convincing our colleagues today that they  should not support this bill, I will be happy to work with my  colleague, who I know has good intentions, to see what we can do to  address what I think are some of his concerns. But for now, I must  oppose the bill, and even with the amendment, it does not satisfy the  concerns that I have addressed here. It does nothing to protect those  in the rural communities and the underserved communities, and it does  nothing to help community banks.   So I am opposed both to the bill and to the amendment, and I ask for  a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
