 Mr. Speaker, on Friday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller  handed down the most significant hacking indictment targeting a foreign  power in history. Director Mueller alleges that 12 Russian military  officers were responsible for breaking into political organizations,  stealing sensitive documents, and disseminating them to undermine faith  in American democracy. Friday's indictment will further shape the norms  of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, and demonstrates our  commitment to holding malicious actors accountable.   Yet, today, Mr. Speaker, not 3 days later, President Trump said he  didn't see any reason to think that Russia carried out the election  meddling.   Well, the President set it up as whether you believe U.S.  intelligence and law enforcement agencies or Russia. However, this  isn't a matter of belief, this is matter of fact; and the facts say the  Russian government hacked us.   I hope that the President will finally acknowledge this, and I pray  that my Republican colleagues will hold him accountable if he doesn't.  And I thank Director Mueller for his ongoing work.                            ____________________
