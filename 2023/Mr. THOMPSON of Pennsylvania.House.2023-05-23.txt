 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Centre County's own Marisa Vicere who was named the Youth  Mental Health First Aid Instructor of the Year, an award that she  received for her efforts to support mental health and well-being in her  home State of Pennsylvania.   Each May, we observe Mental Health Awareness Month to acknowledge the  mental health challenges faced by millions of Americans.   For Marisa, every day is committed to mental health awareness and  support. In 2012, Marisa founded the Jana Marie Foundation and has  ``devoted its energy to opening minds and saving lives through  educational programming and community mobilization to empower young  people in the Centre County region.''   Marisa started the foundation after her sister, Jana Marie Vicere,  tragically lost her life in a battle against depression at the young  age of 30.   Marisa honors her memory by continuing her sister's commitment to  helping others and through creative expression in the arts.   In addition to her national award, she will soon be inducted as one  of this year's outstanding State College alumni.   I commend Marisa Vicere for winning the 2023 Youth Mental Health  First Aid Instructor of the Year and for her selfless service to the  Centre County community through the Jana Marie Foundation.                            ____________________
