 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bill Theiss from  Jackson Township in Ohio's 13th Congressional District.   Bill was recently named Stark County 2023 Military Veteran of the  Year by the Greater Canton Veterans Council.   As we head into Veterans Day, I am honored to celebrate Bill as one  of our community's selfless, brave heroes who has served our Nation.   For Bill, service to our Nation and protecting democracy is a family  tradition. Two of his brothers and his father also served our Nation.   Fifty-seven years ago, Bill received his military draft notice, going  on to serve two tours overseas in the Vietnam war as an officer in the  United States Army from 1966 to 1970.   Now, Bill is a leader in the Stark County veteran community, where he  volunteers to plan social events and works to assist homeless veterans.   Serving our Nation is an enormous sacrifice, but for Bill, his  service didn't end with his military career.   Madam Speaker, I thank Bill for his lifetime of service to our  country and for protecting our freedoms, and I congratulate him on  being Stark County Military Veteran of the Year.                            ____________________
