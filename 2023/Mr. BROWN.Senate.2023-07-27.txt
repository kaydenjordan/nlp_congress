 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the  board, staff, and supporters of Growing Hope Globally as they celebrate  their commitment to putting their Christian faith into practice by  helping end hunger globally.   Every day, Growing Hope Globally implements grassroots solutions to  hunger that link rural communities in the U.S. with smallholder farmers  in developing countries. Specifically, farmers in the United States  tithe a portion of their crops to combatting global hunger. Their work  makes a difference for so many people, both in the United States and  around the world.   This small nonprofit with big ambitions began with the compassion of  two Ohio farmers and their friends who wanted to put their faith into  action and help build a better world. Over the past 25 years, Growing  Hope Globally has expanded from just one project in Stryker, OH,  started by Vernon and Carol Sloan, to supporting projects in 21  different States that have served more than 2.2 million people. Vernon  and Carol's idea was simple but powerful: fund agricultural development  programs that support small farmers and rural communities through  grassroots farmer-to-farmer assistance.   I am inspired by the farmers in Ohio and across the Nation who invest  their profits in agricultural development projects that support small  farmers in countries facing hunger and food insecurity. Just last year,  Growing Hope Globally hosted 130 U.S. projects. They oversaw 47  agricultural development programs in 30 countries, and they helped more  than 200,000 people find lasting solutions to hunger.   I am sure my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating Growing Hope  Globally's 25-year journey. I look forward to supporting this important  organization, and seeing all you will accomplish in the next 25  years.                            ____________________
