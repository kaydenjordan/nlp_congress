 Mr. President, this place fancies itself the world's  greatest deliberative body, but we would be deceiving ourselves if we  ignored the biggest debate that has been happening in America over the  last 36 hours.   A publicly elected official--Governor of one of the 50 States--has  been defending a practice that is morally repugnant. The Governor of  Virginia has been defending a practice that is repugnant to civilized  people across the entire world.   Here is just one of the ugly nuggets from Ralph Northam, the Governor  of Virginia: ``If the mother is in labor . . . the infant would be  delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be  resuscitated (if that's what the mother and the family desired) and  then a discussion would ensue between the physician and the mother.''   Let's be very clear about what we are talking about. We are talking  about fourth-trimester abortion or what anyone in the normal world  calls infanticide. That is what we are talking about, and the Governor  of Virginia has been defending this all day yesterday and again today,  going out and trying to equivocate and qualify and then double down and  again say he wants to defend this practice, which is infanticide.   Let's be clear about what we are talking about. We are talking about  killing a baby who has been born. We are not talking some euphemism. We  are not talking about a clump of cells. We are talking about a little  baby girl who has been born and is on a table in a hospital or a  medical facility, and then a decision or a debate would be had about  whether you could kill that little baby. We are talking about the most  vulnerable among us, and we have a public official in America out there  again and again defending this practice. This is infanticide that we  are talking about.   This should be so far beyond any political consideration. We are  talking about a little baby--a baby with dignity, an image bearer. We  are talking about a tiny life that has done nothing wrong to warrant  being left to die cold and alone on a table.   Everyone in the Senate ought to be able to say unequivocally that  killing that little baby is wrong. This doesn't take any political  courage, and if you can't say that, if there is a Member in this body  who can't say that, there may be lots of work you can do in the world,  but you shouldn't be here. You should get the heck out of any calling  in public life where you pretend to care about the most vulnerable  among us. There should be no politics here that are right versus left  or Republican versus Democrat. This is the most basic thing you could  be talking about. We are talking about a little baby born alive, and we  have a public official in America defending the idea: Well, you could  have a debate about killing her.   That is why today I am starting a dual-track legislative process to  make sure this body has a clear-eyed look at the issue before us, has a  clear-eyed look at this atrocity, and to make sure the 320 million men  and women who are actually our bosses--to be sure  [[Page S794]]  they have a clear-eyed look at what we stand for. Do we stand with  those little, vulnerable babies in desperate need of care and comfort  and support, medical treatment, food, or do we stand with the comments  of the Governor of Virginia over the last 2 days?   Tonight, I am beginning what is known as the rule XIV process. That  is an expedited procedure for floor consideration of my legislation,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   In addition, I want to announce that on Monday night, I am going to  be sure that every Senator has the opportunity to come to the floor and  say whom we stand for and what we stand against. So I want to announce  that in addition to the rule XIV process that I am going to initiate in  a moment, I also want Senators to be aware that on Monday evening, I am  going to be asking unanimous consent for Senators to come to the floor  and pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act legislation.  I am going to ask all 100 Senators to come to the floor and be against  infanticide. This shouldn't be complicated.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk,  and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading and in order  to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I  object to my own request.    Thank you. I look forward to the debate in this body on  Monday evening.
