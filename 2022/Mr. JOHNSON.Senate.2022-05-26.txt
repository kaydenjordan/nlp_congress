 Mr. President, let me first also express my condolences  and associate myself with the comments of the Senator from Texas. The  tragedy is horrific. It is hard to think of anything more awful than  what happened in Texas and in other schools over the last few years.                                 Asylum Rule    Mr. President, I come to the floor today for another reason--in  support of using the Congressional Review Act to disapprove of and  prevent the implementation of a rule titled Procedures for Credible  Fear Screening and Consideration of Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and  CAT Protection Claims by Asylum Officers. I will refer to this rule as  the ``asylum rule'' to make it a little bit simpler. As the title  suggests, there is an awful lot to this, but the reason we ought to  disapprove of it is actually quite simple.   This rule will go into effect at the end of this month, on May 31. On  May 31, what this new rule will do is it will allow the USCIS, asylum  officers, to begin granting asylum without review by an immigration  court.   It is important to note that section 240 of the Immigration and  Nationality Act, which governs removal proceedings, states:       [a]n immigration judge shall conduct proceedings for deciding       the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien.    Now, an immigration court is an adjudicative court. It is a separate  unit of government from a USCIS officer, who is within the Department  of Homeland Security in the executive branch. It is a check and balance  on executive action. It is a very necessary check and balance on an  executive who is not faithfully executing the laws, as we have today  with President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas.   On May 1 of this year, news reporter Bret Baier asked Secretary  Mayorkas in an interview:         Is it the objective of the Biden administration to sharply       reduce the total number of illegal immigrants coming across       the southern border?    The obvious answer to Bret Baier's question is, That is the goal--to  reduce the flow of people coming into this country illegally.   That ought to be every administration's goal. That is what a  President and an administration would do if they were faithfully  executing the laws; but listen to Secretary Mayorkas's reply, his  answer.   Secretary Mayorkas stated: ``It is the objective of the Biden  administration to make sure that we have safe, orderly, and legal  pathways for individuals to be able to access our legal system.''  [[Page S2720]]    I first must note that our legal system is horribly broken. It is  that legal system that has produced this result. Now, I don't expect  the viewers to look at and to be able to see everything on this chart,  but you can go to my website and download this, and you will see the  cause and effect of various directives, of various rules, of various  regulations, and of various court orders and proceedings to cause this  explosion--this out-of-control flow--of illegal immigration.   By the way, it all started back in 2009 when then-ICE Director Morton  issued a directive directly contravening the plain language of the law  that required detaining individuals whose asylum claim was being  adjudicated. So we stopped detaining them.   Then, of course, in June 2012, President Obama, through his DHS  Secretary, created the DACA memorandum, which was an open invitation to  unaccompanied children coming to this country because they knew that,  once they got here, they would be able to stay.   If you take a look at the history here, the gold represents single  adults coming into this country illegally and being apprehended. This  is on a monthly basis. Blue is family units exploiting our very broken  asylum system, where the credible fear standard gives you a free pass  into the country. Red represents unaccompanied children.   It is important to note that back in 2014, when President Obama  declared it a humanitarian crisis, about 2,000 people were being  apprehended at the border on a daily basis--2,000. Now, again, because  of different policy choices, the word gets out--and because of  different court decisions--and people in Central America and throughout  the world realize that we are not following our asylum laws. We have a  virtually open border. We are engaging in ``catch and release.''   So President Trump had to deal with a surge in 2019 of more than  4,000 people per day in a given month, and you can see that surge here.  But President Trump took action. He engaged. He implemented the Return  to Mexico policy. He made agreements with the Central American  countries and Mexico, and we pretty well stopped the flow of  unaccompanied children and family units. We actually reduced the flow  of single adults who were exploiting our broken immigration system.   Then, during the Presidential debates, Democratic candidates,  including President Biden, declared to the world that they weren't  going to deport people; they were going to offer people who were coming  into this country illegally free healthcare.   You can see, even during 2020, as we were building the walls--and we  had the Return to Mexico policy in place--that single adults realized  there might be a change in policy, and they started flooding our  border. If you will notice, we went from, on average over about 10  years, about 30,000 single adults per month coming into this country to  the last 2 months, when it has been over 150,000 or closer to 160,000,  170,000 single adults. Throw on top of that, at almost the minute that  President Biden came into office and dismantled those successful  programs, we then had a new flood, a new surge, of family units in blue  and unaccompanied children flooding our border and exploiting our  asylum laws.   This new rule that is about to take effect at the end of this month,  the asylum rule, again, circumvents, is contrary to stated law that  says immigration judges, immigration courts, need to make that asylum  determination, not members of the administration, not USCIS officers.   What this rule does is it gives that power to grant asylum--an  awesome power that Congress never meant to give to the administration-- to USCIS officers and only allows a judge to take a look at it if the  asylum claim is denied by the USCIS officer. This isn't going to do  anything to reduce the backlog. What this will do is this increase the  flow. This is another signal throughout the world that we have an open  border policy.   The only restraint right now is title 42, and this administration is  working actively to overturn a court order that says you must keep  title 42 restrictions in place. And if the USCIS officer isn't as  generous as we fear they all will be and actually denies asylum, you  are right back there in immigration courts. So the only purpose of this  rule is to increase the flow, to accomplish Secretary Mayorkas's stated  goal of making sure we have a safe, orderly, and legal pathway for  individuals to access our legal system. In other words, this  administration's policy on the border isn't to secure it, isn't to  reduce the flow; it is to make the processing and dispersing of illegal  immigrants more efficient so more will come.    Last year, one and a quarter million people either encountered and  dispersed or came in as known ``got-aways,'' came to this country  illegally and were dispersed. That is a number that is larger than the  population of eight States. That is how out of control this crisis is.  Yet Secretary Mayorkas won't even call it a problem, much less a  crisis.   So it is obvious how harmful this rule is to our Nation and to our  national security. An open border is a national security threat.   I urge my colleagues to join me in using the Congressional Review Act  to disapprove of this rule and prevent its implementation.   With that, I yield the floor.                                   H.R. 350
