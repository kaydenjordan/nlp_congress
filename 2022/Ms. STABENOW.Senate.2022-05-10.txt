 Madam President, I rise today to honor and remember the  veterans throughout Michigan's history who have given their lives on  behalf of our country.   Even before Michigan was a State, these brave patriots have been  willing to risk everything--even their lives--in order to defend our  Nation, our people, and our way of life.   Perhaps the stakes were never higher than in World War II.  Totalitarianism threatened free countries and free people, echoes of  which we are tragically seeing today in Ukraine. Americans--and  Michiganders--would not stand by and watch democracy die.   We planted victory gardens. We purchased war bonds. And we built an  Arsenal of Democracy strong enough to defeat dictators and defend  freedom around the world.   More than half a million Michigan men and women served in our Armed  Forces. For more than 15,000 of them, it was the last thing they ever  did.   We can never repay them for their sacrifice. But we can remember  them, honor them, and share their stories.   That is the aim of the Michigan World War II Legacy Memorial in Royal  Oak. Ground was broken for this special place just last month.   The memorial will feature statues representing life on the  battlefront and the homefront. A series of pillars will stand for  Michigan's contributions to the war. A brick walkway will tell the  stories of those who fought and sacrificed. And a wall of stars will  commemorate the lives that were lost.   Each one of the 1,300 stars will represent more than 10 Michigan men  and women who gave their lives for our country. One of those stars  shines for Pfc. Walter Wetzel of Roseville.   On the morning of April 3, 1945, Pfc. Wetzel was guarding his  platoon's command post when it came under fire. German troops fought  their way close to the building and threw two grenades into the room  Pfc. Wetzel was defending alongside his fellow soldiers. Pfc. Wetzel  shouted a warning and threw himself on top of the grenades, sacrificing  his own life so that others could fight on.   For this supreme act of bravery, Pfc. Wetzel was awarded the Medal of  Honor, which is now on display at the Michigan Heroes Museum in  Frankenmuth.   Pfc. Wetzel deserves to be remembered, as does everyone who laid down  their lives for our country. It is incredibly fitting that Michigan  would honor their sacrifice in such a lasting way.   This Memorial Day, we remember all Michigan veterans who gave their  lives in service to our country. And we salute all of our veterans who  are still with us. It is only because of their sacrifice that our  democracy endures.                            ____________________
