 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his incredible support as chair of the Education and Labor Committee.   Madam Speaker, over 40 years ago, after the Pregnancy Discrimination  Act provided civil rights protections to pregnant people, it is  shameful that we still must address this issue today.   Every year, roughly 250,000 people in America are denied basic  accommodations to continue their work once pregnant; and when these  simple temporary  [[Page H4516]]  adjustments in their work activities are denied, many face being fired  or are forced to take unpaid leave simply to protect their health and  the health of their pregnancy.   This discrimination can take many forms, but its impacts can be  deadly. And, of course, these burdens fall disproportionately on people  and women of color who are overrepresented in low-wage jobs that are  physically demanding, lack adequate workforce protections, or both.  This is also one of the key reasons why I founded the Black Maternal  Health Caucus with Congresswoman Lauren Underwood last year.   I am pleased that the House is taking up the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act today, which will create a clear set of rules for  employers to follow that requires them to provide accommodations for  pregnant workers to continue to work and support their families.   So today we are sending the message that nowhere in America--nowhere  in America--should you have to worry about the health of your pregnancy  because your employer won't accommodate you. Today we will tell  millions of Americans that pregnancy won't prevent them from taking  their dreams as far as they can take them.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Maternal  Health Coalition, a group of public health professionals, clinicians,  and maternal health organizations outlining their support for this  legislation.                                                September 11, 2020.      Re Support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.        Dear Representative: As organizations dedicated to ending       racial injustice and systemic racism, including dismantling       the racism that contributes to this country's Black maternal       health crisis, we write in strong support of the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 2694). Congress must do all it can       to end the prejudice Black pregnant workers and pregnant       workers of color continue to face in the workplace. This       includes making sure when pregnant workers voice a need for       reasonable accommodations that those needs are met rather       than penalized and that the workplace is an environment where       pregnant workers of color do not fear asking for       accommodations.        The Black Maternal Health crisis remains frighteningly       persistent and requires immediate attention and multi-faceted       solutions. Black women experience maternal mortality rates       three to four times higher than white women. The       circumstances surrounding this alarming statistic can often       be attributed to a lack of access to care, including due to       inflexible workplaces, and deep biases in racial       understanding. Various social determinants such as health,       education, and economic status drastically influence the       outcomes of pregnancy for Black women leading to severe       pregnancy-related complications. As the Black Mamas Matter       Alliance has pointed out ``Health is determined in part by       our access to social and economic opportunities, the       resources and supports that are available in the places where       we live, and the safety of our workplaces . . . however,       disparities in these conditions of daily life give some       people better opportunities to be healthy than others.''       Black pregnant workers along with Latinx and immigrant women       are disproportionately likely to work in physically demanding       jobs that may lead to workers needing modest accommodations       to ensure a healthy pregnancy. Too often, however, those       requests are refused or ignored, forcing pregnant workers of       color to disproportionately contend with unsafe working       conditions.        Black mothers have among the highest labor force       participation rates in the country and 80 percent of Black       mothers are their family's primary breadwinner,'' Yet,       historically, Black women have been exploited in the       workplace, and that exploitation continues to this day.       Though Black women only comprise 14.3 percent of the       population, nearly thirty percent of pregnancy discrimination       complaints are filed by Black women.'' This is because of the       multiple forms of discrimination Black workers and other       workers of color too often face in the workplace. As scholar       Nina Banks has noted, ``The legacy of black women's       employment in industries that lack worker protections has       continued today since black women are concentrated in low-      paying, inflexible service occupations ...'' Black women in       low wage jobs working during pregnancy face little support       from employers when safeguards do not address pregnancy       related accommodations. Faced with the threat of termination,       loss of health insurance, or other benefits, Black pregnant       people are often forced to keep working which can compromise       their health and the health of their pregnancy.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will positively impact       Black women's health and economic security. When Black       pregnant people must continue working without accommodations,       they risk miscarriage, excessive bleeding, and other       devastating health consequences. Black women have the highest       incidence of preterm birth and yet we know that workplace       accommodations such as reducing heavy lifting, bending, or       excessive standing can help prevent preterm birth, the       leading cause of infant mortality in this country.        Black women are also at higher risk of preeclampsia, which       is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality. We are       still learning about how to prevent this dangerous medical       condition, yet we know that simply allowing workers to take       bathroom breaks can prevent urinary tract infections which       are ``strongly associated with preeclampsia.'' Similarly,       ensuring pregnant workers can drink a sufficient amount of       water can also help pregnant workers maintain their blood       pressure, which is critically important since hypertensive       disorders (high blood pressure) are also a leading cause of       maternal morbidity and mortality. By putting a national       pregnancy accommodation standard in place, the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act has the potential to improve some of the       most serious health consequences Black pregnant people       experience. Furthermore, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act       will help remove one of the many barriers Black pregnant       people face at work by ensuring they are afforded immediate       relief under the law, and not thrown into financial dire       straits for needing pregnancy accommodations.        Congress has the opportunity to pass legislation to support       rather than subjugate Black pregnant workers and workers of       color. We urge every member of the House of Representatives       to support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and by       extension, the health and economic wellbeing of Black       pregnant workers and pregnant workers of color.
