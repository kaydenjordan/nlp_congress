 Madam Speaker, inflation rates are at a 30-year high, and  gas prices are up 61 percent since last year. Why? Well, according to  Joe Biden, it is because of the American Rescue Plan that this body  passed in the spring. No less than the President himself said:         You got checks, but what happens if there is nothing to buy       and you got more money to compete for goods? It creates a       real problem.    Yes, Mr. President, it does create a real problem, and now you are  trying to double down with this broke back better bill.   What does it do? It further harms the economy with $4.5 trillion in  new spending, $1.5 trillion in new taxes, and $3 trillion in new debt.  It benefits the wealthy with a SALT tax cut of $25,000 for  millionaires, electric vehicle subsidies for couples making $500,000 a  year, and government-funded paid leave for millionaires. It builds the  bureaucracy with 150 new government programs, props up the Green New  Deal, and weaponizes the IRS.   Madam Speaker, this is the wrong plan for the American people, and I  urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
