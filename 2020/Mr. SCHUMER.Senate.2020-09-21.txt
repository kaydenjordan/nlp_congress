 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in the Jewish tradition, only a person of  great righteousness dies at the end of the year, near Rosh Hashanah,  because God determined that they were needed until the very end. On  Friday evening, shortly after the sundown on the eve of the Jewish New  Year, we learned that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg--a  woman of great righteousness, a woman of valor--passed away.   She was many things to many people: a brilliant mind, a quick wit, a  lover of the opera, a friend, a colleague, a workout guru, a feminist  icon. She might be the only Supreme Court Justice to become a meme.  What began as a joke, ``the Notorious RBG''--likening a legendary  rapper to an octogenarian jurist--struck a chord of deep resonance in  American society because Ruth Bader Ginsburg was, in fact, a rebellious  force to be reckoned with.   In a male-dominated legal establishment that wasn't waiting for  someone like Ruth to shake up the system, she elbowed her way through.  Her brains, her strength, her fortitude changed the world for women  long before the rest of the world caught up.   Over the course of two decades, as an academic and general counsel  for the ACLU, Ruth worked to challenge the foundations of the legal  system that had long treated women as a group that had to be  ``protected''--and thus excluded--from full participation in American  life. Not only did she reverse those laws and convince the majority of  the Supreme Court that the Constitution forbids discrimination on the  basis of sex, she was a living, breathing example of how absurd an idea  it ever was that women needed additional protections.   And when she got to the Court, she ruled in a manner that brought the  same equality and justice to so many different people, from all walks  of life.   The daughter of Russian immigrants who came to this country like my  own grandparents, Ruth went to the same high school as I did in  Brooklyn, NY--James Madison High School--two decades before I did. I  followed her career and her ascent to the bench with that special pride  you feel watching someone from your neighborhood make a great  difference in the world. The fact that at the end of her long life and  illustrious career, young women, and indeed young men across America,  looked at Ruth Bader Ginsburg with the same sense of pride and hope and  sometimes adoration, gives me great hope.   May she forever rest in peace.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, Justice Ginsburg's death leaves a  vacancy on the Supreme Court with only 44 days left before a national  election that could result in a different President--a vacancy that  could determine the future of the Supreme Court for generations and  make rulings that touch every aspect of American life.   Reporters will no doubt cover the political machinations here in  Washington, but for hundreds of millions of Americans, this vacancy on  the Supreme Court puts everything--everything--on the line.   Americans' right to healthcare hangs in the balance. President Trump  is pursuing a lawsuit which would eliminate protections for more than  130 million Americans with preexisting conditions, send drug prices  soaring for seniors on Medicare, and take health insurance away from  tens of millions of people. He will nominate a Justice that would  ensure that result in a Supreme Court case that will be argued only a  few weeks after election day   A woman's fundamental, constitutional right to make her own medical  decisions--to control her own body, her right to choose--hangs in the  balance. The right of workers to organize and collectively bargain for  fair wages at a time of growing income inequality hangs in the balance.  The future of our planet, environmental protections, and the  possibility of bold legislation to address climate change hang in the  balance. Voting rights and the right of every American citizen to have  a voice in our democracy hang in the balance. The stakes of this  election, the stakes of this vacancy concern no less than the future of  fundamental rights of the American people.   I was with my daughter and her wife to celebrate the Jewish New Year,  and they thought to themselves and mentioned at the table: Could their  right to be married, could marriage equality, be undone?   Those are questions hundreds of millions of Americans are asking  about things near and dear to them as this nomination hangs in the  balance. That is what it is all about--all the rights enshrined in our  Constitution that are supposed to be protected by the Supreme Court of  the United States; all the rights that could be undone or unwound by a  conservative majority on the Court; the right to join a union, marry  whom you love, freely exercise your right to vote; the right of a  parent with a child who has cancer not to watch, helpless, as their son  or daughter suffers without proper healthcare.   If you care about these things and the kind of country we live in,  this election and this vacancy mean everything. And by all rights, by  every modicum of decency and honor, Leader McConnell and the Republican  Senate majority have no right to fill it--no right.   In the final few weeks, sensing her failing health, Justice Ginsburg  told her family that it was her ``most fervent wish that [she] not be  replaced until a new president is installed.''   That was Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dying wish--her most fervent  wish--that she should not be replaced until a new President is  installed.   The Senate Republican majority should have no problem adhering to  Justice Ginsburg's dying wish. Leader McConnell held a Supreme Court  vacancy open for nearly a year in order to ``give the people a voice''  in selecting a Supreme Court Justice.   I just heard the remarks of the Republican leader, and it is obvious  why he is so defensive.   This is what Leader McConnell said in 2016, mere hours after the  death of Justice Scalia. His words:         The American people should have a voice in the selection of       their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy       should not be filled until we have a new president.    No amount of sophistry can change what McConnell said then. And it  applies even more so now--more so--so much closer we are to an  election.   In an op-ed on February 18, 2016, with Senator Grassley, Leader  McConnell wrote: ``Given that we are in the midst of a presidential  election process, we believe that the American people should seize the  opportunity to weigh  [[Page S5722]]  in on whom they trust to nominate the next person for a lifetime  appointment to the Supreme Court.''   In the midst of an election process, February before the election,  but now we are not? Now these words don't apply? It doesn't pass the  smell test in any way. No wonder Leader McConnell was so defensive in  his comments.   At a press conference on March 1, 2016, Leader McConnell said that  ``we will look forward to the American people deciding who they want to  make this appointment through their own votes.''   And on the floor, March 16, 2016, McConnell said that ``our view is  this: give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy.''   That was 8 months--more than 8 months from a national election. This  is 44 days. The Senate has never confirmed a nominee to the Supreme  Court this close to a Presidential election.   If that was how Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans justify their  mindless obstruction of President Obama's nominee, surely they must  abide by their own standard. What is fair is fair. What is fair is  fair. A Senators' word must count for something.   Senator McConnell has come to the floor numerous times to say that  ``your word is the currency of the realm in the Senate.'' That quote:  ``It is important for all Senators to keep their word, but it is  particularly important for the majority leader.''   Leader McConnell said those things.   My friend, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  sensed that this situation might arise and made it crystal clear how he  would behave if the shoe were on the other foot. He said:         I want you to use my words against me.        If there's a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy       occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say       Lindsey Graham said let's let the next president, whoever it       might be, make that nomination.    He reiterated that view less than 2 years ago and encouraged the  audience to ``hold the tape'' for exactly this situation.   No wonder Americans have so little faith in governing and in this  Senate led by the Republican majority. We now know the entire thing was  a farce, not a shred of credibility to those arguments. We have the  exact scenario that Chairman Graham talked about--a Republican  President and a Supreme Court vacancy in the last year of the first  term. Indeed, it is almost the last month of his first term.   ``I want you to use those words against me,'' he said. ``You can say  Lindsey Graham said the next president, whoever it might be, should  make the nomination.''   Well, here we are. And despite these words, despite their supposedly  noble principle that the American people should have a voice in the  decision of the next Supreme Court Justice, President Trump, Leader  McConnell, and Chairman Graham have already announced they will ignore  their own standard and will rush to confirm a new Justice before the  next President is installed--a Justice that could tear down Justice  Ginsburg's life's work and other critical laws, like the Affordable  Care Act.   The kind words and lamentations we just heard from the majority  leader about Justice Ginsburg are totally empty, totally meaningless if  he moves to appoint someone who will tear down everything Justice  Ginsburg built.   Leader McConnell put the Senate on ``pause'' for over 4 months while  COVID-19 devastated our country, but now he will move Earth and Heaven,  and ignore all principle and consistency, to install a new Supreme  Court Justice who could rip away Americans' healthcare in the middle of  a pandemic.   Leader McConnell and Chairman Graham have made a mockery of their  previous position. They seem ready to show the world their word is  simply no good. It is enough to make your head explode. And then to  hear Leader McConnell up on the floor trying to defend this--pathetic,  pathetic.   Why even bother instructing a pretense for your position? Why say it  is this rule or that rule and then do the exact opposite when it suits  your interests? Why not just come to the floor and say: I'm going to do  whatever is best for my political party. Consistency be damned. Reason  be damned. Democracy be damned.   Just admit it. There is no shaping the cravenness of this position.  But over the course of the debate, I know the Republican leadership is  going to try. We are going to hear some crazy things from the other  side to defend the indefensible and justify this unjustifiable power  grab. We heard some of it already, a few minutes ago.   We are going to hear a series of preposterous arguments; that it  somehow has to do with the orientation of the Senate and Presidency, as  if that constitutes some legitimate principle. We will hear that  Republicans have to do it because Democrats will do far worse, unnamed  things in the future.   Some--some--few on that side will at least have the dignity of  putting their head down and plowing through with it because they know  there is no reason--no reason, no argument, no logic--to justify  flipping your position 180 degrees and calling it some kind of  principle. It is not. It is utterly craven, an exercise in raw  political power and nothing more.   I worry. I worry for the future of this Chamber if the Republican  majority proceeds down this dangerous path.   If a Senate majority over the course of 6 years steals two Supreme  Court seats using completely contradictory rationales, how could we  expect to trust the other side again?   How can we trust each other if, when push comes to shove and when the  stakes are the highest, the other side will double-cross their own  standards when it is politically advantageous? Tell me how. Tell me how  this would not spell the end of this supposedly great deliberative body  because I don't see how.   There is only one way for this Chamber to retain its dignity through  this difficult chapter. There is only one way for us to have some hope  of coming together again, trusting each other again, lowering the  temperature moving forward, and that is for four brave Senate  Republicans to commit to rejecting any nominee until the next President  is installed. That was Justice Ginsburg's dying wish. It may be the  Senate's only last hope.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
