 Mr. Speaker, today I am sending a joint letter  to Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking him to limit the Mueller  investigation in two respects. The letter to Attorney General Jeff  Sessions states:         We, the undersigned, urge you to, one, limit Special       Counsel Mueller's investigation to, A, alleged Russian       interference with the 2016 Presidential election, herein       referred to as ``Russian interference,'' and, B, alleged       collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians with       respect to the alleged Russian interference, herein referred       to as ``Trump collusion.''        Two, terminate the investigative phase of Mueller's       authority no later than July 5, 2018, which is the 2-year       anniversary of the date on which the FBI began investigating       alleged Russian interference with the 2016 Presidential       election.        We respectfully request that you consider the following       reasoning for our request.    First, with respect to limiting the Mueller investigation scope, the  letter states:         You recused yourself ``from any existing or future       investigations of any matters related in any way to the       campaigns for President of the United States.'' This request       does not conflict with your recusal because it asks that you       direct Mueller to cease investigation of matters that go       beyond allegations of Russian interference and Trump       collusion. For emphasis, matters beyond alleged Russian       interference and Trump collusion, if any, can and should be       treated like any other matter investigated and prosecuted by       Federal law enforcement officials and the Department of       Justice.        While public opinion must not always dictate justice, it is       important to emphasize that the expansion of Mueller's work       scope goes way beyond the alleged Russian interference and       Trump collusion that was the public basis for the appointment       of a special counsel. As such, continuation of Mueller's work       scope beyond alleged Russian interference and Trump collusion       betrays the public trust on which America's justice system is       founded.                                time  1015    Second, with respect to termination of the Mueller investigation on  the 2-year anniversary of when the FBI and Department of Justice began  the Russian interference investigation, the letter states:         The investigation of alleged Russian interference began       almost 2 years ago. Two years is more than enough time for a       competent and thorough prosecutor, backed up by the resources       of the FBI and Department of Justice, to do his job.        If no harm was being done by the tardiness of an       investigation, that would be one thing. But in this instance,       Mueller's tardiness is damaging America. The alleged Russian       interference and Trump collusion investigations have taken on       the character of an endless political persecution that not       only harms America's trust in the justice system  [[Page H3839]]       but also severely damages and distracts from the ability of a       duly elected President to fulfill his duties to the American       people.        As you know, America is racking up deficits and debt at a       frightening and dangerous pace. Washington public officials       must be more prudent with tax dollars forcibly taken from       American citizens. Mueller appears to be burning through tax       dollars at a roughly $1.5 million-per-month clip. Given the       rather paltry results to date, a strong argument can be made       that Mueller's investigation is an extravagant waste of tax       dollars.        We urge you, on the second anniversary of the start of the       alleged Russian interference and Trump collusion       investigations, to end it. Between now and then, Mueller has       plenty of time to get the job done.    Mr. Speaker, so far, this letter has been respectfully signed and  submitted to Attorney General Jeff Sessions by no less than 16 Members  of the United States Congress.                            ____________________
