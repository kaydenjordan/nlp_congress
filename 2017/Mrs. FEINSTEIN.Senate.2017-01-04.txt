 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Extending  Justice for Sex Crime Victims Act, a bill to extend the time for minors  to seek justice against their perpetrators.   Sex crimes committed against children tragically remain a vile and  dangerous reality in communities across this country.   Just this past summer, as the world tuned into the 2016 Olympic Games  in Rio de Janeiro, the Indianapolis Star reported that USA Gymnastics  had failed to report to law enforcement allegations of child sexual  abuse committed by some of its coaches.   Due to these purported failures, athletes as young as 7 years old  were reported to have been abused for years, without any action taken  to prevent the abuse.   Since the initial Indianapolis Star report, more and more young  gymnasts have come forward about their abuse.   All over the world, and all over this country, sex abuse victims are  bravely coming forward to tell their stories of abuse when they were  children.   In my home state of California, numerous victims have contacted my  office. They have shared the amount of courage and strength it took to  finally come forward with their experiences.   These stories represent an untold amount of pain and suffering. They  also represent how difficult it is to come forward until later, in  adulthood.   It has been estimated that 90 percent of child sex crime victims  never go to the authorities concerning their abuse.   To put this into context, studies indicate that at least one in four  girls and about one in five boys is sexually abused. 90 percent of  those victims never go to the authorities.   A great number of victims don't ever disclose their abuse. If they  do, they do not come forward until many years later, after reaching  adulthood.   This bill extends the civil statute of limitations in two ways for  minor victims of Federal sex crimes to seek justice against their  perpetrators.   For one, the bill extends the statute of limitations for minor  victims until the age of 28, from age 21, for injuries stemming from  sex crimes such as sexual abuse and child pornography.   Second, for the two laws that provide civil remedies for sex abuse  and sex trafficking victims, the bill clarifies that the statute of  limitations does not begin to run until after the victim actually  discovers the injury or the violation.   This is significant because victims of sex crimes are sometimes  abused even before they can remember the abuse, some as young as 3  years old. Some victims are unable to connect their abuse to the  injurious symptoms they exhibit throughout their lives.   The bill therefore clarifies that the limitations period begins when  the victim first discovers the injury or the violation.   Through these provisions, the bill ensures that minor victims have an  extended period to seek justice against their perpetrators after  discovering their injury or violation.   I want to thank Senator Cornyn again for working so closely with me  on this issue. I also want to thank the cosponsors to this bill:  Senators Klobuchar, Inhofe, Franken, Flake, Gillibrand, Tillis, and  Markey.   I also want to acknowledge the support for this bill from the  National Center for Victims of Crime, Rape Abuse & Incest National  Network, the National Children's Advocacy Center, SGS for Healing,  National Crime Victim Law Institute, National Association of VOCA  Assistance Administrators, National Network to End Domestic Violence,  Stop the Silence, PROTECT, the National Association to Protect  Children, Rights4Girls, End Rape on Campus, National Children's  Alliance, Lauren's Kids, Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Assault,  and Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN (for Mrs. Feinstein (for herself, Mr. Wyden, Ms.          Cantwell, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Murray, and Ms. Harris)):   S. 31. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to  permanently prohibit the conduct of offshore drilling on the outer  Continental Shelf off the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington;  to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill, the West  Coast Ocean Protection Act, which would amend the Outer Continental  Shelf Lands Act to prohibit the Department of the Interior from issuing  a lease for offshore oil or gas in federal waters off the coast of  California, Oregon, or Washington.   I am pleased to be joined today by Senators Wyden, Merkley, Cantwell,  Murray, and Harris in sponsoring this bill, which has been reintroduced  in every Congress since 2010.   The original impetus for this bill was the Deepwater Horizon  catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico in April of 2010, which demonstrated  yet again the risks of offshore oil and gas extraction.   When the Deepwater Horizon well blew out, 11 people died and 17  others were injured. Oil and gas rushed into the Gulf of Mexico for 87  days.   Oil slicks spread across the Gulf of Mexico, tar balls spoiled the  pristine white sand beaches of Florida, wetlands were coated with toxic  sludge, and more than one-third of federal waters in the Gulf were  closed to fishing.   While Deepwater Horizon served as an important reminder, the dangers  of offshore oil and gas were already too well known to Californians. In  1969, the Santa Barbara oil spill leaked up to 100,000 barrels of oil,  and remains the third largest oil spill in the country to this day.  [[Page S62]]    Like the Deepwater Horizon, the Santa Barbara oil spill was caused by  a natural gas blowout when pressure in the drill hole fluctuated.   It took 11 days to plug the hole with mud and cement, but oil and gas  continued to seep for months.   Using containment technologies still in place today, the cleanup  effort relied on skimmers, detergent, and booms.   There has been no new drilling in waters controlled by the State of  California since then, and there has been no new drilling in Federal  waters off the coast of California since 1981.   Appropriately, the most recent plan from the Department of the  Interior for Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing will not allow  new leasing off the Pacific Coast of California, Oregon or Washington  through 2022.   The fact is that those of us on the Pacific coast do not want any  further offshore oil or gas development.   In 2012 California's 19 coastal counties generated $662 billion in  wages and $1.7 trillion in GDP. This accounts for 80 percent of the  economic activity in the State.   California's Ocean economy, including tourism, recreation, and marine  transportation, accounts for over 489,000 jobs.   Unlike other areas of the country, any potential fossil fuel  resources off the coast of California are likely to be found within  only 50 miles of the coast, because of the narrow shelf off the  California coast. This means that any potential drilling, and any  potential spills, would be in direct conflict with the ocean  environment and economy that my state enjoys.   Enacting a permanent ban on offshore drilling would protect our coast  for generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Extending  Justice for Sex Crime Victims Act, a bill to extend the time for minors  to seek justice against their perpetrators.
