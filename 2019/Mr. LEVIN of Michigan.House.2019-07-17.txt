 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate my  constituent in St. Clair Shores, City Manager Mike Smith, on his  upcoming retirement after nearly two decades of service to the  community.   Mike Smith has been a true hands-on leader. I ran into him at St.  Clair Shores Memorial Day parade, which is one of the biggest in the  country, where he was rushing around on a golf cart, as ever,  personally managing this huge event.   Mike has also been a leader on an issue extremely important to me and  my fellow Michiganders: water quality. He has fought for improvements  to the Chapaton Retention Basin, a project I have made it my mission to  help fund in order to protect water quality in Lake St. Clair and the  Great Lakes system.   While I will miss Mike's partnership, I wish him the very best in his  retirement, and I thank him for his tremendous service.                            ____________________
