 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the tireless work of  school counselors across the country and in the 38th District of  California, whom I am honored to represent. These public servants guide  students through academic, social, and personal development.   Dana Zapanta, a counselor at Artesia High School in my district, is  exactly the type of champion that students need. Dana, a 12-year  counseling veteran, has been instrumental in the development of  Artesia's Career Technical Education program. She also coordinates  numerous events, including AP Student Night and college fairs. Thanks  in part to her unwavering commitment to students, the graduation rate  is nearly 99 percent.   Despite the important contributions counselors like Dana make every  day, counseling positions are not always protected when local budgets  are cut. The average student-to-counselor ratio in our Nation's public  schools is almost double the ratio recommended by the American School  Counselor Association.   Students deserve to have the support of school counselors like Dana.  That is why I am proud to introduce a resolution to designate this week  as National School Counseling Week. I urge my colleagues to join me in  honoring these selfless professionals.                            ____________________
