 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor law enforcement during this  upcoming National Police Week.   In 1962, as my colleague from North Carolina suggested, President  John F. Kennedy formally proclaimed the recognition of Peace Officers  Memorial Day beginning in May of 1963. Kennedy acknowledged that ``from  the beginning of this Nation, law enforcement officers have played an  important role.''   In 1821, Stephen F. Austin, known as the father of Texas, established  a group of roughly 50 men to provide for the safety of the first Texas  settlements. He recognized this group as The Rangers in 1823, for their  duties compelled them to range over the entire countryside, thus giving  rise to the service known today as the Texas Rangers.   Today I pay special homage to the first responders who ran to the  gunfire when shots rang out last Saturday, just 4 days ago, at the  Allen Premium Outlets in Allen, Texas.                                time  2120    The first responders include: the Allen Police Department, the Plano  Police Department, the McKinney Police Department, the Frisco Police  Department, the Prosper Police Department, the Wylie Police Department,  the Fairview Police Department, the Collin County Sheriff's Office, the  Collin County Constable Precinct 1, the Collin County Constable  Precinct 3, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, the Texas  Department of Public Safety Highway Patrol, and the Texas Department of  Public Safety Texas Rangers.   I offer special recognition to the Allen police officer who, by the  grace of God, was on the scene when the first shot was fired and  responded swiftly.   He is a hero among a cast of heroes who continue piecing together the  details of this horrible occurrence. That Allen police officer's  actions epitomize the words of the legendary Texas Ranger, Captain W.J.  McDonald, who said: ``No man in the wrong can stand up against a fellow  that is in the right and keeps on a-comin'.''
