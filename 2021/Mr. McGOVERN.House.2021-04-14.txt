 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California, a  distinguished member of the Rules Committee and also a graduate of the  College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, for yielding me the time.   Madam Speaker, I support this rule and the underlying legislation,  and I urge my colleagues on both sides to do the same. I hope they all  will vote for the rule.   The two bills that we are bringing to the floor are the product of  regular order. They went through the committee process, hearings and  markups.   We, in the Rules Committee, made the Republican substitutes in order  so they can try to defend their ideas, which I don't agree with.  Nonetheless, other Republican amendments are made in order as well. But  then again, I guess there is not much we can do to make some of my  friends happy.   Madam Speaker, I rise for a more somber purpose, and that is to honor  my friend and colleague, Congressman Alcee Hastings, who we lost last  week after a courageous battle with cancer. I am proud to have sat  side-by-side with him in the Rules Committee for many years.   I often say that the Rules Committee is like a family. To those  outsiders who  [[Page H1778]]  are observing the Rules Committee, we can sometimes look a little bit  like a dysfunctional family, but nonetheless, we are a family. Today,  our family is in mourning.   This House is already a little less joyful and a little less purpose- driven without him here. That was the thing about Alcee Hastings.  Whether he was in the majority or the minority, or whether he liked  what we were considering on this floor or not, he relished his service  in this institution. He used every day here to wage worthy fights on  behalf of justice.   His election marked the first time an African American was elected  from Florida since the Civil War era. He went on to become the first  Black chairman of the Helsinki Commission, a respected voice on the  world stage.   There was not a barrier he was afraid to break. He was steadfast in  providing a voice to all those who needed an ally, including  minorities, children, immigrants, and people struggling in poverty.   Madam Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that he  could do more with the simple turn of a phrase than many of us could do  with 100 words or more. As he was yielding back his time in the  committee or here on the floor, especially if he felt that we were  considering a bill that somehow was disadvantaging vulnerable people in  this country, he would get up and give a stern and passionate and  succinct lecture to this body. Then he would conclude by saying: That  is my story, and I am sticking to it. And if I offended any of you by  what I said, that was intentional.   It was pure Alcee Hastings. He chose his words carefully, and he  meant every one of them. Now I have lost a dear friend, this Congress  has lost a giant, and those who all too often go unseen in America have  lost a champion.   We send our prayers and our condolences to his family, to his  dedicated and wonderful staff, and to his constituents, knowing that  these Halls will never see someone quite like him again.   May he rest in peace.                                time  1545
