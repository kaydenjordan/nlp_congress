 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from  Georgia (Mr. Collins) for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition not only to these Articles  of Impeachment, but in strong opposition to the process that has  brought us to this point.   Our Constitution and Bill of Rights are all about process. Our  Founders knew that a government without constraints could accuse anyone  of any crime at any time, even without compelling evidence. That is why  the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendment have established a bedrock  principle of innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.   But on November 14, Speaker Pelosi informed the press that the  President should prove his innocence when she stated: Mr. President, if  you have anything that shows your innocence, then you should make that  known.   The Constitution also guarantees that the accused can call witnesses  to testify on their behalf, but the Republicans and the President were  continually denied that right throughout this process.   The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of the defendant to face  their accuser, but not only have the Democrats prohibited Republicans  and the President from questioning the so-called whistleblower, his  identity has been kept secret.   Before Members take this historic vote today, one week before  Christmas, I want Members to keep this in mind: When Jesus was falsely  accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face  his accusers. During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more  rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this President in this  process.
