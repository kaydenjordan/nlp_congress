 Mr. Speaker, first, I want to say that we received  amazing news this morning. Brittney Griner is coming home.   This is a huge relief for her, her wife, Cherelle, and her family  after months of uncertainty in Russia's sham justice system. I thank  President Biden, Secretary Blinken, and all at the State Department who  made this happen.   Today, in a strong symbol of the stark differences in the freedoms  between our two Nations, the U.S. Congress will vote in a bipartisan  way to pass the Respect for Marriage Act enshrining marriage equality  into Federal law and protecting marriages just like Brittney's.   I am proud to vote today to say that love is love no matter who you  are or where you live and no matter what any future extreme or out-of- touch Supreme Court may say.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes''  and standing up for freedom.
