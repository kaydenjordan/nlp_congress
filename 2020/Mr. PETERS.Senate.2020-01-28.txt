 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Pastor  Douglas P. Jones of Welcome Missionary Baptist Church of Pontiac, MI,  as the congregation and the Pontiac community celebrate his 30th  pastoral anniversary.   Pastor Jones moved from his native Cincinnati in 1989 to Pontiac, MI,  to assume leadership of Welcome Missionary Baptist Church. Under his  guidance, membership at Welcome Missionary Baptist Church grew from a  few hundred to more than 4,000 worshippers. From the very beginning of  his tenure at the church, Pastor Jones has worked tirelessly to  implement a vision of unity and kindness, bringing worshippers together  so that they may find strength in their community and, with that  strength, work toward positive change throughout the Pontiac area.   His focus on ensuring that church members' needs are met can be seen  in  [[Page S633]]  the number and diversity of ministries established at Welcome. In  support of his younger members, Pastor Jones created both the Young Men  Making a Difference Ministry for preteen and teenage boys, as well as  the Teen Esteem Ministry for preteen and teenage girls. Pastor Jones  has endeavored to create resources for the most vulnerable members of  the Welcome community such as the T.I.P.--Tots, Infants, and  Preschoolers--ministry, which looks after the congregation's youngest  members, the Exodus Dependency Program, which assists those contending  with problems relating to substance abuse and HIV, and the Domestic  Violence Ministry.   Pastor Jones has not limited his dedication to service to the members  of Welcome Missionary Baptist Church but, rather, extended his  unwavering faith and generosity to the broader Pontiac community. He  has been fundamental in the positive growth seen throughout the city  over the last 30 years. He has served on committees, boards, and  partnerships in support of the community, including the Pontiac Youth  Assistance, the NAACP North Oakland Medical Center, and the Woodward  Dream Cruise, Inc., to name only a few. Seeing a lack of unity among  those trying to create change, Pastor Jones founded the Greater Pontiac  Community Coalition, a federation of over 190 Oakland County  individuals, community groups, clergy, elected officials, and  businesses that work together to encourage positive change on the  individual, social, and institutional level through advocacy and  community action. Pastor Jones has further been a driving force behind  helping the students of Pontiac achieve their goals of pursuing higher  education. Under his guidance the Pontiac Promise Zone Scholarship  Program was created, which has given many Pontiac students the chance  to obtain the financial aid necessary to pursue their dreams of higher  education in the State of Michigan.   Since his arrival in 1989, Pastor Jones has been a source of strength  and good will for all those in the Pontiac community. He is often  called upon to act as a consensus builder among groups and people of  different perspectives, preaching partnership and cooperation in order  to inspire success and transformation. He has worked tirelessly in  pursuit of what he thinks is best for the community and has done so  while spreading a message of morality and kindness.   I have no doubt that the congregation at Welcome Missionary Baptist  Church is proud to call Pastor Jones their leader and celebrate his  many accomplishments over the last 30 years. I am grateful to Pastor  Jones for his friendship and for his selflessness in serving the  residents of Pontiac and surrounding area. I wish Pastor Jones, First  Lady JoAnn, and their family continued happiness and success as they  continue to work for the betterment of the community.                            ____________________
