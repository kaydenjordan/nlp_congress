 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call for a  Green New Deal for America.   As one of the youngest members of this body, I am proud to represent  a generation that is taking on climate change with the urgency that it  deserves.   The Green New Deal is a call to action and a blueprint for positive  change. It is about choosing justice and progress over scarcity and  inequality. It is about choosing to have a plan instead of waiting for  a miracle.   San Diegans are all too familiar with how devastating unchecked  climate change has been for our community, and those who can least  afford it have paid the highest price.   This plan is to mobilize and rebuild our economy around clean energy,  empowered workers, and good jobs.   Madam Speaker, my generation knows that we can't take small steps to  solve big problems. We have to think differently and reimagine a better  future.                            ____________________
