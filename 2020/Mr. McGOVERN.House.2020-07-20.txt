 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished member of the  Rules Committee, Mr. Perlmutter, for yielding me the time.   I also want to associate myself with the comments of all my  colleagues who have remembered our dear friend   John Lewis, the  conscience of the Congress, indeed, the conscience of the country.    John Lewis was a man of action who never gave up on fighting for a more  just, fair, and decent country, and I think all of us can pay tribute  to him not just with words but with actions.   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of good ideas being considered as part  of this debate. There will be a lot of debate over the next couple of  days, but I want to discuss one in particular here today, an amendment  by my colleagues Mark Pocan and Barbara Lee.   Because of their leadership, Congress will finally vote on whether to  cut the Pentagon's bloated budget and reinvest that money in the  American people here at home. All I can say is: It is about damn time.   COVID-19 has laid bare our Nation's failure to invest in programs  that support our families and keep them healthy, but this debate was  needed long before this pandemic hit because, for years and years, we  have been told there simply isn't enough money to invest in our  communities, in universal childcare, Medicare for All, or repairing our  crumbling infrastructure.   We have been told that a Green New Deal is too expensive and that it  is unreasonable to ask to cancel crushing student loan debt. But there  is always enough money lying around to raise the Pentagon's budget.  Decade after decade after decade, we shortchanged the American people  while we shoveled more money into building more nukes or more military  bases halfway around the world.                                time  1045    Mr. Speaker, I am sick and tired of it. This amendment is the least-- and I mean the least--we can do. Since the start of the Trump  administration, in just the last 3 years, our defense spending has gone  up every single year, over $100 billion in total. That is crazy.   Now, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Speaker. I support our troops. This  amendment exempts from cuts military personnel, defense healthcare, and  our Federal civilian workforce. But I do not support military spending  so wasteful that it weakens our Nation; I don't support Congress  funding weapons our troops don't want; and I don't support Congress  funding forever wars that our country shouldn't even be involved in.   For me, this all boils down to a simple question, Mr. Speaker: What  do we mean by ``national security''?   Now, some here in Washington think our national security ought to be  measured solely by the number of bombs we have, but those of us who  support this amendment think our national security must also be  measured by the prosperity of our people, by whether our families have  enough money to buy groceries, and whether we are investing in our  schools and our libraries and our roads and all the things that  strengthen our communities.   If we continue failing to invest in our people, what kind of country  will be left for our military to defend 20, 40, 60 years down the road?  What will we tell our children and their children when our military  budget continues to balloon, yet our citizens cannot afford even the  most basic necessities?  [[Page H3103]]    Budgets, Mr. Speaker, are moral documents. They represent our values,  what we think is important. It is time for America to do the right  thing and fundamentally alter our national priorities. That is what  this proposal is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule. There will be  lots of debate on lots of subjects, but I urge them to support this  amendment when it comes up for a vote.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the amendment  offered by Representatives McAdams, Titus, Horsford and myself.   Mr. Speaker, on July 16th, 75 years ago at 5:29 a.m., the first ever  nuclear explosion burned across the skies of New Mexico, changing the  world forever.   The Trinity Test was certainly an astonishing moment. When the bomb,  called the Gadget, detonated, the observing scientists experienced the  literal definition of shock and awe.   A great deal has happened since that first test of an atomic bomb.  The United States is the only nation to have used nuclear bombs against  a foreign nation. The U.S. carried out tests for several decades,  ending them only in 1992.   During those years, nuclear testing killed or sickened thousands of  military personnel who were involved in the detonations, as well the  people who lived downrange from U.S. test sites, including tens of  thousands in the continental United States. These communities are still  dealing with the devastating legacy of nuclear testing decades after  the U.S. conducted its last nuclear test in 1992. The responsible step  for Congress would be to extend and expand the Radiation Effects  Compensation Act (RECA) rather than to endorse talk of resuming U.S.  nuclear testing, which would dishonor the experiences of downwinders  and atomic veterans.   The United States established a blue-ribbon panel to investigate what  had happened to our atomic veterans, resulting in public apologies by  Presidents H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George Bush and special  reparations and health program by the Departments of Justice and  Veterans Affairs. I would like to thank Chairman Adam Smith and Ranking  Member Thornberry for including in the underlying bill, H.R. 6395, a  provision to honor our Atomic Veterans with a service medal, and I urge  them to fight to include this provision in the final conference report  of the NDAA later this year.   For more than a quarter-century, the Science-Based Stockpile  Stewardship Program has worked extraordinarily well in ensuring the  reliability of the existing nuclear warhead types in the U.S. arsenal.  The overwhelming majority of the past U.S. nuclear test explosions were  for ``weapons development'' and ``weapons effects'' purposes. There is  [[Page H3333]]  simply no technical reason to resume testing now, nor in the  foreseeable future.   Mr. Speaker, resuming U.S. testing would violate the global taboo  against nuclear testing established by the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban  Treaty. As one of the 184 signatories of the CTBT, the United States  has a legal obligation not to take actions that violate the object and  purpose of the treaty, which is to prohibit nuclear test explosions, no  matter what the yield. Renewed testing by the U.S. would undermine  global support for operating and maintaining the treaty's International  Monitoring System, which the United States itself depends upon to help  monitor other states' compliance with the nuclear test ban.   The McAdams-Titus amendment is right thing to do. It is the smart  thing to do. And it is the moral and humane thing to do.   For these and so many other reasons, I urge all my colleagues to  support the McAdams amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  Amendment No. 5 offered by the gentlelady from Minnesota, Congresswoman  Omar, to establish a policy framework for the accelerated withdrawal of  U.S. forces from Afghanistan. I thank Congresswoman Omar for her  leadership on this and so many other critical foreign and defense  policy issues.   Mr. Speaker, in October of this year, the United States will have  been engaged in the Afghanistan conflict for 19 years. That's 19 years  of war, Mr. Speaker. Nineteen years of terrible losses of life--among  our brave troops and servicemembers, our coalition partners,  humanitarian and other development aid workers, and most of all, among  the people of Afghanistan who have suffered the highest death toll.   The numbers of deaths and injuries are chilling: nearly 2400 U.S.  military have died; over 20,000 have been wounded; and over 1700 U.S.  contractors have lost their lives in Afghanistan. For the Afghan  people, the war has been devastating: over 100,000 Afghan civilians  have been killed or wounded over the course of this war. According to  the United Nations, whose figures are considered conservative, for each  of the past six years, Afghan civilians have suffered over 10,000  casualties annually. Mr. Speaker, it is likely that every family in  Afghanistan has suffered grave loss from this unending war.   It's been 19 years of devastation, Mr. Speaker. No one can assert  that it would be a hasty or untimely moment to consider withdrawing our  forces from Afghanistan. In fact, I believe that it is well past time  for the United States to withdraw its forces, close the chapter on this  war, and take meaningful steps to secure a stable peace.   This amendment calls for a long-term, inclusive peace process and  strikes a section of the NDAA that would impose unduly onerous  conditions on troop drawdown, essentially preventing any withdrawal and  prolonging this endless war. A nearly identical amendment passed the  House in 2013, 305-121, with overwhelming bipartisan support. That was  an amendment offered by Congressman Adam Smith (WA), our late colleague  Walter Jones of North Carolina, and me. If the House so overwhelmingly  supported a withdrawal of troops in 2013, then why not today?   According to the ``Costs of War Project at Brown University,'' the  United States has  [[Page H3335]]  spent nearly $2 trillion on this war. To finance war spending, the  United States has borrowed heavily and will pay more than $600 billion  in interest on those loans through 2023. The rest of the debt will take  years to repay.   In addition to the more than $2 trillion the U.S. government has  already spent on the war, debt and medical costs will continue long  into the future.   Mr. Speaker, I know that Afghanistan is in the midst of negotiations  to end this conflict. The withdrawal of U.S. troops is a key element of  securing that peace. Let us begin today to put that framework in place,  begin the safe and orderly withdrawal of our troops; and put an end to  the longest war in U.S. history.   I urge all my colleagues to support the Omar Amendment No. 5.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Amendment No.  253 offered by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel  (NY) and myself. I want to thank Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith  (WA) and Ranking Member Mac Thornberry (TX) for including this  amendment in En Bloc Amendment No. 2.   Mr. Speaker, 39 years ago, in December 1981, the worst massacre in  modern Latin American history took place in a remote village in El  Salvador and surrounding communities.   Known as the El Mozote massacre, it's estimated that between 800-to- 1200 men, women and children were killed by units of the Salvadoran  military.   I'm sorry to say that some of the units participating in the  massacre, in particular the Atlacatl Battalion, were created, trained  and equipped by the United States.   I've had the privilege to visit the community of El Mozote. I've  talked to survivors of the massacre and to relatives whose family  members were victims of the massacre. I've seen the names of those  killed on the memorial walls of the church and community square.   A garden is planted to remember the over 140 children who were  murdered. The average age is six. But many were so young that their age  is noted as ``zero'' because they were only infants. It is so very  difficult, Mr. Speaker, for any of us to contemplate any soldier being  ordered to murder infants and then being forced to carry out that  order.   Over the past two years, a trial has been underway in El Salvador to  investigate the El Mozote massacre and hold accountable those  responsible. The presiding judge has asked the United States for any  and all relevant documents we might have in various agency files.   Mr. Speaker, this is a very important trial. It is among a handful of  cases deemed by the Salvadoran Attorney General's Office as cases of  historical significance. Holding accountable those who ordered,  commanded and carried out this massacre would be a powerful act in  breaking the dominant culture of impunity in El Salvador that protects  from any consequence, judicial or otherwise, those who perpetrate  violent human rights crimes against Salvadoran civilians.   Last year, Congress charged the State Department with coordinating a  government-wide search among all Federal agencies to identify and  release to Salvadoran judicial authorities, including the presiding  judge in the El Mozote trial, any and all documents and materials  relevant to the period surrounding the time of the massacre.   The McGovern-Engel amendment offered today simply requires the  Defense Department to do its part and provide these documents to the  Salvadoran judicial authorities.   I hope we can count on everyone's support for this amendment. I urge  my colleagues to vote for this amendment and for En Bloc No. 2 in which  it is included.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Armed Services Committee  Chairman Adam Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry for including my  bipartisan amendment in this en bloc amendment.   Mr. Speaker, on October 3, 2016, then Secretary of Defense Carter  sent a memo to United States military leaders on the subject of  ``Principles Related to the Protection of Medical Care Provided By  Impartial Humanitarian Organizations During Armed Conflict'' and  included a statement of principles that had been drafted by military  and civilian lawyers within the Department of Defense and reflected  relevant legal principles. Where the principles were not already  legally binding as a matter of treaty or custom, the memo conveyed  United States support for recognition of the principles as customary  international law.   The memo also conveyed the Secretary's expectation that Department of  Defense orders and guidance were already consistent with the  principles. But he nonetheless included a request for a ``prompt review  of all relevant orders, rules of engagement, directives, regulations,  policies, practices, and procedures'' to ensure consistency.   This bipartisan amendment, cosponsored by Rep. Chris Smith of New  Jersey, requests the results of that review--or, if the review was not  completed, requires that it be undertaken.   Mr. Speaker, attacks on health care workers and facilities occur all  over the world. The Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition recently  reported that in 2019 there were at least 1,203 attacks on health care  workers, health facilities and health transports in 20 countries in  conflict around the world. At least 151 health workers died and at  least 502 were injured as a result of these attacks.   We know the Department of Defense has sought to be responsive to the  need to protect health care during conflicts. This amendment affirms  the importance of United States leadership in ensuring global respect  and protection for health care workers, their vehicles and equipment,  and health care facilities. Having the review requested in 2016 will  contribute to the development of practical guidance for U.S. armed  forces on the ground.   I'm very grateful for the bipartisan support this amendment has  received from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Armed  Services Committee. I ask all my colleagues to support this amendment  and En Bloc No. 2 amendment in which it is included.    Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Armed Services Committee  Chairman Adam Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry for including my  bipartisan amendment in this en bloc amendment.   Mr. Speaker, during the last 20 years journalists, human rights  organizations and courts in Colombia have repeatedly uncovered evidence  of unlawful surveillance and intelligence gathering by units of the  Colombian security forces. This unlawful activity has been directed at  human rights defenders, journalists, judicial authorities and the  political opposition. It violates their rights, and may put them in  mortal danger.   The problem keeps recurring in spite of reforms like the elimination  of the Department of Administrative Security, the presidential  intelligence agency, in 2011, and in spite of major court cases in  which some of the officials responsible for the abuses were convicted.  New allegations have emerged this year, including credible claims that  U.S. security sector assistance may have been misused in the process.   Colombia is an ally of the United States. The U.S. has invested  billions of dollars in the country over the last two decades, including  important investments in security assistance.   We simply cannot afford for this problem to continue. We need a solid  understanding of what has gone wrong in order to figure out how best to  work with the Colombian government to fix it.   That is why this amendment requires a comprehensive report on any  involvement by the Colombian government in unlawful surveillance and  intelligence gathering since 2002. The report incorporates an  assessment of whether any U.S. security sector assistance was involved,  as well as a description of the actions taken by U.S. and Colombian  authorities in response, and recommendations for preventing any  recurrence going forward. The report will also include a review of  Colombian security doctrine and training to ensure that intelligence  operations are conducted consistent with human rights obligations.   I'm very grateful for the bipartisan support this amendment has  received from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Armed  Services Committee. I ask all my colleagues to support this amendment  and En Bloc 2 amendment in which it is included.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Armed Services Committee  Chairman Adam Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry for including my  bipartisan amendment in this en bloc amendment.   This amendment, co-sponsored by Representative Jackie Walorski (IN),  would permanently establish the Wounded Warrior Service Dog Program--a  lifechanging program which has been a part of the DOD ``Defense Health  Programs'' at the Uniformed Services  [[Page H3583]]  University of the Health Sciences for the last six years, and has  consistently received bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment would ensure the program can continue to  aid our nation's veterans by awarding grants to nonprofit organizations  that stand-up, operate, and provide free assistance dogs to veterans  and service members with physical disabilities, PTSD, or traumatic  brain injuries.   I first became passionate about this issue in 2013 when I visited the  National Education for Assistance Dog Services (NEADS), which is  located in my district in Princeton, Massachusetts. Service dogs often  become an integral part of a veteran or servicemember's treatment team  because they provide both physical and emotional support   NEADS told me amazing stories about how service dogs are helping  veterans with physical disabilities, as well as those suffering from  post-traumatic stress. They are trained to help veterans having a  seizure, to remind them to take medications, and even to create a  protective physical barrier in a crowded space.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment would allow the Wounded Warrior Service  Dog Program to continue to effectively expand treatment options for our  veterans and service members around the country.   I ask all my colleagues to support this amendment and En Bloc 2  amendment in which it is included.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Armed Services Committee  Chairman Adam Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry for including my  bipartisan amendment in this en bloc amendment.   Mr. Speaker, the Government of Kuwait owes $677 million to about 45  U.S. hospitals for care provided to Kuwaiti citizens. These debts are  from 2018, 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.   The hospitals affected include some of the finest medical  institutions in the United States. Six of these are in Massachusetts-- as well as hospitals and medical institutions in California, Texas,  Ohio, Illinois, New York, Minnesota and elsewhere.   Our medical facilities have shown great patience with the Government  of Kuwait, waiting for Kuwait to meet its obligations and make these  payments. As my colleagues in the House can understand, hospitals  across the nation are now operating under significant financial stress  because of the COVID-19 pandemic and these debts are adding to their  hardship.   The Kuwaitis say this matter is pending in their parliament. But  that's what they said last year. And the year before that.   It is my understanding that the State Department has been  respectfully trying to resolve this matter, but Kuwait continues to  drag its feet. This lack of responsiveness and accountability is very  frustrating, Mr. Speaker. And I hope this bipartisan expression of  concern might provide a little push towards resolution.   Let me assure the House that we would not have put forward this  bipartisan measure if we thought it might bring economic hardship on  the people of Kuwait. But if you're concerned that $677 million is a  lot to ask from Kuwait, then you will be relieved to know that the  Kuwait sovereign fund, under the Finance Ministry, is the 5th largest  in the world, with assets exceeding $592 billion.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan amendment is very simple: it's a sense  of Congress that says to the Kuwaitis ``pay your bills.'' That's all we  ask: Do the right thing and make these outstanding payments to U.S.  hospitals and medical institutions.   I'm very grateful for the strong bipartisan support this bipartisan  amendment has received from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the  House Armed Services Committee. I would like to thank my colleagues who  have joined me as cosponsors: Representatives Stephen Lynch (MA),  Ayanna Pressley (MA), Bill Keating (MA), Juan Vargas (CA), Lori Trahan  (MA), Joseph P. Kennedy, III (MA), Tim Ryan (OH), Anthony Gonzalez  (OH), David Joyce (OH), John Garamendi (CA) and Jimmy Gomez (CA).   Mr. Speaker, this is a respectful and very measured amendment. We  hope to signal to Kuwait that this matter has been brought to our  attention and we are deeply concerned by the amount and detrimental  impact of these outstanding payments. It is our hope that Kuwait will  resolve this matter promptly and pay its outstanding debts to American  hospitals and medical institutions. Should these debts continue to  linger unresolved, then perhaps next time, Congress will need to  express its concerns in stronger terms.   I ask all my colleagues to support this amendment and the en bloc  amendment in which it is included.
