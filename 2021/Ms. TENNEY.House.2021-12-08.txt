 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize three New York  State Section Four high school teams. This past weekend, for the first  time since 2019, hundreds of players, coaches, parents, and fans from  across the great State of New York returned to Syracuse University's  Carrier Dome to compete for a New York State Public High School  Athletic Association Football Championship.   This past Friday, the Class D, 12-win, undefeated Tioga Tigers, led  by Head Coach Nick Aiello, roared to victory with a 27-0 victory over  the Moriah Vikings, winning their second State championship in school  history.   Saturday's games would bring more fun to New York State's 22nd  District. First, the fourth-seeded Class C, 12-and-1 Blue Devils of  Chenango Forks, led by Head Coach David Hogan, played a rematch of  their 2019 championship game, and again beat the Schuylerville Horses,  this time with a convincing 21-0 shutout victory.   And last, but certainly not least, the 13-and-1, Class B, Maine- Endwell Spartans, led by Head Coach Matt Gallagher, came back from a  12-7 halftime deficit, to outscore the Pleasantville Panthers 14-0 in  the second half, winning their first State championship since 2014.   One State, 27 congressional representatives, five championship  divisions, and New York State's 22nd district took home the trophies in  three of four divisions we competed in.   Congratulations to all teams from the 22nd District.                            ____________________
