 Madam President, I come to the floor again to seek  unanimous consent for a resolution that commemorates the Armenian  genocide.   In October, the House of Representatives passed a version of this  resolution by a vote of 405 to 11--405 to 11. This vote was historic,  and I applaud the bipartisan courage of those in the House to stand up  for what is right.   For those here in the Senate who would consider objecting to this  request, I urge you to think long and hard about what it means for your  reputation, what it means for history, and what it means for the Senate  as an institution. History is watching, and it will not look kindly on  those who object to recognizing genocide.   In recent speeches before the Senate, I have laid out the case for  why we must move forward on this resolution.  [[Page S6874]]  The simple threshold question for this body comes to this: Do we  recognize a clear case of genocide when it happens, or do we let a  country like Turkey determine our own views, determine our own sense of  history, determine our own moral obligation, and determine the public  record--a Turkey that today is committing atrocities against the Kurds  in Syria, a Turkey that has teamed up with Russia and the Kremlin in  purchasing the S-400 air defense system and just recently used it  against an American F-16 to see if it works, and a Turkey that works to  block forward movement in NATO on key national security objectives of  the United States?   At what point do we say enough is enough? At what point do we simply  move forward and acknowledge the truth? The truth is that the Armenian  genocide happened. It is a fact. To deny that is to deny one of the  monstrous acts of history. This denial is a stain on the Senate and our  country. We have an opportunity to right that wrong and put the U.S.  Senate on the right side of history.   Let's again review some of that history here today. More than 104  years ago, the Ottoman Empire launched a systemic campaign to  exterminate the Armenian population through killings, forced  deportations, starvation, and other brutal matters. How do we know  this? How do we know this? Because U.S. diplomats were there. They  wrote it down and sent it back to the State Department in Washington.   Henry Morgenthau, the U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913  to 1916, wrote this in his memoir:         When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these       deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a       whole race; they understood this well, and, in their       conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to       conceal this fact. . . . I am confident that the whole       history of the human race contains no such horrible episode       as this. The great massacres and persecutions of the past       seem almost insignificant when compared to the sufferings of       the Armenian race in 1915.    That is what Henry Morgenthau said.   On June 5, 1915, the U.S. consul in Aleppo, Jesse Jackson, wrote to  Ambassador Morgenthau, saying:         There is a living stream of Armenians pouring into Aleppo       from the surrounding towns and villages.        The [Ottoman] Government has been appealed to by various       prominent people and even by those in authority to put an end       to these conditions, under the representations that it can       only lead to the greatest blame and reproach, but all to no       avail. It is without doubt a carefully planned scheme to       thoroughly extinguish the Armenian race.    On July 24, 1915, in a report to Ambassador Morgenthau, the U.S.  consul in Harput, Leslie Davis, stated: ``Any doubt that may have been  expressed in previous reports as to the Government's intention in  sending away the Armenians have been removed. . . . It has been no  secret that the plan was to destroy the Armenian race as a race. . . .  Everything was apparently planned months ago.   In an October 1, 1916 telegram to Secretary of State Robert Lansing,  U.S. Charge d'Affaires Hoffman Philip wrote, ``The Department is in  receipt of ample details demonstrating the horrors of the anti-Armenian  campaign. For many months past I have felt that the most efficacious  method of dealing with the situation from an international standpoint  would be to flatly threaten to withdraw our Diplomatic Representative  from a country where such barbarous methods are not only tolerated but  actually carried out by order of the existing government.''   And finally, Abram I. Elkus, who served as the United States  Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1916-17, telegrammed the  Secretary of State on October 17, 1916, stating ``In order to avoid  opprobrium of the civilized world, which the continuation of massacres  [of the Armenians] would arouse, Turkish officials have now adopted and  are executing the unchecked policy of extermination through starvation,  exhaustion, and brutality of treatment hardly surpassed even in Turkish  history.''   That continues to verify that these diplomats saw the truth with  their own eyes and communicated back to their superiors in Washington.  They did their job, and the historical record proves it. Now it is up  to individual U.S. Senators to do your job.   The Government of Turkey has funded lobbyists willing to trumpet lies  and make excuses for these atrocities. The Turkish Government and its  sympathizers have advocated for restrictive laws on expression and  against legislation that recognizes the Armenian genocide. They will  stop at nothing to bury the truth. I hope that individual Senators will  not once again fall for it.   Any apprehension, any trepidation on the part of Senators who believe  this resolution will somehow do irreparable harm to our relationship  with Turkey is simply unfounded. Twenty-seven countries have recognized  the genocide in one form or another. Some saw trade increases in Turkey  following their recognition. Twelve members of NATO have recognized the  genocide. They still work with Turkey on defense issues. They still  have embassies in Ankara. Their relationships were not irreparably  harmed. Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece,  Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, and the Slovak  Republic all did the right thing.    I say to my friends and colleagues that genocide is genocide.  Senators in this body should have the simple courage to say it plainly,  say it clearly, and say it without reservation.   In every session of Congress since 2006, I have introduced or  cosponsored resolutions affirming the facts of the Armenian genocide.  When I was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I was  proud to preside over the passage of an Armenian genocide resolution  out of the committee.   The work continues here today. If we are not successful this  afternoon, I know we are not going to stop until we are. I am not going  to stop until I go through every single Senator who is willing to come  to the floor and issue an objection on behalf of the administration  because I think Armenian Americans need to know who stands in support  of recognizing the genocide and who opposes it.   I thank Senator Cruz for joining me in this effort. He has been  stalwart with me in this bipartisan resolution. I thank the 27  additional Senators who have been willing to stand up for a true,  clear-eyed vision: Senators Van Hollen, Rubio, Stabenow, Gardner,  Markey, Cornyn, Warren, Romney, Peters, Portman, Feinstein, Wyden,  Duckworth, Reed, Schumer, Udall, Harris, Whitehouse, Sanders,  Klobuchar, Cardin, Booker, Casey, Bennet, Rosen, Brown, and Cortez  Masto. I thank them all.   Before I ask unanimous consent, I yield to my colleague from Texas.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas for his  eloquent statement and for his forthrightness on this issue.   As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from further consideration of  S. Res. 150 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I  further ask that the resolution be agreed to, that the preamble be  agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, once again, I am deeply disappointed.  This is the third time a Republican Senator has come to the floor to  object to the genocide resolution--the recognition of the genocide  resolution. There is never a good time. There is never a good time. In  my view, there is always the right time, however, to recognize genocide  as genocide.   My colleague from North Dakota actually sponsored H. Res. 220, the  Armenian genocide resolution, affirming ``the proper commemoration and  consistent condemnation of the Armenian Genocide will strengthen our  international standing in preventing modern-day genocides'' when he was  a Member of the House of Representatives. He was right then. He was  right then. The time was right then, and the time is right now.   President Erdogan was here in the United States a couple of weeks  ago. There was a meeting at the White House. A few of my colleagues had  the privilege of joining the President expressing their discontent.  Erdogan was given options--a way out of the dilemma that Turkey has put  themselves in with the S-400. Basically, they were told either return  to Russia and destroy them in our presence and/or give them to us,  which, of course, Russia will never allow that to happen, for us to  have their technology.   There was a deadline. It was yesterday. I waited until today to make  sure that in fact we wouldn't intercede in any way with that  possibility. Turkey, in the interim, while this is going on, they used  the S-400 to fire at an F-16 to see if they could take it down. Really?  Really?   So this premise that there was a meeting in NATO--well, there was a  meeting in Washington, and then there was a meeting in NATO. They still  haven't done anything on the S-400. They still haven't exercised any of  the options that have been given to them.   I just want my colleagues to know that I intend to come once a week  to the Senate floor, and all those who want to be listed on the wrong  side of history, they have the option of doing so. I am not going to  cease until we do what is morally and principally right, and that is to  recognize the Armenian genocide as a host of other nations have done as  well.   I yield the floor.
