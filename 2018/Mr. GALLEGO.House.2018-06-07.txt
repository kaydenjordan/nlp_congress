 Mr. Speaker, as you know, Members of this House disagree  on a whole range of topics, but one rare point of bipartisan agreement  concerns the ZTE Corporation.   We have all heard complaints about the theft of trade secrets by ZTE  and other major Chinese companies. We all know that when American  companies are forced into licensing and disclosure agreements with  Chinese State-owned enterprises, American technology is as good as  stolen. We have all sat through hearings and briefings on the  significant threat that ZTE and its brother, Huawei, pose to our  national security. That is why it is concerning that President Trump  decided to let ZTE off the hook for secretly doing business with Iran  and North Korea.   Of course, this decision wasn't the only one affecting international  trade that the Trump administration has made in recent weeks. He is  imposing tariffs on our allies in Europe, Canada, and Mexico. His  Ambassador to Germany has disgraced himself in the capital of our  biggest European partner. He continues to insult our best trading  partners by labeling them as security threats.   That is right, Mr. Speaker. Donald Trump is giving aid and comfort to  ZTE, a known corporate enemy of America, while at the same time going  out of his way to alienate our closest friends and allies around the  world. But why?   I am sure it is just a fluke that Trump is allowing ZTE to resume its  purchases of U.S. technology immediately following China's decision to  award Ivanka Trump seven new Chinese trademarks.   I am positive it is just a coincidence that Trump cut a deal with ZTE  right away after various Chinese entities offered $1 billion in  financing to a resort with ties to the Trump organization. Just a  coincidence.   There is nothing to see here, says the Trump administration. Don't  ask any questions. Don't demand any information. Just look the other  way.   How did we get here, Mr. Speaker? Where is the Grand Old Party as  Donald Trump erodes our alliances, makes nice with our enemies, and  ignites a global trade war?   We need to get to the bottom of whether there was a quid pro quo with  China over ZTE, and we need to get to work on tough legislation to  prevent China from illicitly acquiring American technology, especially  technology with important defense applications and capabilities.   Bipartisan bills for this purpose with broad support from both  parties have already been introduced. The Republican leadership should  immediately bring those bipartisan bills to the floor for debate and  consideration. That is what the American people expect. They want this  body to stand up to America's adversaries and to stand up for America's  laws and values.                                time  1030    They want us to reassert our power as a coequal branch of government.   Trump is tearing down America's alliances. We must preserve them.   Trump is sucking up to dictators and repressive regimes all around  the world. We must condemn them.   More importantly, Trump and his cronies are using the Presidency to  enrich themselves, and we must stop them.   Let's put an end to the Trump of business model: quid pro quo, pay to  play, this for that.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the day when my Republican friends are  courageous enough to say out loud what many of them whisper here in  these hallways: that coddling Chinese companies like ZTE is reckless,  that attacking our allies is dangerous, that using high office for  personal gain is flat-out wrong.
