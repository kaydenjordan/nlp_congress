 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning, U.S. Capitol Police  Officer Brian Sicknick lies in honor under the dome of the institution  he swore to defend--and died defending.   Four weeks ago, the Rotunda was strewn with the debris of an  insurrectionist mob. Today, it is adorned in solemn thanksgiving for  the sacrifice of a hero. On January 6, those who sought to obstruct our  democracy were confronted by a sworn officer and military veteran who  was determined to protect it. In the face of lawlessness, Brian  Sicknick paid the ultimate price to uphold a solemn oath. He gave our  Nation the last full measure of devotion.   Our democratic Republic was built to endure, but it needs heroes like  the officers of the U.S. Capitol Police to support and defend it. So,  today, we mourn and give thanks for the true patriot who lies in the  Rotunda. The Senate and the entire country send our deepest condolences  to Officer Sicknick's family and all who loved him. His name will never  be forgotten.                                   Schools    Now, Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, this pandemic  has forced Americans to confront numerous and compounding tragedies.  Almost 450,000 Americans have been killed; millions of livelihoods have  been upended; and millions of American kids, especially those who  attend public school, have been robbed of an entire year--and  counting--of proper school.   Despite heroic efforts from students, parents, and teachers, so- called remote learning has proven a poor substitute for the real thing.  Research suggests that, even if the average remote-learning student had  gotten back in the classroom last month, they would already have missed  multiple months' worth of learning compared to a normal year.   Forty percent of high schoolers in St. Paul now have failing grades.  In Houston, it is 40 percent of all students. Tampa's school district  has reportedly just lost track of thousands of kids altogether--and  this pain isn't spread equally. The worst has fallen on the most  vulnerable, including lower income households, students of color, and  students with special needs and their families.   The fallout isn't just academic. Replacing the structure,  friendships, and activities of school with isolated screen time has  predictably caused spikes in mental health concerns. Schools normally  keep an eye on kids with challenging home lives and are too often the  most reliable sources of hot meals and on and on.   We know with certainty now that K-12 schooling cannot move online  indefinitely, like a white-collar workplace. It is more like routine  medical procedures--something that can be postponed a few weeks in a  pinch but which our society really cannot do without, and some families  aren't having to. Many private and parochial schools have been in  person since the fall, and many European countries have kept kids in  school nearly this whole time, but in places across America, where  public education depends on the whims of powerful public sector unions,  the best interests of children have often come dead last.   As the months have rolled by and the data have poured in, it has  become clear that schools can open safely. Just last week, CDC  researchers affirmed:  [[Page S275]]  ``With proper prevention efforts . . . we can keep transmission in  schools and educational settings quite low.''   This confirms what scientists were observing as far back as October,  when it was reported: ``Transmission by young children to adults seems  to be negligible as long as safety measures are in place.''   Dr. Fauci, whose expertise was supposed to guide the Biden  administration's whole approach, said last week: ``We can keep the  children in school and get them back to school safely.'' That is Dr.  Fauci.   An administration that puts facts and science first would be  conducting a full-court press to open schools.   Federal funding is not an obstacle. That is more goalpost-moving.  Congress has poured more than $110 billion into making education safe.  As of last week, States and local school districts had only spent about  $4 billion of the roughly $68 billion we set aside for K-12 schools.  That leaves $64 billion in the pipeline already.   Remember, science tells us that schools are largely made safe with  simple precautions. Science is not the obstacle. Federal money is not  the obstacle. The obstacle is a lack of willpower not among students,  not among parents--just among the rich, powerful unions that donate  huge sums to Democrats and get a stranglehold over education in many  communities.   Apparently, Big Labor's talking points have already displaced Dr.  Fauci as the White House go-to source. The President's Chief of Staff  keeps saying we need even more massive Federal funding before teachers  can go back. There is no scientific basis for that, none whatsoever.   The goalpost-moving doesn't stop with money. In several places, these  unions sought to elbow toward the front of the line for vaccinations-- only to turn around and say: Thanks for those vaccinations but don't  think these will necessarily get our folks back in the classroom any  time soon.   Too often, local officials just roll over and submit to these  tactics. In my hometown of Louisville, KY, the largest school district  in the State has a union-funded board of education vice chair. He is  now saying that, even if all school personnel get vaccines, he would  still be reluctant to open schools. In San Francisco, the 28-year-old  board of education president--28 years old--argued a few days ago that  vulnerable kids aren't really missing out on learning; they are just  learning different things, and it is the system's fault for not  measuring all of the valuable cultural experiences they have had while  being stuck at home.   What nonsense.   Families are losing patience--and fast. We could not function with  remote police or remote firefighters or remote dental surgeons, and we  would never pretend otherwise. Kids, parents, and a lot of talented  teachers have given online learning their all, but we will be deluding  ourselves if we continue to accept this pale shadow of proper schooling  when all of the science--all of it--points the other way.   No more goalpost-moving. States and districts have got to follow the  science and get American education back on track                            Budget Reconciliation    Mr. President, on a related matter, in the past year, Congress has  worked together to pass five major rescue packages on a bipartisan  basis. The Democratic leader spent months saying that any pandemic  relief should pass with broad bipartisan support.   He said last July: ``Sitting in your own office, writing a bill, and  then demanding the other side support it is not anyone's idea of  bipartisanship.''   But, yesterday, less than a day after several Senate Republicans  spent, literally, 2 hours meeting with President Biden, Senate  Democrats plowed ahead with a party-line vote to set the table for a  partisan jam. The new President talks a lot about unity, but his White  House staff and congressional leadership are working with a different  playbook.   We will be discussing the facts on schools, on jobs, and on  healthcare in depth in the days to come, but the rushed budget process  that will play out this week is exactly the wrong path toward making  law. Senate Republicans will be ready and waiting with a host of  amendments to improve the rushed procedural step that is being jammed  through.   We will be getting Senators on the record about whether taxpayers  should fund checks for illegal immigration, whether Democrats should  raise taxes on small businesses in the midst of this historic crisis,  and whether generous Federal funding should pour into school districts  where the unions refuse to let schools open, and this is just a small  taste.   The American people will see Republicans are focused on smart and  responsible policies to reopen the country, and they will see Democrats  who seem desperate to make their first act in power the same kind of  massive, partisan, poorly targeted borrowing spree that permanently  wounded the last Democratic Presidency right out of the gate.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I appreciate these assurances from  the majority leader. The right to offer amendments is important to  Senators on our side as well, and we look forward to full and vigorous  debates, including amendments, as the Senate takes up the many  important issues before us. On a related note, I have discussed with  the majority leader concerns that have been raised about debates on  motions to proceed. I think many times cloture has to be filed on a  motion to proceed because Members want to ensure they are given the  right to offer amendments. Given the assurances regarding the ability  of Senators to debate and amend legislation in this Congress, that  should help in alleviating that practice. Also, when we are proceeding  to bills with broad bipartisan support, it is my hope that we will not  need to have lengthy debates on motions to proceed.   The resolution provides that the committee budgets and office space  will be divided equally, subject to the customary set-aside for  administrative expenses and nondesignated staff. It is our expectation  that the details of those arrangements will be negotiated and agreed to  by the respective chair and ranking member, in consultation with other  members of each committee.
