 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment with  Representative Ayanna Pressley. This amendment works to ensure that  people with disabilities are able to access registered apprenticeships  on an equal basis with their nondisabled peers.   Three cogent facts: The workforce participation rate for people with  disabilities is still less than one-third that of nondisabled peers;  number two, among people with disabilities actively seeking work, the  unemployment rate is twice that of nondisabled workers; and number  three, people with disabilities are less likely to have meaningful  access to participate in apprenticeship programs.   This amendment ensures that individuals with disabilities will be  able to access apprenticeship programs that will help them develop the  skills and build a work history that will open doors to their future.   This can also help employers understand the value of this workforce  and learn from experience that accommodating a disabled employee is  usually a simple, inexpensive process that benefits the employee, the  employer, and, ultimately, all of us who benefit from having an engaged  and diverse workforce.   I thank Representative Susan Davis for this bill and the leadership  of our chairman,  Bobby Scott.
