 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the school  board members from the seven school districts in my district in  recognition of School Board Member Appreciation Month.   I am incredibly grateful for the extremely devoted school board  members across my district from Aldine, Houston, Galena Park,  Channelview, Sheldon, Pasadena, and Humble ISDs.   These folks are doing incredible work on behalf of the people and are  the most important public servants I can think of. They are shaping the  next generation of leaders by ensuring our schools are places where  students can learn, explore, and dream.   I know that keeping our schools running smoothly and safely comes  with plenty of late nights and a lot of behind-the-scenes work. I am  truly grateful for the work of all these school board members and their  service to the next generation of leaders. I thank them for always  putting children over politics, classrooms over bathrooms, books over  bullets, and teaching over talking points.                            ____________________
