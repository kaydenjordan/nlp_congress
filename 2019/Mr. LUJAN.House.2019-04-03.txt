 Mr. Chair, I want to share a story of one of my  constituents, Rayen. Her story is hard to hear, but we cannot tune it  out.   When Rayen first reached out for protection, her partner, Daniel, had  struck her with a wrench, raped her, and strangled her to the point of  unconsciousness. But Tribal police had little jurisdiction over Daniel,  who is not Native American. They were forced to turn the case over to  Federal prosecutors.   Next, Rayen went missing. Her body was found several weeks later,  beaten and strangled.   Rayen's story is representative of the violence women, especially  Native women, face every day. This violence is an epidemic in our  country. Native women are 10 times more likely to be murdered than any  other ethnicity.   We need to act. The Violence Against Women Act is a pillar of our  Federal response to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence,  and stalking.   Passage of H.R. 1585 will ensure that every survivor of domestic  violence is given the protection they need to rebuild their lives after  experiencing violence.   Mr. Chair, please join me in voting for this legislation in memory of  Rayen and in memory of all the women who have faced domestic violence  and assault.
