 Madam Speaker, Americans are seeing the  impacts of inflation every day, with rising costs everywhere from the  gas pump to the grocery store. California workers and families are  bearing the brunt of this nationwide, 13-year inflation high.   Prices of everyday goods in my State are, in many cases, higher than  the national average. For example, the average price of a gallon of  regular gasoline in California's 39th District is more than $1 higher  than the national average.   Additionally, these higher costs come in addition to high State and  local taxes, cost of living, and astronomical housing costs. June  statistics showed the median housing price in my district rose more  than 20 percent, with the median price of a single-family home being  more than $800,000.   That is why I am disappointed that instead of working with  Republicans to address inflation, get Americans back  [[Page H3799]]  to work, and support small businesses, Democrats are moving forward  with trillions more in Federal spending on a partisan wish list that  will cause increased Federal debt, an even higher cost of living, and  more money out of the pockets of hardworking taxpayers.   We should be making life more affordable, not less.
