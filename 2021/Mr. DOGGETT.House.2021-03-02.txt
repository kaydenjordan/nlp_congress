 Madam Speaker, this bill restores guardrails to our  democracy that almost went off the rails as Republicans pledged their  loyalty to the cult of Donald Trump. Republicans have long found  success creatively suppressing the votes, restrictive voter ID laws,  limiting voter hours, locations, and extreme gerrymandering.   Having repressed votes for so long, it is hardly a surprise that  their reaction to those voters who manage to overcome the many  obstacles placed in their way is now turned to throwing out and  repressing the vote and ignoring the will of the majority.   Fearing voters, fearing accountability, in their opposition to this  bill and in legislative efforts across the country in some 43 States,  the Republican solution to losing power in the last election is to  reduce the number of voters in the next election.   Truth for them is not a matter of the facts. It is whatever Trump  declares. Fraud is their description of any election that they lose.    Today's bill favors turning out the votes, not throwing  them out. Let's protect American democracy which worships, above all,  the voice of the people expressed through free and fair elections; not  bowing before the golden idol of one who has betrayed our country.
