 Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I want  to start by reminding everyone why this is happening. It is not about  abortion. It is not about the Dobbs decision. This is about a  tyrannical executive branch walking all over the U.S. Senate and doing  our jobs.   In November, I got word that the Pentagon was thinking about spending  taxpayer dollars to facilitate elective abortions. This goes beyond  what the law--which was passed here--the law allows. The law only  allows the Department of Defense to facilitate and fund abortions in  the cases of rape, incest, and the life of the mother.   Now, I warned Secretary Austin that if he did this and changed this,  I would put a hold on his highest level nominees. Secretary Austin went  through with the policy anyway in February of this year. So I am  keeping my word. This was Secretary Austin's choice, not mine. He knew  the consequences for several months. Nothing in the law allows  Secretary Austin to facilitate elective abortions. In fact, the law  just says the opposite. So this was Secretary Austin's choice.   Secretary Austin thought abortion is more important than his highest  level military nominations. Secretary Austin could end the policy  today, and I would lift my hold. Secretary Austin has chosen not to do  that.   This is the fourth time the Democrats have come to the floor to try  to break this hold. I will come down here as many times as it takes.   The Senator from Massachusetts claims that my hold on the Pentagon  nominations is affecting readiness and so have the other Senators who  have come to this floor. Senator Schumer said last week on this floor  multiple times that it was affecting readiness. Several other Senators  have said the same thing. Democrats keep repeating the same talking  points and the same opinion, but not one of them has cited any facts-- not one.   I even asked the Pentagon to explain to me how this affects  readiness. All I have heard is opinions like we just heard from Senator  Warren. The senior Senator has been asking questions from the Pentagon.   On April 6, the senior Senator sent this letter to Mr. Austin. The  full letter may be found at https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/ doc/2023.04.06%20Letter%20to%20DoD%20on %20Tuberville%20Holds.pdf.   The letter asks about the effects of my hold on military readiness. I  will answer right now. My hold has no effect on readiness, none.   In an Armed Services Committee hearing last week, Senator Reed asked  two of the military top combatant commanders what impact would my hold  have on readiness. ADM John Aquilino said: ``No impact.'' John Paul  LaCamera agreed. There is no impact on readiness or operations.   Experts have known for more than a decade that the military is  topheavy. We do not suffer from a lack of generals. Democrats are  concerned with promotions of generals but have shown very little to no  concern about our historic recruitment crisis--and it is a crisis.  Right now, the military is missing more than 20,000 enlisted soldiers  from last year's short on recruiting. That is in addition to another  8,000 that President Biden, for some reason, kicked out of the military  over vaccine mandates.   So we are missing 28,000 enlisted troops right now, and the Democrats  are panicking about 180 generals and admirals.   Last week, a report showed that the Army, Navy, and Air Force--all of  them are preparing to miss their recruitment goals this year, and  nobody is talking about it. They will miss their goals by thousands and  thousands of new servicemembers. Yet I don't hear Democrats say a word  about it. They are worried about 180 top-level generals and admirals.  We have plenty of generals.   When my dad served in World War II, we had one general for every  6,000 troops. Think about that--1 for every 6,000. Now we have 1  general for every 1,400 enlisted servicemembers. That is more than four  times the ratio of generals to troops. That is a lot of money. We won  plenty of wars with a lower ratio. Again, bipartisan experts have shown  this for more than a decade.   Let me mention a few examples. Here is an article from Ben Freeman of  the Project of Government Oversight from 2011. It is entitled: ``The  Most Top-Heavy Force in U.S. History,'' found at https://www.pogo.org/ analysis/2011/11/todays-military-most-top-heavy-force-in-us-history.   The author talks about testifying before the Senate on this issue. He  also mentioned a nearly 25-percent increase in three-star and four-star  generals in the previous decade. Over the same time, the increase in  enlisted members was just 2 percent--2 percent. People who actually do  the work.   I have a report from Third Way from 2013, which may be found at  https://www.thirdway.org/report/star-creep-the-costs-of-a-top-heavy- military.   Here is what this centrist organization said in their report 10 years  ago. It is called ``Star Creep: The effects of the top-heavy  military.''   The story says:         America's armed forces have far too many generals and       admirals--a situation that wastes money and creates a drag on       military effectiveness. Although the U.S. military is 30%       smaller now than it was at the end of the Cold War, it has       almost 20% percent more three and four-star officers. [Twenty       percent.] The layers of bureaucracy to support them have       grown as well, slowing down decision-making and burdening the       warfighter.        We need to trim the fat, which will make our military both       leaner and more effective.    That was 10 years ago.   Here is another article. This one is from the Washington Times in  2016, which may be found at https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/ apr/5/ash-carter-says-us-military-too-top-heavy-aims-cut.   The title of the article: ``Ashton Carter says U.S. military too `top  heavy,' aims to cut ranks of generals and admirals.''   Ash Carter was President Obama's Department of Defense Secretary. He  felt the military was also topheavy. Both of President Obama's  Secretaries of Defense agreed with that. The late Senator John McCain  agreed with that statement. Again, this has been common knowledge in  military circles for a decade. Yet now my Democratic colleagues have  selective memories.   Finally, I will just mention one more article from the Washington  Times from this past January. It is called ``Top Heavy: U.S. military  bloated by brass as officer-to-enlisted ratio dwarfs Cold War era,''  which may be found at https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/jan/29/ top-heavy-us-military-bloated-brass-officer-enlist.   Here are a few numbers from the article. In World War I, we had one  officer for every 15 enlisted. In World War II, it was one of every  ten. Today the ratio is 1 to 4.   Today we have more admirals than we have ships. Let me repeat that:  We have more admirals in our military than we have ships.   Yet the Democratic side of the aisle is in panic that we don't have  enough admirals; it just doesn't make sense. In the first century of  this Nation, we only had a handful of three-star generals ever. George  Washington and Ulysses S. Grant were the first two three-star generals  in our history. Today we have more than 160 three-star generals.  Overall, there are more than 650 generals today. ``Star creep'' is  putting this very mildly.   This hysteria on the other side of the aisle has absolutely no basis  in fact. They have complained about my holds for weeks, but they still  haven't shown me one single fact.   So I am looking forward to Secretary Austin's response to Senator  Warren. I can't wait to read it. In the meantime, I am not going to  budge. I will come down here as many times as it takes day and night to  vote. I am not afraid to vote. We are working a 3-day week this week.  We just took a 2-week recess earlier this month. And if Democrats are  so worried about the military readiness, then why are we taking days  off? Let's vote. We can vote these. I mean, it is not like I am holding  them and they can't be confirmed.   We can vote on every one of these people. Just call them up on the  floor. We can vote on them. Everybody needs to vote. I am not afraid to  work. I will stay here as long as it takes. And let me remind my  colleagues that we just voted--and confirmed--last week a military  nominee, the way we are supposed to do it, instead of a hundred at a  time.   Clearly, we are capable of voting on military nominees and  promotions. We  [[Page S1326]]  could also be voting on legislation that expands the DOD's abortion  policy. We can bring it right here and vote. That is our job--instead  of the Secretary of Defense playing Congress and doing bills on his  own. That is not how this place is supposed to work. In fact, that is  how this should be done in a democracy.   So, finally, let me remind my Democratic colleagues again: I gave the  Pentagon fair warning. I told them if they imposed this policy on our  country, then I would hold these nominees. They chose to go forward  with this policy anyway. They forced my hand. This was the Biden  administration's choice. All I am doing is keeping my word, and that is  why I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I want to make something very, very  clear here. None of these positions the Senator from Massachusetts has  mentioned will go unfilled. Each role has its commander in place until  the relief is confirmed. That is how the military works.   Mr. President, one thing very important to me and to our country is  our military. There is only one thing more important, and that is our  Constitution that they protect. For that reason, I object.
