 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                    Morocco--Additional F-16 Ammunition         The Government of Morocco has requested a possible sale of       five thousand eight hundred and ten (5,810) MK82-1 Bombs       (Tritonal); three hundred (300) MK84-4 Bombs (Tritonal); one       hundred and five (105) Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM)       KMU-572F/B Tail Kits; one hundred eighty (180) MXU-651B/B Air       Foil Groups (AFG), GBU-10; four thousand one hundred twenty       five (4,125) MXU-650C/B AFGs, GBU-12; four thousand three       hundred and five (4,305) MAU-169L/B Computer Control Groups       (CCG), GBU-10, -12, -16; and five thousand one hundred       seventy-eight (5,178) FMU-152 Fuzes. Also included are flares       M-206, Flares MJU-7A/B, Impulse Cartridges BBU-36, Impulse       Cartridges BBU-35/B, Bomb Sensor DSU-33C/B, chaff, bomb       components, spares, repair parts, support equipment,       publications and technical documentation, engineering       technical and support services, and other related elements of       logistics, transportation, and program support. The estimated       cost is $209 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a major Non-NATO ally that continues to be an       important force for political stability and economic progress       in Africa.        The proposed sale will improve Morocco's capability to meet       current and future threats of terror from violent extremist       organizations prevalent throughout the region. Additionally,       the additional munitions provided by this sale will improve       interoperability with the United States and other regional       allies and enhance Morocco's ability to undertake coalition       operations, as it has done in the past in flying sorties       against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Morocco will have no       difficulty absorbing these additional munitions and services       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the       basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Raytheon USA, Orbital ATK       (USA), General Dynamics, Kilgore Cheming Groupe (USA),       Cheming Groupe (USA), and Kaman Precision Products (USA). The       purchaser typically requests offsets, however there are no       known offset agreements at this time in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require U.S.       Government or contractor representatives to be assigned to       Morocco.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-38       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology.        1. Sensitive and/or classified (up to SECRET) elements of       the proposed sale include munitions and support equipment:       MK82-1 Bomb (Tritonal), MAU-169L/B, MXU-651B/B, MXU-650C/B,       Fuzes FMU-152A/B, and JDAM MK-84 KMU-572 F/B. The hardware,       software, and data identified are classified to protect       vulnerabilities, design and performance parameters, and other       similar critical information.        2. GBU-10/12/16/58 Paveway II (PWII), a Laser Guided Bomb       (LGB), is a maneuverable, free-fall weapon that guides to a       spot of laser energy reflected off the target. The LGB is       delivered like a normal general purpose (GP) warhead, and the       semi-active guidance corrects for many of the normal errors       inherent in any delivery system. Laser designation for the       LGB consists of a Computer Control Group (CCG) that is not       warhead specific, and a warhead specific Air Foil Group (AFG)       that attaches to the nose and tail of a GP bomb body. The       PWII can use either the FMU-152 or FMU-139D/B fuzes. The       overall weapon is CONFIDENTIAL. The GBU-10 is a 2,000 lb (MK-      84 or BLU-117 B/B) GP bomb body fitted with the MXU-650 AFG,       and MAU-209C/B or MAU-168L/B CCGs to guide to its laser       designated target. MK-82 bomb body's hardware are       UNCLASSIFIED.        3. Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) is a Joint Service       weapon which uses an onboard GPS-aided Inertial Navigation       System (INS) Guidance Set with a MK82, MK83, MK84, BLU-109,       BLU-100, BLU-111, BLU-117, BLU-126 (Navy) or BLU-129 warhead.       The Guidance Set, when combined with a warhead and       appropriate fuze, forms a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit (GBU). The       JDAM Guidance Set gives these bombs adverse weather       capability with improved accuracy. The JDAM weapon can be       delivered from modest standoff ranges at high or low       altitudes against a variety of land and surface targets       during the day or night. After release, JDAM autonomously       guides to a target using the resident GPS-aided INS guidance       system. JDAM is capable of receiving target coordinates via       preplanned mission data from the delivery aircraft, by       onboard aircraft sensors (i.e. FLIR, Radar, etc.) during       captive carry, or from a third party source via manual or       automated aircrew cockpit entry. The JDAM as an All Up Round       is UNCLASSIFIED; technical data for JDAM is classified up to       SECRET.        4. Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) FMU-152 is a multi-delay,       multi-arm and proximity sensor compatible with general       purpose blast, frag and hardened-target penetrator weapons.       The JPF settings are cockpit selectable in flight when used       with JDAM weapons.        5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        6. A determination has been made that Morocco can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        7. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Morocco.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The TOW 2A, Radio Frequency (RF) Missiles (BGM-71-4B-      RF) is a direct attack missile designed to defeat armored       vehicles, reinforced urban structures, field fortifications       and other such targets. TOW missiles are fired from a variety       of TOW launchers in the U.S. Army, USMC, and FMS customer       forces. The TOW 2A RF missile can be launched from the same       launcher platforms as the existing wire-guided TOW 2A missile       without modification to the launcher. The TOW 2A missile       (both wire & RF) contains two tracker beacons (xenon and       thermal) for the launcher to track and guide the missile in       flight. Guidance commands from the launcher are provided to       the missile by a RF link contained within the commands from       the missile case. The hardware, software, and technical       publications provided with the sale are UNCLASSIFIED.       However, the system itself contains sensitive technology that       instructs the system on how to operate in the presence of       countermeasures.         2. Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) is designed       to fire all existing versions of the TOW missile and consists       of a Target Acquisition Subsystem (TAS), a Fire Control       Subsystem (FCS), a Li-Ion Battery Box (LBB), a modified       Traversing Unit (TU) plus the standard launch tube and       tripod. The ITAS provides for the integration of both the       direct view optics and a second generation Standard Advanced       Dewar Assembly (SADA) II thermal sensor into a single       housing; direct view optics that provide viewing the target       scene in daylight and non-obscured conditions; introduction       of both passive and active eye safe laser-ranging;       development of embedded training and training sustainment;       automatic bore sight which allows the gunner to align the       night vision system with the direct view optics; insertion of       advanced Built-in Test/Built-in Test Equipment (BIT/BITE)       which provides fault detection and recognition and go/no go       status for the gunner; and an Aided Target Tracker (A17) that       provides the capability to process infrared imagery into       recognizable contour features used to assist the gunner's aim       point.         3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.         4. A determination has been made that Morocco can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.         5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Morocco.                            ____________________
