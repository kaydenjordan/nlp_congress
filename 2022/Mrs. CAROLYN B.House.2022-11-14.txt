 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (S. 533) to require a guidance clarity  statement on certain agency guidance, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 533         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Guidance Clarity Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. GUIDANCE CLARITY STATEMENT REQUIRED.         (a) Requirement.--Each agency, as defined in section 551 of       title 5, United States Code, shall include a guidance clarity       statement as described in subsection (b) on any guidance       issued by that agency under section 553(b)(3)(A) of title 5,       United States Code, on and after the date that is 30 days       after the date on which the Director of the Office of       Management and Budget issues the guidance required under       subsection (c).        (b) Guidance Clarity Statement.--A guidance clarity       statement required under subsection (a) shall--        (1) be displayed prominently on the first page of the       document; and        (2) include the following: ``The contents of this document       do not have the force and effect of law and do not, of       themselves, bind the public or the agency. This document is       intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding       existing requirements under the law or agency policies.''.        (c) OMB Guidance.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of       Management and Budget shall issue guidance to implement this       Act.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 533 would require Federal agencies to include a  guidance clarity statement on the first page of guidance documents.   Federal Rules, regulations, and guidance are complex, even at best of  times. For most Americans who do not spend hours per day reading  through the Federal Register, guidance documents can be very confusing.  This simple, good government bill will help clarify for the public that  agency guidance is intended to help guide the implementation of Federal  regulations, not to act as additional legally binding rules.   I thank Representative Luetkemeyer and Ranking Member Comer for  working with us to perfect this bill. This is a bipartisan bill which  has passed the Senate by unanimous consent.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation  so it can be sent to the President's desk, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman  from Pennsylvania has no further speakers, then I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  S. 533, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (S. 3655) to amend the Civil Rights Cold  Case Records Collection Act of 2018 to extend the termination date of  the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3655         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Civil Rights Cold Case       Investigations Support Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. CIVIL RIGHTS COLD CASE RECORDS REVIEW BOARD EXTENSION                     OF TENURE.         Section 5(n)(1) of Civil Rights Cold Case Records       Collection Act of 2018 (44 U.S.C. 2107 note; Public Law 115-      426) is amended--        (1) by striking ``4 years'' and inserting ``7 years''; and        (2) by striking ``4-year period'' and inserting ``7-year       period''.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3655, a bill to amend the  Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 to extend the  termination date of the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board.   I would like to begin by celebrating that this bill is bipartisan. It  is co-led by Senators Jon Ossoff and Ted Cruz, and a companion bill was  introduced in the House by my colleague,   Bobby Rush of Illinois.   The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 requires  public disclosure of cold case files from the civil rights era that are  still in the possession of Federal agencies. The 2018 law also created  a review board tasked to review any agency decisions to delay public  disclosure of civil rights cold case files within their possession.   As part of their examination, the review board will submit  recommendations to the President, who has final decisionmaking  authority over the public records disclosure. Under current law, the  review board will be terminated by January of 2024.   This bill, S. 3655, revises the initial term of the board from 4 to 7  years with an optional extension year, if needed. The extension is  critical because the work of the review board has been delayed.   The prior administration did not nominate members to the board when  the bill was enacted in 2018. The current administration nominated  board members in 2021, and all members were confirmed by February of  2022.   As a result of delays in nomination and confirmation of the review  board members, S. 3655 provides the board additional time to complete  its mission.   This bill has bipartisan support. In addition, the National Archives  supports this bill because the extensions will ensure that review board  members have enough time to complete their assignments.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of the  Civil Rights Cold Case Investigations Support Act, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), from the First District,  chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy with the Committee on Energy and  Commerce, and the House sponsor of the Civil Rights Cold Case  Investigation Support Act of 2022.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), from the 12th  District, who is the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Transportation  and Maritime Security with the Committee on Homeland Security.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  S. 3655, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (S. 3510) to require the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget to issue guidance with respect to  natural disaster resilience, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3510         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Disaster Resiliency Planning       Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

(2) Briefing.--Not later than 2 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Director shall brief the       appropriate congressional committees on the implementation of       the guidance required under subsection (a) across agencies.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3510, the Disaster Resiliency Planning Act, was  introduced by my colleague and counterpart in the Senate, Chairman Gary  Peters, along with Senator Rick Scott, and it passed the Senate by  unanimous consent in June. Our colleague, Representative Troy Carter,  is leading companion legislation in the House, which is also  bipartisan.   This commonsense, bipartisan bill takes action to implement an  important recommendation made by the Government Accountability Office  last year. In 2021, GAO issued a report on the efforts of Federal  agencies to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars by mitigating  the impact of natural disasters on Federal property and assets like  buildings, roads, bridges, and levees.   In the 5 years leading up to the report, billions of taxpayer dollars  were spent repairing the damage done to Federal assets by natural  disasters, and current trends demonstrate that the frequency and  severity of natural disasters are increasing as a result of climate  change.   As the largest real property owner in the United States, the Federal  Government's fiscal exposure to natural disasters is deeply concerning.  The Federal Government lacks a comprehensive, strategic approach to  resilience, which is key to addressing this risk and protecting  taxpayer dollars.   Fortunately, agencies have made good progress in creating action  plans that identify extreme weather vulnerabilities and steps that can  be taken to address them. GAO's report recommended the crucial next  step that agencies should be directed to incorporate these assessments  into their asset management investment decisions.   That recommendation remains open today, but this bipartisan bill will  ensure that it finally gets done. Within 180 days, OMB would be  required to establish guidance for the incorporation of natural  disaster resilience into the real property asset management and  investment decisions of Federal agencies. As recommended by GAO,  agencies would be required to incorporate their natural disaster risk  information assessments into such decisions.   This commonsense, good government bill has been informed by years of  GAO analysis and will protect taxpayer dollars by prioritizing cost- effective resilience strategies. We must implement these action plans  before the next superstorm or wildfire deals yet another blow to our  Federal assets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  S. 3510, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (S. 1941) to direct the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget to standardize the use of core-based  statistical area designations across Federal programs, to allow between  120 and 180 days for public comment on any proposed change to such  designations, and to report on the scientific basis and estimated  impact to Federal programs for any proposed change to such  designations, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1941         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Metropolitan Areas       Protection and Standardization Act of 2021'' or the ``MAPS       Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Federal programs use core-based statistical area       delineations to determine the delivery of Federal services,       benefits, and funding to people in the United States, such as       in criteria for eligibility or distribution.        (2) Core-based statistical area delineations provide a       nationally consistent set of standards for collecting,       tabulating, and publishing Federal statistics for geographic       areas, and they are not intended for any public or private       sector non-statistical uses such as program administration or       service delivery.        (3) Updates to core-based statistical area delineations may       cause widespread disruption to the delivery of Federal       services, benefits, and funding to people in the United       States based on the reliance of Federal programs on these       delineations.        (4) There does not exist any comprehensive list of Federal       programs that rely on core-based statistical area       delineations. Such a list is valuable for the study of how       Federal services, benefits, and funding are distributed to       people in the United States.        (5) Increased transparency on the impacts of any update to       core-based statistical area delineations may be overly       burdensome due to the anticipated variety of Federal programs       that rely on these delineations. Any requirement for complete       disclosure of these impacts prior to implementation of new       delineations may unintentionally cause the existing       delineations to ossify.        (6) In order to prevent any disruption to service delivery       of Federal programs based on updates to core-based       statistical area delineations, and ensure the independence of       Federal statistical policymaking, Congress must sever the       link between future updates to core-based statistical area       delineations and any automatic impact on Federal programs       that rely on these delineations.       SEC. 3. PURPOSE.         This purpose of this Act is to ensure--        (1) transparency in how core-based statistical area       delineations are used in domestic assistance programs; and        (2) independence of the Office of Management and Budget in       establishing and updating core-based statistical area       delineations.       SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given the       term in section 551 of title 5, United States Code.        (2) Comptroller general.--The term ``Comptroller General''       means the Comptroller General of the United States.        (3) Core-based statistical area.--The term ``core-based       statistical area'' has the  [[Page H8484]]       meaning given the term by the Office of Management and Budget       in the Notice of Decision entitled ``2020 Standards for       Delineating Core-Based Statistical Areas'', published in the       Federal Register on July 16, 2021 (86 Fed. Reg. 37770), or       any successor to that Notice.        (4) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of       the Office of Management and Budget.        (5) Domestic assistance program.--The term ``domestic       assistance program'' has the meaning given the term in       section 6101 of title 31, United States Code.        (6) Open government data asset.--The term ``open Government       data asset'' has the meaning given the term in section 3502       of title 44, United States Code.       SEC. 5. NON-PROPAGATION OF CORE-BASED STATISTICAL AREA                     DELINEATIONS.         (a) Amendment.--Chapter 63 of title 31, United States Code,       is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``Sec. 6309.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1941, the Metropolitan Areas Protection and  Standardization, or MAPS Act, focuses on a little-known process at the  Office of Management and Budget that may seem arcane at first glance,  but which has profound implications for the way the Federal Government  serves the people of this Nation.   OMB maintains a set of standards to ensure consistency across the  Federal Government in how agencies classify statistics by geographic  area. These standards determine whether a county is considered  ``metropolitan'' based on its proximity to an urban core. Although  these standards are supposed to be used solely for statistical  purposes, they are frequently used by Federal agencies to distribute  funding, benefits, and programs.   Every 10 years, OMB considers recommendations from an interagency  technical advisory committee, with input from the public, to ensure the  continued relevance of the standards.   The recommendations for 2020 standards initially included a proposal  that, for a county to qualify as metropolitan, it must be near an urban  core with a population of 100,000, doubling the current threshold of  50,000 people.   Because this threshold hasn't been changed since it first came into  use in 1949, the proposed change would have converted 142 metropolitan  statistical areas from the metropolitan designation to the  nonmetropolitan designation.   According to the Brookings Institute, this would have impacted 19  million people and increased the share of  [[Page H8485]]  America's population residing in nonmetro counties from 14 percent to  around 20 percent.   There is currently no inventory of all Federal programs that rely on  the standard to distribute services, benefits, and funding, and no  process for ensuring that agencies are equipped to review the impacts  of potential changes on such programs.   As a result, what should be a purely statistical standards update  actually has unknown and potentially profound ramifications for Federal  program administration, warranting further review.   While the Standards Review Committee and OMB ultimately chose not to  recommend or include this change in the final 2020 Standards,  examination of the recommendation make clear that Congress must ensure  that these statistical standards can be updated without the risk of  unintended consequences cascading across the Federal programs and  policies built around them.   To accomplish this, the MAPS Act would clarify that changes to the  standards would not propagate automatically for any nonstatistical use  by a domestic assistance program. Changes for nonstatistical uses could  only take effect if the relevant agency determines that they support  the purposes of the program and are in the public interest, and if such  changes are affirmatively adopted through notice-and-comment  rulemaking.   The bill would also create an inventory of the current uses and  impacts of the standards in distributing Federal services, benefits,  funding, creating transparency for both policymakers and the public.   In short, the MAPS Act puts in place the safeguards needed to ensure  that the Federal Government's bedrock statistical standards can be  updated purely based on scientific criteria, without the influence of  nonstatistical considerations.   At the same time, it ensures that Federal policies and programs  continue to operate as intended and are updated with careful  consideration of their unique goals and impacts.   I urge my colleagues to support this responsible, good government  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York.
