 Madam President, today, I join Senator Boozman with a  heavy heart to mourn the death of a young patriot and a selfless public  servant.   Last month, Jeremiah Story, a member of the Arkansas National Guard  and a correctional officer at the Perry County Sheriff's Office, died  in the line of duty. Officer Story was only 21 years old. He worked at  the Perry County Detention Center and hoped to one day become a State  trooper.   He was known as an infectious source of joy among his friends and  within his community, always uplifting those who needed cheering up and  including those who felt left out. He was a devoted Christian who  encouraged everyone to go to church and who shared the gospel with  anyone who would listen. And he loved America, joining the Army  National Guard as soon as he graduated from high school. Jeremiah Story  was the type of selfless servant every young person should aspire to  be.   Three weeks ago, Officer Story was in the process of booking a drug  criminal at the Perry County Detention Center when the criminal pulled  out a concealed pistol and shot Officer Story in the chest. He died  soon thereafter at a Conway hospital, and the coward who shot him is  now charged with capital murder, as he should be.   His murderer didn't get away with anything, didn't gain anything,  didn't escape--nothing for this evil deed. He only snuffed out a  bright, young, wonderful life.   He should know, and every criminal in our State should know, that  justice will be rendered for this awful slaying.   In the aftermath of Officer Story's death, hundreds of Arkansans have  come together to remember his life and mourn his loss. Among those who  attended candlelight vigils for this special young man were the inmates  at the Perry County Detention Center. The chaplain of the detention  center said Officer Story was ``loved by a lot of different people, not  just outside but  [[Page S3196]]  inside.'' He added that he had used Officer Story as an ``example  setter'' for the inmates for the kind of citizen and man they could  aspire to be if they turned their lives around.   Officer Story's example lives on. Those who knew him, those who have  just now heard of him, can draw inspiration for a life well lived. In  21 short years, Officer Story did more good and spread more joy than  many others who have been blessed with many more years on this Earth.   He was a great Arkansan and a great American. May God bless and keep  Officer Jeremiah Story, and may God console his family and friends in  this time of grief.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to honor  an important member of Her Majesty's diplomatic service, Mr. Edward  Ferguson. Edward has been the latest in a long line of impressive  British diplomats who have furthered the Special Relationship between  the United Kingdom and United States.   Edward has served as the Minister Counsellor for Defence at British  Embassy in Washington, DC. The Minister Counsellor is the senior  Ministry of Defence--MOD--civil servant in the embassy. This position  is responsible for aspects of the bilateral defense relationship,  paying close attention to defense strategy; security and operational  policy; acquisition and trade.   Since arriving in September 2018, Edward has played a pivotal role in  further strengthening the already indispensable United States-United  Kingdom defense relationship. As the UK's senior policy adviser on  defense relations with the United States, he was responsible for United  Kingdom-United States collaboration on strategic planning, nuclear  policy and programmes, trade and acquisition, and science and  technology. He can point to a number of significant successes on his  watch, not least the signing of the Australia-United Kingdom-United  States--AUKUS--Agreement.   Prior to his service at the British Embassy Washington, Edward served  as Her Majesty's Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2014 to  2018, where he created and led a new international strategy, co- launched by the British and German Foreign Ministers, that re-energised  Euro-Atlantic integration after years of stagnation, while stimulating  economic growth and reducing high levels of youth unemployment.   From 2011 to 2014, Edward was Head of Defence Strategy and  Priorities, where he led two teams, one responsible for leading the  MOD's contribution to developing the 2015 National Security Strategy  and the Strategic Defence and Security Review and the other for  prioritising the MOD's international defence engagement activities.   A former exhibitioner and choral scholar of Trinity College, Oxford,  where he was also treasurer of the Oxford Union, Edward graduated with  first class honours in classics in 2001. In 2013, he graduated from the  London School of Economics and Political Science with an MSc with  distinction in strategy and diplomacy. He has been a member of the  Royal College of Defence Studies--RCDS--strategic advisory panel, a  member of the US Air Force Grand Strategy Advisory Board, and is a  graduate of the PINNACLE Command and Staff course at National Defense  University--NDU.   Edward has served in numerous roles within the Ministry of Defence,  starting out in the Iraq Secretariat during the build-up to and  subsequent execution of Operation TELIC in 2003. In 2006, he  volunteered for an operational tour, serving as political advisor to a  British battlegroup in Maysaan Province, Iraq--while his brother was a  troop leader with the British Army in Basra. On his return, he took on  responsibility for the strategic management of the United Kingdom's  bilateral defence relations with the United States, Canada, and Western  Europe.   From 2007 to 2009, he worked as Private Secretary to three Defence  Secretaries, acting as their closest adviser on issues relating to  operations in Iraq, the 6-billion defence equipment  programme, science and technology, counterterrorism and counterpiracy.   In 2009, he was appointed the head of Afghanistan and Pakistan  policy, responsible for advice to the National Security Council on the  policy, financial, legal, parliamentary, and presentational aspects of  the UK military contribution to operations in Afghanistan and on the  long-term defence role and interests in Pakistan.   Edward has been a key voice engaging on behalf of Her Majesty's  Government, particularly with Congress. He has been a strong proponent  of increasing the breadth and depth of the bilateral relationship since  his arrival at the embassy and has gained many friends and allies in a  bipartisan basis throughout Capitol Hill. He has travelled far and wide  throughout the heartland of the United States--and has many excellent  memories of American hospitality to show for it. His presence and  strong support of the Trans-Atlantic Alliance will be sorely missed,  but I know he will always be a stalwart advocate for our alliance.   I know I speak for a chorus of voices in the Senate in wishing him,  his wife Caroline, and their children, Henry, Tessa, and Mimi well as  they transition into their next diplomatic posting.                            ____________________
