 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 780, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4293) to reform the Comprehensive Capital Analysis  and Review process, the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test process, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 4293, the  Stress Test Improvement Act of 2017. I want to thank the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Zeldin), who is a real workhorse on the Financial  Services Committee and a real leader in trying to ensure that we have  affordable credit for our constituents so that they can achieve the  American Dream. In his legislation, he will bring clarity and  reasonableness to the stress test regime.   Currently, as we know, banks face two separate, legally mandated  stress tests: the CCAR and the DFAST. Together, these two programs  constitute one of the greatest expansions of the Federal Reserve's  supervisory powers in recent history. But what is important to note,  Mr. Speaker, is that, in addition to these mandated stress tests, banks  conduct stress tests every single week on one asset class or another.   It is important to know how banks can withstand tough, stormy  financial weather, but this was taking place even prior to either DFAST  or CCAR. What has happened now, Mr. Speaker, is these particular tests  are incredibly onerous to the point where the reports are not just  measured in pages, they are measured in pounds, and it is doubtful that  anyone actually reads them.   Then, to compound the challenge, Mr. Speaker, the Federal Reserve's  stress tests have become kind of a cat-and-mouse exercise in which the  Fed staff and compliance officers attempt to outwit each other in a  game that has no rules and no transparency. In other words, it is a  secret test. Nobody really knows what is on it. It is difficult for  Congress, it is difficult for our markets, and it is difficult for the  public to even assess whether or not these tests are effective.   Mr. Speaker, it is very important to note, if you don't know what is  on the test, how can you adhere to the rule of law if you don't know  what the law is? And so something really needs to change here.   Now, it is fortunate that yesterday the Federal Reserve finally took  action to begin to simplify and refine the CCAR stress testing regime.  Recognizing the opacity of the stress test regime, Federal Reserve Vice  Chairman for Supervision Randy Quarles said in a statement: ``Our  regulatory measures are most effective when they are as simple and  transparent as possible.'' I couldn't agree more, as does the gentleman  from New York as well.  [[Page H3113]]    Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, this particular proposal is somewhat  modest in its attempt to simplify the process. It does follow the  results of a review undertaken by former Fed Chair Yellen, which found  a need to reduce the burden resulting from stress testing requirements.  Almost everybody agrees with that, especially on our smaller financial  institutions. So that is one more reason why this is needed.   I am glad the Federal Reserve recognizes the need to reform the  stress test regime because, again, it contributes to a climate of legal  and regulatory uncertainty when the rule of law is so critical to the  foundation of our society and it is so critical to economic growth.   But in light of the Fed's announcement yesterday, it is also  important to point out what the Fed did can easily be undone next week,  next month, or next year. That is why it is critical that Congress has  to make improvements in the stress testing regime permanent, especially  for the CCAR process, which is not--I repeat, not--a creation of  statute.   The gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin) has come up again with just  the right bill, H.R. 4293, and it will help provide a commonsense, and,  oh, by the way, bipartisan reform that will inject badly needed  accountability, transparency, and targeted relief to reduce legal and  regulatory uncertainty for financial institutions.   Why is this important, Mr. Speaker? At the end of the day, it is not  really the banks that are the subject of these regulations. At the end  of the day, it is their customers. And what this committee and what  this House has to do is ensure that there is affordable and available  credit to help fund people's American Dreams.    I heard from a gentleman by the name of John in my district from  Mesquite, Texas. He said:         Credit helped me obtain my first home, and 13 years later,       I am still in it. It has helped us grow from one child, when       we moved in, to four. We ran into some bad times, but I was       able to withstand it all with the help of the available       credit lines that I had at the time. Without the credit, it       would have been nearly impossible to still be where me and my       family are today.    That is why it is so important, Mr. Speaker. People need credit to  pay their bills, to buy their homes, to pay for their car repairs; and  all of these regulations, the regulatory onslaught that has been taking  place for almost a decade, makes that credit less available and more  expensive. It shrinks the American Dream, and we can't allow that to  happen on our watch, Mr. Speaker.   That is why it is so important that we bring some rationality to the  stress test so that, hopefully, people like John in Mesquite can  continue to get that line of credit. Mr. Speaker, that is why it is so  important that we all vote for H.R. 4293 today.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Zeldin), who is a hardworking member of the House  Financial Services Committee and the bill's sponsor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Utah (Mrs. Love).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Tenney), another hardworking member of the House  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chairman of our Financial Services  Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the distinguished ranking  member, who observed that our banks have more capital today. And this  is a good thing. To the extent that Dodd-Frank had anything to do with  it, I would say congratulations to the Dodd-Frank Act. But I also  noticed that, for many of us, many of our banks are still  undercapitalized.   And the ranking member had every opportunity to vote for the  Financial CHOICE Act that would require 10 percent, far more capital  than these banks that she is concerned about failing have today, but  she rejected that.   She often uses the phrase ``Wall Street megabanks,'' but it is her  side of the aisle that supports a taxpayer bailout fund for what she  calls the Wall Street megabanks. That comes from our friends on that  side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker; not on this side. She says we have to  bail out these banks.   No, we don't have to. We don't have to. We should support bankruptcy  over bailout. And we should support high levels of capital over  incredibly intrusive Federal control, Federal control that ultimately  gets resolved into less credit and more expensive credit for many of  our constituents.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I would add, banks have stress-tested themselves  long before the appearance of Dodd-Frank. Long before the appearance of  Dodd-Frank. In fact, stress tests are taking place on some group of  assets at every bank in America every day. Many, many banks,  particularly the larger banks, may do up to 200 stress tests a week.   What the gentleman from New York is trying to do is add some level of  clarity, sanity, and reasonableness to the federally instituted CCAR  process, something that can take literally 40,000 pages--40,000 pages-- can take tens of millions, if not over $100 million, to produce that  could have been used to loan to our constituents to buy their home, to  repair their car, to put groceries on the table, to pay for their  healthcare premiums.                                time  1500    And some say, well, these tests have to be conducted semiannually.  Why semiannually? What is wrong with annually? What is sacrosanct about  semiannually? And, oh, by the way, why are we testing for both worst- case scenario and some mid- scenario?   Okay. Either you are going to survive the 100-year flood or you are  not. If you can survive the 100-year flood, surely you can survive the  50-year flood. So why do we need that other test?   I mean, what we hear from our friends on the other side of aisle: Oh,  my God, we can't question the Federal regulators. I mean, they come  from Mount Olympus. They have this great wisdom that we can never  challenge them.   Well, the truth is we are Article I of the Constitution, and we are  the ones who make the law, and that is why we have hearings, and we  listen very closely. We listen closely to our regulators; we listen  closely to our constituents; we listen closely to market participants;  and then we make judgments. We make judgments.   So, yes, there is a balance. There is a balance between economic  opportunity and financial stability. We want there to be strong  financial stability, but we also want there to be strong, strong  economic opportunity for all of our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr.  David Scott), the Democratic cosponsor of this  legislation and a proud member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes t the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), who served as our vice chairman of the  Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer  Credit.     Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Well, the ranking member poses the question, ``Why?'' I can tell you  why, Mr. Speaker. It is because Therese from Waco has written:         I would like to express my disappointment at being rejected       for a home loan, which would cost less than the house I       presently have been renting for 5 years. As a small-business       owner, I run my design studio out of my home office and take       every tax break that is legal to offset the taxes payable if       I didn't.    We do it for Sherry from Eustace, who writes:         After a divorce 4 years ago, I needed to buy a car because       my car was over 10 years old. I have a checking account in my       name, I have a savings account, but they did not loan me       money.    There is an onslaught of financial regulations that is costly,  intrusive, burdensome, and is causing credit to be less available--less  available--to the people who need it. That is why we do this, Mr.  Speaker, week after week after week. We do it to make sure that our  constituents can buy homes, that they can have cars. If they have tough  times, if they lose a job, if they go through a painful divorce, that  is why we do it, Mr. Speaker.                                time  1515    Again, stress-tests are important. That is why banks do it themselves  every single week.   But the question is: How do we calibrate this?   We have used the ranking member's prescription, and that of my  friends on the other side of the aisle, and it brought us 1.6 percent  economic growth. Thankfully, today, with a new Congress and with a new  President, we have 3 percent economic growth, and all types of  opportunities are coming.   We should not listen and go back to those days. It is time to go  forward to a better America with greater opportunity for all Americans.  That means we have to reform the stress test to ensure that not only do  we have financial stability, but we have financial opportunity as well.  That is the work of the gentleman from New York.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support H.R. 4293, the Stress Test  Improvement Act of 2017, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H3118]]     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member talks about the  hundreds of millions of dollars of fines that these banks have paid,  who have violated provisions of civil law, maybe that means the system  is working. That is what ought to happen to wrongdoers. There ought to  be fines.   No one can defend what happened at Wells Fargo. I hope that the  current management team is cleaning up what has been a mess and what  has harmed consumers for many, many years under the previous team.   But I do know this: that Wells Fargo has been fined almost a half a  billion dollars already. Their former CEO had $75 million clawed back  in compensation. They lost $29 billion of market value--their  investors--and investigations are ongoing, as it well should be.   But I would point out that our prudential regulators continue to have  full authority to enforce all of our consumer protection laws: the  Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act, the Consumer Leasing Act,  the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and  the Fair Credit Billing Act. When they find violations, people are  fined, as they well should be.   But what we are talking about, once again, is trying to create  economic opportunity for all those who need it, to make credit more  available and less expensive for people who are trying to buy a home,  repair a car, and put groceries on the table.   What the gentleman from New York is saying, again, when it comes to a  federally imposed stress test, after hours and hours of testimony, we  believe that maybe that test ought to be administered annually, instead  of semiannually. That would be a better balance. That is what is  happening from the gentleman from New York.   What the ranking member's motion to recommit would do is simply water  that down when all of our consumer protection laws remain fully in  effect. They are working.   Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of the motion to recommit, I urge  adoption of H.R. 4293, the Stress Test Improvement Act, from Mr. Zeldin  from New York.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 780, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4061) to amend the Financial Stability Act of 2010 to  improve the transparency of the Financial Stability Oversight Council,  to improve the SIFI designation process, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4061, the Financial  Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2017.   I want to commend two friends, Mr. Ross from Florida on the  Republican side of the aisle and Mr. Delaney on the Democrat side of  the aisle, for their collective leadership on bringing forth this truly  bipartisan bill, a strong, bipartisan bill, which has 58 different  cosponsors, half from each side of the aisle.   Before talking a bit about the bill, there has been a lot of news  today, Mr. Speaker. Part of the news, that I just could not overlook,  is the fact that my dear friend and colleague from Florida announced  that he would be retiring at the end of this Congress. I do want to say  what a pleasure and honor it has been to work with the gentleman from  Florida. I have appreciated his leadership, I have appreciated his  knowledge, and I have appreciated his calm demeanor and his ability to  further strong, bipartisan measures that will help create greater  credit opportunities for hardworking Americans. I would say I will miss  him, but I will be gone as well. Maybe he will invite me down to the  Florida coast for some deep sea fishing. I look forward to receiving  that invitation at the appropriate time.   Now back to business, Mr. Speaker.   The Financial Stability Oversight Council is charged with identifying  emerging threats to our financial stability. However, during the  previous administration, the FSOC, as it is called, went far beyond  identifying this risk and, instead, just concocted incredibly  irrational speculative scenarios about sectors of the financial markets  that had nothing to do with the financial crisis. In turn, they have  caused more harm to the financial system than added stability.   It bears highlighting at the outset that this bill does not strip the  FSOC of its ability to designate a nonbank financial company as a SIFI,  or systematically important financial institution. Frankly, Mr.  Speaker, it would be a better bill if it did. It also wouldn't be a  bipartisan bill. That is not what this bill is trying to do. Rather,  this bill simply brings needed transparency and accountability to the  designation process.   Mr. Ross and Mr. Delaney, in H.R. 4061, do this by reversing the  presumption that government bureaucrats should dictate the business  models and operational objectives of private businesses in requiring  the FSOC to approach the potential designation of a nonbank by  encouraging companies to address the risk prior to designating them as  SIFIs in order to actually reduce systemic risk.   Let me sum it up, Mr. Speaker. All this is saying is that a nonbank  financial institution that the Financial Stability Oversight Council  feels may be creating undue risk in the system, give them an  opportunity to remedy that before you designate them as a too-big-to- fail institution backed up with a taxpayer bailout fund. At least give  them an opportunity to remedy the risk that you are concerned about.   What could be more common sense? What could be more reasonable? That  is why it is such a strong, bipartisan bill coming out of the House  Financial Services Committee.                                time  1530    Specifically, Mr. Speaker, applying bank-like regulation to nonbanks,  such as asset managers, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and  private investment funds just doesn't make sense. Nonbanks do not have  access to the deposit insurance fund, they don't have access to the  Federal Reserve's discount window or lending facilities. Nonbanks take  far larger capital haircuts on the assets they hold. Nonbanks, when  they fail, fail very differently from banks.   If an individual mutual fund were to fail, the shareholders of that  fund would bear the losses, not the taxpayer. There is no reason to  apply the same system to them.   So the bill would bring, again, clarity and accountability to the  FSOC designation process. That should be self-evident.   To date, the FSOC has designated four nonbank financial companies as  systemically important financial institutions. Today, only one remains  designated and it is unclear for exactly how long.   The de-designation of these companies seems to point to a recognition  that these companies do not present a potential risk that FSOC first  claimed that they did. MetLife, one of them, actually challenged FSOC's  SIFI determination in court, and FSOC's designation was found by an  Article III judge to be fatally flawed, arbitrary and capricious, and a  critical departure from FSOC's own standards.   Based on that case alone, it certainly seems appropriate for Congress  to ensure there are proper guardrails put in place in this designation,  because at  [[Page H3122]]  the end of the day, the designation doesn't just affect, again, Wall  Street, it is felt directly by Main Street households who are trying to  save for college, save for retirement. They would see their costs rise  and their investment returns fall on a mutual fund if it was  designated, simply because investors would be required to bail out  other too-big-to-fail firms.   So this is a common sense piece of legislation, it is strongly  bipartisan, and I urge all Members to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say as  the jihad against banks continues, if you read the bill, it doesn't  have to do with banks, it has to do with nonbanks. And the apocalyptic  vision that is described by the ranking member is supported by a  majority of Democrats on the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Ross),  [[Page H3123]]  who serves as the vice chairman of our Subcommittee on Housing and  Insurance and is the Republican sponsor of this piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), who serves as the chairman of our Capital  Markets, Securities, and Investments Subcommittee.    I yield the gentleman from Michigan an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2-1/2 minutes to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Delaney), the lead Democratic cosponsor of the  legislation and a hardworking member of the Financial Services  Committee.    I yield the gentleman from Maryland an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), who serves as the vice chairman of our Capital  Markets, Securities, and Investment Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton), who serves as the vice chairman of our  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Sherman), one of the Democrat cosponsors of the  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 seconds just to say I  take note that the ranking member respects her Democrat Members who  disagree with her, but, apparently, not enough to yield them any of her  time.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Budd), yet another hardworking member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I believe I have the right to close. I  have no further speakers, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, why is this important, and what does this bill do? Let  me try to make it very succinct. Dodd-Frank gave the Federal Government  the power to designate firms to be too big to fail and backed them up  with a taxpayer fund, a bailout fund. We think that is wrong.   But that is not what this bill does. The bill doesn't repeal the  bailout fund. It simply says to nonbanks--not banks, nonbanks--mutual  funds, insurance companies: You know what? Before we knock you upside  the head with a sledgehammer, we are going to give you a chance to get  your act together.   That is essentially what this bill does. And why is that important?  It is important because we have people who are trying to capitalize  small businesses. It is important because we have people who are trying  to save for their retirement. Enhanced prudential standards, which is  the legal term of art for coming down with a ton of bricks onto a  company, that can cost people.   In fact, it has been estimated that these enhanced prudential capital  requirements imposed with a SIFI designation, a too-big-to-fail  designation on a mutual fund, could trim as much as 25 percent or  $108,000 for a mutual fund investor's returns over a lifetime of  investing. That comes out of the pockets of our seniors. That is why  this is so important.   Contrary to what you hear on the other side of the aisle, the FSOC,  the Financial Stability Oversight Council, will still have full ability  to designate an institution as too big to fail. But it says: You know  what? Before you do that, consider some other methods: consider  seniors, consider small businesses, and consider the impact of what you  are going to do.   Look at what happened to GE Capital. This was one of the great  financing companies in America, and they were basically a coyote in a  trap that had to chew its leg off. There is hardly anything left of  them. They used to fund furniture retailers, bread bakeries, Jack in  the Box franchises. They provided credit to startups all over America,  $31 billion in 2010 to 1.2 million small and midsized businesses, and  now, next to nothing. Next to nothing, because they were designated as  a nonbank SIFI.   The ranking member brings up AIG, but guess what? AIG was regulated  by a Federal regulator who had full ability to stop anything they were  doing for safety and soundness. And guess what? The regulator, in which  many on the other side of the aisle put total faith into, they missed  it. They screwed up. They said under oath in our committee: Yeah, we  had full authority to stop it, and we just missed it. We just missed  it.   So it is time, Mr. Speaker, that we improve this Financial Stability  Oversight Council. I urge all Members to support H.R. 4061.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
