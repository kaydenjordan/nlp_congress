 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my post closure  debate time to Senator Feinstein from California.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, Parliamentary inquiry.    In the opinion of the Chair, would one Senator calling  another Senator a liar during debate on the floor of the Senate be a  violation of rule XIX?    Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield back.
