 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Priscilla Arceo.   Santa Ana High School's valedictorian, Priscilla Arceo, made us proud  when she appeared and earned the spot of student speaker at the  national Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Student  Class of 2020.   I also thank our Santa Ana High School principal, Jeff Bishop, for  his support. And, of course, I thank the debate coach and teacher, Sal  Tinajero, for bringing the debate program to Santa Ana High School. Mr.  Tinajero continues to make champions out of these great kids at Santa  Ana.   Madam Speaker, today, Priscilla is headed to the University of  California for her college degree, and I extend congratulations to  Priscilla.                            ____________________
