Uranium transfers and sales.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) the safe and secure operation of nuclear reactors in       the United States must remain the paramount focus of the       Nuclear Regulatory Commission;        (2) the existing fleet of nuclear reactors in the United       States is operating safely and securely;        (3) nuclear energy is the largest source of affordable,       reliable, emissions-free energy in the United States,       providing approximately 20 percent of the electricity       consumed in the United States and 60 percent of emissions-      free electricity generation in the United States;        (4) a 1,000-megawatt nuclear plant--        (A) provides approximately 500 permanent jobs;        (B) pays approximately $40,000,000 annually in wages;        (C) generates approximately $470,000,000 annually in goods       and services in the local community; and        (D) pays approximately $83,000,000 annually in Federal,       State, and local taxes;        (5) nuclear energy is of critical importance to United       States energy security and worldwide influence on       nonproliferation;        (6) nuclear energy uses widely available fuel resources to       enable scientific progress, emissions-free and reliable       electricity generation, heat generation for industrial       applications, and power for deep space exploration;        (7) the private sector, the National Laboratories (as       defined in section 2 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42       U.S.C. 15801)), and institutions of higher education are       pursuing innovations in nuclear energy technology that will       play a crucial role in--        (A) the future global and United States energy supply; and        (B) the exports, manufacturing, and economy of the United       States;        (8) eventual deployment of commercial advanced nuclear       reactors will require--        (A) modernizing the regulatory framework; and        (B) making other necessary changes to facilitate the       efficient, predictable, and affordable deployment of advanced       nuclear reactor technologies;        (9) 2 impediments to the commercialization of advanced       nuclear reactors are the high costs and long durations       associated with applying the existing nuclear regulatory       framework to advanced nuclear reactors;        (10) license application reviews should be as predictable,       efficient, and timely as practicable without compromising       safety or security;  [[Page S7958]]         (11) the development of advanced nuclear reactors would       benefit from the early identification of policy issues for       timely consideration and resolution by the Commission to       improve the efficient development of designs as well as       preparing for design review and licensing;        (12) the existing nuclear regulatory framework and the       requirements of that framework have not adapted to advances       in scientific understanding or the features and performance       characteristics of advanced nuclear reactor designs;        (13) the existing nuclear reactor licensing process does       not provide iterative feedback to manage risk as needed for       typical technology development and investment cycles;        (14) a staged licensing structure that provides clear and       periodic feedback to applicants on an agreed schedule will       help to enable the commercialization of safer and innovative       technologies that will benefit the economy, national       security, and environment of the United States;        (15) a technology-inclusive Commission regulatory framework       will--        (A) allow greater technological innovation; and        (B) enable inventors, scientists, engineers, and students       to pursue licensing advanced reactor concepts;        (16) further preparation by the Commission of the research       and test reactor licensing process will enable the Commission       to more efficiently process applications for research and       test reactors when the applications are received;        (17) it is incumbent on the Commission--        (A) to budget appropriate resources to undertake an active       role in design familiarization activities with potential       applicants with advanced reactor designs;        (B) to budget for adequate resources to conduct licensing       reviews and other work requested by licensees and applicants;       and        (C) to use those budgeted funds to ensure responsiveness to       licensees and applicants in recognition of the dependence of       the licensees and applicants on Commission approval before       the benefits of the technology of the licensees and       applicants can be realized; and        (18) both prospective advanced nuclear reactor applicants       and the existing fleet of nuclear reactors in the United       States would benefit from modernizing the outdated fee       recovery structure of the Commission to better manage       fluctuations in workload and the number of licensees in a       fair and equitable manner.       SEC. 3. PURPOSE.         The purpose of this Act is to provide--        (1) a program to develop the expertise and regulatory       processes necessary to allow innovation and the       commercialization of advanced nuclear reactors;        (2) a revised fee recovery structure to ensure the       availability of resources to meet industry needs without       burdening existing licensees unfairly for inaccurate workload       projections or premature existing reactor closures; and        (3) more efficient regulation of uranium recovery.
