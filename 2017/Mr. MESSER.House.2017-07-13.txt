 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership.   Congress' most important job is to provide for the national defense  of this country. Yet, during the past 6 years, America's military  resources have been downsized and slashed.   Today, Congress is taking corrective action to rebuild our military,  support our troops, and provide for a strong national defense. This  Defense Authorization Act fulfills our promise to prioritize America's  safety and protect our citizens from ongoing global threats, including  radical Islamic terror.  [[Page H5779]]    This bipartisan bill increases resources for every branch of the U.S.  military and ensures that our troops receive the compensation they  deserve, with the largest pay increase in 5 years. It also supports a  robust missile defense program, and it strengthens America's cyber  warfare capabilities.   Simply put, this bill makes America safer, and I urge your support.
