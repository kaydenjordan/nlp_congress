 Mr. Speaker, like many Members of Congress, I came  determined to increase long-term Federal investment in infrastructure.   Supporting the movement of people, goods, energy, and information  through our infrastructure is crucial to driving investment in our  communities and maintaining America's economic competitiveness.   Modernizing our infrastructure is important to Americans in every  part of the country. We know that infrastructure projects are  consistently evaluated as the best return on government investment.                                time  0915    As a member of the New Democratic Coalition, we believe any new  proposal must include new revenue, new financing, new funding, and  regulatory streamlining and encourage lifecycle funding in innovative  infrastructure projects that are built to last.   As chair of the New Democrat Coalition Infrastructure Task Force and  a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I believe  that there should be four pillars for infrastructure deals. Those  include revenue funding.  [[Page H2987]]    I support securing dedicated, sustainable revenue to keep the Highway  Trust Fund solvent well into the future and increasing Federal  investment that is not looted for other purposes.   We need a variety of funding options, including mileage-based user  fees; raising or indexing the gas tax; user fees on electric vehicles  or batteries to create parity with gasoline-powered vehicles; slightly  increasing the corporate tax rate and dedicating the incremental  revenue gains toward infrastructure, both expanded and new bond  programs.   We must think strategically and use lifecycle cost analysis to  account for the operating and maintenance needs of an asset across its  entire lifecycle. Thus, we will help guard against deferred  maintenance.   I support investing seed capital to capitalize an infrastructure bank  that would leverage its funds for everything from roads, to water, to  broadband projects. The bank would be accessible to States, localities,  and regional groups and would be able to loan them money with favorable  terms as well as offer bond insurance.   I and the task force support grant programs that would specifically  target areas in desperate need of revitalizing their infrastructure,  including those recovering from natural disasters, communities with  higher rates of unemployment and poverty, and rural areas. That means  new avenues to fund infrastructure projects in communities that have  been left behind and in areas that traditionally struggle to attract  infrastructure funding for projects that have holistic community  support.   The task force recognizes the importance of continued regulatory  streamlining in a way that balances expedited construction with  appropriate environmental and safety safeguards. The administration  must work to implement the numerous streamlining provisions already  passed into law by Congress in the FAST Act transportation bill.   In addition, I support encouraging the use of regional partnerships  and public-private partnerships.   We must also think about broadband and realize that this is the new  transportation of the 21st century, making sustainable and innovative  public and private investments across the U.S. to repair and upgrade  existing assets and build vital new projects.   We must seek to support projects that help communities become more  energy efficient, resilient, and better prepared to deal with the  impact of climate change and environmental cleanup.   Finally, we must seek to give communities ownership of local  development and encourage innovation, regulatory streamlining, and more  comprehensive multiproject long-term planning.                            ____________________
