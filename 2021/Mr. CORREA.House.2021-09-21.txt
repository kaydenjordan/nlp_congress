 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the SAFE  Banking Act as an amendment to the NDAA. More than half--let me repeat,  more than half of the U.S. population lives in a State jurisdiction  where cannabis is legal. Veterans prefer cannabis to opioids to treat  their invisible wounds that they bring back from the battlefield.   Cannabis customers and businesses are law-abiding citizens and  entities, yet they have to pay their employees, their bills, and their  Federal taxes with cash. It just does not make sense.   As my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have pointed out, we  need to get rid of that gray black market, bring this cash business  into the banking system.   Again, I rise in strong support of this commonsense measure.
