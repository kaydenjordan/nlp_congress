 Madam Speaker, I rise to echo the words of our  President: Americans, help is on the way.   The House of Representatives and Senate have passed the rescue bill,  and there is money for vaccinations, money to open the schools, and  money for small businesses. The opportunity to revise and rebuild our  economy is at hand. The President will soon sign this legislation, and  help is on the way.                            ____________________
