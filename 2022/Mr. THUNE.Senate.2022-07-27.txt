 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Biden border crisis continues to rage.  Last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered 207,416  individuals attempting to cross our southern border illegally, the  highest June number ever recorded. And April and May successively set  records for the highest numbers for any month ever.   During the 2021 fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection  encountered a record number of individuals attempting to cross our  southern border illegally--1,734,686, to be precise--a record. We still  have 3 months to go for this fiscal year, but we have already exceeded  last year's number by more than 11,000. That is right. In just 9  months, we have already exceeded last year's record number of  apprehensions.   The situation on our southern border is out of control, although you  would never know it to hear the President and his administration. ``The  border is secure'' the President's Homeland Security Secretary said  just a few days ago. Again, The border is secure. My only question is  how he said that with a straight face.   Our southern border is the opposite of secure. It is in crisis. The  flood of illegal immigration is so great that huge numbers of Customs  and Border Protection officers have been pulled off the border to  process migrants. A May article from the Economist reported that:         Around 60 percent of CBP agents have been assigned to       process migrants, taking them away from field work.    That, of course, leaves our borders wide open to illegal activity,  including the drug trafficking that is flooding our country with  fentanyl.   It also means even with all the apprehensions the Border Patrol has  made, many more individuals are getting through unstopped. One source  reports that so far this fiscal year, there have been more than half a  million got-aways--in other words, individuals the Border Patrol saw  but was unable to apprehend.   The Economist article I mentioned also noted:         One border expert estimates that less than 20 percent of       people trying to cross the border undetected are stopped.    Less than 20 percent--that is a security nightmare.   Our Customs and Border Protection agents are giving this job their  all, but there is no way for them to keep up with the flood of illegal  immigration, especially when they are being pulled off the border to  process migrants.   It is President Biden's job to help stop this border crisis, but when  he is not pretending this crisis doesn't exist, he is taking actions  that are contributing to this disaster. On his very first day in  office, President Biden rescinded  [[Page S3710]]  the declaration of a national emergency at our southern border. He  halted construction of the border wall. He revoked a Trump  administration order that called for the government to faithfully  execute our immigration laws. And his Department of Homeland Security  issued guidelines pausing deportations, except under certain  circumstances. That was all, again, on his first day in office.   Needless to say, the effect of all this was to declare to the world  that the U.S. borders were effectively open. And even as huge numbers  of illegal immigrants pour across our southern border, he has continued  to build on those actions. The President sought to significantly limit  the ability of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enforce  immigration laws.   Deportations dropped precipitously during fiscal year 2021, as did  arrests in the interior of the country. In March of this year, the  administration rescinded a 2019 rule expanding expedited removal for  individuals here illegally. And, of course, the administration is still  attempting to remove title 42 COVID-19 restrictions, with no viable  plan to control the resulting surge in illegal immigration.   Illegal immigration, especially the kind of out-of-control illegal  immigration we are currently experiencing, has serious consequences. I  have already mentioned some of the security risks it presents. With  Customs and Border Protection overstretched, it is easier for bad  actors to cross the border into our country--gang members, drug  traffickers, human smugglers, and the list goes on.   Our country is currently in the midst of a fentanyl crisis. In fact,  right now, fentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death for American  adults between the ages of 18 and 45. And where is all this fentanyl  coming from? Most of it is being trafficked across our southern border.  The current border situation is undoubtedly facilitating that  trafficking.   Illegal immigration is financially costly, as well. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement is currently running out of money for this year,  thanks, in part, to the out-of-control situation at our southern  border.   President Biden has talked about wanting to build a ``fair, orderly,  and humane'' immigration system. There is nothing--nothing--humane  about our current situation. Encouraging illegal immigration, as the  President's policies have done, has contributed to a humanitarian  crisis that saw 557 migrants die attempting to cross the southern  border during fiscal year 2021. Just last month, in an incredibly  tragic, horrific story, 53 migrants died in an unair-conditioned  tractor-trailer after being smuggled across the border. It was a sober  reminder of the human costs of policies that enable illegal  immigration.   The President may think that his border policies are compassionate,  but, again, he would be wrong. Policies that encourage illegal  immigration, that encourage individuals to undertake the often  dangerous journey across our southern border often at the mercy of  human smugglers are the very opposite of compassionate. I would like to  think that the President would wake up to the dangerous situation we  are in and take action to help stem the flood of illegal immigration at  our southern border, but after a year and a half of his  administration's neglecting this crisis, I am not getting my hopes up.  I am afraid that, like inflation, out-of-control illegal immigration  has become a fact of life in the Biden Presidency. As with inflation,  Americans and those vulnerable individuals who are attempting to enter  our country, will be left to suffer the consequences.   I yield the floor.
