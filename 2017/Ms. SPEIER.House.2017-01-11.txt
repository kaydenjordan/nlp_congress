 Mr. Speaker, the Republicans' plan to repeal the  Affordable Care Act should be entitled repeal and collapse, because it  will generate, in this country, a financial and healthcare meltdown for  tens of millions of people.   In fact, if we repeal the ACA, 30 million Americans will lose their  health insurance. States and hospitals will be on the hook for $1.1  trillion in uncompensated care, and rural hospitals will close.   It will cost the country 3 million jobs. All of this is to give the  top one half of 1 percent an almost $200,000 tax break and costs middle  class families as much as $6,000 more a year. Once  [[Page H310]]  again, the Republicans are taking care of the richest while imposing  tax hikes on hardworking Americans.   As this chart shows, the ACA has caused dramatic reductions in every  age group across the entire marketplace in terms of uninsurance, a 50  percent reduction in uninsured in America.   So what does this mean to the average American? For my constituent,  Penny Floor, it could return her to a time when she lived with no  health insurance whatsoever.   Here is a picture of Penny. She works for the San Mateo Community  College District and is one of the 27 percent of Americans under the  age of 65 who have a preexisting condition. She is now at risk, thanks  to the GOP's reckless ideological agenda, to lose her health insurance.   This is Penny's story in her words:         I tried to buy health insurance in my thirties and in my       forties, and both times I was turned down and was told I was       ineligible. Basically, I didn't lie on the portion of the       form that asked if I had ever been hospitalized for mental       illness. I said I was treated for depression when I was 17,       and for that I was denied the ability to purchase health       insurance.        For a long period of my adult life, I had no health       insurance. I worked for a nonprofit childcare center and had       no coverage. I got married in my forties, and both my husband       and I went to graduate school and were covered then. But when       we received our degrees, the coverage ended. My husband was       working as a freelance computer programmer. He ended up       taking a corporate job that wasn't his dream job so we could       be insured.        He is still there today. He is 62, and I am 60, and we live       in fear he will be laid off. I am holding my breath that       there will be some coverage through Medicaid if that happens,       or if we make it to retirement.        When I was younger, I was lucky enough to have incredible       health. I didn't go to the doctor or the dentist for 10       years. I was constantly terrified that I would be in a car       accident and would be sued. And I was afraid my family would       be bankrupt trying to take care of me.        Thank God for Planned Parenthood and access to birth       control. It is the only medical attention I received during       that time because their sliding pay scale was the only thing       I could afford.        Now I am 60, though, and I do have health issues. I was       hospitalized earlier this year for blood clots in my legs and       lungs. It was scary and expensive, but we had good coverage.        But if the ACA is repealed and Medicaid is affected, I       don't know what we will do. We are educated, not poor, very       productive members of society, and we are scared.    These are the words of a real American, my constituent, Penny Floor.                            ____________________
