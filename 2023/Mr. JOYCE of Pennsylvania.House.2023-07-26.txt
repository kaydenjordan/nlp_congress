 Mr. Speaker, more than 500,000  Pennsylvanians lack access to fast and reliable internet service at  their homes, often adding a layer of difficulty to students who are  trying to learn, to businesspeople who are trying to engage in commerce  from their homes, or to patients who are trying to connect with their  physicians for telehealth visits.   As I travel throughout my district, I hear from farmers who struggle  to implement precision farming due to a lack of GPS signal. When I  visit schools, I hear from teachers about students who struggle to  complete their homework simply because they lack access to high-speed  internet in their homes.   These problems are persistent, and each contributes to the larger  issue: that rural communities are suffering from a lack of access to  broadband internet.   To ensure that our rural communities are not left behind, it is time  for Congress to commit to building out rural broadband infrastructure  as part of the agriculture and rural development appropriations.   Ensuring high-speed internet connections, whether from fiber-optic  cables, wireless towers, or satellite, will ensure that students are  able to learn from home, that employees are able to work from home, and  that patients are able to heal from home.   We as a Congress must stand committed to rural broadband development.                           Protecting Our Farmland     Mr. Speaker, right now, nearly 400,000  acres of American farmland are owned by Chinese investors.   The increasing reach of the Chinese Communist Party is incredibly  alarming, as this land is being purchased near sensitive military  installations and other areas critical to our national security.   It is imperative that the Biden administration gain a better  understanding of these land purchases and develop programs to halt the  purchase of agricultural land by those associated with China, Russia,  North Korea, and Iran.   We must ensure that the USDA is able to improve tracking of foreign  land ownership and help to ensure that our communities are protected  and safe from the actions of the Chinese Communist Party.   This is a national security issue, and it is time for Congress and  the Biden administration to take swift and decisive action to protect  our American farmland.                            ____________________
