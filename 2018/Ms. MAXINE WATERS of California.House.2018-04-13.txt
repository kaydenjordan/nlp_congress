 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to start off with a quote from Speaker Paul  Ryan in a 2012 townhall meeting. This is what he said to his  constituents: ``If you're a bank and you want to operate like some  nonbank entity like a hedge fund, then don't be a bank. Don't let banks  use their customers' money to do anything other than traditional  banking.''   I agree, and that is why Congress passed the Volcker rule in the wake  of the 2008 financial crisis, to prevent taxpayer-backed banks from  engaging in risky, speculative activities like owning hedge funds. But  since that time, Republicans have engaged in a relentless attack  against the Volcker rule at the behest of Wall Street megabanks.   H.R. 4790, the so-called Volcker Rule Regulatory Harmonization Act,  is the latest threat to that rule. Specifically, H.R. 4790, contains  two problematic provisions that would create a loophole in the Volcker  rule and make it easier for the Trump administration to weaken or  repeal it.   Leading up to the financial crisis, Wall Street megabanks engaged in  proprietary trading, which is essentially speculative, highly leveraged  betting that benefits their bottom line but uses federally insured  loans backed by the U.S. taxpayer.   These banks gambled on exotic financial instruments like  collateralized debt obligations comprised of risky subprime mortgages  and credit default swaps, which even the legendary investor, Warren  Buffett, criticized as ``financial weapons of mass destruction.''   When the Housing bubble finally burst, these bets led to massive  losses and required the Federal Government to bail out the banking  industry with trillions of taxpayer dollars to stop an economic  catastrophe. To protect the American taxpayer and the economy from this  sort of risky trading as well as to return banks to the business of  helping consumers and small businesses, Congress included the Volcker  rule's ban on proprietary trading as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street  Reform and Consumer Protection Act.   Specifically, the Volcker rule prohibits taxpayer-backed banks from  engaging in risky proprietary trading and from owning hedge funds and  private equity funds. It also prohibits banks from owning the very same  risky collateralized debt obligations that accelerated the 2008 crisis.   According to Martin Gruenberg, Chairman of the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation, that is, the FDIC, which is the agency charged  with protecting taxpayers from bank bailouts, ``had it,'' this  prohibition, ``been in place then, the Volcker rule would have  constrained the proliferation of such instruments.''   The result today is less reckless risk-taking by Wall Street  megabanks and a stronger financial system. And despite dire predictions  by Republicans, our banks have returned to lending to consumers and  businesses, and our financial markets are adapting and thriving.   For example, since passage of Dodd-Frank, bank lending to businesses  has increased 80 percent; and in the bond market, which has long been  dominated by bank dealers, we have seen record-new bond issuance by  companies, States, cities, and towns seeking to raise funds and record  trading volumes in those bonds. Most other metrics also show a healthy  corporate bond market.   Nevertheless, H.R. 4790 is just the latest Republican attempt to  weaken the Volcker rule. First, the bill would provide a blanket  exemption from the Volcker rule for 97 percent of our Nation's banks  which have consolidated assets of $10 billion or less and with less  than 5 percent of those assets in trading assets.   To be clear, most community banks do not engage in any trading  activities and, therefore, have no compliance requirements under the  rule. However, H.R. 4790 would give all community banks the  congressional thumbs-up to begin speculative trading instead of  focusing on the traditional business of banking. It also makes  community banks prime targets for hedge fund salesmen.   Now, why is this an area of concern for me? It is an area of concern  because I hear the community banks when they say that their numbers are  going down because of mergers and consolidation. This bill does not  help with this problem. It makes it worse because it sends a shining  beacon to hedge funds all over the country that they can peddle risky  and questionable investments to community banks, and the regulators  will be none the wiser.   I am extraordinarily concerned with the extent of the affordable  housing crisis our Nation is facing. We need banks to invest in housing  and in our communities. I believe that community banks can provide  those kind of investments.    But I am also concerned that, if the hedge funds can prey on  community banks with little oversight, then they will be unable to  provide the kinds of investments in housing and small businesses that  communities need. Instead, we will see more community banks investing  in hedge funds and possibly leaving these communities behind.   So when Members ask: How can we create more affordable housing or  address the issues that experts like Dr. Matthew Desmond are raising on  the housing crisis in America, one thing that we can do is not think  narrowly about the impact of financial services legislation, and,  particularly, legislation like H.R. 4790 that can create lasting,  unintended consequences if not carefully considered.   We should think broadly and realize that the policies that we make  for banks can have real impacts on the communities they serve. And the  regulators and experts have done just that. They have carefully  considered the bill's provisions and the unintended consequences that  could ensue.   That is why the blanket carve-out in this bill is opposed by former  Federal Reserve Chairman and the rule's namesake, Paul Volcker, who has  said: ``I know from my long experience in banking and savings and loan  regulation that plausibly small loopholes can be `gamed' and exploited  with unfortunate consequences.'' Paul Volcker was Chairman of the  Federal Reserve for part of the savings and loan crisis, which, during  that time, more than 1,000 S&Ls failed, fully one-third of the  industry.   The exemption is also opposed by FDIC Chairman Gruenberg, FDIC Vice  Chairman Thomas Hoenig, and investors and advocates.   If we truly want to reduce regulatory burdens on community banks that  engage in permitted trading activity, we should be looking at other  ways to accommodate them, such as by creating a presumption of  compliance with the Volcker rule, which reduces compliance costs  without opening up a loophole. Rather than encouraging banks,  especially community banks, to make speculative bets on hedge funds or  derivatives, we should be doing everything possible to ensure banks are  focused on supporting their communities by offering mortgages and  commercial loans.   Second, H.R. 4790 would repeal the requirement that the Federal  Reserve, FDIC; Office of the Comptroller of Currency, that is the OCC;  Securities and Exchange Commission, that is the SEC; and the Commodity  Futures Trading  [[Page H3217]]  Commission, that is the CFTC, work together to jointly implement the  rule. Instead, the bill would delegate sole rulemaking authority to the  Federal Reserve, which could choose to consult or not consult with the  other regulators.   This would unreasonably cut the FDIC out of any future rule changes,  even though it is the regulator charged with protecting deposit  insurance against the very risky, speculative activities the Volcker  rule was designed to prevent.   It would also cut the OCC out of the rulemaking process, even though  it oversees institutions that account for approximately 40 percent of  bank holding company trading revenues.   And it would cut out the SEC and the CFTC, even though those agencies  have the expertise and jurisdiction over broker dealers and future  traders and their marketmaking activities.   Worse, appointing the Fed a single regulator would make it easier for  the Trump administration to weaken and repeal the Volcker rule, even  though it was expeditiously promulgated in 2 years and the regulators  are now working together to make appropriate changes. While the bill  would at least allow the appropriate banking regulators--SEC and CFTC-- to enforce the rule, such enforcement authority is meaningless if the  Volcker rule is effectively gutted by the Trump administration.   But this is what my Republican colleagues want. Chairman Hensarling's  600-page Big Bank giveaway, H.R. 10, known as the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act,  would have repealed the Volcker rule outright. H.R. 4790 is merely the  latest attempt to do the same thing.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose H.R. 4790, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), who is a member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman  from Illinois an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when the gentleman from Michigan started his remarks, he  [[Page H3219]]  accused me of wanting to talk about housing. He is absolutely correct.  I want to talk about housing. I believe that if we really understood  the needs of our constituents all over this country, instead of talking  about megabanks and how we can give them whatever they want in order to  make more profits, we should be talking about housing. We should be  talking about housing needs in this country.   As a matter of fact, I have said to the chairman more than once that  I really would like to have a hearing on homelessness because  homelessness is exploding all over the country. In the city of Los  Angeles, we have probably over 53,000 homeless people every night  without a place to lay their heads.   Oh, yes, we should be talking about housing. You cannot separate  trading from housing in the way that maybe some would attempt to do:  Oh, this is about Volcker; it has nothing to do with housing.   Oh, yes, it does.                                time  0945    Because, instead of this risky trading that the banks are doing, they  should be investing in our communities and providing for affordable  housing.   And let me just tell you, African-American homeownership today is as  low as it was when housing discrimination was legal. There is not a  single county in the United States with sufficient affordable housing.   So, yes, we should be talking about housing, and thank you for  bringing it to my attention. Thank you for accusing me of wanting to  talk about housing.   Last year our Nation's banks reported $164.8 billion in profit. Had  it not been for the Republicans' new tax law which required them to  take a one-time charge, the FDIC estimates that the banks would have  profited to the tune of $183.1 billion, which is an all-time high and  an increase of 7.2 percent from 2016 and a 26 percent increase from  2006.   So I think it is a little hard to argue that banks don't have enough  money to lend, but let's look at what they did with that money.   The Wall Street megabanks returned a lot of that money to their  shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. For example,  in June 2017, J.P. Morgan announced a stock repurchase program of up to  $19.4 billion, its biggest buyback since the financial crisis.  Citigroup also announced its largest ever stock buyback program, worth  up to $15.6 billion, and doubled its dividend.   The Wall Street megabanks also handsomely rewarded their CEOs with  some of the biggest paydays since 2006. Five Wall Street banks,  combined, paid their CEOs a total compensation of $126 million, the  highest amount since before the financial crisis. Each chief of the  banks--which includes Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan  Stanley--received an average $25.3 million for their work, and that was  up 17 percent from 2016.   Mr. Speaker, we listen to Chairman Hensarling's stories. He shares a  lot of stories with us that he receives from his constituents about  problems they are having receiving car loans or a mortgage. And I  agree, we should be doing more to expand access to credit for  consumers; but what I do not agree with is the Republican argument  that, if we only repealed bank regulations, then all of a sudden those  individuals would receive the car loans and the mortgages that they  currently cannot.   Banks are raking in money hand over fist, and they could use that  money now to lend to creditworthy borrowers instead of paying millions  of dollars in bonuses to their CEOs. Let's be clear about what is  really going on. No amount of regulatory relief will cure Wall Street  greed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is absolutely amazing. We had the gentleman earlier  who said this is not the time to talk about housing, and then we have  the gentleman from Wisconsin who says, when the banks do well, our  constituents do well.    The banks are making millions of dollars; the CEOs are making  millions of dollars; and they have bank tellers and people who work who  are not even making $15 an hour. We can't even get a minimum wage  increase, Federal minimum wage increase for our constituents, and many  of them are working in these megabanks where the CEOs are walking away  every year with millions of dollars in pay.   So these statements, when banks do well, everybody does well, I wish  my good friend would reexamine that statement because I think, when he  thinks about it, he might want to retract it and take that back.   ``Certainly, we have to do a better job ring-fencing, fire-walling-- whatever metaphor you want to use--between an insured depository  institution and a noninsured investment bank.'' That is a quote from  Chairman Jeb Hensarling, March 2013. That appeared in The Wall Street  Journal.   And this is just what the Volcker rule does.   ``If you're a bank and you want to operate like some nonbank entity  like a hedge fund, then don't be a bank. Don't let banks use their  customers' money  [[Page H3220]]  to do anything other than traditional banking.'' Again, I repeat, that  is what Speaker Paul Ryan said in May 2012 in a townhall meeting.   ``I do support the Volcker rule. I think the concept of proprietary  trading does not belong in banks with FDIC insurance.'' That is a quote  from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, January 2017, during the Senate  confirmation hearings.   Another quote: ``I think the Volcker rule is very important and it is  good. I think the Volcker rule is good. Banks should not be a last  resort to sell securities. Banks should not have prop desks buying  them.''   That was Carl Icahn, the hedge fund manager and currently special  adviser to President Trump on regulatory reform during a 2015  conference.   Another quote: ``Proprietary trading played a big role in  manufacturing the CDOs and other instruments that were at the heart of  the financial crisis. . . . If firms weren't able to buy up the parts  of these deals that wouldn't sell . . . the game would have stopped a  lot sooner.''   This is a quote by Michael Madden, a managing director of the  investment firm BlackEagle Partners and a former Lehman executive.   We have more quotes. Here is one: ``The industry should be  compartmentalized so as to limit the propagation of failures and also  to preserve cultural boundaries.'' That is a quote by John Reed, the  former Citigroup chairman, in a Senate testimony, February 2010.   Further quoting: ``A strong Volcker rule is one of the most important  provisions to prevent `too big to fail' financial institutions, stop  conflicts of interest, and support credit in our economy. . . . Failure  to comply should be severely punished.'' And this is what Reed said in  a letter to regulators, February 2012.   Again, in looking at all of these quotes, we find that there is one  from former Democratic and Republican Secretaries of the Treasury W.  Michael Blumenthal, joined by Nicholas Brady, Paul O'Neill, George  Schultz, and John Snow.   This is what they said: ``Banks benefiting from public support by  means of access to the Federal Reserve and FDIC insurance should not  engage in essentially speculative activity unrelated to essential bank  services.'' Again, all of these gentlemen said this in a letter,  reported in The Wall Street Journal, February 2010. This was a letter  to the editor.   And let me just, again, refer to one of the greatest economists in  this country and the former Chair of the FDIC, Paul Volcker. What did  he say?   He said, in essence: The five banking regulatory authorities have now  successfully responded to the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by  setting out a comprehensive regulation restricting proprietary trading  by commercial banks in the United States. . . . The agencies have dealt  comprehensively with thousands of particular conceptual and practical  questions raised by affected bankers, by legions of lobbyists, by other  interested parties, and by the general public. . . . The result should  help the process of restoring trust and confidence in commercial  banking institutions. It is, after all, those institutions which  benefit from explicit and implicit public support that we count on to  provide a strong, safe, and effective financial system--Paul Volcker,  December 2013.   ``The Volcker rule will make it illegal for firms to use government- insured money to make speculative bets that threaten the entire  financial system and demand a new era of accountability from CEOs who  must sign off on their firms' practices. Our financial system will be  safer, and the American people are more secure because we fought to  include this protection in the law.'' That was President Obama,  December 2013.   Mr. Speaker, with that, I will reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), my friend and champion of  consumers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional  30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire, how many  more speakers does Mr. Hensarling have?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time to close.   This is the third bill that the majority has put on the House floor  this week that is a harmful giveaway to the big banks. I could just  list you all of the deregulatory bills that they have been bringing  forward, but, today, the bill we are considering, H.R. 4790, would  threaten the Volcker rule, which prevents banks from gambling with  taxpayer money. As we have discussed, the Volcker rule is a key  component of Wall Street reform and has prevented risky, speculative  behavior by Wall Street and made our economy safer. It must not be  compromised.   It seems the Republicans have not learned the lessons of the  financial crisis at all. They are working every day to reverse critical  Dodd-Frank reforms and to reopen the door to risky and harmful  practices that led our Nation to economic catastrophe, so I oppose this  bill.   I do not want our Members to be tricked or fooled talking about  community banks. This is not about community banks. This is about the  megabanks. They always use the community banks to lead on some of these  arguments so that people will think that they are doing something for  community banks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
