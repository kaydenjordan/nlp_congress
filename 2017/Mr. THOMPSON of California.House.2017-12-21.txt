 Mr. Speaker, this year has been the worst  fire season in California history. The October fires included 21 major  fires that were fought by over 11,000 firefighters.   They were driven by powerful winds that reached speeds of over 80  miles an hour, and these fires moved, at times, as fast as 200 feet per  second. That is 40 football fields in a minute. They burned nearly  300,000 acres.   They forced over 100,000 people to evacuate their homes, and they  destroyed over 9,000 homes and structures. And, most tragically, 44  people lost their lives.   Our communities have been devastated, Mr. Speaker, but they have also  come together and supported each other in inspiring ways, and now they  begin the very long road to recovery.   I am pleased to see this supplemental funding package will deliver  much-needed funds for fire recovery. I want to specifically thank  Congressmen Calvert, McCarthy, and Pelosi, who came out and saw this  devastation and have been working with us to make sure we get the funds  that we need. I want to thank the appropriators and the appropriations  staff for all their help as well.   With the support of the entire California House delegation, the State  of California has requested $4.4 billion for fire-related disaster  relief. These funds will be vital to helping families rebuild their  homes and their lives and to supporting our community as they rebuild  critical infrastructure and restore essential services.   It is critical that the Federal Government steps up and does its part  to support our long-term recovery. This funding package is an important  first step in that effort.   I have a picture of one of the devastated areas. This is over 3,000  homes in one swath that were just burned to the ground. Folks in  California who experienced this terrible disaster need our help.  [[Page H10390]]    I ask for an ``aye'' vote.
