 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support  of the America COMPETES Act, in particular the inclusion of legislation  to reauthorize title VI of the Higher Education Act sponsored by myself  and Representative Young of Alaska.   This will help our Nation develop a strong foundation in  international education, research, and world language studies,  especially in languages that hold special strategic interests.   The bipartisan, bicameral bill will increase and expand these  programs incorporating some 200 languages and also build international  capacity at minority-serving institutions.   In addition, the America COMPETES Act enhances the Advanced  Technological Education Program at the National Science Foundation,  doubling the authorization for a program that I helped initiate which  strengthens high-tech worker training through community and technical  colleges. It incentivizes critical partnerships between businesses and  schools to meet local workforce needs.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the America COMPETES Act to better  equip our citizens to succeed in an increasingly interconnected world.
