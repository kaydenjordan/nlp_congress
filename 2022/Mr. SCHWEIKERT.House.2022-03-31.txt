 Madam Speaker, you do realize what is going on here,  and I am going to be a little sarcastic because I am frustrated.   Insulin prices are outrageous.   But why is it outrageous?   The fact of the matter is our regulatory mechanic and our payment  mechanic are the very things that broke this, and here you do a piece  of legislation that will break it more.   Please, I beg of the majority: Hire an economist. And I will walk you  through some of the facts on it. So, Madam Speaker, you are doing a  bill here where you are going to subsidize the dollar amount in the  back, but you are still going to keep the regulatory mechanics the way  they are in their archaic designs, and then you are going to be joyful  that individuals will pay what, $35 a vial?   At the same time we are subsidizing it billions and billions and  billions of dollars.   Does anyone have a subscription to an aggregator on healthcare policy  on your side?   You do realize, there is a co-op coming out of the ground right now  that is going to be $50, $55 for a box of five. It is lower than your  subsidized price. And this is their market price.   If you were doing something good for society, you would actually be  moving this covax to the top of the regulatory stack and say: We want  them to get permitted and licensed as fast as possible because they are  still a year plus away. But it is being built right now, and you are  about to screw up the solution. And if you really, really, really,  really care about people--remember, I represent the population with the  second highest number of diabetes. I represent a Tribal community that  is number two in the world. Come with me some time and let me introduce  you to people who have had their feet cut off. If you actually care  about solving the misery, then read the science journals that made it  clear last November, December, the success.   We know how to cure. And for my friend over here, you have a family  member type 1--I know I need to go through the Speaker--but a family  member with type 1, we know how to cure it now. And there is even the  next generation of this. We have even learned how to do the stem cell,  the isolate cell, tag it with a CRISPR so you can do a bio-foundry,  meaning it doesn't have to come from your skin cells, we can basically  now cure type 1 and the same technology will work for type 2. But we  are going to have to deal with some societal issues. If you want to end  the misery in society don't build more clinics, don't do a subsidy, get  this technology to people.   And for those of us who are fiscal hawks and actually care about  where we are going, you do realize that 31 percent of all Medicare  spending is just diabetes. Thirty-three percent of all healthcare  spending is diabetes. And so the brain trust here decides: Hey, let's  subsidize this by billions and billions and billions and billions and  billions of dollars, screw up the movement to actually have cures to  actually have a co-op provide the product dramatically less expensive.   Remember, the co-op is going to bring it in cheaper than the  subsidized price without all the taxpayer money.   Please, I know the virtue signaling here is powerful. The economics  are crap.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West  Virginia (Mr. Mooney).                 Partisan Games--Supreme Court Justice Thomas     Mr. Speaker, tonight is going to be a tricky  presentation, and I want to apologize immediately to those who have to  try take down our words. But tonight, I am going to actually try to  focus on solutions.   Last week, I spent an hour behind this microphone begging our friends  on the left, begging our Democrat colleagues to stop doing much of what  they have been doing. And I demonstrated that it has been hurting  people. Last year was miserable for the working poor, for the poor, for  the middle class.   And in some ways, it is our own fault in this body because  intellectually, this place is calcified--that is my word of the day.  Because we see the math. We see the facts. And we have the folks lay  out what is going to happen. But because it is already part of,  particularly in this case, the left's dogma, we do it anyway. And then  we act surprised here a year later when my community had 10.9 percent  inflation last year.   Year over year, how many people is that crushing? And now we are  seeing some data. And this is important; this isn't transitory. A  number of the most powerful modelers in the economic world in this  country are now starting to ring the alarm bells of both: We are  heading towards a recession and that inflation may now be with us for  decades because of how we have screwed things up in this place.    First, this is as of almost today, you have Goldman Sachs now saying  there is a 27\1/2\ percent chance of a recession--not a slowdown, a  recession, which means two quarters of negative GDP by the end of this  year.   Citi is at 25 percent.   J.P. Morgan is still at 15, which were the numbers from last week.   These numbers have skyrocketed. If you and I looked at this three  weeks ago, it was 9 percent.   Does anyone here actually care about people? Do you care about  working men and women? Do you understand what a recession does to  people? How long it takes to get your feet back underneath you? Let  alone the head kick we are giving to the American public with  inflation.   So here is my goal. I am going to race through just a boatload of  slides here, and I am going to throw out concept after concept after  concept. Some of them are marginal. Some of them you are going to go,  Oh, that makes sense.   But the point is, there are actually solutions. If the left would  ever allow us to offer a genuine amendment in committee, to actually  have a genuine discussion and debate, maybe we could change some hearts  and minds in this place, or just even enlighten some intellect around  here. But that isn't what this place does.   So let's actually start to walk through the bill that a number of  folks are so giddy about today.   I am fixated on diabetes because of what it does and the misery to  parts of my district. I represent a Tribal community that is number 2  as a percentage of population who suffer from diabetes. Come to the  reservation. I will introduce you to families that I have known where  mom has her feet cut off.   But to tout the bill that was passed here today as a solution is an  absolute fraud. You do realize the con job that the Democrats are  touting here? And I am not sure it is purposeful. I don't think they  spent time understanding.   First, you basically created a subsidy bill for Big Pharma.  Congratulations. You didn't reduce the price. What you did is you  created, functionally, $20 billion of subsidy to buy down the price of  insulin. And you bought it down with a fraud because you are doing a-- well, we are going to pretend that the Trump administration's rule in  regard to rebates is in effect, which it was never going into effect.  So you made magic money again.   And at the same time, you just took away the pressure we could have  done together to actually get a real solution on the price of insulin.  And some of that solution could have been something as simple as the  co-op that is in construction right now, that is saying they are going  to bring $30 a vial, $55 a box--and a box is 5 vials--of insulin to  market in a year.   So if we were actually doing solutions here, the Democrats' bill,  working with Republicans, would have been, We are going to put it in  the stack for licensing and permitting. We are going to put aside some  money to make sure that they get their factory up and running in  Virginia as soon as possible.   And, oh, by the way, this is substantially less expensive than the  subsidized version that is going to cost society $20 billion. And you  are handing that to Big Pharma. Isn't that amusing?   I mean, amusing the speechifying here. And the Democrats' approach to  helping people who can't afford their insulin is to blow up the market,  screw up the incentives, and then screw up the actual solution. And the  solution is coming.   Does anyone actually subscribe to something where they read?   And you have got to understand, we need to go--and the whole debate  around diabetes, we have got to go much, much further.   Mr. Speaker, 31 percent of all Medicare spending is diabetes; 33  percent of all healthcare spending. Understand, in 29 years, the United  States is scheduled to have about $112 trillion of borrowed money in  today's dollars.   Mr. Speaker, 75 percent of that is just Medicare, but if 31 percent  of Medicare spending is diabetes, cure it. And you go, But, David, how  would we do that?   Well, I have been to this floor a dozen times over the last 12 months  saying the research is happening. The early numbers look good.   Guess what? It succeeded. Hey, the phase 1s worked. Now we are  actually on another set of phase 1s where they are actually using  CRISPR to tag the stem cell that has become an isolate cell to make it  so you can do a biofoundry. And it could be a production line, so it  doesn't even need to come from your skin to get the stem cells.                                time  1815    Meaning, if we would get our reimbursement sets straight here, our  licensing sets straight here, our incentives lined up. The modelers say  in about 5 years you could actually be rolling out--the cure to type 1  is actually the easy part, it is the cure to type 2 which is much more  difficult. We have to have a brutal conversation of nutrition support  and maybe nutrition support that is healthy.   Encouraging our brothers and sisters in my Tribal communities, the  lifestyles and things, to be ready to actually accept the cure. But the  fact of the matter is it is here. So what did the Democrats just do?  They did a subsidy bill for insulin that is going to cost $20 billion.  How about if they had taken that $20 billion and put it into the price  for getting this cure to market?   It is just an example we don't seem to get our heads around. The  world works in incentives and disincentives. We have made it so  bureaucratic and so expensive that we are in an incumbent protection  racket here. It is not incumbent Members of Congress, it is incumbent  bureaucracies, incumbent business models, and the disruptions like this  that would end so much misery and also be the single biggest thing we  can do to affect the debt in this country.   We applaud ourselves for voting through a bill that actually will  have made things worse. If there is an economist in the room and you  walk through saying, well, because you just functionally government- subsidized this, you just took away the pricing pressure to actually  have the revolution of both the cost and the cure.   I am begging my brothers and sisters here to think. There is this  incredible hope. They have already had the successes in the phase ones,  and now the ability to actually tag it and make it  [[Page H4058]]  so you don't need to be on anti-rejection drugs. Think about what it  means to the health of the country.   Why would I go to diabetes right after showing you that the  projections of a recession at the end of this year are skyrocketing  because you are heading in an approach where you are making a  substantial portion of our population--making them available to  participate in the economy.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to throw out a really uncomfortable subject  for a second. I am the senior Republican on the Joint Economic  Committee and we have been trying a little side project for almost a  year. What makes people poor? What is the real cause of income  inequality? And unlike the rhetorical crap virtue signaling that is  said around here, we are actually starting to find out there are a lot  of things, but health, education, things of that nature that we can  affect are actually major precursors, then you look at the amount of  the population that is in the lower quartiles that either they or their  family or because they have someone who is horribly sick substantially  because of renal failure or diabetes.   My other side of the argument is why this is moral to pursue. It also  would end lots of misery. It would actually really help the poor. It  actually might squeeze down income inequality. It is sort of the  trifecta. Yet, I will do these presentations on how it works and that  it would be amazing for economic growth, and if it truly brought more  of our brothers and sisters to be able to participate in the economy,  it would also be really good for inflation, too.   I have done this slide multiple times. I'm trying to sort of explain  the mechanisms of a stem cell and you can now direct--think of it as a  biofoundry mechanism, sort of like CRISPR. You can direct that stem  cell to become an insulin-producing cell. In the previous slide you can  walk through how you can actually do this in a fashion that it can be  almost a factory production. So even beyond the personalized medicine  concept.   Why this is so important is we are on the cusp of a revolution to  make people's lives so much better--so much healthier. Instead, what we  have done in this place over the last 12 months is we have set off  inflation. We have set off crime. We have set off homelessness because  of really, really bad policies. Lots of great virtue signaling. There  have been beautiful speeches behind these microphones telling you how  much we care and how we feel, and then the economics are just horrible.   Some more of the disruption that I believe would be great for the  country--and the technology is already here, we just have to learn how  to legalize it--is your ability to wear something on your wrist. This  is one of my favorites. I am just going to walk you through a concept.   This is a breath biopsy. A couple versions of this out there think it  would be a couple hundred dollars, at most, and you could have  functionally a medical lab in your medicine cabinet at home. Blow into  it. Within a couple moments it tells you: Hey, guess what, you have a  virus. It can then bang off your medical records, order your  antivirals, and maybe Lyft or someone can drop it off at your house in  a couple hours.   Would that make your life easier? Would that give you more time with  your family and faster to get healed? Would it help crash parts of  healthcare costs? Remember, three-quarters of that $112 trillion is  healthcare, it is Medicare. Healthcare is what is substantially  bankrupting this country.   Do you know what the problem with that technology is? It is illegal.  The fact of the matter is you would let this breath biopsy be able to  order your antivirals, allow the algorithm--and the data says the  algorithm is more accurate than those of us that are humans. I know  that just hurt a bunch of people's feelings.   If you legalize the technology you could have a disruption in the  price of healthcare. You could make this society--our country-- dramatically more efficient and give us more time with our families and  be healthy. It would be an economic virtuous cycle and a healthy one.  It would just require us around here to actually have to deal with the  avalanche of lobbyists that hate this technology. As I said before, we  are sort of calcified intellectually around here, aren't we?   Mr. Speaker, now I want to talk about the heresy that is in President  Biden's budget and the solutions. How many times have you gotten up  here and seen the Speaker herself, multiple times--tax reform in 2017  was for the rich. No, it wasn't. CBO--more revenues came in. Corporate  tax receipts leaped 75 percent after we reformed the tax code a couple  years ago.    The fact of the matter is--what we call receipts in Ways and Means,  revenues as most people would think of--coming into in government went  up dramatically. Why that was so important is that 2018 and 2019 were  our most successful years in modern economic history of poor people  getting less poor, the middle class doing better, income inequality  shrinking, food insecurity shrinking.   Minority populations had the biggest movement ever in U.S. history in  getting less poor, getting wealthier. That income inequality gap shrank  because we got the tax incentives correct. But because it was  Republicans that did it, there is this running away from it--we have  seen--great job, guys. Think about what has happened to this country in  1 year.   You are poorer today than you were 1 year ago. The fact of the matter  is the setting off of inflation--God knows some of the other things  that have gone on and we are going to touch on them--we are poorer  today than we were 1 year ago. Yes, there was COVID. We stood behind  these microphones a year ago and said, you don't want to keep dumping  money the way you are doing, you are going to set off inflation. They  told us to go jump in the lake. Congratulations, they did it.   Now some of the economists are telling us a recession by the end of  the year, oh, and maybe 10 years of an inflationary cycle before we can  squeeze it out of the system.   Once again, if you actually look at the charts, it was actually  working women that exploded. This big of a movement here--I know this  chart doesn't express it--that type of steep curve increasing is  remarkable. It is just remarkable in what happened after tax reform.   It was actually working women, substantially those from minority  populations, that had just remarkable increases in income. They are the  ones that also got crushed during the way we approached the pandemic.  Anyone that tells you, oh, it was this huge give-away of money.   Well, it is sort of amazing because it was the second and the third  highest receipts or revenues in 2018 and 2019. You got to remember  there was a little bit of a con in 2017 because the expensing went in-- you could expense in the last quarter before the tax reform. So the  fourth quarter of 2017 you could begin expensing. So this actually had  some of the economic growth effects pulled into the previous year--I  know I am geeking out a bit--but it continued.   One of the reasons we actually economically held up pretty well is  the Democrats haven't been able to repeal the 2017 tax reform. And I  know this slide is a little hard to see, but it is the best one we  could put together in the short timeframe. Guess what? We crossed over  $4 trillion in revenues and receipts.   If you go back--think about that, it was only a couple years earlier  that we were at $3.3 trillion. You understand, that is like a $700  billion increase in receipts in a time when the Democrats told us we  had eviscerated the tax code and gave it all away. At some point the  calculator does tell the truth.   So back to our earlier thesis. Getting the tax system correct is  amazing for the economics. This is the other side of the question I  want to ask. How many here believe growth is moral? I will try to argue  over and over that economic growth creates opportunity, and those  opportunities driven by that growth is moral. I wish I could just get  us to focus on--that growth also is a way we survive the debt bubble  that is expanding like an alligator mouth. Here is the size of our  economy and here is the scale of the debt.   You do understand that CBO basically says in 9 years, every single  year just our interest payment will be $1 trillion. That is where we  are heading. Here is a crazy thought. If I needed to tap down inflation  today but I wanted to do it by not solely having the Federal Reserve do  monetary policy, which  [[Page H4059]]  is squeezing cash out of the system--remember, inflation is what, too  many dollars chasing too few goods. You have the monetary side of  inflation pull the dollars out of the economy. The other side is to  make more stuff.   This year, expensing. The reality of it--tax reform--it was the  expensing that drove much of the economic expansion, the investment in  productivity, it goes to 80 percent this fiscal year and then drops  down I think to 60 percent the next year. Do a mechanism where you add  a bonus.   If you say: Business, if you are willing to take some of that cash  functioning out of the system and go invest it in productivity capital,  buy a new plant, put in new equipment, do things that will make it so  you can pay workers more. We make more stuff because when we have more  stuff you knock down inflation because it is now the number of dollars  divided by numbers of stuff. Crazy idea.                                time  1830    Do a tax adjustment.   Mr. Speaker, say we are going to give you a bonus on your expenses to  encourage you to take that money out of liquidity and buy things that  make us more productive as a country. It is a win-win, and it has the  benefit of being a long-term benefit to society.   It is sort of. We have been working on this. This is just as a  thought experiment. And it may not be brilliant, but it is more the  concept of right now. Today there are too many dollars chasing too few  goods. Then create a deal with business in America saying, Hey, if you  take some cash, set it aside, functionally, ah, screw it, and you are  going to put it into new equipment that makes it more efficient so you  can have more goods, better transportation, better supply chains, that  is what we want to incentivize instead of trying to buy things today  and shove them in a warehouse because you are worried the price is  going to go up tomorrow.   This is the type of thought experiments policy we should be pursuing,  Mr. Speaker, if you need to knock down inflation but you want to do it  by growing as an economy.   Instead, around here, we are going to sit around on our backsides and  let the Federal Reserve basically squeeze us out and put many people  through months and months and months of recessionary misery because  that is how we are going to knock down inflation.   Another part of the thought experiment: I have some new areas--if I  am blessed enough to represent in the coming cycle--and we did some  polling. And they came back that crime is their number one issue.   I went on a ride-along with a sergeant who is actually a friend. He  was showing me neighborhoods saying, You do realize the homelessness in  these neighborhoods has doubled in a year. Doubled. He is explaining to  me that someone now can get high for a fraction of the cost they could  a year ago. Every single one of those are what we call knockoff  effects, second-degree, third-degree effects.   Do you all remember your high school economics class?   You opened up the borders. What did you think was going to happen?   My community of Phoenix is flooded with narcotics. As a matter of  fact, we just had a bust a couple months ago. There was enough fentanyl  to kill every single resident in Arizona.   So the compassion that this administration and Speaker Pelosi wanted  to show for the border, thank you, because you are killing my  neighbors.   The homelessness--I don't believe the Phoenix market is the only area  that is seeing incredible increases in homelessness. The crime--go on  to the city of Phoenix's heat map and click, click, click, and you can  see the expansion of the crime and where it is moving and the number of  overdoses.   The fact of the matter is when you screw up a policy, then you need  to think through the knockoff effects.   You screwed up the border policy.   How much misery did you bring to society?   Remember, we have done a number of presentations.   What are the two ways you make the working middle class or the  working lower class poorer?   Inflation. We are doing a great job at that. And you flood the  marketplace with people with similar skill sets. So if you are that  individual who may not have finished high school, but you are a good  drywaller and you are busting your backside--and it is hard work; I  hung drywall as a young man--we just flooded the marketplace with  people of similar skill sets.   Does anyone around here own a basic economics book?   So let's go to a couple other things. So the principle there is, get  the border policy right because there is this incredible irony--legal  immigration for individuals with specific talent sets that we actually  need in this society, the young man who just got his Ph.D. at Arizona  State University and is leaving because the State Department's ability  to process visas and ability to be immigration has functionally become  nonexistent in the last 2 years. But over here, a couple million cross  the border.   Does anyone see just the weird irony of the Democrats' policies of,  they hurt?   I don't think they were meant to hurt. I think they had the virtue  signaling quality of sounding compassionate, but that is not what has  happened.   So let's actually walk through a couple of things that are actually  additional solutions.   How many times do we talk about supply chains?   And you have seen the latest data. It basically says--and I am not  going to argue with it because I haven't had a chance to break down the  numbers--half of inflation is we spent too damn much money. But half of  inflation is second degree knockoff effects in supply chains.   So we just did the transportation bill. The transportation bill was  substantially green oriented, very little of the money actually went to  roads and bridges. None of it actually went to disruptive technologies.   But there are ideas like this, where this was some SpaceX engineers  who are out raising capital to build this, where you would actually  have autonomous trains. So you pull a container off, stick it on one of  these, the autonomous lorry right underneath it on the track drives it  to the warehouse it is supposed to be dropped off at.   So you are telling me we have a crisis in truck drivers in the  Alameda Corridor outside L.A. Our ability to use technology, why didn't  we incentivize this sort of thing?   But do you want to know what the Democrats chose to incentivize in  their Build Back Better, Mr. Speaker?   It wasn't creative things to make us more productive as a society. It  was ideas like this: in their legislation it is illegal for the ports  to automate.   Huh?   But they just told us that they were trying to fix the supply  chains--except for the numbers of giveaways to the unions they put into  their legislation that you can't automate the ports.    So on one hand, Mr. Speaker, you have breakthrough technology that  says that we think we have a way to move these containers. And then the  next thing that the brain trust around here does policy-wise is, we are  going to make it illegal for you to do the automation that would move  the supply chains that you are telling us is half the inflationary  spike.   There are solutions. Stop putting up these impediments and start  embracing the technology to fix the problem.   Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining?    So in the President's proposal, in the Democrats'  proposals, they want to tax the rich more. The new President Biden's  budget, I think, has 36 new taxes in it. But here is the great irony.  Okay. So they want to do this one tax where they want to functionally  tax unrealized capital or unrealized gains which is the taking--it will  be ruled unconstitutional. But it is an interesting concept. We want to  make a simple proposal that something both Republicans and Democrats  might agree upon, stop subsidizing the rich. We have come here to this  floor a couple of times and shown there are $1.4 trillion every 10  years that the left subsidizes the rich.   And so what do the Democrats do?   They say: We need to tax the rich more.   Okay. And then they put in Build Back Better you can make $800,000 a  [[Page H4060]]  year and we are going to hand you $125,000 of tax credits--not tax  deductions--credits.   Does anyone see the lunacy going on here?   So the virtue signaling is rich people aren't paying enough, and then  over here we are going to give them 1 trillion-plus dollars in  subsidies, and then they are going to add more in their Build Back  Better for more rich people to have more subsidies. It is just  infuriating.   Does anyone actually read this stuff?   Does anyone own a calculator?   Mr. Speaker, you start to see the numbers.   I have a number of these slides here, and the point is really simple:  policy after policy, if you can afford your fourth $6-million house on  a beach somewhere, do you deserve subsidized flood insurance?   But all through this government there are items like that where we  wink and nod, we say we are going to tax rich people more, and then we  are handing out massive subsidies.   As a Republican, I want to cut spending. You say you want more  revenues, Mr. Speaker. Great. Stop putting through the Tax Code,  regulatory code, these programs of wink, wink, nod, nod, a bunch of  subsidies to people who write checks.   So, Mr. Speaker, you have had a number of, particularly, Republicans  who have come behind the microphone and said: You canceled the Keystone  pipeline. You made it really hard to put new land into production for  pulling hydrocarbons out.   That is actually not the big thing that the left did. What the left  did are things like this where the Securities and Exchange Commission  is functionally adding new rules that if you invest in hydrocarbons or  you are a pension system or these, you are going to have to fill out  paperwork to explain your effect on global warming.   What are your effects on carbon?   They functionally did what we call, they screwed up the capital  stack. So you could have a natural gas field that was substantially  shut down when prices collapsed during the pandemic. It is ready to go,  but you need a bunch of capital to put it back into production.   And where do you go to get a loan, Mr. Speaker?   The Democrats did something brilliant, if the goal was to make us  much poorer and dependent on foreign countries' hydrocarbons like  Venezuela. They said, Okay. We can do the regulatory side, by that is a  little bit obvious, but if we make it so no one can get capital to  actually put these fields into production, they have succeeded.   Do not let someone try to con you, Mr. Speaker, that what you are  paying at the gas pump today and what you had to pay for your heating  bill yesterday happened because of Putin's invasion. Natural gas prices  exploded last September, October.   Mr. Speaker, do you remember this room being full of people wanting  to talk about how we are going to survive the winter heating bills?   That was because if this. It didn't just happen.   But my proposal is, okay. I am fascinated with the use of natural  gas. Our friends on the left, our brothers and sisters on the left,  say, But, David, yes, it may burn about half the CO 2 emitting as coal,  but there is methane.   Let's see if I can find this slide. The technology that is out there  to basically gobble up methane--and maybe this works, maybe it doesn't  work, but the fact that the technology exists and it has been  scientifically proven to work, why wouldn't we pursue that saying: If  you could get your natural gas out--because remember, President Biden  just promised we are going to ship a bunch of liquified natural gas to  Europe, except we don't really have the production right now and you  can't get capital for it and the left is going to protest leakage from  methane. Well, it turns out you can take clay, a copper oxide--so it is  kitty litter. Think about that. It is a cheap solution to absorb that  methane.   Why wouldn't we bring the brain trusts around here and say, We need  the natural gas desperately. Some are worried about the methane bleed.  Fine. Let's find a solution. It turns out there may be a really  inexpensive one.   Why don't we invest and pursue it?   There are solutions.   Instead, around here, it is the Malthusian economics of let's just  shut it down and see how long people are willing to live in poverty and  misery.   The transportation bill again: What is one of the most powerful  things you can do to move traffic in urban areas and suburban areas,  Mr. Speaker?   Technology. It turns out if you actually care about the environment  and you want to move more traffic, invest in the technology that  synchronizes the stoplights that tell you when school is out, so it  synchronizes the lights, the on-ramps to a freeway that tell you when  an ambulance is coming. The studies over and over and over say whether  it be in an algorithm or an AI-managed smart grid system for traffic is  one of the most impactful things you can do, Mr. Speaker, to clean the  air because you move the traffic.   We couldn't get anyone here willing to even listen to one of our  amendments on the left about promoting that type of technology.   There is a biotech revolution going on around us and substantially  this is happening because of what we did in that 2017 tax reform which  moved--exploded--the investments. Whether it be messenger RNA, my  fascination with synthetic biology, the stem cells, there are disease  after disease after disease and misery after misery we are about to  cure. We know how to cure hemophilia now. I think we are on the cusp of  knowing how to cure sickle cell anemia, an incredibly painful disease.  They are here.   This place should be doing everything we can to promote getting those  things to market safely and quickly, as fast as we can to end the  misery. By the way, it has amazing financial benefits to the economy  and to our tax base.   And you start to look at the innovations that are coming right now  from the biotech industry.                                time  1845    One of the reasons I did this--and I didn't bring the other slides.  Then, the left offers their H.R. 3, which, functionally, the  economists, even the leftwing economists, said, yes, it will lower some  drug prices, because we are basically going to do scarcity pricing.  Functionally, we are going to say you can't have certain drugs if it  costs more than a certain amount, like they do in Europe. But it will  also crash the capital stock once again. A lot of you are going to die  because you are not going to get this next generation of cure, and this  amazing cycle of cures that are coming goes away--great virtue  signaling.   The left will tell you they are about to do a piece of legislation to  lower drug prices, and we all go ``yay,'' because they are too high.  But by the end of the decade, there are fewer cures, and the value goes  away because you didn't remove people from being sick.   It is all about curing people. In the misery, help bring those cures  to market.   Personalized medicine, let's legalize it. I showed you the wearables,  those things. This here should be part of your ability to stay healthy.  Legalize it.   Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining.    Forgive me. I have been trying to talk fast so as to  not chew it all up.   Mr. Speaker, in a couple of the pieces of legislation that passed  here, we have put aside boatloads of cash to run wire to rural America,  and they deserve to have internet access.   I thought this slide was amusing, but you are actually seeing it  happening in Ukraine right now. These are a bunch of little kitties in  a Starlink satellite dish because apparently a Starlink satellite dish  stays a bit warm in the winter so it defrosts itself. See, it is cute-- kitties.   But the fact of the matter is, every inch of North America now has  broadband internet. It is a bunch of satellites flying over us.   So, let me get this straight: In Ukraine, they are now using this,  Starlink, to be able to communicate, but we can't seem to get our  brothers and sisters here in the House of Representatives to understand  there is a solution to broadband all over the country. They just happen  to be flying in low-Earth orbit above our heads. It is here.   Instead, we are going to turn around and put out billions and  billions and  [[Page H4061]]  billions and billions of dollars of subsidies to put more fiber and  more wire in the ground to the middle of nowhere.   Mr. Speaker, there is a huge disruption coming. We need to make sure  that our regulatory and policy sets are ready for this.   This is another thing that would also dramatically help this coming  decade's inflation cycle. Researchers, particularly at the University  of Illinois, have done this remarkable thing. I did a series of  presentations on this a year ago. I will do this real quick.   You-all remember your high school biology class. You remember a C4  plant, plants that really, really want carbon to turn it into a sugar  and grow. But they accidentally grab an oxygen molecule, and they have  to spend all of this energy purging that oxygen molecule and go back  and try to get a carbon molecule. I know this is a little geeky, but it  is important to get our heads around it.   They have come up with a way to tweak the plant so, every time, it  always grabs the carbon so it turns it into a sugar. Some plants will  grow 40 percent more efficiently on the same land, the same fertilizer,  and the same water. You do realize, just that basic math--and it won't  turn out this way, but just conceptually--that is like removing every  car off the face of the Earth.   If our brothers and sisters really care about the environment, they  would be running as fast as they can to allow these types of available  technologies to feed the world and feed our country. Yes, it would be a  disruption, but these things exist.   Mr. Speaker, the other topic I want to touch on is a tax policy. This  is a conceptual one.   How many of you have ever heard of a VAT tax, a value-added tax?  Okay, so much for the enthusiasm.   A value-added tax is what substantially most of the rest of the world  uses. If we are going to have a conversation about: We want businesses  back in the United States; we want manufacturing back in the United  States; we want to take on China; we are going to do tariffs; we are  going to do these regulations; and we are going to do import and export  controls--great. Realize most of those aren't really going to do much.  Here is how I am going to try to explain what the rest of the world  does to stick it to the United States.   This is a picture of a beautiful Audi. Let's pretend it is a $100,000  car. My guess is, this one is a little more expensive. It is being made  in Germany, but someone in Scottsdale, Arizona, is about to buy this  Audi.   When it is in Germany, there is a 19 percent VAT tax on it, a value- added tax. But the moment it leaves the shore of Germany and is on its  way to the United States, the car has been exported. They give them  back the $19,000, that 19 percent. When it comes to the United States,  it is $19,000 less than it was sitting there in Germany. When it hits  our shore, we put a small tariff or duty on it.   But the $100,000 Tesla that is made in Texas, when someone in Germany  is buying it, it has all the tax load--corporate tax, income tax, all  the other things that we would do in the United States--in that price.  When this car leaves the United States, we don't refund 19 percent of  the taxes. It hits the German shore, and they put that $19,000 on top  of the price.   So, we get it both ways, coming and going. When we want to export,  other countries put their VAT tax on our products. But when they send a  product to us, they take it off.   We can be incredibly competitive. We can automate in ways to make up  for labor differential costs. Our energy costs are actually much more  competitive than the rest of the world.    Why isn't all manufacturing in the United States right now? It is  because we are basically getting arbitraged on the value-added tax  because the rest of the world refunds it. Until we fix that, all the  talk of ``we want made in America,'' the math doesn't work.   There are a couple of creative solutions. They are technically  difficult, where you would have to take that refunded VAT and put it  back on at our shore, so, functionally, everyone is treated exactly the  same. The $100,000 American-made car and the $100,000 German-made car  have the same tax load when they are being sold in their respective  countries.   I have been trying to figure out a way to try to explain this concept  simply, but the tax system, the current tax system as it is, is one of  the reasons it is so difficult to compete with other countries'  manufacturing, because they refund that value-added tax.   Mr. Speaker, the last thing is, I am truly worried about something. I  believe it is going to affect the United States, but I fear it is going  to affect the entire world.   How many of you have seen the stories that a number of the agrarian  economists, food economists, believe that this coming fall, parts of  the world are going to starve?   The price of fertilizer is up dramatically. The price of grain is up  dramatically. Putin's war on Ukraine has screwed up the grain markets.   Do we have a moral obligation to step up and understand that, 6  months from now, part of the world may be starving? What happens in the  world when you have people going hungry? You have violence and horrible  things happening.   We see it coming. All the things we are seeing in the futures  markets, the price of fertilizer blowing up, if they don't actually  affect food supplies, if I am wrong, it is a free option. But if I am  right, we should be pulling the alarm cord.   We should be begging farmers--in our farm policy, our ag committee,  we should be removing set-asides, encouraging ways to take corn that  would be used to make corn-based ethanol and turn it into animal feed,  using the rotation that is already happening to soy because soy only  uses--it is not my specialty--a quarter or a third of the amount of  fertilizer.   If this is about to happen to the world, and we see it 6 months  ahead, what is our moral obligation to pull that alarm cord and get it  right? By getting it right, we also help our own inflation and maybe a  couple of million people don't die in sub-Saharan Africa.   Mr. Speaker, I know that was a lot of different subjects thrown  really quickly. If someone is interested, almost everything I touched  on, we have done much longer presentations on how the policy would  work, how it would help inflation, how it would make people's lives  healthier and better.   But my point tonight is a really simple one. Stop doing the things  that ultimately are hurting people. Start looking for the optimism and  the opportunity that can make America more prosperous, that can make  the poor less poor, and that can actually knock down inflation. It  would actually be able to be done together.   A lot of these ideas aren't actually Republican or Democrat. They are  just disruptive. If we would embrace the disruption, this could be an  amazing decade. Right now, the data we are getting today, we may be in  for years of misery because of policy from this last year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
