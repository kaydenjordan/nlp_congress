 Mr. President, I rise today in support of President  Trump's nomination of Indiana's Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme  Court.   In the coming days, Americans will hear a great deal about Judge  Barrett--much of it from people who have never met her, who have never  worked with her. As a fellow Hoosier, I have had the privilege of  actually getting to know Judge Barrett and her family and to understand  the breadth of her intellect and the thoughtful reasoning of her work.  My own opinions have been informed by my personal interactions with her  and supported by the countless students, clerks, and former colleagues  who, despite their very political beliefs, are united in their  admiration for Judge Barrett. They will second what I tell you here.   Amy Coney Barrett's qualifications to fill this seat are beyond  question. The character she will demonstrate, once in it, will be  exceptional.   Her career is beyond distinguished. She graduated magna cum laude  from Rhodes College and summa cum laude from Notre Dame Law School in  South Bend, IN. She was highly decorated while doing both, including  Dean's Recognition Award and best exam in numerous courses.  [[Page S5930]]    She held prestigious clerkships for Judge Laurence Silberman on the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and for the late Justice  Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court.   She is a respected educator, teaching for nearly two decades at Notre  Dame's Law School, where she was named Distinguished Professor of the  Year three times.   In 2017, she was nominated to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Circuit  Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. I have to say, I was  incredibly pleased by her nomination to the Federal bench, and I was  proud to vote for her confirmation.   I wasn't alone in my esteem for Judge Barrett. During her  confirmation process, those students and colleagues--former and  current--came forward with words of support and praise by the score.  They described her as fair and decent, brilliant and generous. They  were struck by her integrity, her impartiality, and her temperament.  They spoke of her dedication to teaching students not how to think but  how to think for themselves. They recalled the long lines extending  outside of her office of those students who sought and were always  given advice and mentoring.   Though they came from different backgrounds and held differing views,  they came together as a chorus to say this: Amy Coney Barrett possesses  exactly the type of mind and the strength of character America's  constitutional system relies on. I agreed then, and I still do.   Just 3 years ago, I didn't hear a single credible criticism of Judge  Barrett based on her legal qualifications. I don't anticipate hearing  one now. She will be guided by the law and precedence. She will be  faithful to the Constitution.   As compelling as the testimonies of those who admire her are, it is  through her own words that we can see the type of Supreme Court Justice  Amy Barrett will be: ``A judge is obligated to apply the law as it is  and not as she wishes it would be.''   Judge Barrett has said: ``She is obliged to follow the law even when  her personal preferences cut the other way or when she will experience  great public criticism for doing so.''   It is important for Americans to understand her qualifications for  the Supreme Court and her fidelity to the Constitution. But they should  also know a bit about her life away from the bench.   When I met her, it was quite obvious that Amy Coney Barrett was less  interested in cataloging her professional accomplishments and more  inclined to discuss her family and the accomplishments of her children,  whom she clearly loves so very much.   Judge Barrett and her husband Jesse have been married for over 20  years now. Their family is a large one and a loving one. They are  parents to seven children. Their youngest son has special needs. They  have twice adopted--both times from Haiti. Judge Barrett has asked:         What greater thing can you do than raise children? That's       where you have your greatest impact on the world.    It is clear not just from those words but from simply spending a few  moments with this beautiful family that this is her life's joy and her  greatest point of pride.   How absurd then to see her described, as some here and in the media  have, as anti-healthcare. It is the opposite, actually. As the head of  a large household, Amy Coney Barrett knows full well and better than  most of her detractors how important medical coverage is to every  American's health and to their peace of mind too. This includes  insurance for those with preexisting conditions--which Republicans  have, time and time again, committed to protect, while working to make  healthcare more affordable and more accessible.   This is actually not why Judge Barrett was nominated or why she  belongs on the Supreme Court. Let us be truthful. It is also not the  real reason why those who oppose her do so and do so with such rage. In  the absence of actual objections to Amy Coney Barrett's resume, they  rummaged through and purposely warped Judge Barrett's record. They  warped her legal writings to position her as the mortal enemy of  ObamaCare. This is a lie. Her scholarship--if properly read, rather  than quickly mined for propaganda--reveals no such thing.   For 30 years, Democrats have continually cried wolf, painting every  Republican Supreme Court nominee as the end of the Republic, hoping  always to scare the American people to their side. Just as we witnessed  2 years ago, when their lies run out of believers, the lies grow more  reckless. This is a dangerous game to play right now--doubly so for the  party that is blocking healthcare legislation during a pandemic.   Judge Barrett hasn't been nominated to the Supreme Court to make  policy. Some seem to have forgotten, but that is our job. President  Trump selected her not only because of her sharp mind and impressive  qualifications but because she will not legislate from the bench. That  is the whole point.   Of course, there are others who may take a different, even darker  tack. To them, none of this matters--not the impeccable credentials,  not the ringing endorsements, not that she is a role model of an  accomplished professional and a loving mother, not that she has been  described as ``mind-blowingly intelligent'' and ``one of the most  humble people you will ever meet''--none of it. We will hear from them  in coming days--likely in this Chamber. We will hear a lot from them.   If past is prologue, they may choose to focus instead on Judge  Barrett's religious beliefs--not out of any deep conviction but out of  desperation. They may argue that it is impossible to live a life of  faith and uphold the law. They may create a caricature of Judge Barrett  that has no relation to reality and one that reflects their own  intolerance, not hers. It is regrettable that, in 2020, we must still  repeat this refrain: We do not have a religious test for public service  in the United States of America, and we never have.    It is true. Judge Barrett is a faithful Catholic. It is true. So,  too, are five current Supreme Court Justices. So, too, are millions of  Americans. To argue that this prohibits her from sitting on the Supreme  Court is nothing short of religious bigotry.   In 1793, George Washington penned a letter to the members of the New  Jerusalem Church of Baltimore, MD. In it, Washington outlined one of  the principles that makes America so unique. ``A man's religious  tenets,'' he wrote, ``will not deprive him of the right of attaining  and holding the highest offices that are known in the United States.''   Happily, 200 years later, we now apply Washington's equation  regarding the holding of high office to both men and women. It is  unfortunate, though, that, two centuries later, we must still be  reminded that all Americans can worship and pray as they please, and no  doors of opportunity shall be closed because of it.   And there is this: Since our founding, 114 Americans have sat on the  Supreme Court. Only four of them have been women.   Are those who oppose this President and this pick really willing to  use religious prejudice as an excuse to oppose confirming the fifth?  Come on. If so, the faith my colleagues should be worried about isn't  Judge Barrett's but the American people's in this institution.   In the coming weeks, I hope we don't regress into religious bigotry.  I hope the Senate can move past the personal attacks of some past  nominees and, instead, focus on the professional qualifications and  judicial comportment of Judge Barrett.   We are constitutionally obligated to provide our advice and consent  to the President on his judicial nominees. My hope--and, perhaps, it is  a naive one--is that we will fulfill that responsibility by holding  hearings that are informative rather than destructive, not unlike those  that led to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's bipartisan confirmation in  1993.   If the Senate does this and we consider Judge Barrett's  qualifications, she will be confirmed and subsequently serve with great  honor and distinction, and she will do the American people proud. Both  the High Court and our country will be better for it.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
