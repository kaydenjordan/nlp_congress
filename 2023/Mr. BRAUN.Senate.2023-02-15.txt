 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to let these  comments be made before the vote, and I will keep them brief.    Madam President, yesterday, I spoke about a new law passed  by the DC City Council. This law lowers penalties for crimes like  carjacking and robbery. Thankfully, Congress is stepping in to stop  this legislation.   DC, Washington here, should be an example of our American ideals.  Sadly, it is becoming an example of the crime we are experiencing  across the country in our larger cities. In Chicago, the Midwest, there  are new records being broken in the wrong way each week, in New York,  and even in places like my State capital of Indianapolis. It should be  a wake-up call to crack down. Yet city governments keep going the other  way.   The first priority of any government should be the safety of its  citizens, especially at the local level, where you live each day. We  know a big part of this is not about the laws we have. We have a lot of  laws on the books. They are not enforced. In my State capital of  Indianapolis, I have a prosecutor who will not enforce those laws, and  even in the heart of our country, the Midwest, you have the same issue.   I guess the most disturbing part of all of this is the hatred for our  police. They place their safety at hazard to protect ours. Too often,  they pay the ultimate price in doing so.  [[Page S412]]    (The remarks of Mr. BRAUN pertaining to the introduction of S. 459  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    Madam President, we lost a Hoosier recently who spent 7  years fighting ALS. I was proud here, along with Senator Coons, to  start the ALS Caucus. ALS is one of those diseases, when you are  diagnosed with it, for which there is not a very good prognosis--3 to 4  years, maybe, sometimes.   Corey Polen from Indiana was able to stretch it out to 7 years and  fought valiantly along the way. He was involved in trying to take his  cause and help others. Currently, there is no cure, and there is  severely limited access to treatment options.   Since I have been here, I have been trying to reform healthcare in  general. That is a task when you have one side of the aisle that  doesn't think there is anything to do there or isn't interested in it  and the other side maybe wanting to have more government when I think  we need to reform it in an underlying way and make it more transparent,  more competitive, and remove barriers to entry so that you have doctors  and nurses wanting to come into the profession.   Let's take this commonsense part of it. This is a disease, along with  several other diseases, for which, once you are diagnosed, you do not  have time, and you are beset by a cumbersome process that keeps people  from getting into and even staying in treatment. We need to fix that to  where, through the Promising Pathway Act, which I have had out there  and which is gaining stride, we need to make an exception for those  ailments that have treatments in progress and where the individuals  suffering from them are willing to take the risk. They want to do that  because there is no other option, especially when there are promising  treatments that you are working with.   In Corey's case, his journey began in October 2015. He was hiking  with his wife Jennifer in Arizona. On that hike, he kind of hurt his  ankle and noticed more. He then returned to his hometown and wanted to  look into it further. That is when he got that bleak diagnosis.   All along the journey, as his condition was getting worse, he was out  there to help others with it. His main goal for us here in Congress was  for us to get something like the Promising Pathway Act across the  finish line, which would give hope to him and to all of the others with  similar diseases who are frustrated by the fact that we can't move  quickly enough, especially when there is stuff in the works that looks  like it is going to be someday, if not a cure, at least a mitigation to  the disease. We weren't able to get that done.   I would ask my fellow Senators and someone else in the House to carry  it. We need to get this across the finish line. A panel of FDA advisers  voted 7 to 2 that there was enough evidence to do something different.  That gave hope to people like Corey and others that something would get  done, but it hasn't happened. We have this under our own control to get  it done, and it is well past time to get it done.   I have been here going on now into my fifth year, and we have been  dragging our feet. I am going to roll up my sleeves and get it done,  and we are going to keep pursuing this effort through our ALS Caucus.  Senator Coons and I have done it, and we have made headway. But why  wouldn't we, when we have been dawdling with this issue for so long,  not give the benefit of the doubt to treatments that are promising and  get this across the finish line for these individuals who have no other  hope but for us to get it done?   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, Indiana has lost several officers in the  line of duty in the last 2 years, like Terre Haute Officer Greg Ferency  and Richmond Officer Seara Burton.   I would like to say a few words about Elwood Police Officer Noah  Shahnavaz, who was killed in the line of duty last year in a little  town in Indiana. He was only 24 years old. He was shot during a routine  traffic stop by a violent career criminal who should have been behind  bars. His parents, Laurie and Matt, remembered their son to my office  with these words:         All that Noah ever wanted to do is help others. Society has       been robbed of the many positive impacts he would have had on       our world.    When a police officer is killed in the line of duty, it sends a shock  wave through the community, and it is happening in far too many places.   I decided after his death that I wanted to take the lead in  reintroducing the Thin Blue Line Act. This bill would make targeting  police officers an aggravating factor in favor of the maximum sentence.  It has already passed through the House of Representatives once before.  We need to do it again in this Congress and get it through the Senate  as well.   Supporting our police shouldn't be a partisan issue. This law  wouldn't apply in every case, but it would make criminals think twice  before targeting our police. We have to do everything we can to protect  those who protect us. The one thing we could do to fight back against  crime is to support those on the frontline. We need to give them the  resources they need and send a clear message to those who wish to do  them harm: If you target a police officer, you are going to pay the  highest price possible.   We need to get that done.                            ____________________     Madam President, Indiana has lost several officers in the  line of duty in the last 2 years, like Terre Haute Officer Greg Ferency  and Richmond Officer Seara Burton.
