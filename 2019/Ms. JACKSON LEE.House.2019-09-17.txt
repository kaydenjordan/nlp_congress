 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  1618, the ``Nicholas and Zachary Burt Carbon Monoxide Poisoning  Prevention Act of 2019.''   I thank Congresswoman Kuster of New Hampshire for introducing this  legislation which will save the lives of many children.   H.R. 1618 directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish  a grant program to provide assistance to States for specified  activities related to the prevention of carbon monoxide poisoning,  including installation of alarms in certain dwellings and facilities.   More specifically, this grant would assist in installing alarms in  dwelling units of low-income families or the elderly, childcare  facilities, public schools, senior centers, and student dorms owned by  public universities.   In addition to installation efforts, this bill would also assist in  enforcement and education efforts related to carbon monoxide detectors.   Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced by burning  fuel.   Exposure to unhealthy levels of carbon monoxide can lead to carbon  monoxide poisoning, a serious health condition that could result in  death.   In the month of August, a carbon monoxide leak at the Raveneaux  Apartments in Houston sent eighteen people to the hospital--seven of  these victims were children.   This time, all of the victims survived.   More than 150 people in the United States die from carbon monoxide  poisoning every year.   Home deaths account for the majority of accidental carbon monoxide  poisoning, and research shows that purchasing and installing carbon  monoxide alarms close to the sleeping areas in residential homes and  other dwelling units can help avoid fatalities.   That is why I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 1618.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  806, the Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2019.   I want to thank Congressman Mike Thompson for introducing H.R. 806  which will help to save the lives of countless children.   H.R. 806 directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to  require fuel containers to include devices that impede flames from  entering the container.   This requirement applies to flammable, liquid fuel containers of  fewer than five gallons that are intended for transport.   The bill also requires child resistant caps on kerosene and diesel  fuel containers.   CPSC may either promulgate a rule or adopt an existing standard.   Additionally, CPSC must educate consumers about dangers associated  with using or storing such containers near an open flame or a source of  ignition.   On September 21, 2013, a 10-year-old boy, Christopher Allsup, died  when an old red plastic gas container exploded showering him with  burning gasoline.   Over 90 percent of his body was burnt.   He was flown to the University of Iowa Burn Center where he lived for  only 5 hours.   In 2010, Robert Jacoby had poured gasoline from a gas can onto a  brush pile he planned to ignite, he then walked the can 20 feet from  the pile when it exploded.   He said he had not yet lit a match or any other fire but claimed a  spark from static electricity created by the friction between the  plastic can and his denim jeans was the source of ignition.   Jacoby suffered severe burns over 75 percent of his body and spent  four months in a burn unit, incurring $1.5 million in medical bills.   In August in preparation for Hurricane Dorian a resident of Fort  Myers, Florida had filled several gasoline canisters and stored them  next to a natural gas-powered water heater.   A hot shower triggered the water heater causing it to work harder  with the vapors of the gasoline ultimately starting a fire in the  garage.   Luckily, water coming from the pipe sprayed everywhere, containing  the fire to the garage.   Gasoline from gas cans is responsible for deaths and injuries both  from ignition and the volatile vapors as well as from direct aspiration  into the lung or aspiration following vomiting of ingested gasoline.   For children, the most serious types of injuries associated with  exposure to gasoline are burns following ignition of the volatile  vapors, chemical pneumonia, pulmonary damage, and possible death  associated with direct aspiration into the lungs or aspiration during  vomiting following ingestion.   The filling of portable fuel containers or ``gas cans'' in pickup  trucks and cars can result in serious fires as a result from the  buildup of static electricity from the bed liner or carpet.   Under certain limited conditions--including a very low volume of  gasoline left inside--a flashback explosion can occur inside a plastic  gas can, when gas vapor escaping the can contacts a source of ignition  such as a flame or spark.   Since 1998 the CPSC has tallied at least 1,200 emergency room visits  and 11 deaths due to gas can explosions.   That is why I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 806.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committees on the Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Budget, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 4285, the Department of Veterans Affairs  Expiring Authorities Act of 2019, which among other things,  reauthorizes the VA Vendee Loan Program.   The VA Vendee Loan program allows veterans, non-veterans, owner- occupants, and investors the opportunity to purchase VA real estate  owned properties.   Veterans have the opportunity to purchase these properties with  little to no money down, competitive interest rates, 15 or 30 year loan  term options, and no appraisal requirement or pre-payment penalties.   H.R. 4285 would provide a one-year extension to this critical program  that gives veterans a viable alternative to traditional financing.   The Department of Veterans Affairs is making a positive impact on the  lives of thousands of veterans and beneficiaries.   For example, in the Philippines, the Manila Regional office is the  only Veterans Affairs office outside the United States or its  territories.   This legislation will create a one-year extension of VA's authority  to operate a Regional Office in the Philippines, providing benefits  claims, local payment of benefit checks, and other social services to  thousands of U.S. veterans living oversees in the Philippines.   In addition, H.R. 4285 will provide a two year extension of authority  to fund financial assistance for supportive services to very low income  veteran families in permanent housing, and a one-year extension of VA's  authority to temporarily expand payments and allowances for beneficiary  travel in connection with veterans receiving care from vet centers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4285,  the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2019, to  continue providing the Department of Veterans Affairs the resources to  continue providing services to our nation's veterans.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  2134 the ``Helen Keller National Center Reauthorization Act of 2019.''   Helen Keller was an American author, political activist, and lecturer  who was the first deaf-blind person to earn a Bachelors Degree in the  United States.   She was born in Tuscumbia, Alabama on June 27, 1880 and she spent her  life campaigning for women's suffrage, labor rights and antimilitarism.   The Helen Keller National Center Act established a Helen Keller  National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults to provide specialized  intensive services for deaf-blind persons, to train personnel to  provide such services, and to conduct applied research, development,  and demonstrations relating to communication techniques, teaching  methods, aids, devices and delivery of services.   This bill requires an annual audit of the Center and it directs the  Secretary of Education to ensure that Center service and training  programs are monitored regularly, and Center operation is evaluated  annually, with written reports to the President and Congress submitted  by specified deadlines.   There are approximately thirty-six million adult Americans that  suffer some type of hearing loss and approximately ten million  Americans that are blind or visually impaired.   This legislation will help ensure that these Americans get the help  they need to fulfill their dreams.   That is why I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 2134.
