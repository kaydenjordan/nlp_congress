 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from  California for her astuteness, and, certainly, the manager of this  legislation, and our friends on the other side of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I simply want to try to craft the importance of H.J.  Res. 46 that we will ultimately be debating today. As an original  cosponsor, I was quick to try to bring order and to recognize the  importance of the Constitution.   Clearly, the statute might be interpreted to be used in a reckless  manner. But it is precise in that it deals with the necessity of  building military construction and other matters in the course of war  that are an emergency.   It might even cover rising gun violence, the fact that we have more  guns in the United States than we have citizens.   It might be that if there was a pending war on the southern border,  one might determine that that is the case.   It might be that, in 2001, the first sense of terrorism came when an  individual crossed the northern border to attack the United States. If  that had continued with throngs of terrorists coming across the  northern border, the President then might have declared a national  emergency.   But we do not have that, Mr. Speaker. What we have is a person's  desire.   We understand that the apprehensions at the southern border have  actually gone down. The combined 521,000 apprehensions for border and  Customs agents for fiscal year 2018 was 32,288 apprehensions fewer.   Those who are coming across the border in the last 6 to 8 months are  coming across as mothers and children fleeing the catastrophe of  bloodshed in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. These are people  desperate for help. They are coming through legal ports of entry.   How do I know that? I have stood and watched them come. I have spoken  to a mother whose baby was 45 days old. She had birthed on her road  here, not because she just wanted a vacation, but because they had  committed to decapitating her if she did not leave town immediately,  meaning leave one of the countries. It was my plea that got her to be  able to go to a hospital. I held little Roger in my hands, who is 9  months old. He had been separated at the border from his family.   These are the issues that are being addressed at the border. There is  no catastrophe.   Let me be very clear, as my friends always cite illegal immigration,  I want to make sure that any criminal, no matter who they are, who does  any injury to anyone in the United States, count me as standing on the  side of bringing that person to justice. But that is not what is  happening at the border.                                time  1245    Therefore, I would ask the administration to attend themselves to the  Constitution, to recognize the difficulty or the wrongness of  distorting the purposes of the United States Congress, the House, that  has the purse strings by calling it a national emergency. My God, if we  were to have one, would this Nation even understand how to implement it  because they are hearing it being declared in a very foolish way?   I conclude by simply saying that 58 people in national security, Mr.  Speaker--58 of them--have indicated this is wrongheaded and jeopardizes  our national security.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for the resolution that I  have cosponsored, H.J. Res. 46.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member on the Judiciary  Committee and senior member on the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland  Security Subcommittee, I, too, am glad of the underlying discussion  regarding the protecting of women.   I rise today to support H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act  of 2019, to close the gun show loophole, supported by 80 percent of the  American people, so unlicensed dealers cannot, undercover, out of the  back of their trunk, sell to people who would create and perpetrate  either mass murders or individual abuse and gun violence.   I also support H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,  that would, in fact, have stopped the deaths at the Mother Emanuel  Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where worshippers were shot down,  nine of them.   To listen to the debate in the Judiciary Committee, 10 hours of  rebuffing these simple legislative initiatives, I beg of my colleagues  to stand with us. It is clear that we have an amendment, Horn and  Murphy, that clarifies great bodily harm, includes domestic violence,  dating partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse.  We want women to be protected and others involved in domestic abuse  circumstances.   My amendment that will be brought up as well will provide the  information as to how many times the FBI has had to deal with petitions  that have been denied.   Let us not have another 20 years before we have bills that deal with  gun safety legislation. Let's do it now.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule governing debate on  H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019'' and H.R. 1112,  the ``Enhanced Background Check Act of 2019,'' as well as the  underlying legislation.   These legislative proposals address and strengthen the background  check system that is already in place to purchase a firearm.   A 2013 study found that approximately 80 percent of all firearms  acquired for criminal purposes were obtained from sources who were not  required to run a background check, and that 96 percent of inmates who  were not prohibited from possessing a firearm at the time they  committed their crime obtained their gun this way.   This loophole exists largely because unlicensed sellers need not  conduct any background check under current law, even if the sellers  sell a large number of guns.   H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would make  it illegal for any person who is not a licensed firearm importer,  manufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to any other person who  is not so licensed without a background check.   Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm under this measure would be  required to visit a licensed firearms dealer to run the necessary  background check before the transfer could be finalized.   H.R. 8 is intended to provide an accurate and speedy manner to ensure  firearms do not end up in the wrong hands.   An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  demonstrated that NICS background checks are approximately 99.3 percent  to 99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed  within 90 seconds.   H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would  strengthen the background check procedures federal firearms licensees  or dealers follow before selling or transferring a firearm.   As under current law, firearms dealers would be required to run a  background check on prospective buyers using the NICS.   Over 90% of checks are completed within 90 seconds so if the NICS  system has not returned an answer to the licensed firearms dealer  within ten days, the prospective firearms purchaser may file a petition  with the Attorney General for review.   After another ten-day period has expired, the licensed firearms  dealer may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if  it has not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer  has no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from  obtaining a firearm under federal, state, or local law.   Thus, under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or  transfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days  have passed, since the initial background check.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding effective action to  reduce, if not prevent altogether, the countless mass shootings and gun  violence in our country that continue to claim so many innocent lives.   Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and  Prevention found firearm-related deaths rose for the second-straight  year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.   In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that  there were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more  than 2015.   An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about  11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.   Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and  violence deterrence.   There is nearly one mass shooting per day in the United States--355  mass shootings in 2018.   In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School  in Newtown,  [[Page H2125]]  Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.   Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings,  with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.   On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large  crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las  Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.   And on November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First  Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year- old Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 and injured 20 others.   Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence,  resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.   States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates-- as much as 114 percent higher than other States.   A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  looking at 30 years of homicide data found that for every 1 percent  increase in a State's gun ownership rate, there is a nearly 1 percent  increase in its firearm homicide rate.   Gun death rates are generally lower in States with restrictions such  as safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.   Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.   Because more than 75 percent of the weapons used in mass shootings  between 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally, stronger legislation is  needed to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.   And that begins with passing H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background  Checks Act of 2019,'' and H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Check  Act of 2019.''   I urge all Members to support the rule and the underlying legislation  when it comes to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The only crisis is the constitutional crisis that has been created by  the President of the United States by his direct and ill-conceived  abuse of power which is noted in the Constitution as a violation of the  Constitution.   It is sad that the President has declared a national emergency for  the purpose of misappropriating funds from previously designated and  important uses to build a wall, uses that would be dealt with in a  national emergency in case of war that would then call for the building  of direct materials and buildings necessary for troops engaging in war.   The only response to my good friend who has come back from the border  and saw people going over the border is to engage more Border Patrol  agents and train them to do the job that they are designated to do. We,  as Democrats, support that.   Illegal border crossings are at a near 40-year low. Sixty national  security personnel, ambassadors, CIA, DNI, and others have indicated  that this is wrongheaded. It is wrong.   The President's declaration clearly violates Congress' exclusive  power of the purse, and if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the  balance of powers, violating our Founder's vision for America. That is  unconstitutional.   To quote Thomas Paine in ``Common Sense,'' it says, `` . . . in  absolute governments the king is law, so in free countries the law  ought to be king.'' This is the abuse, the declaration, and we should  vote for the underlying resolution to restore constitutional order.    Let me also indicate that as a member of the  Homeland Security Committee, the numbers of Mexicans from Mexico has  decreased.   The numbers coming now are what we call OTMs, other than Mexican.  They are coming and fleeing bloodshed in countries where they are being  threatened with a decapitation of their head.   Mothers are being told that if you stay, we know you are pregnant,  you can have the baby, and we will kill you after the birth. These are  the stories that those of us who visited the border are hearing over  and over again.   If there is a crisis, it is a humanitarian crisis. We, as Democrats,  have no problem with funding the resources necessary for the border,  including, as indicated, the increase in personnel, technology, and  transportation equipment.   I have been to the border when the need for night goggles and other  types of equipment were rendered important. Let us do the right thing.  Vote on this resolution, and do the constitutional point of restoring  order to this government.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our Constitution and in  defense of our republic and urge all members to join me in voting for  H.J. Res. 46, which terminates the phony declaration of emergency  issued by the President on February 15, 2019.   The reason this resolution is before us today is because of the  petulant intransigence of a single person, the current President of the  United States.   As a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary and the  Committee on Homeland Security, I have visited the southern border on  numerous occasions in recent weeks and months and can state confidently  that there is no national emergency or national security crisis that  justifies the President's reckless and unconstitutional decision or  compels the Congress to abdicate its responsibilities under Article I  to check and balance the Executive Branch.   The President is only pursuing this tactic of declaring a national  emergency after realizing that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was absolutely  correct when she informed him that he did not have the support in  Congress to require the taxpayers to pay for his broken promise that  ``Mexico would pay for the wall, 100 percent!''   In fact, according to the latest Marist Poll, the most recent polling  data available, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the President's  national emergency declaration by a 61 percent-36 percent margin.   The President's decision is opposed by both men and women in every  region of the country, by every income group and education category.   National security experts across the political spectrum are unanimous  in their assessment that the situation on the southern border does not  constitute a national emergency, an assessment echoed by leading former  Republican senators and Members of Congress.   They understand that after failing to convince the American people or  Congress to pay  [[Page H2139]]  for his ineffective, wasteful, and immoral multibillion dollar concrete  wall, the President has now embarked on a course of conduct that is  deeply corrosive of the constitutional system of checks and balances  wisely established by the Framers and which has served this nation and  the world so well for nearly 250 years.   Having failed miserably to achieve his objective in the  constitutional legislative process, the President is trying a desperate  11th hour end-run around Congress with an unlawful emergency  declaration that contravenes the will of the American people and  negates the awesome power of the purse vested exclusively in the  Congress of the United States.   The Congress will not tolerate this.   Despite being repeatedly admonished and in the face of overwhelming  evidence to the contrary, the President continues to propagate false  information regarding the state of our southern border.   Mr. Speaker, these are the facts.   Net migration from Mexico is now zero or slightly below (more people  leaving than coming) because of a growing Mexican economy, an aging  population and dropping fertility rates that have led to a dramatic  decrease in unauthorized migration from Mexico.   Migrant apprehensions continue to be near an all-time low with only a  slight increase from 2017.   The combined 521,090 apprehensions for Border Patrol and Customs  agents in fiscal year 2018 were 32,288 apprehensions fewer than the  553,378 apprehensions in 2016.   To put this in perspective, on average, each of the 19,437 Border  Patrol agents nationwide apprehended a total of only 19 migrants in  2018, which amounts to fewer than 2 apprehensions per month.   In the last few years, an increased proportion of apprehensions are  parents seeking to protect their children from the violence and extreme  poverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.   But even with more Central Americans arriving to our southern border  seeking protection, total apprehension rates are still at their lowest  since the 1970s.   The absence of a massive wall on the southern border will not solve  the drug smuggling problem because, as all law enforcement experts  agree, the major source of drugs coming into the United States are  smuggled through legal ports of entry.   The southern border region is home to about 15 million people living  in border counties in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.   These communities, which include cities such as San Diego, Douglas,  Las Cruces, and El Paso, are among the safest in the country.   Congress has devoted more U.S. taxpayer dollars to immigration  enforcement agencies (more than $21 billion now) than all other  enforcement agencies combined, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, US  Marshals, and Secret Service.   The bulk of this money goes to U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP), with a budget of $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 and more than  59,000 personnel.   CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in the country, and more  than 85 percent of the agency's Border Patrol agents (i.e., 16,605 of  19,437) are concentrated on the southern border.   Expanded deployment of the military to the border to include active- duty troops could cost between $200 and $300 million in addition to the  estimated $182 million for the earlier deployment by the President of  National Guard to the border.   Mr. Speaker, having been soundly defeated legislatively by Congress,  a co-equal branch of government, the President wants to finance border  wall vanity project by diverting funds that the Congress has  appropriated for disaster recovery and military construction.   The funds the President wants to steal were appropriated by Congress  to help Americans devastated by natural disasters, like Hurricanes  Harvey, Irma and Maria, or for other purposes like military  construction.   Congress did not, has not, and will not, approve of any diversion of  these funds to construct a border wall that the President repeatedly  and derisively boasted that Mexico would pay for.   In fact, the President has admitted he ``didn't have to do this,''  but has opted to do so because ``I want to see it built faster.''   Mr. Speaker, just yesterday a bipartisan group of nearly 60 national  security officials including former secretaries of state, defense  secretaries, CIA directors, and ambassadors to the UN issued a  statement declaring that ``there is no factual basis'' justifying the  President's emergency declaration.   Instead of protecting our national security, the President's  declaration makes America less safe.   The President is stealing billions from high-priority military  construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential  training, readiness and quality of life necessary to keep the American  people safe, directly undermining America's national security.   The President's declaration clearly violates the Congress's exclusive  power of the purse, and, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the  balance of powers, violating our Founders' vision for America.   Opposing the President's reckless and anti-American decision  transcends partisan politics and partisanship; it is about patriotism,  constitutional fidelity, and putting country first.   That is why nearly two dozen distinguished former Republican Members  of Congress are urging Republicans in Congress to vote for H.J.R. 46  and uphold ``the authority of the first branch of government to resist  efforts to surrender'' our constitutional powers to an overreaching  president.   To quote Thomas Paine's Common Sense: ``In absolute governments, the  King is law; so in free countries, the law ought to be King.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to uphold the rule of law and the  Constitution, and reject the President's power grab; I urge a  resounding Yes vote on H.J. Res. 46.
