 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for yielding the  time.   Mr. Speaker, for the first time in debt limit negotiations, the U.S.  Government will spend less money next year than it did this year.   This rates as one of the largest deficit reduction bills in American  history, and it will fundamentally change the spending trajectory here  in Washington with more work to do and more work ahead.   The bill contains spending cuts that take a step in the right  direction toward restoring fiscal sanity in Washington. This agreement  will return discretionary spending to 2022 levels.   Additionally, we set top-line spending at 1 percent annual growth  over the next 6 years.   We also cut spending through the largest funding rescissions in  American history, clawing back billions of dollars in unspent COVID  money.   We institute the first-ever statutory paygo to hold President Biden  accountable for his administrative actions. If this rule had been in  place over the last 2 years, it would have checked regulatory overreach  that has cost the economy at least $1.5 trillion during Biden's  Presidency.   This agreement will also change the way Washington operates by  compelling a workable appropriations process.   Simply put, this legislation ends the Democrats' spending spree and  fights inflation.   This deal will also help grow our economy and lift Americans out of  poverty by instituting the strongest work requirements in a generation  in some of our social safety net programs. These reforms will combat  the labor shortages crippling small businesses by encouraging  individuals to contribute to our society and economy while preserving  these programs for those who need them most.   Another progrowth solution in this bill is the transformational  reforms to the permitting process and the environmental review process.  Cutting this red tape will boost domestic energy production, lower  costs for struggling American families, and set us on a path toward  energy independence. Furthermore, it will be faster, cheaper, and  easier to build things in America, large and small. Whether that is  infrastructure, roads, bridges, new homes, new factories, so be it.   This legislation, though, is a product of divided government.  Republicans only control the House of Representatives, not the Senate  and not the White House. Throughout this process--which was long,  laborious, and tough--it has been Speaker McCarthy's leadership and  House Republicans leading. We passed a plan, and it was that plan and  the Speaker's leadership that enabled these negotiations and this  agreement.   Mr. Speaker, this is the most conservative spending package during my  time in Congress. I am proud to support it, and I encourage my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''                                time  1930
