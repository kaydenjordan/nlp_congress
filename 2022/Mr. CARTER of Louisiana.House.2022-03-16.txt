 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate our  Nation's actions to make healthcare more affordable. Together, we  provided more resources for the CDC and State and local health  departments to ensure they are prepared and equipped, implementing  lessons learned from the pandemic.   We confronted our most urgent health crises while taking strides to  reduce unacceptable health disparities. We invested in our veterans,  focusing on the mental health needs of those who served our Nation.   We strengthened biomedical research, providing more funding for the  National Institutes of Health and establishing the Advanced Research  Projects Agency for Health to cure the previously uncurable. We  protected the safety of our food and medicine by funding the FDA.   The pandemic taught us that no one is safe unless everyone is safe.  That is why we increased funding for global health, to work to prevent  the next pandemic.  [[Page H3750]]    With this budget, Democrats are not only making healthcare more  affordable for all Americans; we are building a healthier and safer  Nation.               Helping Working Families with the Cost of Living     Madam Speaker, I rise to highlight the  significant investments we enacted to help working families with the  cost of living.   In a time of great uncertainty and change, people are living paycheck  to paycheck or on fixed incomes. Many are struggling just to pay basic  bills.   Our investments represent a lifeline for working families. By  increasing funding for childcare, public schools, and providing high- quality job training, this bill gives more tools to help Americans  succeed.   Government must serve the people, not the biggest corporations. We  provided resources to small businesses and entrepreneurs as they pursue  the American Dream. We invested to connect communities to the internet  and expand access to affordable housing and homeownership. We  strengthened our core services and tackled the root causes of rising  prices.   One example is by providing $158 million to support the production  and delivery of small- to medium-size manufacturers, helping detangle  the supply chain and lower costs to consumers. We paid for it by  cracking down on big corporations and the wealthiest who are not paying  their fair share. This government funding legislation truly delivers  for the people.                            ____________________
