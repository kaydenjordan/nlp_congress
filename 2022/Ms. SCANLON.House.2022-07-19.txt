Clause 7 of rule XIII shall not apply to any       resolution introduced prior to the date of adoption of this       resolution.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Monday the Committee on Rules met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1232, for three measures.   First, it provides for consideration of H.R. 8294 under a structured  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations, makes in order 190 amendments, provides en bloc  authority, allows the chair the ability to offer up to five pro  [[Page H6712]]  forma amendments, and provides one motion to recommit.   Second, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 8373 under a  closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce, self-executes a manager's amendment,  and provides one motion to recommit.   Third, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 8404 under a  closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on the Judiciary and provides for one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides the majority leader or his designee the  ability to en bloc requested votes on suspension bills this week and  deems passage of House Resolution 1230.   Madam Speaker, today's rule provides for consideration of three  important bills--one that is part of the regular process of funding the  government for the next year, and two that are emergency measures to  respond to the ongoing assault by an extremist rightwing minority  against Americans' individual rights and liberties.   The first bill is a package of bills called the minibus. This package  of six annual appropriations bills provides funding for the Federal  Government for the next fiscal year for a wide array of important  government programs: Food and farming, transportation, housing,  conservation and environmental protection, veterans programs, community  development, and general operations of the Federal Government.   Thanks to the strong leadership of House Democrats on the Committee  on Appropriations, today's bill makes major investments to meet the  needs of Americans at this difficult point in time. When we talk about  these huge budget bills each year, it can be overwhelming, so let's  look at some concrete examples of how these bills are going to benefit  our country.   This budget bill will increase funding for veterans' healthcare by  $20 billion, helping the VA to meet the health needs of our Nation's  veterans. In addition to funding traditional health services for  veterans, this bill will expand mental healthcare, including suicide  prevention, improve women's healthcare, homeless assistance programs,  substance use disorder programs, and invest in medical research to  address veterans' unique health needs.   With the lack of affordable housing being one of the major issues  impacting our communities across this country, this bill will increase  funding for housing by $9 billion and provide 140,000 more families and  seniors with stable, affordable housing. It will get lead and radon out  of public housing units and incentivize the construction of thousands  of new units of affordable housing.   This bill will provide a $7 billion boost for the Department of the  Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency, which is funding for  our national parks, our land and water conservation programs, and for  enhanced enforcement of our environmental protection laws so that  Americans of all ages and backgrounds--and our children--can have clean  air to breathe and water to drink, and enjoy the natural wonders that  our amazing country has to offer.   This bill provides a $2 billion increase for programs that support  public health, rural development, and fight hunger. Vital funding for  SNAP and WIC will increase access to healthy foods for the 40 million  Americans who rely upon our Nation's antihunger programs, improving  their health and lowering the cost of living for those in need.   Funding for the FDA under this title will improve the safety and  availability of baby formula. It will strengthen oversight of our food  and drug safety laws and support supply chains for critical drugs and  medical devices.   Funding for rural development will provide grants and low-cost  financing to expand broadband and fix water infrastructure in rural  communities, promoting community and economic development.   The bill also provides an additional $4 billion in funding for  government operations so that our Federal agencies can do the work that  we all rely upon. Among other things, this boost will help the IRS  improve its processing times and provide more taxpayers with help when  filing. A stronger IRS will also be able to better enforce our tax laws  to make sure that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair  share.   This funding will more than triple the Election Security Grants  program which provides funding to the States to secure our Federal  elections by purchasing new technology and keeping ahead of bad actors  who try to attack our elections. This funding has helped to make the  U.S. elections so secure that anyone who says the 2020 election was  stolen is either a liar or a fool.   This funding will encourage economic development by funding the Small  Business Administration's lending programs and the Treasury  Department's Community Development Financial Institutions. Combined,  these programs are often the main source of financing for minority and  women-owned small businesses, many of which are increasingly leading  the way in creating jobs and economic opportunities.   The minibus also makes major investments in our servicemembers by  increasing funding for housing and childcare on military installations.                                time  1030    This funding will provide more childcare services for the 1.2 million  children of Active-Duty servicemembers, as well as the ability to  construct and remediate thousands of substandard units of military  family housing.   Finally, this year's appropriations bills build on last year's  successes with community project funding, which allows Members of  Congress to better represent their districts and exercise Congress'  responsibility to direct Federal spending, rather than delegating it.   Community project funding allows Members to support smart, high- impact investments in their districts in a way that is transparent and  ethically sound. I thank the Appropriations Committee for their work to  responsibly reinstate this opportunity.   Because of these rule changes, I have been able to bring millions of  dollars back to my district for a variety of locally backed efforts  ranging from mental health programs to community centers to workforce  development. This year, I am proud to have secured funding for 15  projects totaling $20 million for Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional  District.   Madam Speaker, obviously, I could keep going on about the amazing  things that this bill will do, but all together the minibus is a strong  investment in our country that will help working families, small  businesses, and local communities, as well as helping to fight  inflation, create jobs, and support economic development.   Funding the government is Congress' primary responsibility. It is  right there in the beginning lines of Article I, Section 8 of the  Constitution, that Congress has the power to provide for the common  defense and general welfare of the United States.   With the consideration of these six appropriations bills this week,  and the other six later this month, House Democrats are meeting their  responsibility to the American people by passing a budget on time.   I say House Democrats because I am concerned that my Republican  colleagues may follow their recent practice of refusing to work in a  bipartisan manner to fund the government or to solve problems for the  American people, and then voting against this bill when it comes to the  floor.   Of course, over in the 50-50 Senate, where 10 Republican votes are  needed to pass a budget bill, the Senators have not even begun  consideration of any appropriations packages. Just like last year,  House Democrats are passing funding bills on time while Republicans in  the Senate are holding up the process for months by slow-walking  negotiations and refusing to compromise.   Last year, this obstructive behavior by Senate Republicans meant that  Congress didn't pass its 2022 budget until we were halfway through that  year. That meant by the time the Federal Government received its 2022  funding, it only had 6 months left to use it. That is irresponsible.  That is not good business, and it is not sound government.  [[Page H6713]]    At every turn, the filibuster and stonewalling by Republican Senators  squash every single legislative initiative that comes their way.   Madam Speaker, this rule also brings two other critically important  bills to the floor. Today's rule also provides for consideration of the  Right to Contraception Act, a bill that would codify fundamental  privacy rights relating to purchasing, using, and providing  contraception; and the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the  right to same-sex marriage in Federal law.   These are two basic freedoms that the overwhelming majority of  Americans support, and that most Americans are surprised to learn are  now under threat from an extremist rightwing minority in our Supreme  Court and many Republican State legislatures across the country.   In the wake of the Dobbs decision, we immediately saw a number of  States implement or try to pass abortion bans. The practical and tragic  consequences of those decisions are growing every day with women and  girls unable to get the healthcare they need, whether it is a 10-year- old rape victim in Ohio being denied medical care in her home State or  a women with an ectopic pregnancy in Missouri whose healthcare  providers are withholding what is standard medical care because they  fear prosecution under these laws.   These tragic stories will continue, and they will get worse. This is  the world we live in in the aftermath of the extremist Dobbs decision.  But the impact of the Dobbs decision does not end with abortion care.  The extremist rightwing majority on the Supreme Court has put our  country down a perilous path. They have shown us the harsh reality of  judicial review--no objectivity, no textualism or originalism, this is  just politics by other means.   The majority in Dobbs and others who hold this minority view are  pushing a rightwing agenda that can be summed up as this: for all their  talk about States' rights and individual freedoms, the rightwing  majority is going to uphold the rights they support and take away the  rights they oppose.   The two bills we consider today respond to the immediate threat  articulated by Justice Thomas in his concurrence in the Dobbs  decision--that he wants to overturn decisions that protect rights to  contraception, same-sex marriage, et cetera. It is not just Justice  Thomas, Justice Alito has joined him in similar concurrences; and, of  course, he wrote the majority decision in Dobbs.   Rightwing legislators and Members of Congress are saying exactly what  they want to do and introducing bills to do exactly this--to undermine  the right to contraception and to undermine the right to same-sex  marriage. These are not hypotheticals but very real threats.   In response to this insanity, the House must vote this week on the  Right to Contraception Act and the Respect for Marriage Act. The Right  to Contraception Act would prohibit States from banning or restricting  possession, sale, purchase, transportation, use, prescription of  contraception, including birth control, IUDs, condoms, and other  products that aid in family planning.    The Respect for Marriage Act will codify the current law of the land  and protect the thousands of same-sex marriages and families across  this country, who are now justifiably afraid that their families are  under attack. I can't tell you how many constituents, colleagues,  friends, and their children that I am hearing from in the wake of this  decision and in the wake of Justice Thomas' explicit threat.   Both of these bills will protect rights enjoyed by Americans that are  now being threatened by the Supreme Court minority view and their co- conspirators in the Republican Party. I am glad we are bringing these  bills up for a vote so we can see who is going to vote for them and who  is going to vote against them.   I am confident that House Democrats will provide the votes necessary  to pass the bills. It is time for our colleagues across the aisle to  stand up and be counted. Will they vote to protect these fundamental  freedoms, or will they vote to let States take those freedoms away?   Today we will find out. Then we will see what our colleagues in the  Senate will do. We are going to put these bills up for a vote, and the  public can see, on the record, how their Representatives and Senators  respond. At least everyone will know where their elected officials  stand.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, these appropriations bills are not going  to make inflation worse. It is a bad-faith argument. Inflation is bad.  It is  [[Page H6714]]  eating away at family paychecks not just here in America but all across  the globe.   My colleague cited the recent inflation figures here in the U.S.-- they are worse overseas. The economic shocks in supply chain  disruptions caused by the pandemic and then exacerbated by Russia's  invasion of Ukraine are hitting hard--yes, here at home and all across  the world. There are things that we are doing to bring those prices  down, and economic indicators show that prices are starting to come  down. It doesn't deny the real pain that we are all feeling right now.   Second, which spending would he have eliminated? Would it have been  the funding to develop vaccines and therapeutics? Maybe the funding to  keep people in their homes during the pandemic? Would it be the funding  that supported small businesses over the last several years, or maybe  it is just the paycheck protection funding?    I think it is a hollow argument, and I think it is also worth noting  that we are not seeing any alternative solutions.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Ross), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina.                                time  1045     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am so happy that my colleagues are rising to condemn  political violence, but I find it disingenuous and maybe even a little  one-sided when they only condemn political violence that they disagree  with.   This previous question condemns violence, as my colleague just said,  by the radical left but not the radical right. They are conveniently  ignoring decades of violence, harassment, and even murder of abortion  care providers and harassment of those seeking such care on a daily and  weekly basis.   Why are they surprised by this political violence on this topic when  this is a model that the anti-abortion forces have utilized for  decades?   Also, on a more practical note, I am stunned that my colleague is  seeking to reduce funding for the IRS. Any responsible Member of  Congress who prioritizes constituent services knows that we receive  hundreds and hundreds of calls every year, particularly in recent  years, from people who are struggling to get a response from the IRS,  who are struggling to get their much-needed tax refund, and who are  struggling to get payments or straighten out difficulties. Why is that?  It is because the IRS has been underfunded for decades.   The IRS is facing a crisis with retirements and with the inability to  attract talent given the tight labor market. We need to fund the IRS  again so that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair share.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I know we are running short on time, but  I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman.  [[Page H6717]]         Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Today's rule is a testament to the hard work and leadership of the  Appropriations Committee led by Chairwoman DeLauro. I applaud the  efforts of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and their  staff to prepare legislation that meets the needs of everyday  Americans; to grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out,  rather than relying, once again, on the failed trickle-down economics  of the last 50 years.   Given the draconian consequences of failing to pass a budget, I  encourage my colleagues in the House and Senate to move quickly in  negotiating a final budget bill so we can fund the government on time.  It is the responsible thing to do.   We cannot afford to govern from CR to CR, or to pass a budget bill  halfway through the fiscal year.   And I am also incredibly grateful to my colleagues on the Energy and  Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committee for stepping up to  present legislation to protect fundamental American freedoms that have  been placed at risk by the rightwing majority of the Supreme Court in  overturning Roe v. Wade.   I urge all of my colleagues to protect the right to contraception  with the act of that name, and to repeal the statutory ban on same-sex  marriage by approving the Respect for Marriage Act in its floor  consideration.   At a time when Americans' rights are under attack by a well-funded,  extremist minority which has seized control of the Supreme Court and  some State legislatures, it is more important than ever for elected  Members of Congress to use their legislative powers to protect and  expand Americans' personal and fundamental freedoms.   So, Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the rule  and the underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1232         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 12. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 1233) expressing the sense of the House       of Representatives condemning the recent attacks on prolife       facilities, groups, and churches. The resolution shall be       considered as read. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the resolution and preamble to adoption without       intervening motion or demand for division of the question       except one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of House Resolution 1233.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
