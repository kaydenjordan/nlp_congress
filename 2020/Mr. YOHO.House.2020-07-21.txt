 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the University of  Florida and its outstanding faculty and staff on their receipt of the  George W. Bush Institute of Innovation Award. A team of economists and  business development experts ranked the University of Florida number 1  nationally in innovation impact, compared to all other universities in  the Nation.   By itself, the University of Florida was ranked sixth in the Nation  when compared to the whole combined California or Texas education  systems. The University of Florida is the most productive large  university in the country at leveraging its research funding into new  companies, new jobs, and new ideas.   In the study conducted by the George W. Bush Institute and the Opus  Faveo Innovation Development Consulting firm, the University of Florida  proved it moves more technologies to the point of impact than anyone  else in the country. The University has an average of 123 patents and  generated 15 startups per year between 2013 and 2017. UF was an even  stronger performer and license outcome, earning an average of $36  million per year, equal to 6.4 percent of its research dollars.   Additionally, the University of Florida also ranked fourth overall in  teaching impact and it produced one-third as many STEM Ph.D. graduates  each year as the entire University of California system, despite having  a research budget of only one-tenth as large.   The University of Florida has created an entire innovation ecosystem,  including tech transfer, business incubators, a venture fund, corporate  engagement, and more to support the transitional research generated by  the University of Florida faculty.   The George W. Bush Institute and Opus Faveo Innovation Development's  report highlights UF's operation as one of the most respected  technology transfer offices in the country with the best tech transfer  team in the world.   The University has spun off more than 60 companies in biotech alone.  Major pharmaceuticals, food, agriculture, biotech, and the energy  sectors have acquired more than 20 percent of these companies.   The faculty, staff, and students at the University of Florida are as  intelligent as they are ambitious, and demonstrate the breadth of  diversity, thought, and creativity in the State of Florida. It is  because of accomplishments such as this that Florida is counted among  the most successful and influential States in the Nation.    I am proud, as I see the positive impacts of the University of  Florida's continual research for knowledge, innovation, and discovery.  The students and faculty at the University of Florida are determined,  hardworking, and I am glad to see that the University is getting the  recognition that it deserves.   Congratulations again to my alma mater, the University, its faculty,  and staff on this exceptional award and for your continued dedication  to knowledge and education. The University of Florida's leadership is  invaluable as it leads the way IN innovation for generations to come.   As a double Gator, I am honored to be able to represent the  University of Florida and the Gator Nation in Florida's Third  Congressional District, and I look forward to witnessing your continued  success.   Go Gators.                            ____________________
