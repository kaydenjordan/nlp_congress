 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable woman  and public servant who works in this Chamber every single day: Ms.  Joyce Hamlett.   (Applause, the Members rising.)    Joyce, with that support, I should have had you run my  Speaker's race.   This is Joyce's last week on the House floor. After 35 years of  working in Congress, she is about to begin a well-earned retirement  where she will spend time with her loved ones.  [[Page H3935]]    This is truly the end of an era. Joyce is the first African-American  woman to be appointed as the Keeper of the Mace.   Now, we all know Joyce, and she knows each and every one of us. She  has gotten to know some of you even better than others.   For those at home, Joyce is the keeper of the rules. Just so you know  that she is fair to all, it was just last month that I thought, being  Speaker, I could have my own rules, and I brought somebody onto the  floor. I asked the people outside, ``Hey, can I bring somebody onto the  floor?'' I thought we were out of session. They said: ``You are the  Speaker. Go ahead.''   I walked in those doors, but somebody stopped me. It was Joyce.   If it was not just me sneaking someone onto the floor but you without  a tie or proper attire, you would have received a polite reminder from  Joyce about the rules of decorum.   I would watch at times at the greatest height where we were not  getting along with one another, when the tensions were high and I was  afraid to talk to some of my own Members, but when Joyce walked up with  that unbelievable smile and she would tell them they were doing  something wrong, it was just like she was the teacher and they were in  the first grade. ``Yes, Ms. Joyce,'' and they sat right back down.   Joyce has devoted her entire career to this institution, the people's  House. In the early 1980s, she started working as a cook in the Capitol  cafeteria alongside her mother, Betty. Then she served as an elevator  operator in the Capitol before taking a position with Chamber security.   In total, as I said earlier, Joyce has given more than 35 years of  her life to the House of Representatives.   That is why she cares so deeply about this Chamber and works to  ensure that everyone who walks through these doors treats this  institution with the respect it deserves.   In fact, Joyce has had one of the most important responsibilities in  the House. When the people think of Congress, they think of the Capitol  Building, of the dome, the symbol of American democracy. When people  think of the House, we have our own symbol: the mace of the House of  Representatives.   The day begins when the mace is raised, and the day ends when the  mace is lifted. It has become the symbol of responsibility and duty for  this institution in which we are honored to serve. Since 2007, Joyce  has been charged with protecting and keeping the mace.   I don't know if you have looked at her brooch. When I became Speaker,  Ann Hand came to see me. She makes a lot of different jewelry. She  sells it, and I look to buy. She brought me this one piece of jewelry.  She said the only person that has it is the Speaker before, Speaker  Pelosi. I had watched Speaker Pelosi wear that brooch of that mace. She  provided it to me for a family member.   The thing I enjoy the most about this job is when I get to put the  floor into session. I got to know Joyce. We spend time behind there.  She is holding the mace. I thought, wouldn't that be a great gift for  retirement? In the back of my mind, she had told me that she was  leaving, so I said: We are going to have a party for you.   I thought we could present this to her then, but then I thought, no,  I need to present it to her now--the look on her face. The brooch on  her lapel, she wears that every day, proudly. She wears it because she  has earned it as the Keeper of the Mace.   I have told her time and again it is going to be sad to see her go,  and I know Joyce is looking very much forward to spending more time  with her family in North Carolina, with her two sons, David, Jr., and  Donald, and all of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   Joyce, on behalf of the House, a really grateful thank-you. Thank you  for your service. Thank you for your friendship. Personally, thank you  for your commitment to the people's House.   We are a better institution because of Joyce. We are better Members  in some of our darkest times because of a warning from Joyce.   You will always be welcome back into this House.   May you enjoy all the happiness in this world that this well-earned  retirement brings. I thank you for the work, the commitment, and the  friendship.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Madam Speaker, Joyce is still going to be here with us  for the rest of the week.   Tomorrow, at 11 o'clock, in the Rayburn Room, Leader Jeffries and I  are going to host a reception for her retirement, and you can all come  by.   Let's not make the week go longer just for Joyce. Let's end on a  positive note for Joyce.   (Applause, the Members rising.)  [[Page H3936]]                                ____________________
