 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for not only  managing the time, but her leadership and great work in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the millions of Americans who will  suffer under this oxymoron called TrumpCare. This bill will result in  higher costs and less coverage for hardworking Americans, especially  the poor and the elderly. The only winners in this bill are the wealthy  who are getting their $600 billion tax cut.   Earlier this week, an official with the American College of  Physicians put it best when he said:         In 38 years of advocating for doctors and patients, I have       never seen a bill that will do more harm than the AHCA.    This is a powerful statement.   You know, Mr. Speaker, what I can't figure out is what problem this  bill is trying to solve. If the Republicans were looking to cover fewer  people, make insurance more expensive, and give tax cuts to the rich,  then I guess this Republican bill is the answer.    Let's take a quick look at what this bill does or, as my Republican  colleagues refer to it, promises kept.   First and foremost, 24 million Americans are going to lose coverage.  Let me repeat that, 24 million. That is not only unacceptable, it is  cruel.   And even for those lucky enough not to lose coverage, things are not  going to be very good.   Under the Republican healthcare scheme, older Americans will be  paying five times more. In what world does anyone think that it is a  good idea to make health care even more expensive for the elderly? This  is one of those crazy but true things about this bill. So this is what  the GOP calls promises kept.   Well, let's take a moment to remember what promises were actually  made. In an interview with ``60 Minutes'' in 2015, President Trump  promised:         Everybody is going to be covered. I am going to take care       of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not,       everybody is going to be taken care of much better than they       are being taken care of now.    Then just 2 days before the election, Trump went to Sioux City, Iowa,  and said:         I am going to protect and save your Social Security and       your Medicare. You made a deal a long, long time ago.  [[Page H2336]]                                     time  1630    So how does this repeal bill stack up with those promises? Premiums  will spike 750 percent with far fewer tax credits to help shoulder that  burden; 30 million Americans with preexisting conditions would lose the  certainty of coverage they have enjoyed under ObamaCare; Medicare will  be slashed by $170 billion; Medicaid will be cut 25 percent. That is  $880 billion being ripped away from the most vulnerable Americans,  resulting in 14 million people losing coverage immediately.   So who wins here with TrumpCare? The rich, who will reap $600 billion  in tax cuts at the expense of medical treatment for the most vulnerable  and working folks in this country; Big Pharma is a winner who can now  look forward to more obscene profits and less oversight; and, of  course, the private health insurance companies, who, once again, will  be in total charge of America's health care.   Who loses? Hardworking, regular folks who simply can't afford to  underwrite a tax cut for the rich at the expense of their health.   Take my constituent, Shawn, for example. He wrote me to share his ACA  story. In 2006, Shawn was diagnosed with HIV and a rare heart  condition, and his premiums skyrocketed from $123 a month in 2005, all  the way up to $1,473 a month in 2012. That is an average increase of  between 35 and 40 percent per year. At the same time, his deductible  climbed to $2,900, meaning his insurance wouldn't offer him a dime  until he coughed up nearly $3,000 first.   When ObamaCare kicked in in 2014, Shawn had at least a dozen plans to  choose from. He selected a platinum plan which delivered better  coverage than he previously had for only half the price that he had  previously been paying. Let me repeat: because of ObamaCare, Shawn  started paying half the price for a better plan. How was it better? As  Shawn put it, he no longer faced lifetime caps; he had free wellness  visits included in his coverage; instead of a nearly $3,000 deductible,  he now had just a small copay.   If the ACA is repealed, Shawn will be uninsured for the first time in  his life. For the first time in 54 years, Shawn will be forced to pay  out of his own pocket for lifesaving medications. His HIV medications  alone cost nearly $30,000 per year--that is three times as much as he  pays right now for all of his medical expenses. If he is hospitalized  for his heart condition--which has occurred already twice--he will  incur tens of thousands of dollars in additional charges. In short,  under the Republican's healthcare scheme, Shawn will be financially  ruined.   Mr. Speaker, this is utterly unacceptable. The American people  deserve access to affordable, accessible, and high quality health care.  TrumpCare achieves the opposite. It is a bad deal and a threat to the  well-being of our Nation and our people. Beyond that, it is shameful  and inhumane.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose TrumpCare in its entirety  and vote it down tomorrow.
