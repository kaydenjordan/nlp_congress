 Mr. President, I rise in favor of Flake amendment No. 176.   We have had problems, obviously, with the VA. Phoenix, AZ, has been  kind of ground zero for that. Part of the problem is that the VA has no  strong prohibition against hiring felons, and we have had example after  example around the country of their continuing to hire felons or those  who have been disciplined by the profession. So this would simply  require that they fire felons who are on their rolls.   I urge support and yield the floor.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of the act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of amendment  No. 176, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
