 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill reauthorizes the Hydrographic Services  Improvement Act, which funds vital navigation and safety services of  NOAA's Office of Coast Survey, which maintains more than 1,000 charts  and publications used by Federal and State agencies, private  organizations, and the public.   It is no small feat to do this for our Nation's 95,000 miles of  shoreline and 3.4 million square nautical miles of water.   It is critical that we ensure Federal capacity for hydrographic  surveys, mapping, and charting. NOAA vessels and data support a wide  range of activities and inform decisions with significant economic,  environmental, and safety impacts.   As we face rapidly changing ocean conditions, hydrographic services  will only become more important. This is particularly true in the  Arctic, where we will eventually see almost entirely ice-free summers.  It is not a matter of if, but when and how soon. With that comes an  entirely new seascape for maritime commerce and transport, defense, and  natural resources.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleague Mr. Young for his hard  work. I encourage adoption of this bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5751 redesignates the Golden Spike National  Historic Site as the Golden Spike National Historical Park and directs  the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program known as the  Transcontinental Railroad Network within the National Park Service.   On May 10, 1869, a historically very significant day in the history  of our country, the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts were linked for the  first time in our Nation's history when the 1,912-mile system of hand- built tracks was completed in Promontory, Utah.   This national historical park designation is a fitting tribute that  acknowledges the significance of this event. The bill will also help  the National Park Service educate the public about the history,  construction, and legacy of the transcontinental railroad without  additional funds.   I would like to thank the chairman for his efforts to preserve an  important part of our history. This is a good bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support its passage.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 805, releases the reversionary interests on two  parcels of land in Tulare County in California. These parcels are  currently leased from the Union Pacific Railroad and contain a skate  park and historic women's club, owned and operated by the city.   City officials want to make improvements to both facilities, but are  unable to secure financing without clean and free titles to the  property.   In the 19th century, Congress granted the land to Southern Pacific  Railroad, the predecessor of Union Pacific, for use as a railroad  right-of-way. Congress subsequently authorized the railroad to lease  the land to Tulare for other public purposes. However, the land remains  encumbered with a reversionary interest.   Congress passed a law in 1998 that released the reversionary interest  on 12 parcels in Tulare. H.R. 805 deals with two additional parcels,  allowing Union Pacific to sell the land to Tulare and clear the way for  planned improvements.   The 1998 law was the first time Congress authorized the release of a  reversionary interest for redevelopment purposes. At the time, the  railroad had already sold the land at Tulare, even though it belonged  to taxpayers, and Congress had to intervene to remedy the situation.  Unlike the situation in 1998, the two parcels affected by this bill  have not been sold and under normal circumstances, the Federal  Government--not Union Pacific--should receive payment for the parcels  if they are no longer used as originally intended by Congress.   However, the history of congressional involvement in Tulare justifies  an exception to this standard. Due to the circumstances, I am happy to  support this bill and I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I agree. I think no Member of  Congress enjoys an unnecessary crawl back, but I think the majority of  the Members of Congress recognize our duty to protect the public  interest.   We resoundingly support what is a very, very good bill. Mr. Speaker,  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 857, introduced by Representative Cook from  California, is a comprehensive package of land designations designed to  increase conservation efforts and recreation access throughout the  California desert.   The bill adds approximately 329,370 acres to the National Wilderness  Preservation System, expands three units of the National Park System,  creates new areas set aside for off-highway recreation, and establishes  the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area.   Representative Cook's bill builds upon the success of the California  Desert Protection Act and the recent monument designations by President  Obama to provide lasting protections and ensure ongoing recreational  access throughout the region.                                time  1615    This bill closely mirrors its Senate companion introduced by Senator  Feinstein that is moving its way through the legislative process in the  Senate. Hopefully, that means we can deliver a version of this bill to  the President's desk to provide a lasting conservation solution for a  substantial portion of the California desert.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3392 requires the Bureau of Land Management to  disclaim interest in 230 acres of land in northern Louisiana. The land  at issue was originally surveyed in 1842, transferred to the Bossier  Levee District in 1892, and conveyed to private owners in 1904.   However, BLM conducted a resurvey in 1967 after realizing that  certain lands were omitted from previous Federal surveys. The resurvey  puts more than 200 acres of land previously thought to belong to  Louisiana and private interests back into Federal ownership.   Until recently, the results of this resurvey were largely ignored or  forgotten, and now there are several homeowners with clouded titles and  some confusion regarding the ownership of mineral rights in the area.   BLM is currently working to evaluate ownership and authorized  conveyance where appropriate under the Color-of-Title Act. The Color- of-Title Act authorizes the BLM to convey public lands that have been  acquired by peaceful adverse possession often caused by historical  surveying anomalies, such as in this case. However, the Color-of-Title  Act does not authorize the transfer of mineral rights owned by the  United States, which is why this bill is necessary.   To be clear, under most circumstances, we would not support  legislation to transfer Federal mineral rights without fair  compensation to the American taxpayer, but this is a very unusual and  special case. Over 40 years have passed since the BLM attempted to  enforce Federal ownership of this land. This lack of clarity and  communication is unacceptable. For that reason, I support this bill and  I urge its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to support this bill.  I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Smith).                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4257 creates a process to expedite land exchanges  between the Federal Government and State land grant agencies.   Currently, the primary method of eliminating State trust lands from  conservation areas has been through legislative land exchanges, which  can be time-consuming and complicated. This bipartisan bill, introduced  by Representatives Stewart and Polis, offers a new way to speed up the  process of removing State lands from Federal conservation areas.   H.R. 4257 could incentivize State land agencies to be good partners  and supporters of additional conservation legislation by removing an  important barrier to new conservation designations and improving the  management of existing conservation areas.   Mr. Speaker, I support passage of this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
