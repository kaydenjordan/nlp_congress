 Mr. Speaker, with this body back to work this week, I  was hoping we would be here to work and to address the ongoing health  and economic crisis. Unfortunately, that is not  [[Page H6138]]  the case. While small businesses and hardworking Americans struggle to  get by, we are spending what little time we have left during this  Congress voting on marijuana legislation.   Mr. Speaker, we need to get our priorities straight and start  governing responsibly. And we can do that right now by reopening the  applications for the Paycheck Protection Program, which still has $133  billion available to small businesses and workers trying to get through  this crisis.   Luckily, there is a way around the obstruction that currently exists  in this body. I am one of the 186 members on the discharge petition  that would bring H.R. 8265 to the floor for a vote. This commonsense  legislation would reopen the applications for the Paycheck Protection  Program and give small businesses access to unspent money. Members of  this body know how important this bill is in this current situation. It  is a shame that those who set the floor schedule are focused on  advancing partisan priorities rather than rising to meet the challenges  facing our workers and small businesses.                            ____________________
