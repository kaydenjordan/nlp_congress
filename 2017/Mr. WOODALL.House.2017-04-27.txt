 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 280 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 280         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1694) to require additional entities to be       subject to the requirements of section 552 of title 5, United       States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of       Information Act), and for other purposes. The first reading       of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and amendments specified in       this section and shall not exceed one hour equally divided       and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of       the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the       nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform now printed in the bill, it       shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the       purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule an amendment       in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 115-14 modified by the amendment printed in       part A of the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution. That amendment in the nature of a substitute       shall be considered as read. All points of order against that       amendment in the nature of a substitute are waived. No       amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute       shall be in order except those printed in part B of the       report of the Committee on Rules. Each such amendment may be       offered only in the order printed in the report, may be       offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified       in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall       not be subject to a demand for division of the question in       the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of       order against such amendments are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a       separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the       Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the amendment in the       nature of a substitute made in order as original text. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.        Sec. 2.  It shall be in order at any time through the       legislative day of April 29, 2017, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.        Sec. 3.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of April 29, 2017.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for  1 hour.  [[Page H2911]]         Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I have a confession to make to you. In  fact, I have two confessions to make.   The first is I have got a big group up in the Rules Committee right  now. It is my Gwinnett County Chamber of Commerce. It is an amazing  county, tremendous diversity, tremendous record of success in solving  problems. They have been up there visiting with leaders all day long.   I first met with them this morning while Mr. McGovern was down here  on the floor during 5 minutes. I said: Well, this is a 5-minute time.  You can step right through the doors there, if you would like to see  it.   They said: Who is on the floor?   I said: Well, it is this fellow right here. His name tag is there in  the Rules Committee. He is down there, #endhunger.   I said: The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) and I can  disagree on all sorts of issues, all sorts of public policy, but there  is nobody in this institution who has a heart for service on the issue  of hunger more than Jim McGovern does.   I said: Here he is. He is representing Massachusetts, of all places,  and he has chosen to serve on the Agriculture Committee. If you are a  Georgian, you serve on the Agriculture Committee because you grow  cotton and peanuts and row crop after row crop after row crop. When you  are from Massachusetts and you sit on the Agriculture Committee, you  want to end childhood hunger, you want to feed people.   I tell you that as a confession, Mr. Speaker, because I am not going  to confess to sharing my admiration for Jim McGovern all that often on  the House floor, but I was with folks up there today who really do  commit themselves to making a difference in our county. It was nice to  have a colleague on the floor--again, with whom I disagree about much-- who was putting everything he had, as he does every day, into an issue  that he cares a lot about.   That is all my constituents back home want, Mr. Speaker, is to  believe that we have sincere, earnest folks working on sincere and  difficult issues. So I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern) for that.   My second confession, Mr. Speaker, is that ordinarily I really enjoy  listening to the Reading Clerk read the rule. It gets me all wound up  about how the process is. Of course, today she was talking about all  the amendments we are going to make in order. We are making every  single amendment offered by both sides of the aisle in order on this  underlying bill.   I found myself thinking back to the days when I was a young man and I  came up here with my class. I was sitting up here in the gallery, and I  walked into the floor at a time when the Reading Clerk was just  standing up there reading. There was no cheat sheet that they give you  in the gallery, Mr. Speaker. You don't have any idea whether they are  going to read for 20 seconds or 20 minutes. For all you know, they are  going to read for the rest of the afternoon, and it was hard to follow.   I get a cheat sheet here that my staff gives me before each rule. I  didn't enjoy it as much today as I ordinarily do, Mr. Speaker, because  there is a lot of procedural work in this rule.   We are coming up on a bunch of big deadlines. So there is the ability  to bring up suspensions. These are commonsense bills that two-thirds of  the House agree on. You can bring those up at any time. That provision  is made in this rule.   There is the ability to bring things up the same day. If the Rules  Committee goes up and passes a new rule, we can bring that bill to the  floor immediately. Ordinarily that would lay over for 24 hours. But  because there are so many things we are trying to get done, we waived  that.   All of those procedural issues, Mr. Speaker, get in the way of my  favorite part of the rule, which is that every single Member of this  body had a chance to come up to the Rules Committee, offer their ideas  for how we can make this bill better, and the Rules Committee made  every single one of them in order. Let me tell you more about that.   This House Resolution 280, Mr. Speaker, is the structured rule for  the consideration of H.R. 1694. If you happen to tune into our Rules  Committee web feed, Mr. Speaker, you can see it at rules.house.gov if  you are not able to get up there with us as we meet sometimes late at  night.   This House Resolution 280 is for the consideration of H.R. 1694, the  Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017. Now, folks know a lot  about open records, Mr. Speaker. It is that procedure--it is called  FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act--where any member of the United  States community board of directors--that would be any United States  citizen--can write and say: this is my government, and I want some  information about what is going on. That has been a very fundamental  part of who we are as a people for as long as you and I have been  alive.   What is unusual, though, is the way the Federal Government has gotten  involved in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the tune of about $187  billion--billion with a B, Mr. Speaker. The American taxpayer bailed  out these two private institutions making the American taxpayer, making  the U.S. Government the largest shareholder in both of these  institutions.   So we found ourselves in a unique situation of having the American  taxpayers in charge of an institution with no ability, through the  Freedom of Information Act, to request information from that entity. It  just hadn't come up that often. Thank goodness we haven't had to bail  out folks that way in the past.   Mr. Speaker, these entities that Fannie and Freddie are a part--we  called them government-sponsored enterprises--they just haven't  historically been the subject of that kind of taxpayer scrutiny, but  times are changing.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, went through the regular order process.  Hearings were held. Markups were held. It came out of the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform. If you have not looked into government  reform, Mr. Speaker, it is not often that the Committee on Oversight  and Government Reform is moving unanimous legislation.   The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is a tough committee  to serve on. I served there in my first term here, Mr. Speaker. It is  the hardest things about our government, how we hold each other  accountable. Of course, where you stand sometimes depends on where you  sit here. If you sit on the left or you sit on the right, you might  feel differently about government reform and accountability.   This bill passed out of this committee on a voice vote, Mr. Speaker.  The most collaborative of efforts moved this bill to the floor.   Then when we got it in the Rules Committee, we had several Members  say: I think we can make this bill better. I think we can make this  bill even better.   These were Members who may not have had a chance to fix those issues  on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.   Again, as I said, we made all amendments in order from both sides of  the aisle. I believe that totals three today, Mr. Speaker. But the  take-home message for me is, if you had an idea about how to fix this  bill, the folks in the Rules Committee made that opportunity available  to you.   Mr. Speaker, we can't do the big things every single day of the week.  Every piece of legislation we pass, unless we stuff everything into it,  can't do everything for everyone. Candidly, I am opposed to stuffing  everything into a piece of legislation. I am glad when we have an  opportunity to move one issue, one subject, one topic at a time and  deliver on behalf of the American people.                                time  1245    Mr. Speaker, this structured rule, House Resolution 280, is a good  bill. It  [[Page H2912]]  is a good resolution that, if passed, will provide for the  consideration of the underlying legislation, H.R. 1694, which, if  passed, will provide the American taxpayer, for the first time, the  accountability that they deserve for the $187 billion in taxpayer  support that Fannie and Freddie have received. I am proud to be  associated with that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall), my friend, for  the customary 30 minutes.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I first want to begin by thanking the  gentleman for his kind words to his constituents about me on the floor.  It means a lot to me, and I appreciate it.   I should tell him, however, that, even though sometimes people don't  realize this, Massachusetts has a robust agricultural base, and, in  fact, in my district, I have 1,832 farms on over 142,899 acres,  compared to the gentleman who has 209 farms on 13,328 acres. So, in  addition to fighting hunger, I am on the Agriculture Committee to  represent my farms.   I do genuinely appreciate the gentleman's kind words, but then I look  at the rule that we are debating today and it kind of spoils the mood.   Having said that, I just want to say to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker,  that here we are again, just 1 day from our government running out of  funding and confronting yet another manufactured, totally avoidable  crisis, and instead of working on a bill to fully fund America's  biggest priorities, we are back on the floor with--the only way I can  characterize this--more filler legislation. It seems my Republican  friends care more about looking busy than actually doing their jobs.   This rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 1694, as my  colleague mentioned, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017.  It is a fine bill designed to strengthen transparency at Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac. I support the legislation. My Democratic colleagues  support the legislation. The Republican majority supports the  legislation. In fact, I haven't found one person yet who doesn't  support the bill.   Freedom of information is a good thing, Mr. Speaker, and I support  FOIA, but what about the freedom from the threat of a government  shutdown?   What about freedom from the threat of a default on our national debt?   What about freedom to know what our President's conflicts of interest  are and to see his tax returns?   What about the freedom from having our healthcare protections ripped  away, protections like essential health benefits and protections for  people with preexisting conditions?   And what about the freedom to know what Congressional Republicans and  the White House are doing to our healthcare system behind closed doors?   None of this seems to matter.   But the most troubling part of this rule is that it declares blanket  martial law, through Saturday, that allows Republicans to bring  anything--and I mean anything--to the floor between now and then.   Now, I understand the importance of rushing something to the floor  when the government is about to run out of money; although, I would  point out that we are 7 months into the fiscal year and my Republican  friends set this deadline themselves back in December, so there is  absolutely no excuse for Congress to come within hours of yet another  shutdown. But this is just the latest example of Republican  obstruction, obfuscation, and incompetence that has, once again,  brought us to the edge of the cliff. And, Mr. Speaker, this is no way  to govern.   This rule would allow Republican leadership to rush anything to the  floor within hours of it being released. Not just appropriations, it  gives them blanket authority to jam us with whatever new disaster they  cook up with the White House in the backroom of Capitol Hill, and that  includes this latest healthcare deal that I have heard so much about  this week.   Of course, with it being a backroom deal, we were relying on news  reports all week to clue us in to these terrible new provisions; and it  was only last night, around midnight, when the Republicans finally  posted their newest healthcare proposal that we were able to confirm  just how bad it really is.   Incredibly, this new amendment will make the bill even worse than  before. Honest to God, Mr. Speaker, I didn't know that was possible.   In addition to killing the requirement to provide basic, crucial,  essential benefits like maternity care and prescription drugs and  emergency services, this new amendment will also completely gut  protections for people with preexisting conditions. In fact, this  amendment directly violates the commitment made by President Trump and  House Republicans to protect those with preexisting conditions.   This newest proposal will allow insurers to charge an unlimited ``age  tax'' to older Americans, and, to make matters even worse, Republicans  have set up a system that would allow women to once again be charged  more than men for health coverage. It will bring us back to those bad  old days when insurance companies could charge women more because they  said being a woman was a preexisting condition.   Give me a break.   All of this, on top of a disaster of a healthcare bill that will  cause 24 million Americans to lose their healthcare coverage. And in  addition, their bill would cut Medicaid by close to $1 trillion, and  take that $1 trillion and give it, in the form of tax breaks, to the  wealthiest individuals in the country.   Mr. Speaker, this is not the way we should be running this House. All  of this is being done to appease the most conservative fringes within  the Republican Conference in an attempt to deliver, I guess, a  political ``win'' to Donald Trump so he can celebrate 100 days  in office. It doesn't matter what the details are, he just wants to be  able to tout a victory of some sort.    Well, this is not a victory for the American people. This would be a  disaster for the American people.   It is no wonder that my Republican colleagues have been overwhelmed  by angry calls from their constituents at home demanding that they  oppose this reckless and heartless bill. As one Republican remarked:  ``I spent the whole work period hearing from people pissed about  preexisting conditions. This isn't helpful.'' That is one of my  Republican colleagues.   Now, under this rule, these dangerous backroom deals could be rushed  to the floor without any proper deliberations, but they will have a  very real, very serious, and very dangerous consequence for millions of  Americans. Real lives are at stake here.   Now, I can't help but also note that this newest amendment exempts  Congress from the terrible impacts of this proposal. Can you believe  that? Knowing just how damaging these new provisions are, Republicans  wanted to keep healthcare protections for themselves but set up another  system for their constituents.   Now, it was only after the press caught Republicans with their hands  in the cookie jar that they introduced yet another bill to unexempt  themselves. But the new bill to unexempt Congress would require a 60- vote supermajority in the Senate. What are the odds that is going to  happen, Mr. Speaker?   Are we seriously supposed to trust that they won't exempt themselves  from this terrible plan, to trust that the Senate can muster 60 votes  to pass this provision or anything else?   Let me be clear: this maneuver is a procedural sleight of hand. This  is legislative smoke and mirrors designed to give Republicans, who  tried to pull a fast one and got caught, a talking point.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans wrote this bill, so change the damn bill.  Don't just say: ``Trust us. We will pass another bill to fix the fix,  and we will get the Senate not to make any changes. Oh, while we are at  it, we will get a supermajority in the Senate to support it.'' Who do  you think you are fooling, Mr. Speaker?   I urge all my colleagues to defeat this martial law rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would tell my friend that I think this is exactly the right way to  be moving legislation, and I am proud that we are doing it. Big bills  are hard and big  [[Page H2913]]  bills are sloppy. Can we do better on big bills? Of course we can. Of  course we can.   But you and I have been on the Rules Committee together, Mr. Speaker.  The Rules Committee process, you have seen it happen. If I am down here  talking about a small bill that everybody agrees on, folks want to know  why it is we are not doing something bigger. And when I bring a big  bill down here tomorrow, folks are going to want to know why I have  rushed it to the floor and we are not doing something that has more  bipartisan agreement on it instead.   These issues are hard, and that is why they have sent serious men and  women here to try to solve them. I want to do everything that my friend  from Massachusetts has talked about, Mr. Speaker. I want to see a  healthcare bill go across the floor. I want to see a full-year funding  bill go across the floor. Shoot, I don't stop there. I want to see the  budget go across the floor. I want to see a transportation and  infrastructure bill go across the floor. I have got a tax bill I want  to see go across the floor. The list is long.   And while my friend from Massachusetts and I are down here working on  this, I have got 433 other colleagues out there working on that, and my  great hope is that we are going to deliver on those things in the very  near future, too.   But today, Mr. Speaker, today isn't a day for recriminations. Today  is a day for celebrations, in that what we have here is a bill that we  have worked through the regular order process.   You are not going to hear one person, Mr. Speaker, not one, come down  to the floor and say this bill wasn't moved through the process in the  right way. You are not going to hear one person come down to the floor  and say their voice was silenced on this bill. You are not going to  hear one person come down to the floor and say their input was turned  away on this bill.   We do so much that we wish we could do better, Mr. Speaker. When we  have these opportunities to celebrate those things we are doing right,  I sometimes wish we would take a little more time to focus on our  successes. There will always be time to turn our attention back to our  failures.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just say to my colleague, I don't have any  problem with the underlying bill, but I would argue with him that I  think most of our colleagues probably don't know what the hell we are  doing here because, in the scheme of things, this is not terribly  consequential. I think our problem is the fact that we are at the edge  of another crisis where, if we don't fund the government by tomorrow,  we shut this place down, we shut the government down, and that has an  impact on the American people.   I think what our objection is is that the rule that you bring to us  here today to consider the underlying bill also allows my Republican  friends to bring up anything they want between now and Saturday,  including, you know, an awful healthcare repeal bill.   And by the way, when we talk about regular order, it would be nice,  especially when it comes to the big things like health care, that we  actually do things like hearings and listen to what experts have to say  and our constituents and patients and doctors, I mean, a whole bunch of  people who have a stake in our healthcare system.   The bill that my friends brought to the floor, that they had to pull,  never had a single hearing and, in all likelihood, whatever monstrosity  they bring to the floor in the future will probably not be the result  of regular order. It will be the result of a backroom deal where very  few people have any input.    So I can't celebrate today. I am very concerned for my constituents.  I am very concerned for the millions of people who might lose their  health care. I am concerned for this country.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  previous question.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump's first 100 days have been embroiled in  controversy and shrouded in secrecy. The American people deserve a heck  of a lot better. They deserve transparency from their government. They  deserve to know which special interests are getting face time with the  President and his top aides and whether the White House is being used  to personally enrich President Trump and his family.   It is our duty, as the people's Representatives, to hold this  administration accountable, an administration that has so many  conflicts of interest, financial conflicts of interest, that it is on a  collision course with corruption. So, if we defeat the previous  question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up  Representative Katherine Clark's resolution, H. Res. 286, which would  force the White House to release information to us regarding the  President's many potential conflicts of interest, including his tax  returns, involvement in his business empire, and White House and Mar-a- Lago visitor logs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 12 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Katherine Clark) to discuss our  proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle  that they had me at hello. When they said this was a great bill  underlying this resolution and they didn't see any controversy, they  thought we ought to pass this and they thought this was a good step  forward for the American people, yet you had me. I would like to do  that.   I remember, Mr. Speaker, a friend of mine, his name was Jay Pierson.  He served in this institution for over four decades. His job was not to  be particularly partisan one way or the other. His job was to make sure  this place functioned. I wonder what goes on over the 40 years of  changes in the way that we treat each other on the House floor and the  way that we work with each other on the House floor.   My friends have a perfectly legitimate concern. In fact, they brought  it up as a privileged resolution already this year. It has been tabled.  I recognize that my friends and I have disagreements--vast  disagreements--in numerous areas of public policy, but today we have a  chance to talk about one of the agreements that we have. I wonder, Mr.  Speaker, what folks back home watching think. Do they think, just like  the media loves to report, that, golly, those guys can't even agree on  what time to start in the morning?   For Pete's sake, we have worked a bill through the process, just like  we learned about in civics class. Don't make me sing ``I'm just a bill,  and I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill,'' Mr. Speaker, because that is  exactly the process that we all want bills to go through, and we have  done that here today.   We can't even take a moment to talk about how successfully we have  worked together, not even a moment to talk about how the process  worked, not even a moment to talk about how we delivered for folks. We  have to shift gears to something that is not even the topic of the bill  today. We will have time to talk about every controversy we want. If  folks want to go fisticuffs with one another, I am certain we will make  time for that, but right now we have a chance to talk about those  things that unite us.   In the spirit of dispelling those myths, Mr. Speaker, dispelling  those  [[Page H2915]]  myths that things don't get done around here, dispelling those myths  that we don't respect each other, and dispelling those myths that we  can't work together, I want to dispel the myth that what this  underlying rule does is it provides Republicans with a pathway for  doing whatever it is they want to do whenever it is they want to do it,  because that doesn't really sound like fair play. I wouldn't want to  support such a bill either.   What this rule does do is, contrary to the rules, allow us to bring  up suspension bills at any time. Now, what a suspension bill is, Mr.  Speaker, as you know, it is a bill that can pass not with a simple  majority, but with a two-thirds majority. So this rule says, forbid the  thought, should bipartisanship break out in the next 72 hours, you all  should be able to bring those bills to the floor and deliver it for the  American people.   Well, dag gum it, I support that. I don't look at that as a way of  Republicans to manipulate the system. I look at it as a way for the  United States Congress to deliver on behalf of the system, and I am  glad we are doing it.   Number two, the bill says, if the Rules Committee, in its wisdom,  passes a rule to bring a bill to the floor rather than have that bill  lay over for a night, you can bring that bill to the floor directly. So  my friend is absolutely right when he says that passing this rule would  allow us to rush legislation to the floor. It would rush that  commonsense, bipartisan legislation that two-thirds of us would agree  on, we can rush those results across the finish line for the American  people; and, if the Rules Committee acts and we pass that rule on the  floor of the House, it will allow us to consider the legislation that  that rule would bring to the floor on the same day instead of waiting  24 hours.    Now, what my friend says about having an opportunity to read the  bills is critically important--critically important. I want to point  out because, again, folks have so many concerns about what goes on in  this institution, I got lots of things I can gripe about, but when we  are getting it right, I want to make sure that we are telling folks  that we are getting it right.   This tradition of self-flagellation in this institution drives me  crazy because, when we tear ourselves down, Mr. Speaker, it is not us  who bears the cost of that. It is our constituents. It is the board of  directors of the United States of America. It is the folks who come  beyond us.   We have a responsibility to lead this institution, and when we are  doing it right, we ought to tell the American people that we are doing  it right. For example, there might be a healthcare vote that comes to  the floor of this House in the next 24, 48 hours. I don't want to get  my expectations high for that, Mr. Speaker, but I sure would be  enthusiastic if that happened. If that were to happen, my friend is  exactly right: we will go to the Rules Committee; we will pass a rule;  we will bring it to the floor; and we will bring it up the same day.  But the language was posted yesterday, and the vote wouldn't happen  until tomorrow. So when folks say let's leave the language out there  for folks to have a chance to read it, let's not rush something  through, we have got 3 days built into the system.                                time  1315    That is not a rule of the House. I want to make that clear. There is  no rule in this institution that says you have got to present a bill  before you can pass a bill to read it and find out what is in it. This  is not a rule of this House. It is a policy of ours. It is a policy of  who we are and of let's do this; let's make this our commitment to make  this happen. Mr. Speaker, it does not always happen, but most of the  time it does. I celebrate that success.   Again, thinking about those things that unite us instead of divide  us, I just listened to my friend, Ms. Clark of Massachusetts, make an  incredibly eloquent plea for her bill. She said, if we defeat the  previous question--that vote is coming up very soon--we will take up  her piece of legislation, which was just handed to me about 3\1/2\  minutes ago.   Mr. Speaker, I get it that sometimes people think that they have such  urgent ideas that those ideas need to come to the floor in a hurry. I  will settle for either outcome: that it is okay that we bring ideas to  the floor in a hurry and that it is okay if you hand somebody a bill  3\1/2\ minutes ago and tell them you want to bring it to the floor 30  minutes from now. If that is okay, then let that be okay. If what we  need is for bills to lay overnight, then let that be okay.   We have a process here that is built on mutual respect, that is built  on years of tradition that men and women paid a tremendous price for,  that they provided tremendous leadership for. In the name of short-term  political gains, I want to make sure that we don't tear down those  long-term policy successes.   This institution should be a source of pride for the American people.  I don't believe that it is today. The responsibility of making it that  source of pride falls on you and me. We are the only ones who can get  that job done. We have an opportunity today to do just a little bit of  that, and I hope we take advantage of that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me say to the gentleman from Georgia: he had me at hello, too. If  all he said was ``hello'' and introduced the underlying bill, we would  be done. There would be no controversy. The underlying bill is being  brought to the floor under a rule that is atrocious and that, quite  frankly, every Member of this House should be ashamed about. Under this  martial law rule, you can bring anything up at any time you want, at a  moment's notice, without people having an opportunity to actually  understand what they are going to vote on.   The gentleman talked about they might bring up the healthcare bill  between now and Saturday. He said: Yesterday, we posted the text of our  new amendment. He used the word ``yesterday'' loosely. They posted it  at midnight last night. I was asleep at midnight; I don't know about  the gentleman.   The bottom line is, there is nothing that says that they can't change  the text again and again and again and again, offer more amendments,  because that is what they have been doing since they first began their  effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.   On something as important as health care, on something that could  affect millions and millions of people in this country, that could  throw 24 million people off of health care, that will cut Medicaid by a  trillion dollars, that will compromise Medicare, that will take away  essential benefits, people ought to know what the heck they are voting  on.   We ought to have regular order on these major pieces of legislation.  Why is that so controversial? How about a hearing on health care? The  idea that we would like the opportunity to know what we are voting on,  to do this in a thoughtful way, is so offensive to my Republican  colleagues. I am flabbergasted by this--to basically defend this  process.   We have to use a procedural motion to be able to try to force a  debate or bring to the floor the bill of my colleague, Katherine Clark,  which basically calls on the President to release his tax returns and  calls for some transparency with regard to visitor logs at the White  House and Mar-a-Lago. We have to resort to a procedural motion because  the Republican majority basically blocks us from bringing anything to  the floor under a normal process.   The Rules Committee has become a place where democracy goes to die.  Yet the bill that we have before us, the underlying bill that we are  going to consider later today, could probably pass on a suspension.   By the way, we have no problem with giving you same-day authority on  suspension bills. Those aren't controversial. We don't even have a  problem, although you should have prepared for this, with you being  able to bring a bill to the floor quickly to keep the government  running.   It is the broad authority that you have given yourselves to bring  anything at a moment's notice, without anybody having a chance to  review it. That is what we have a problem with. Quite frankly, my  Republican colleagues ought to have a problem with that, too.   Mr. Speaker, shortly after taking the gavel, Speaker Ryan said: ``I  want to  [[Page H2916]]  have a process that is more open, more inclusive, more deliberative,  more participatory, and that is what we are trying to do.'' That was  the Speaker of the House.   Unfortunately, Republicans do not appear to be trying very hard. The  current Congress is on track to become the most closed in history, with  an incredible 26 closed rules in this year's first quarter out of 42  total rules. The Republican majority shut out all amendments from both  Democrats and Republicans on fully 62 percent of the legislation  considered by the House under a rule.   Do Members realize that? On most bills, even they are not allowed to  offer amendments. No amendments at all. Under a closed rule, you can't  even offer an amendment to fix a typo.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to take a look at this  chart. This shows closed rules in the past decade and for the first  quarter of the year.   Do you see this really long red line on the top? I am happy to bring  it over to my colleagues here. If you see that line, you will see that  the bottom line is that this shows that this Congress has an abysmal  record with regard to an open, fair process.   When we were in charge from 2007-2010, we averaged only 8 closed  rules in the same timeframe. This Congress is more than three times as  closed. We have 26 closed rules in the first quarter alone; that is not  to mention zero open rules. You are even crushing your record for 2015,  the year that you beat the all-time closed rule record. This is not  something to be proud of.   What has this historically closed process brought to the House?  Complete chaos. Virtually no legislative accomplishments. A lousy  process usually leads to lousy legislation. We learned that from your  awful, disastrous attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care  Act.   By the way, I should point out that while we were meeting here  today--I guess some of the advocacy organizations had a chance to read  the language you posted last night at midnight--so far, the American  Hospital Association, AARP, the American Medical Association, March of  Dimes, and America's Essential Hospitals have all come out against this  terrible, new Republican health proposal. In fact, the American  Hospital Association said: ``The amendment proposed this week would  dramatically worsen the bill.''   I would just say to my colleagues: We don't have a problem with  suspensions. We don't have a problem with a rule that will allow us to  keep the government running. We have a problem with your closed,  authoritarian approach to the legislation. We have a problem with the  prospect that you might bring a healthcare bill to the floor that will  impact millions and millions of Americans, and nobody will have read  it, nobody will even have any guarantee that what you posted last night  at midnight will even be what we are voting on.   This is a big deal. It affects my constituents and it affects your  constituents. We ought to be doing a better job around here, and this  process, quite frankly, stinks.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia). Members are  reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 3\1/2\  minutes remaining.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Simply, again, I reiterate that everybody in this House, Democrats  and Republicans alike, should be ashamed at the way this House is being  run. The American people who are watching should be appalled by the way  this House is being run.   I don't care whether you are a liberal or conservative or fall  somewhere in the middle. You ought to have some confidence that what  the people's House is doing is actually thoughtful and is actually in  the best interest of the people of this country. That is not what is  happening here.   Yes, the underlying bill that we are going to talk about later today,  we have no problem with it. It could have passed overwhelmingly under a  suspension vote. I am happy to support it. No problem.   I have no problem, by the way, with bringing up suspensions to fill  up time as we try to get a resolution to the continuing resolution. We  have no problem, quite frankly, with bringing up a continuing  resolution in a quick fashion.   This rule continues a lousy process that has been embraced by the  current Republican leadership in this House. There is no excuse for  this. When it comes to big bills, big legislation, like health care,  which is a very personal thing to people in this country, the American  people deserve much better than this.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``no'' on  this lousy rule and stand up to your leadership and demand that they  open this House up not only to Democratic amendments but to Republican  amendments as well. This is a deliberative body. We ought to be able to  deliberate.   On big issues like health care, it ought not be some backroom deal  that a few people put together. We saw the result of those backroom  deals with a lousy, terrible, awful bill that would hurt millions of  Americans. We ought to do it out in the open.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I heard a group of constituents ask one of our freshman  Members what they found to be the most surprising part of this  institution, having served here for about 100 days, and it was with no  small amount of joy that they gave exactly the same answer that I would  have given after my first 100 days. They said to their constituents:  What really surprised me is how earnest, hardworking, conscientious,  dedicated, and how committed each and every Member of this institution  is.   There are a couple of bad apples that don't follow under that  perspective, but, by and large, the surprise when you get elected to  Congress is about the high quality of the people who you get to work  with, the commitment of the people you get to work with, the conviction  of the people who you get to work with.   What you have heard from my friend from Massachusetts, Mr. Speaker, I  will tell you, is 100 percent authentic. There is no one down here  playing for the cameras today. I could make a powerful case that while  cameras provide a great deal of sunlight, they create a great deal of  unnecessary heat, as well. Folks sometimes are performing for cameras  in this institution, but not my friend from Massachusetts.   What you heard from my friend from Massachusetts was absolutely  sincere concern about public policy. I agree with him. I believe we  should have an open and deliberative process in this institution.   You and I and my friend from Massachusetts don't work for the  leadership. The leadership works for us. There is not one Member of the  leadership team who votes for me. I vote for them.   We have an opportunity to direct the way this institution is led.  Candidly, I couldn't be more proud than I am of the way that Paul Ryan  leads this institution. He is not the Republican Speaker. We have a  Republican leader. The Democrats have a Democratic leader. Paul Ryan is  the Speaker of the House. I am incredibly proud of the way he leads  this institution.   The way to make it even better, Mr. Speaker, is not to cite every  single thing that we do as a failure. It is just not so. Let's find  those things that we do that we can do better, and let's identify them  and work together, but let's celebrate those successes.   For example, my friend pointed to the number of closed rules that  have come to the floor. For folks who don't follow the process closely,  a closed rule means there were no amendments allowed.   Well, many of those bills, Mr. Speaker, were bills that the Rules  Committee sent out an email to all of Capitol Hill and said: We are  bringing this piece of legislation to the floor. Here it is for you to  read it and digest it. And if you have any ideas about how to make this  bill better, you send them to us, and we will take a look.  [[Page H2917]]    When we did that, Mr. Speaker, not one single idea came back from the  Republican or the Democratic side of the aisle for improving the bill.                                time  1330    So, yes, the bill came to the floor. The rule was closed not because  we are trying to silence the minority, not because we are trying to  silence elements of the majority, but because we had a completely open  process, and it turned out that regular order got it right the first  time. We don't need to identify that as a failure. That is an  unmitigated success.   Some of those closed rules, Mr. Speaker, came because we were  bringing legislation under the Congressional Review Act. Now, for folks  who don't know the Congressional Review Act, that is that act that was  passed so that Congress could go back and review regulations that had  been passed by the administration to make sure those regulations  followed congressional intent.   By definition, those bills have to be narrow and targeted. We can't  have an amendment about healthcare legislation added to our waters of  the U.S. Congressional Review Act bill. We can't have folks go and add  a pay raise for our military men and women to that Congressional Review  Act bill. We want a pay raise for our men and women in uniform. We  passed it out of the House. It is sitting in the United States Senate,  but it can't be on a CRA piece of legislation. So, yes, every single  one of those bills came to the floor under a closed rule not because  someone was trying to silence the minority, not because someone wanted  to silence elements of the majority, but because that is the process  that we have to work through together, and, by golly, we are doing it  right.   My friend from Massachusetts talked about what has gone on in this  body. I will tell you, this body has moved more legislation to the  President's desk for his signature in these first 100 days than any  President since Truman. We have had Republicans running the show, we  have had Democrats running the show, but it is only when we  collaboratively have been running the show that we have moved more  bills to the President's desk than any other Congress in modern  American history. I am proud of that. Some of those votes went my way,  some of those votes didn't go my way, but we worked each one of those  through the process, and we did each one of those things together.   Mr. Speaker, I would love to tell you what is going to happen over  the next 18 months. I have no idea. But I know that to the extent that  this body is full of accusations, to the extent that this body is full  of mistrust, to the extent that this body is full of frustration and  condemnation, we are going to go down one path.   To the extent that this body isn't afraid to tell folks back home  when we are working hard together, to the extent that this body isn't  ashamed that we rolled up our sleeves together and got some things done  that folks thought we wouldn't be able to get done, to the extent that  this body isn't afraid to confront the fact that we are always going to  have disagreements, but from time to time bipartisanship breaks out and  bills move a little more quickly than they do at other times. If folks  are willing to accept our successes with the same zeal that they  celebrate our failures, Mr. Speaker, I tell you, we are going to create  a different institution over these next 18 months. Again, not under  Democratic leadership, not under Republican leadership, but under Paul  Ryan's leadership as Speaker of this entire House of Representatives.   We have one such opportunity today. I encourage folks to go to the  web page of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I believe  it is oversight.house.gov. Those folks are working on some of the  toughest issues in this town, and often they are bitterly divided along  partisan lines. They are working on those issues that tend to separate  Americans rather than unite them. They have sent us a bill today that  was so widely supported, it passed by a voice vote unanimously out of  that committee. It then went to the Committee on Rules, where every  single Member of Congress was invited to improve it. Three Members of  Congress took us up on the invitation, and every single one of their  amendments was made in order by this rule.   Mr. Speaker, we have lots of things that are going to bring my friend  from Massachusetts and I back down to this floor, and we are going to  disagree heartily about those. Today we have an example of something  that brings us together. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  this rule that brings our OGR unanimously passed bill to the floor, and  vote ``yes'' on that underlying bill, just as our Republican and  Democratic colleagues on the Committee on Oversight and Government  Reform did.   Mr. Speaker, there are lots of challenges ahead of us. This is one we  can put in the books as a success for our constituents back home. I ask  for a ``yes'' vote.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 280 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution it       shall be in order without intervention of any point of order       to consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 286)       directing certain officials of the executive branch to       provide information to the House of Representatives that will       enable the House to meet its constitutional responsibility to       conduct oversight of the executive branch by investigating       potential conflicts of interests of President Donald J.       Trump. The resolution shall be considered as read. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; and (2) one       motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 286.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools  [[Page H2918]]       for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and       allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer       an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be  followed by 5-minute votes on adopting the resolution, if ordered, and  suspending the rules and passing S. 496.

There are 2 minutes  remaining.                                time  1407    So the resolution was agreed to.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.   Stated for:    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate you yielding and being willing  to stick around with me this afternoon. I have a great pleasure this  afternoon, and that is to talk about successes that we have had  together.   I was down on the floor earlier when we were debating the rule, and I  was talking to my Democratic colleagues on the Rules Committee about  the good work that was going on in the Rules Committee; the good work  that was going on on the House floor. In fact, we brought the bill--it  was a raucous debate, Mr. Speaker. You will remember it. We argued for  an hour about all sorts of extraneous things, then we brought the bill  down, and it passed, I believe unanimously, here on the floor of the  House just a few minutes ago.   I don't understand that. I just don't understand what those drivers  are in politics, Mr. Speaker, that encourages us to tear folks down  instead of build folks up. And that is why I want to talk about some  successes today. You can't see my slides, Mr. Speaker, but I have got  some numbers written down to the left in red, and those are the numbers  that are worth paying attention to.   Twenty-eight. Twenty-eight is the number of bills President Trump has  signed into law in his first 100 days; 28. That is more bills signed  into law than any other American President since Harry Truman.   More bills. Now, I read the same newspapers you read, Mr. Speaker. I  listen to the same news broadcasts you listen to. I hear folks talk  about inaction. I hear folks talk about confusion. I hear folks talk  about division. I don't  [[Page H2928]]  hear folks talking about success, and success is what marks these first  100 days.   Again, there has been more legislative activity than any other  President and Congress--collaboratively Congress, House, Senate,  Republicans, Democrats--more legislative success than we have had in  any Congress and White House combination since Harry Truman.   Mr. Speaker, we had the first Supreme Court confirmation in the first  100 days since 1881--since 1881. Now, it is with no joy that I share  with you that the Supreme Court is such a powerful institution, Mr.  Speaker. I think too often we fail to get the job done legislatively,  and the Court steps in and legislates from right across the street.  That wasn't the job the Constitution envisioned. That wasn't the job  assigned in Article III, but it is the job that has been taken on by  default. So it has become increasingly important that we make sure the  Court is staffed.   I supported the Senate having hearings on the Garland nomination last  cycle. I supported the Senate having hearings on the Gorsuch nomination  this cycle. Decision after decision in the last session went 4-4, which  meant we could sustain the underlying Court's decision, but we couldn't  decide these important questions that were still a source of confusion  across this country. We now have a fully staffed Supreme Court again-- the first time since 1881. We have seen a Supreme Court confirmation in  the first 100 days of a new administration.   Seventeen, Mr. Speaker. It has been 17 years since illegal border  crossings reached this low level. I am going to come back to that. But  what I am saying is that words matter. And what the President has said  is: we are going to grow the most robust economy the world has ever  seen, but we are going to do it with a legal visa program that makes  sure folks are coming and going in accordance with U.S. law. And simply  that change in attitude, Mr. Speaker, simply that change in  attitude from ``we are going to ignore the law'' to ``the law matters''  has brought illegal crossings down to a 17-year low.    Mr. Speaker, 728; that is the number of millions of dollars saved  with the President's first foray into cutting Federal budgets. His  first foray into cutting Federal budgets, he started taking a look at  Federal contracts. Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, what it is like to be  a new President of the United States, particularly one that doesn't  come out of a legislative or government tradition? Everything is new as  it comes to the content, but what is not new is so much of the process.   The President has been looking at contracts his entire life, Mr.  Speaker. The President has been negotiating contracts his entire life.  He took a look at the beginnings of the Pentagon contracts and said, by  golly, we can do better for the American people; $728 million on  project number one saved for the American taxpayer.   That brings us to number 16, Mr. Speaker, and that is 16 years since  consumer confidence in this country has been as high as it is today. I  enjoy traveling across the district, Mr. Speaker, and I am talking to  folks. We are a divided community, like every community is in the  country. Some folks believe one thing; some folks believe another.  Generally, we are united on issues, but sometimes we are divided on  issues. And voter after voter after voter says: Rob, I am not sure what  is going to happen, but I feel like we are going to have opportunity.  It has been 16 years since consumer confidence has reached this high of  a level.   Now, with that increase in confidence, Mr. Speaker, comes an  incredible obligation on the 435 of us to deliver. This isn't  confidence that is based on nothing happening. This is confidence based  on something happening. We have real obligations to fulfill those  promises, those commitments that we all made during the last election  cycle. I think we have the men and women in this Chamber who can do it,  but it has been 16 years since the American people believed that we  could.   I want to put those border crossings in perspective, Mr. Speaker.  There has been a 61 percent decline in border crossings in President  Trump's first 100 days.   Now, I come from Georgia. We have got a robust agricultural economy  in Georgia. And I tell my constituents day in and day out, if you are  not going to raise your son or daughter to pick carrots in south  Georgia; if you don't aspire for your son or daughter to be the very  best cabbage picker that we have in the State of Georgia; if you are  not aspiring to be part of that agricultural economy and help us get  crops out of the field, we are going to need somebody who is aspiring  to do that hard work. And it is hard work, Mr. Speaker.   Well, if we can agree that these aren't jobs that American citizens  are losing, these are jobs that are adding to the American economy,  then we need a legal visa program to let folks come in and to let folks  go out. I went on a bipartisan codel, Mr. Speaker--a bipartisan codel,  Republicans and Democrats, traveling together to El Salvador,  Guatemala, and Honduras talking with families.   You remember the women and children crisis there: unaccompanied  minors coming across the border? I talked to family after family, and  they said: Rob, listen, I don't want to be an American citizen. I don't  want to go to America. I don't want to be in America. I am happy here  at home. But dad, or my husband, he generally travels to America during  the growing season, during the construction season, and turns around  and comes back home when that season is over.   Well, you all are getting so tough on your border security, you are  not handing out legal visas to do this work, that now my husband or my  dad can't come back home when the growing season is over. So now we are  all picking up, and we are trying to get into America, too, so the  family can stay together.   Well, it makes perfectly good sense to me if you were that family. It  makes no sense if you are the American taxpayer. You recognize that you  have jobs that need to be filled. You recognize you have skills that  you are not training your children to fulfill, and you don't want to  change the visa program to make that happen.   The President has committed to growing the economy. We know that is  going to mean legal access in and out of the country. There was a 61  percent drop in illegal border crossings in the first 100 days.   I will tell you what else that means, Mr. Speaker. That means,  instead of our border patrol men and women working that border under  very difficult conditions, instead of our law enforcement, instead of  all of the instruments of homeland security that we have in this  country being focused on families crossing the border, with a 61  percent decline in this human traffic crossing the border, law  enforcement can now focus on the real security issues to this country:  to the drugs crossing the border, to the weapons crossing the border;  forbid the thought to weapons of mass destruction crossing the border.   There have been tremendously important accomplishments here in the  first 100 days; so much more that we will be able to do together.   Mr. Speaker, there were 25 Iranian entities sanctioned by the Trump  administration in the first 100 days. That is what we did together in  this Chamber. You will remember, Mr. Speaker, we passed the Iranian  sanctions language in a bipartisan way to send the word to the leaders  of Iran that while we have great respect for your citizenry, we cannot  tolerate a nuclear Iran. We do not trust you to be a member of the  league of nations with nuclear capabilities, and the answer is no as  you pursue those very dangerous dreams.   Well, you will remember, President Obama negotiated a deal with the  international community and with the Iranians. I wish he hadn't, but he  did. We had sanctions. Those sanctions are now gone. Iran is pursuing  very much the same path that I would have expected them to pursue,  given the deal that was negotiated. And the world continues to be a  dangerous place.   Well, we have rules on the books today, laws on the books today that  allow the government, in consultation with Congress, in cooperation  with Congress, based on statutes passed by Congress, to get involved  unilaterally as the United States of America in trying to prevent a  nuclear Iran.  [[Page H2929]]    There were 25 different entities identified by this administration as  helping the Iranian Government to pursue those dangerous and illegal  nuclear goals sanctioned and reined in. It is going to make a  difference. It is going to make a difference to national security. It  is going to make a difference to international security.   Mr. Speaker, $18 billion--you can't see this slide, but already in 4  months on the job, 4 months in cooperation with this Congress, we have  seen $18 billion saved through the elimination of red tape. I don't  mean $18 billion that is a one-time deal, Mr. Speaker. I mean $18  billion annually in wasteful compliance costs erased by this  administration, again, often in cooperation and consultation with  Congress.   When I go back and tell you that this President has signed more bills  into law than any President since Harry Truman in cooperation with this  Congress, I am talking about many of the bills that did exactly this:  cutting red tape, saving the American taxpayer money. Those bills, very  often, were brought through the Congressional Review Act process. That  is a process, as you know, Mr. Speaker, that allows the Congress to  take a look at the regulations that the administration promulgates.   We pass the laws; the administration writes the regs; we get to go  back and look at the regs to make sure they represent the true intent  of the legislation.   Well, in many instances so far this year, Mr. Speaker--in fact, in  more instances than any other time in American history, we have decided  that those regulations do not reflect the intent of Congress. In fact,  often they are running directly contrary to the intent of Congress. We  have eliminated those $18 billion annually in savings to the American  taxpayer.   Remember the Keystone pipeline, Mr. Speaker. This administration  approved the Dakota Access pipeline. Think back, Mr. Speaker. We are  going to disagree on things. I am perfectly comfortable with the  disagreements that this body has. But when the application for the  Keystone pipeline was delivered to the administration, it took longer  for the past two administrations to approve the Keystone pipeline--and  by approve it, I mean ultimately they rejected it. It took longer for  them to consider and reject the Keystone pipeline than it took for  Americans to build the Hoover Dam from start to finish.   I want you to think about that. When we are talking about jobs; when  we are talking about the economy; when we are talking about America  being that beacon of hope, and freedom, and opportunity across the  country; when we are talking about the tremendous need for public works  projects in this country, and the amazing things the American people  can do when they put their shoulder into it, it took longer in the 21st  century to get an answer to whether or not you are allowed to build a  pipeline than it took to build the Hoover Dam from start to finish.  That is bad for all of us.                                time  1615    That is bad for every Republican, every Democrat, every Independent.  Every single American citizen needs economic opportunity. Every single  American citizen needs a job. Every single American citizen needs the  certainty of knowing if the pipeline is bad, let's cancel it and let's  move on. But let's not sit and wait and delay. Let's not debate and  debate. Let's get to an answer.   In the first 100 days on the job, President Trump got to an answer.  President Bush and President Obama, combined, again, over 8 years of  delay. President Trump, first 100 days, approved this.   What does this mean? Well, it means that the oil coming out of Canada  is going to come to America to be refined. Remember, the Keystone  Pipeline debate, Mr. Speaker, was never about the environment and  whether or not the Canadians were going to harvest this oil. It was  never about that. The Canadians were loud and clear: We are going to  get this oil out of the ground. We are either going to get it out of  the ground and send it to America to be processed, or we are going to  get it out of the ground and send it to China to be processed. You  pick.   Well, Mr. Speaker, that is an easy choice. If I get to be king of  Canada, I can make different decisions about their environment. But  while Canada has sovereignty and gets to make its own decisions about  its natural resources, we get to decide: Are American citizens going to  profit from the processing of this oil or is China going to profit from  the processing of this oil?   When this oil gets processed, who do you think is doing it in the  most environmentally sensitive manner, Mr. Speaker? You tell me. If  there's a single colleague in this body that believes the Chinese are  better stewards of the environment than the Americans are, then you  needed to vote ``no'' on the Keystone pipeline. But if you believe that  we care more about Mother Earth than the Chinese do, if you believe  that American rules and regulations protect the environment more than  Chinese rules and regulations do, then you needed to be a supporter of  the Keystone pipeline.   In his first 100 days, President Trump took this source of indecision  and confusion and provided certainty. That is not academic, Mr.  Speaker. That certainty is directly connected to jobs.   You can't see it from where you sit, Mr. Speaker, but I am talking  about over 500,000 new jobs not connected to the pipeline,  individually. There are going to be a lot of jobs on the pipeline. Not  this number. I am talking about this approach to governing that says  people deserve a ``yes'' or a ``no'' answer. People deserve certainty.  People deserve fast responses. People don't need to hang in the lurch.   Every single Member of this body, Mr. Speaker, has seen it in their  constituency back home where a small-business owner said: You know  what? I wanted to hire a few more people, but I wasn't really sure what  was about to happen and so I have been putting it off. I wanted to open  a new franchise, but I wasn't entirely sure of what the economic  situation was going to be so I have been putting it off.   When we talk about the economic growth over the past 100 days, when  we talk about the stock markets moving, when we talk about consumer  confidence rising, when we talk about new jobs being created, we are  talking about a change in attitude. And I have seen it on both sides of  this body.   It is a shame, Mr. Speaker, there is that underlying current that  maybe voters reward fighting with each other more than they reward  working together. I don't believe it, but I certainly see people posit  that theory. I believe folks reward cooperation and getting things  done. I don't think people pay us to agree with each other. I think  people pay us to make progress together--500,000 new jobs.   I will read from The Wall Street Journal. It says: ``The Trump order  is a promise in the bank for the voters who elected the President  because he promised to focus on jobs and revving up the economy.''   I believe it is 12 congressional districts, Mr. Speaker, that have  Democrats representing them in Congress, but those districts voted for  President Trump in the Presidential election. These are not  conservative men and women out across the district pursuing some sort  of ideological agenda. These are hardworking American families who  identify more with the Democratic Party and Democratic values but who  began to lose hope in what was going on with regulation across the  country and job creation across the country, and they cast their vote  for President Trump.   Over 500,000 new jobs, Mr. Speaker.   What are we talking about? We are talking about the Keystone  pipeline. We are talking about the Clean Power Plan, which, alone,  threatened to put about 286,000 jobs out to pasture. We are talking  about new investments in infrastructure.   I am not just talking about roads and bridges, Mr. Speaker. I am  talking about the FAA and air transportation. I am talking about ports  like the Port of Savannah in Georgia, the fastest growing container  port in the Nation, and sea transportation. I am talking about  railroads. I am talking about water infrastructure to make sure every  family has access to clean and healthy drinking water.   These are job-creating proposals, and they are job-creating proposals  that have been kept off the books for so long because of regulatory  uncertainty.  [[Page H2930]]  Today we have an opportunity to do that for the very first time.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to take you back to where I began, and that  is that we have a choice in this country. We can focus on the things  that divide us all day every day. We can do it. I still believe there  is more that unites us as a nation than divides us as a nation, but if  you choose to spend your time talking about those things that divide  us, you can fill up a day.   If you choose to spend your time talking about those things that are  broken yet proffering no solutions to fix them, you can fill up a day.  If you choose to spend your day talking about why everybody else is a  lazy son of a gun and only you have access to the truth, you can fill  up a day, and then a week, and then a month, and then a year, and then  a Presidential cycle, and then a decade, and then a generation.    But, Mr. Speaker, if you will recognize that working together we have  already passed more laws in 2017 than any other Congress and President  working together since Harry Truman, if you will recognize that we have  taken the uncertainty out of the Supreme Court--we fully staffed the  Supreme Court so that uncertainty in the legal arena will exist no  longer--if you recognize that a thorny issue like illegal immigration  that has been made so difficult to solve because we haven't been able  to figure out how to deal with the border security aspect so that we  can go on and deal with the other thorny issues, those border crossings  are down, which means our opportunity has increased for dealing with  these problems that have plagued our Nation for so long.   I can give you one example of that, Mr. Speaker. I am going to  digress.   I have got a family in my district trying to bring a relative into  the country from Haiti. They have been working on it for 11 years--11  years. All the talk that goes on in this body about immigration, nobody  is taking about helping my constituents from Haiti. Nobody is talking  about passing a law to make it easier to get your family member in from  Haiti. Nobody is talking about those families that have been separated  while trying to follow the law of the land. Nobody is talking about  those families that have paid out of pocket to go through the legal  process--all the time, all the money, all the delay to do it the right  way. Nobody is talking about fixing it for those families.   Let's fix it for those families because we all agree there is a  better way. If you want to get your adult child in from Mexico, Mr.  Speaker, you needed to file your paperwork in 1993 for their number to  be coming up today--1993, to do it the right way and have their number  to come up today.   Who believes a 25-year process to bring a family member into this  country is the right answer? Of course folks are going to do it the  wrong way.   If you want to bring your adult brother or sister in from the  Philippines, you had to file in 1994 for their number to be coming up  legally today. Who believes that is the right system?   The system is broken. We don't have enough trust together to repair  the system. By eliminating the illegal border crossing's immediate  challenge, the President has created the headroom for us to work  together on issues that we can absolutely solve.   728, Mr. Speaker, the number of millions of dollars saved in contract  negotiations thus far--in fact, not even thus far, but contract  negotiations on one single Pentagon project that the President has  inserted himself in.   For all the things you may think the President knows, doesn't know,  you agree with, you disagree with, you have to know that he knows how  to drive a hard bargain. You have to know that he knows how to  negotiate big contracts.   The American taxpayer is not satisfied with the way we have been  doing it, with the way former White Houses have been doing it. We have  an opportunity to come together and do it better, and the President is  leading us in that way.   And that all culminates, Mr. Speaker, in 16. That is the number of  years since consumer confidence in this country was at its current  levels. You can do that math if you would like, Mr. Speaker. It will  take you back through an entire 8 years of Democratic control of the  White House, and it will take you back through an entire 8 years of  Republican control of the White House.   The American consumer does not care whether you are a Republican or a  Democrat. The American consumer cares whether or not they think their  job is secure.   The American consumer does not care if you are a Republican or a  Democrat. The American consumer cares whether prices are higher  tomorrow or lower tomorrow.   The American consumer does not care about our petty, silly, inside- the-beltway Washington arguments. They care about whether America is  going to be stronger for their children and grandchildren a generation  from now. And it has been 16 years since American consumers have the  optimism that they have today.   I will say it again, Mr. Speaker. We can consume every second of  every day in this body fussing, griping, complaining--there are lots of  things that are wrong and lots of folks to blame for it--or we can  recognize the big hopes and dreams that the American people have placed  on this President and this Congress and this time in our history. We  can recognize that there is still more that unites us in this country  than divides us in this country. We can still recognize that folks care  very little about us and our families and care so very much about their  community and their families.   With that as our touchstone, Mr. Speaker, call me an irrational  optimist, but I think there is absolutely nothing that we can't do  together, and I look forward to playing a role in that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
