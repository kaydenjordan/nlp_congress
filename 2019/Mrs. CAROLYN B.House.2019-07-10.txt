 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding and for his extraordinary leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule, which when  passed will include my bill, the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act, into  the NDAA.   We are long overdue to guarantee Federal workers, 2 million working  people, 12 weeks of annual paid leave to care for themselves and their  families in time of need. This builds on the Family Medical Leave Act  that had 12 weeks of unpaid leave. This provides 12 weeks of paid  leave; which families desperately need.   I painfully remember the birth of my first child and inquiring about  family leave, I was told, ``There is no leave. Women just leave.''   I said, ``I don't intend to leave. I have to work.''   They said, ``We have no leave policy. You will be the first one to  ever come back. Women are supposed to leave.''   Well, this realizes that it takes two workers usually in a family  just to make ends meet.   It is well past time that our Nation truly honors families by  offering this basic benefit for Federal workers.   Additionally, this rule brings us one step closer to honoring our  heroic first responders who risked their lives on 9/11 by allowing this Chamber to move forward with the passage of the  Never Forget the Heroes Act, which fully funds and permanently  reauthorizes the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a listing of well over 54  organizations, women's groups, and unions that are strongly in support  of the Family Medical Leave Act.                                                       July 9, 2019.        Dear Member of Congress: We, the undersigned organizations,       urge you to co-sponsor the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act       (H.R. 1534), and cosponsor and vote for the Federal Employee       Paid Leave Act amendment to the National Defense       Authorization Act (Amendment 363 to H.R. 2500). The Federal       Employee Paid Leave Act would: provide 12 weeks of paid leave       for the birth, adoption or foster placement of a new child;       to care for a spouse, child or parent; for particular       military caregiving and leave purposes; and for personal       health reasons to federal workers who are eligible for job       protected, unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave       Act (FMLA).        With more than 2 million employees, the federal government       is the nation's largest employer, yet provides no paid family       and medical leave. This leaves federal workers forced to       choose between a paycheck and caring for a loved one, a       newborn or themselves. The Federal Employee Paid Leave Act       would not provide employees with additional leave time; it       would simply ensure that federal employees can receive full       pay during their 12 weeks of FMLA leave.        Paid leave would help not just federal employees, but the       entire federal government. With access to paid leave, many       individuals can remain in the workforce when they face       caregiving responsibilities. Women who take paid leave are       more likely to be working within a year after giving birth       than those who take no leave. Paid leave helps reduce       turnover, which is estimated to cost between 16 and 200       percent of a worker's annual salary.        Providing paid leave to federal workers will help the       federal government retain key employees and attract the best       workers. The federal workforce is aging, creating a retention       and recruiting crisis. In 2017, the number of full-time       federal employees older than 50 years old was nearly eight       times the number under 30. An increase in satisfaction with       family-friendly policies has been shown to reduce turnover       intention by 37.5 percent in federal agencies. Further, paid       family and medical leave is key to the federal government's       competitiveness as more top companies introduce new or       expanded paid leave policies.        Paid leave supports the health and well-being of employees       and their families. New mothers who take paid leave are more       likely to take the amount of time away from work recommended       by doctors, and their children are more likely to be       breastfed, receive medical check-ups and get critical       immunizations. When children are seriously ill, the presence       of a parent shortens a child's hospital stay by 31 percent;       active parental involvement in a child's hospital care may       head off future health problems, especially for children with       chronic health conditions, and thus reduce costs. Paid leave       also lets people help older family members recover from       serious illnesses, fulfill treatment plans, and avoid       complications and hospital readmissions. Paid leave is not       just good human resource management; it sends a message about       the value we place on family.        There is a growing consensus across the country that paid       leave is a necessity. Seven states and the District of       Columbia have passed comprehensive paid family and medical       leave programs and dozens of municipalities across the       country guarantee paid leave to their employees. Millions of       workers have filed claims in the four states that have       implemented paid leave programs, and evidence shows that paid       leave benefits both employees and employers and has high       levels of public support--84 percent of voters support a       comprehensive paid family and medical leave policy that       covers all people who work.        The Federal Employee Paid Leave Act would provide critical       support to federal employees when they need time to care--      whether for themselves, their families, or a new child. We       urge you to stand with the more than two million federal       workers and their families by cosponsoring the Federal       Employee Paid Leave Act, and cosponsoring and voting for the       Federal Employee Paid Leave Act amendment in the National       Defense Authorization Act.

MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, we have a chance  today not just to ensure a vital and talented Federal workforce going  into the future, to make public service economically viable to a new  generation, but also to ensure that we can set the standards for all  workers across America.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please vote today for this rule  and the underlying bill.
