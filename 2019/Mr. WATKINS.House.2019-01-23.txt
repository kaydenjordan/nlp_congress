 Mr. Speaker, this week is National School Choice Week.  It is when we shine a light on the educational opportunities when they  are tailored to the individual student.   I was raised by four academics, and they would be the first to tell  you that, in order to empower young people to develop into the type of  adults who can solve the problems of tomorrow, their educational  experiences need to be tailored.   No parent, no teacher, no student wants an ill-fitting educational  experience.   Education is the great equalizer. It is the combat multiplier. It is  the path that leads toward American dreams.   God bless the American student. God bless the American teacher.                            ____________________
