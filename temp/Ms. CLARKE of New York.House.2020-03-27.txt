 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   As vice chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I rise today in  support of the CARES Act.   My colleagues have spoken about the provisions of this bill, and  although it is not perfect, it is a necessary one. We must now protect  my constituents in the Ninth District of New York, the epicenter, and  all Americans across this country.   New Yorkers have been through 9/11, the financial meltdown,  Superstorm Sandy, and now we are in the midst of COVID-19.   In my city, New York City, we are not just facing economic ruin, but  also a genuine health crisis. That is why it is so critical that Donald  Trump use the Defense Production Act.
