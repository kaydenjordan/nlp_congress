 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 908 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 908         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for further       consideration of the bill (H.R. 5515) to authorize       appropriations for fiscal year 2019 for military activities       of the Department of Defense and for military construction,       to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal       year, and for other purposes.        Sec. 2.  (a) No further amendment to the bill, as amended,       shall be in order except those printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution and       amendments en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution.

(c) All points of order against       the further amendments printed in the report of the Committee       on Rules or amendments en bloc described in section 3 of this       resolution are waived.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time for the chair of       the Committee on Armed Services or his designee to offer       amendments en bloc consisting of amendments printed in the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution       not earlier disposed  [[Page H4594]]       of. Amendments en bloc offered pursuant to this section shall       be considered as read, shall be debatable for 20 minutes       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Armed Services or their       designees, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not       be subject to a demand for division of the question in the       House or in the Committee of the Whole.        Sec. 4.  At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment pursuant to this resolution the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 5.  On any legislative day during the period from May       25, 2018, through June 4, 2018 -- (a) the Journal of the       proceedings of the previous day shall be considered as       approved; and (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House       adjourned to meet at a date and time, within the limits of       clause 4, section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be       announced by the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 6.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 5 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.        Sec. 7.  Each day during the period addressed by section 5       of this resolution shall not constitute a calendar day of       continuous session for purposes of section 1017(b) of the       Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2       U.S.C. 688(b)).     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 908 provides for complete  consideration of H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2019.   The rule makes in order 168 amendments to go along with the previous  103 amendments made in order by yesterday's rule.   That means the full House will consider 271 amendments to this year's  NDAA. When you add in the 317 amendments considered in the Armed  Services Committee, that means a total of 588 amendments to the NDAA  will be considered this year.   Mr. Speaker, for this year's NDAA, a record number of amendments were  submitted to the Rules Committee.   I want to thank both the majority and the minority Rules Committee  staff, our Rules associates, and the staff of the Armed Services  Committee for the many hours they put into this open and deliberative  process.   As a member of both the Rules Committee and the Armed Services  Committee, I have spent my fair share of time working on this piece of  legislation.   Like years past, I want to again highlight the bipartisan nature of  our work. This year's NDAA passed out of the Armed Services Committee  on a bipartisan 60-1 vote.   That bipartisanship will continue here on the floor, where 176 of the  amendments made in order are minority or bipartisan amendments.   The theme of this year's NDAA is to reform and rebuild our Nation's  military. The bill supports an increase in top-line funding for the  military, as we continue working to reverse the readiness crisis we  faced for at least the last decade.   Any organization, including the military, is only as good as its  people, and this NDAA authorizes a 2.6 percent pay raise for our  troops, the largest increase in 9 years. This will help us retain and  recruit the best and the brightest.   The bill also calls for increases in the size of the Army, the Navy,  the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Naval and Air Reserves, as well as  the Air Guard.   As vice chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee,  I am pleased the bill authorizes construction of 13 new Navy ships.  This is a much-needed step, as we continue building towards a 355-ship  Navy.   I am especially proud that this year's NDAA includes many provisions  important to my home State of Alabama. From Redstone Arsenal in  Huntsville to the Anniston Army Depot to Fort Rucker in the Wiregrass  to Maxwell-Gunter in Montgomery to the Austal Shipyard in Mobile, this  bill ensures that Alabama will continue playing a leading role in  supplying, training, and supporting our Nation's military.   Sadly, we have lost far too many servicemembers to training accidents  over the last year. The bill ensures improvements to military training  and safety programs to help protect our servicemen and -women.   These efforts include repairing outdated equipment and ensuring the  procurement of new first-class capabilities. This includes additional  Stryker A1 combat vehicles, Army armored brigade combat team vehicles,  F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, C-130 Super Hercules aircraft, E-2D Advanced  Hawkeye aircraft, F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, UH-60M Black Hawk  helicopters, and advanced missiles.   The bill continues to build on Chairman Thornberry's priority of  reforming the Pentagon bureaucracy to make it more efficient and  effective. This includes streamlining buying practices.   From Russia to Iran to China to North Korea, the bill makes  investments to ensure we are keeping up with our adversaries. The  United States must stand ready to confront aggression around the globe,  whether it is from major state actors or rogue terrorist organizations.   Importantly, this year's NDAA includes much-needed investment in our  nuclear deterrent and authorizations for the Missile Defense Agency.   It authorizes funding for codevelopment and coproduction of missile  defense and weapons systems with our key ally, Israel.   All told, I am confident that this bill includes the reforms and  funding levels necessary to rebuild and empower the greatest fighting  force in the world.   With this NDAA, we can hopefully continue to embody the strategy of  peace through strength and support our servicemembers.   Mr. Speaker, if you ever need a pick-me-up or a shot in the arm, I  encourage you to spend some time visiting with our servicemen and - women. These individuals come from all different walks of life and  backgrounds. They all play different roles and have different jobs, but  they are united by the common goal of defending and protecting the  United States of America.   I distinctly remember a conversation I had with a group of sailors  from my home State of Alabama aboard the USS John C. Stennis a few  years ago.   After hearing about their various paths that led them to the Navy, I  asked what I could do for them. One response was straightforward, but  very poignant. She asked me to make sure the American people knew what  they did and that we supported them.   That is exactly what we do with this bill. We bring together Members  of Congress from both sides of the aisle, from different parts of the  country, and we unite behind the common goal of supporting the men and  women in uniform who protect the United States of America.   With this bill, we can send a clear message to our sailors, soldiers,  airmen and marines that the United States Congress has their back, that  we are committed to the mission, and we will ensure that they have the  right policies and the right resources to get the job done.   This bill also sends a message to our friends and our adversaries  that America is back, and that while we prefer peace, we will not  hesitate to do what is necessary to defend our country and protect our  interests.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting House  Resolution 908, and for the 58th year in a row, let's pass a bipartisan  NDAA.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let's compare the records of the Republicans and the Democrats and  who has the most open Congress.   As of May 23 of this year, Republicans in this Congress have provided  for consideration of over 1,130 amendments on the House floor. Over 520  of those, or 46 percent, were Democratic amendments; 430, or 38  percent, were Republican; and 170, or 16 percent, were bipartisan. In  the 114th Congress, the GOP majority allowed over 1,700 amendments. In  the 113th Congress, the GOP majority allowed over 1,500 amendments.   In the entire 111th Congress, when the Democrats were in control,  Speaker Pelosi, the Democrats, allowed less than 1,000 amendments to be  considered on the floor.   Who is more open? Democrats have highlighted the number of amendments  not made in order in this Congress. However, in the 111th Congress when  [[Page H4596]]  they controlled, their majority blocked nearly 3,000 amendments, with  roughly 2,400 of those occurring in the very first sessions.   Unlike our Democratic colleagues who shut the doors and refused to  accept the late amendments from Members, Chairman Sessions of the Rules  Committee has made it a point to ensure that every single Member has  the opportunity to submit their amendments and come to the committee to  share their thoughts and concerns, oftentimes late at night.   Under this model of transparency and openness, the committee has  spent countless hours listening and considering Member testimony. In  fact, we have welcomed over 225 Members to testify at this Congress  roughly 493 times and made in order over 1,130 amendments, including  521 from the Democrats, as I said. So I am glad to compare our record  of openness with theirs.   Let's talk about the escalation in Afghanistan. There is a clear AUMF  that authorizes what we are doing in Afghanistan. Under that AUMF, the  military doesn't have to come back to the Congress to say: Pretty  please, can we put more soldiers into that country?   I trust General Mattis. He knows what he is doing. He has a clear,  legal authorization to do it, and I don't think it makes any sense for  him to have to come back to us.   On the issue of the AUMF, which I know we will have more debate on  during this rule debate, let me say one thing and say it clearly: I  have cosponsored at least two AUMF bills, and those are in the Foreign  Affairs Committee, not in the Armed Services Committee. We don't have  jurisdiction over that. I wish we did. In fact, I have cosponsored a  bill with a Democratic colleague to put jurisdiction in the Armed  Services Committee so we can get something done. So I would dearly love  for the Foreign Affairs Committee to come forward with a bill, and I am  happy to work with the gentleman to see that that takes place.   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), the newest member of the Armed Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Virginia's comments. He  is the ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee in  the House. I have the privilege of serving with him on that committee.   I spent 8 years on the Alabama State Board of Education, 5 years in  the Alabama State senate serving on both of  [[Page H4598]]  our education committees, and 2 years as chancellor of postsecondary  education for the State of Alabama. I care deeply about education. I  know what it can do to better the lives of everybody in America.   I find many of the comments the gentleman made with regard to this  bill very interesting, and I hope there will be a time when we can take  those up and consider them, but this is not that time. We are here  today to talk about the defense of the United States of America.   So, with all respect to the gentleman's comments, I hope that he and  I can sit down with others later and talk about that, particularly what  is the role of the Federal Government versus what is the role of State  and local governments. But today let's talk about the defense of the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the gentlewoman's  comments, and she probably is unaware of the fact that we are presently  undergoing for the first time in the history of the Department of  Defense a full Department-wide audit. We are already getting some of  the things that they have determined from that audit back. That audit  is going to give us information we need to make some further changes in  the management performance of the Pentagon. She probably didn't know we  are already underway with that, but that is going to be completed in  early fall of this year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), who is my colleague from both the Rules Committee  and the Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill authorizes what it authorizes with  regard to these smaller nuclear weapons because we find our adversaries  developing such nuclear weapons.   We are not developing them because we want to use them. We want to  develop them because the mere fact that we have got them, we believe,  is a deterrent to our adversaries using the very same weapons they have  in their arsenal themselves.   So we are simply making sure that we don't have one hand tied behind  our back if we get into one of these types of conflicts.   I understand what the gentleman is saying. No one ever wants to use a  nuclear weapon. But to see your adversary have such a weapon and do  nothing is not what we should do to defend the people of the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I know that some of our Democratic colleagues--not all  of them--would like for us today to be talking about a Federal takeover  of local education. Some of my Democratic colleagues--not all of them-- would like to talk about doing away with the Second Amendment. But that  is not what we are about today. We are talking about the defense of the  United States of America.    Remember where we were 2 years ago, at the end of the Obama  administration. ISIS still controlled vast swaths of western Iraq and  eastern Syria. Iran had just gotten its hands on tens of billions of  dollars that had been frozen--money that they were able to get because  of the deal that President Obama cut with them. We now know that they  have taken that money and increased defense spending, military  spending, in Iran by 40 percent.   Two years ago, we had cut troop levels down to levels we haven't seen  in decades. In fact, we cut the Air Force to the point it had never  been since the founding of the Air Force. Our fleet had been cut down  to less than 280 ships after it had been to at least 400 under the  Clinton administration. Fifty percent of the Navy's jets couldn't fly.  Our adversaries didn't fear us and our friends and allies didn't know  if they could count on us.   We have begun to turn that around. ISIS is largely gone from Iraq. It  is largely gone from Syria. It is obliterated as a conventional force  after becoming a conventional terrorist army that controlled a big  chunk of the Middle East. Gone. Slipped over into North Africa. We  understand that. So we have to continue what we are doing to fight  against them in those places. And, yes, we need an AUMF to do that.   We have also done something that is very important in rebuilding our  military. We have told our men and women that we value them by giving  them pay increases. This bill calls for another pay increase on top of  the one we gave them last year. They have gone too long without real  pay increases.   We are beginning to give them the equipment they need to do the  missions that we have them to do. More ships, more jets, more  ammunition, more missiles, more missile defense. We are going to make  sure that our jets can fly.   Most importantly, we want to make sure that our men and women in  uniform have the training, preparation,  [[Page H4602]]  and support they need so we don't have another year that goes by where  we have more of our men and women in uniform who lose their lives in  training exercises than they do in combat.                                time  1330    We are turning that around. We are leaving the sorry legacy of the  Obama administration so that we can put in place a defense strategy for  this country that will defend our country and, at the same time,  protect the safety of our men and women in uniform. So that is what we  are here today to talk about.   I believe that we will vote on this bill, the underlying bill, in a  bipartisan fashion because, going back to the Kennedy administration,  that is what we have done year after year after year. That is the  message that we send to our foes, to our friends abroad, and, yes, to  those men and women in uniform: that we come together, this Congress  comes together, to make sure that we do what we are supposed to do in  our job to defend this country.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution  908 and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 908 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2475) to provide for the long-term improvement of public       school facilities, and for other purposes. The first reading       of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Education and the       Workforce. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2475.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
