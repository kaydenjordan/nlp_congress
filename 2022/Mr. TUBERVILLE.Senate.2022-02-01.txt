 Madam President, I rise today to honor the 200th  anniversary of Major David Moniac, the first Native American to  graduate from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.   Today, I would like to share the inspiring story of Major Moniac. He  was born in 1802 and lived near present-day Pintlala, within Montgomery  County, AL. Several of Moniac's family members were members of the  Creek Nation and influenced passage of the Treaty of New York in 1790,  which declared peace between the Creek Nation and the United States.  This treaty is significant as it contained an important provision for  the U.S. Government to educate four young Creek Native Americans.  Twenty-seven years later in 1817, David Moniac was accepted into the  U.S. Military Academy under this provision at only 16 years old.   Despite facing an uphill battle due to his age and being the only  minority at West Point, Moniac persevered. He went on to graduate in  the year 1822 as a brevet second lieutenant in the 6th U.S. Infantry  Regiment.   In 1836, Moniac answered the call of the U.S. military, to fight for  our Nation and aid the Army in the Second Seminole War occurring in  Florida. Moniac was named captain and proceeded to organize a unit of  Creek Volunteers from Alabama to serve. During the war, this impactful  Alabamian demonstrated true leadership as he commanded an assault on a  Seminole stronghold and earned a promotion to major in October 1836.  One month later, in November 1836, Major Moniac was killed by a musket  volley at the Battle of Wahoo Swamp while he was leading a charge of  Creek Volunteers. Moniac's death marked the end of the battle.   Major Moniac was laid to rest at a cemetery in Bushnell, FL, near the  site of the Battle of Wahoo Swamp. To remember his incredible courage  and bravery, the inscription on his grave marker states, ``He was as  brave and gallant a man as ever drew a sword or faced an enemy.''   On November 21, 2021, Governor Kay Ivey presented the Alabama  Distinguished Service Medal to Major Moniac's family at the Alabama  State Capitol. The Distinguished Service Medal recognizes exceptionally  meritorious service to the government in a duty of great  responsibility.   Today, we honor Major David Moniac for his impact and the  transformational change that he led as he paved the way for other  Native Americans to receive admission to West Point. His legacy  continues to make not only my home State of Alabama proud and grateful  for his leadership but our entire country. It is a privilege to honor  Major Moniac today in Congress 200 years later commemorating his  service and sacrifice.                            ____________________
