 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Prince  George's County Public Schools for achieving a record high school  graduation rate. Prince George's schools are living up to their motto  of being Great By Choice.   Eight schools have met the goal of graduating 90 percent of seniors  within 4 years, including three schools in the Fourth Congressional  District: Charles Herbert Flowers High School, DuVal High School, and  the Academy of Health Sciences at Prince George's Community College.   Many schools in the Fourth District, including Suitland, Potomac, and  Forestville high schools have demonstrated real progress, with  graduation rate gains of more than 4 percentage points.   Mr. Speaker, these gains have been made possible by the incredible  dedication of educators and parents who are focused on policies that  improve student success like expanding mentoring programs, effectively  using data to target student needs, and emphasizing core reading and  math skills.   Mr. Speaker, we must prepare students for successful lives and  careers once they graduate from high school. That is why I am committed  to working during this Congress to ensure every student has access to  rigorous, relevant, and results-driven career technology education  programs to equip them with the skills to succeed in the 21st century.                            ____________________
