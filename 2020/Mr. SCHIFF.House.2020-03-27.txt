 ``My fellow citizens, let no one doubt that this is a  difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out. No one can  foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties  will be incurred. Many months of sacrifice and self-discipline lie  ahead--months in which both our patience and our will will be tested,  months in which many threats and denunciations will keep us aware of  our danger.''  [[Page H1824]]    Mr. Speaker, these were the words of John F. Kennedy during the Cuban  Missile Crisis. They are equally true today. We cannot see what course  this virus will take, not precisely. Many months of sacrifice and self- discipline will lie ahead for the American people.   We will be tested, and we will prevail. America will rise to meet  this challenge or any other. Our healthcare workers already are. In  this bill, we give them the tools to do the job and we give families  the financial support they need to get by until this time of trial and  tribulation is over.   Let us support this bill and help put our people and our country on  the road to recovery.
