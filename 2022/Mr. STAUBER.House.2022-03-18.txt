 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the Hermantown boys  hockey team, the 2022 Class A Minnesota State hockey champions.   Minnesota is the State of hockey, and in northern Minnesota, hockey  is not just a proud tradition of ours; for  [[Page H3833]]  the players, coaches, families, and fans, it is truly a way of life.   It brings me great joy to see these athletes represent some of the  best parts of our great Eighth District as State champions.   This group of hardworking young players has shown what dedication,  passion, and unwavering commitment can accomplish. It is a true example  of American exceptionalism.   I also honor the coaches for being outstanding role models and  leaders to the Hawks this entire season. Head coach, Pat Andrews, and  assistant coaches: Nate Buck, Matt Swanson, and Chad Huttel guided the  team to not only the school's fourth State championship, but also a  winning season concluding with 29 wins with only 2 losses. The Hawks  secured the championship with an exciting 3-2 win over Warroad.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate every player, coach, and fan who lifted  the Hermantown Hawks to victory. They have made our district so proud,  and I wish every team member the best as they continue their hockey  careers.                            ____________________
