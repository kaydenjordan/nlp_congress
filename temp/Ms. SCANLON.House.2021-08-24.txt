 Madam Speaker, I rise today in enthusiastic support of  this rule and the underlying legislation.   H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, is essential  to ensuring that every American voter has equal access to the ballot  box, and the freedom to make his or her voice heard.   Ever since the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby v. Holder opened  the door, we have seen State legislatures pass hundreds of laws to  restrict voter access while claiming, falsely, to protect our elections  from voter fraud that doesn't even exist.   Now, the unjustified attacks on the 2020 election results by the  former President and his supporters have produced a wave of anti- democratic bills. But it doesn't have to be this way. In Shelby, the  Supreme Court invited Congress to amend the Voting Rights Act to  address its concerns.   For 8 years, our Republican colleagues refused the Court's invitation  to reinvigorate the Voting Rights Act, while extremist politicians  worked overtime to close polling locations, limit voting hours, purge  voter rolls, and erect barriers to the ballot box.                                time  1400    We can't continue down this path if we want America to remain a  functional democracy. Congress needs to do its job. I urge all of my  colleagues and all Americans to support this bill.   I would also like to speak briefly about the bipartisan  infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better Act, which today's vote  will move forward. Together, they are the key to helping Americans and  American businesses succeed in the 21st century.   Our country is facing multiple, interconnected crises: the COVID  pandemic, a deeply unequal economy, long-neglected infrastructure  needs, underfunded public services that often fail to serve those most  in need, and climate disasters that are impacting our communities more  often.   The Build Back Better agenda is simple: make major investments in  physical infrastructure and working families to create a fairer, more  productive, and sustainable economy.   We need the bipartisan infrastructure deal to enable America to  compete in the 21st century, but we also need the Build Back Better Act  to create jobs and lower costs and taxes for working families. These  bills have the power to improve the lives of millions of Americans.  [[Page H4364]]    Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule.    Madam Speaker, since the founding of our country, our  quest for a more perfect union has featured measures to expand, not  contract, the right to vote.   In 1965, activists, including a young John Lewis, put their lives on  the line to pass the original Voting Rights Act.   For decades, that law enjoyed broad bipartisan support, but in recent  years, State legislatures have passed hundreds of laws to restrict  voter access.   In 2020, our system held. It held because voters turned out in  overwhelming numbers. It held because election officials did their jobs  faithfully, regardless of party. It held because brave officers of the  U.S. Capitol and Metro Police defended our Constitution.   But let's be clear, the assault on voting rights continues, inspired  by corrupt and cynical efforts to hold power at all costs. We must do  our job to protect and reinforce our democratic system against these  new threats because it won't hold indefinitely.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Americans to hold the line to protect and  defend our democracy. I urge swift passage of the John R. Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act by the House and the Senate.
