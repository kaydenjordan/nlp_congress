 Madam President, in 1619, Africans were first brought to  Virginia, against their will, to be enslaved. From that moment on,  White Americans systematically and violently denied the rights of  citizenship to Black Americans. The adoption of the 15th Amendment,  ratified in February 1870, was a historic effort to correct course. It  recognized the right of all male citizens, including Black men, to  vote. This amendment was the first time that we promised to protect the  right of African Americans to full and equal participation in our  democracy.   In the 150 years since then, we have tried to expand on that promise  many times, like when women of all races and ethnicities finally won  the right to vote in 1920. Yet our promise remains elusively  unfulfilled. Today, in honor of Black History Month, I would like to  take a moment to discuss the trajectory of that broken promise, as well  as its impact on our character as a nation.   We began to break our promise shortly after we made it. During the  Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras, White men and women across the  country developed a number of techniques--some obvious and brutal, some  subtle and pernicious--to keep African Americans away from the polls  and out of government.   The broader goal of these tactics was to hamper the Black  population's ability to recover from slavery by blocking their access  to education and the economic means of building wealth.   I believe that it is important to acknowledge that Maryland partook  in these pernicious behaviors right alongside other States. Maryland  residents and government officials engaged in ballot tampering, imposed  literacy and property restrictions, stoked racist fears to galvanize  the White vote, and intimidated Black voters using outright violence.  [[Page S1144]]    My intention here is not to condemn my home State. To the contrary, I  am exceedingly proud of the struggles for justice that have bloomed in  Maryland through abolitionists like Harriet Tubman and Frederick  Douglas and civil rights leaders like Thurgood Marshall. I draw  inspiration from the lineage of African-American public servants in  Maryland who overcame enormous obstacles in order to amplify the voices  of their brothers and sisters.   These public servants include Verda Welcome, the first Black woman  ever elected to any State's senate, as well as Adrienne Jones, the  current speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates, who is the first  African American and first woman to serve in that position.   They also include my friend and hero, Congressman Elijah Cummings,  the son of sharecroppers who devoted his life to fighting for equality  and fairness and lifting up our beloved community of Baltimore.   I am likewise grateful for all of the Marylanders whose names we  might not know, but who nevertheless work every day to expand  educational equity, reform our justice system, shrink the wealth gap,  deliver healthcare, and otherwise make our society better. Thanks to  brave and dedicated people like these in Maryland and across the  country, we have made significant strides toward racial justice.   I began my remarks by discussing Maryland's bleaker moments in  history for two reasons. First, to demonstrate that we must never take  progress for granted--Maryland has not always been a tolerant,  inclusive State, it did not become one by accident, and it will not  continue to be one unless we work to make it so. Democracy and the rule  of law do not just happen; we need to protect and nourish them every  day.   Second, to illuminate how those injustices that still exist, of which  there are many, are not new and are not incidental--they are not just  disparate effects of forces beyond our control. They are deeply rooted  in policies and systems intentionally designed to subjugate African  Americans.   One of the strongest, most disheartening examples of this phenomenon  is the ongoing assault on the right to vote. This is not ancient  history. States all over the country continue to ``modernize''  strategies developed a century ago to suppress African-American voting  power. Some of these strategies are blatant and recognizable, like mass  purges of voter rolls; the gerrymandering of districts with ``surgical  precision,'' according to one court; and intimidation of Black voters.  Some of the strategies are disguised behind excuses or fear tactics,  like obstructive voter ID laws and felony disenfranchisement.   Regardless, these tools of oppression are alive and operating as  intended.   One in every 13 African Americans has lost his or her right to vote  because of felony disenfranchisement. Seventy percent of the voters  purged from one State's roll in 2018 were African Americans. Studies  reveal that implementing strict voter ID laws widens the Black-White  turnout gap by more than 400 percent.   So long as we allow these sorts of practices to continue under the  exaggeration of voter ``fraud,'' we are denying African Americans their  full right to vote and breaking the promise we made 150 years ago. This  is a problem on principle, of course, but also for practical reasons;  when we exclude people from fully participating in our democracy, we  prevent them from achieving the social, economic, and civic reforms  they need to strengthen their families and communities.   So what are we going to do about that? I know what I will do; I will  fight for laws that will guarantee every American a voice in our  democracy. That is why I have introduced bills to restore the Federal  right to vote to ex-offenders and to penalize the voter intimidation  and deception efforts so frequently aimed at people of color. These  measures alone will not eliminate suppression of the Black vote, but  they are steps in the right direction.   The racism that we vowed to root out a long time ago is still here.  We may have reined it in, or it may have taken new forms that we do not  recognize yet, but it is still here.   The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. remarked, ``It may be true  that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from  lynching me.'' It is true that we cannot legislate love, but we can and  must legislate equality.   Until we guarantee the right to vote regardless of race, we fall  short of the unique promise and potential of the United States of  America. How can we be, at last, the Shining City on the Hill, while we  continue to deny people their right to vote because of the color of  their skin?   For the sake of our democracy and our common humanity, for the sake  of those who have suffered and died, for the sake of those living and  those yet to come, let us make good on our 150-year-old promise.   Let us build on the progress we have achieved, and let us stay  vigilant about the threats that remain. Let us fulfill the right to  vote.                            ____________________     Madam President, I would like to take a few  moments to thank and congratulate Dr. Phoebe Stein for her lifetime  commitment to advancing the humanities. At the end of this week, Phoebe  will leave her post as the executive director at Maryland Humanities, a  position she has held for more than 11 years. But Maryland's loss is  the Nation's gain. Effective May 1, Phoebe will succeed Esther  Mackintosh as president of the Federation of State Humanities Councils.  The federation is the national member association of the 56 State and  jurisdictional humanities councils. The Federation's purpose is ``to  provide leadership, advocacy, and information to help members advance  programs that engage millions of citizens across diverse populations in  community and civic life.'' I can't think of anyone better suited for  the job.   Phoebe, a Maryland native, arrived at Maryland Humanities in 2008  after serving as the director of public affairs at the Illinois  Humanities Council, now called Illinois Humanities. She received her  B.A. in English from the University of Michigan and her M.A. and Ph.D.  in English from Loyola University of Chicago.   Phoebe has effectively advocated for the humanities at the local,  State, and Federal level for more than 20 years. Even though Phoebe  became executive director at Maryland Humanities at the beginning of  the Great Recession, she managed to expand the council's partnerships,  programs, staff, financial support and other resources, and, most  importantly, its reach. She hosted a radio spot, ``Humanities  Connection,'' while advancing several of the council's flagship  programs, including Maryland History Day, Museum on Main Street, and  One Maryland One Book. The organization now offers more than 1,000 free  events annually in partnership with more than 500 organizations in more  than 150 communities statewide.   Phoebe has brought Maryland History Day winners to meet with their  elected representatives at the Maryland State House and here at the  U.S. Capitol. She helped to foster a responsive environment following  the death of Freddie Gray in 2015 and launch a Humanities Fund for  Baltimore. She introduced student authors to author Chimamanda Ngozi  Adiche at One Maryland One Book events in 2017. Through it all, Phoebe  has been a joyful and indefatigable advocate, coming up to the Hill or  to Annapolis to lobby or traveling throughout Maryland to bring the  humanities to the people. In 2016, ``The Daily Record'' rightfully  recognized Phoebe as one of Maryland's Top 100 Women.   The National Endowment for the Humanities, NEH, provides funding to  State humanities councils through NEH's Federal/State Partnership  Office. The councils also receive funding from private donations,  foundations, corporations, and from the States themselves. This year,  we will celebrate the 55th anniversary of the NEH's creation. On  September 29, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the National  Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act into law. The act called  for the creation of the NEH and the National Endowment for the Arts,  NEA, as separate, independent agencies. More than 200 people filled the  Rose Garden for the bill signing ceremony, including Gregory Peck,  Dumas Malone, Ansel Adams, Ralph Ellison, Walter Gropius, and Paul  Mellon.   President Trump's fiscal year 2021 budget request once again  tendentiously proposes to terminate the NEH, the NEA, the Institute of  Museum and Library Services, and the Corporation for Public  Broadcasting. In previous years, Congress has ignored these proposals,  and I am optimistic we will do so again this year. I would note that  Federal funding for the NEH peaked in 1994 in nominal terms at $177.5  million; in inflation-adjusted terms--2019 dollars--Federal funding  peaked in 1979 at nearly three times its current level.   On a per capita basis, Federal funding for the NEH amounts to less  than the cost of a single postage stamp. That is a rather paltry  investment since, as author and essayist Mark Slouka wrote in his book,  ``Essays from the Nick of Time: Reflections and Refutations,'' ``[T]he  humanities are a superb delivery mechanism for what we might call  democratic values.'' He went on to say:         The case for the humanities is not hard to make, though it       can be difficult--to such an extent have we been       marginalized, so long have we acceded to that       marginalization--not to sound either defensive or naive. The       humanities, done right, are the crucible in which our       evolving notions of what it means to be fully human are put       to the test; they teach us, incrementally, endlessly, not       what to do, but how to be. Their method is confrontational,       their domain unlimited, their ``product'' not truth but the       reasoned search for truth, their ``success'' something very       much like Frost's momentary stay against confusion.    Phoebe Stein understands how important the humanities are to our  individual, collective, and civic well-being. While we Marylanders will  miss her at Maryland Humanities, all Americans are fortunate that she  will be heading the federation, where her passionate advocacy will  extend beyond Baltimore, the Eastern Shore, and the Cumberland Narrows  to redound to the benefit of people and communities across our  Nation.                            ____________________
