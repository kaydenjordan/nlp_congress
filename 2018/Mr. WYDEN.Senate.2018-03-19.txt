 Mr. President, in a few minutes the Senate will vote on  the nomination of Mr. Kevin McAleenan to serve as Commissioner of U.S.  Customs and Border Protection.   As the ranking Democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over trade  policy, I am particularly interested in working with Mr. McAleenan on  an issue that is of longstanding, bipartisan concern; and that is  tougher, smarter enforcement of America's trade laws.   Mr. McAleenan is a longtime public servant, and he has been aware  that the Finance Committee has put in many hours over the last few  years to guarantee that this agency has tough new tools to fight trade  cheats and protect our workers. It is vital that those tools be put to  good use because their trade-related mission--defending American jobs  from trade rip-offs--has too often gotten short shrift. It doesn't  matter what kind of trade deals you sign or what laws you put on the  books if you aren't serious about enforcing them. That is where their  trade mission comes in.   In my discussions with this nominee, it is clear that he understands  that when it comes to trade, this country has to do trade done right,  and tougher trade enforcement is especially important.   I will close with the mention of another issue that this agency has  seen over the last few months, and that is the onslaught of Americans  being stopped at the border and forced to unlock their personal  electronic devices for inspection. It clearly invades their personal  privacy.   Senator Paul and I have introduced bipartisan legislation on this-- there is bipartisan legislation in the other body--that recognizes that  law enforcement should have to get a warrant before searching a device  at the border, and it comes with strong protections to  [[Page S1780]]  let Americans know when and how they consent to having their devices  searched.   In my judgment, this is just common sense, particularly because the  U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that digital is fundamentally  different. They did that when they ruled that law enforcement needs a  warrant to search a phone after an arrest.   We are going to keep pushing for our bipartisan legislation. In the  meantime, we need to work with this agency on this critical issue that  ensures, once again, that this country recognizes that security and  liberty are not mutually exclusive and that you can have policies that  do both.   I want to continue to engage with him, if confirmed, to make sure  that the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans do not  disappear at the border.   As I indicated, he is a public servant with many, many years of  experience. I support his nomination.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
