 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to commend my colleagues for the  important work that everybody is doing down here on the Senate floor,  bipartisan work, addressing one of the most important challenges we  have as a nation. Not just today but for years this challenge is going  to be with us, and that is the challenge of dealing with the rise of  the Communist Party of China. That is going to be more and more of a  challenge and focus of the efforts of all elements of America's  economy, military, society.   And here is the good news. As you are seeing here, there is a lot of  focus, a lot of effort, and a lot of bipartisan work. It is a  democracy, a Republic, right? It is messy. It is not going to be  perfect. But, for the Chinese, I think the worst nightmare of the  Chinese Communist Party is to see Americans coming together and  recognizing that this is something we all need to work on together.   China's economy is growing. Their high-tech capability is growing.  Their military capability is growing. Their aggressiveness throughout  the region is growing.   Just look in the last year: Hong Kong; the disputes along the China- India border with India; the aggressiveness toward Taiwan; the economic  embargo, in many ways, against our ally Australia; Xinjiang Province;  the full discrimination against the Uighurs. And, of course, China is  now fully focused on exporting its authoritarian model abroad--not just  at home but abroad. But again, as I mentioned, the good news is that we  as a nation, we as a Senate, we as a Congress, Republicans and  Democrats, are starting to awaken to this challenge.    This is an issue I have been focused on since I came to the Senate  over 6 years ago. I think the previous administration, the Trump  administration, with their National Security Strategy, National Defense  Strategy, which said, hey, we know we have challenges with violent  extremists organizations, but we need to start shifting our focus to  great power competition with China as the pacing threat--that is where  we should be focused.   Those strategy documents--the National Defense Strategy, the National  Security Strategy--these were actually quite bipartisan documents,  quite bipartisan strategies. The National Defense Authorization Act,  which will be taken up here in a couple of months, in the last few  years has been built around this National Defense Strategy, focusing on  great power competition--China, Russia. So that is continuing. It is  actually continuing on the floor here in the U.S. Senate as we speak.   What I have been trying to do is work with Members on both sides of  the aisle--certainly with the Trump administration but also with the  Biden administration--as they address this challenge. I had some good  meetings with a number of senior officials in the administration, and  one takeaway I got from discussing these issues with the National  Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, was a comment he had made about how  when we were looking at our challenges with China, we need to think  about these in the way in which Dean Acheson, who was a very famous  Secretary of State, talked about the beginning of the Cold War with the  Soviet Union in the late 1940s; how America needs to be dealing with  the Soviet Union and that Cold War from situations of strength,  positions of strength. I thought that was a really insightful comment  by the current National Security Advisor.   So I want to mention a few of these because we have a lot of them  relative to China. Our comparative advantages, in my view, are much  greater than theirs in this competition that is going to, in my view,  last for decades. So let me name a few of these situations of strength.   First, our allies. The United States is an ally-rich nation. China is  an ally-poor nation and getting poorer by the day, by the way. Maybe  North Korea is one ally. Maybe Russia sometimes, but I don't really buy  it. So that is a huge comparative advantage that we have as a nation,  and we need to look at our system, our network of allies and deepen  them and expand them.   One area that that has happened with regard to our allies, really is  a cornerstone of our alliance system in Asia, is the continued focus on  what is called the Quad. The Quad is three of the biggest economies and  democracies in the whole world: the United States, Japan, India, and  Australia.   The Quad actually began in terms of a focus of strategy in the George  W. Bush administration. The Trump administration highlighted it even  more. To the Biden administration's credit, they took the Minister- level meetings that were the focus of the Trump administration's effort  with the Quad and took it to the leader level. President Biden met with  the leaders--India, Japan, Australia, and the United States--recently.  It is a very important development. The Quad can help anchor our  alliances in the Asia-Pacific and beyond in a very significant way. The  Chinese are constantly talking about it because they don't like it  because they know what it signifies.   So that is one area of strength, situation of strength that I think  all of us can agree on, and I think Members of this body can certainly  help play a role   As we look to head into a work session, I am going to head to the  Asia-Pacific with some of my Senate colleagues here--Senator Duckworth,  Senator Coons, and maybe a few others--and we are going to help build  on this important comparative advantage that we have as a nation-- allies. We are an ally-rich nation. China is ally-poor. The more  aggressive they are acting in the region, the more this situation of  strength is going to play to our advantage.   Let me give you another situation of strength for the United States,  particularly as it relates to China. It is a huge  [[Page S3875]]  position of strength. It is our energy sector, the all-above energy  sector for America--I mean renewables, oil, natural gas. This is an  area that for decades we have tried to become energy independent. We  have tried to return to the status we had during World War II, which  was the world's energy superpower in terms of the production of energy.   The good news on that is we have returned to that. Prior to the  pandemic, the United States had once again become the world's energy  superpower--a lot of people thought we could never achieve that again,  but we have--the largest producer of natural gas in the world, bigger  than Russia; largest producer of oil in the world, bigger than Saudi  Arabia; largest producer of renewables in the world. This is really  good for our economy. It is really good for jobs. It is really good for  our national security and foreign policy. And yes, it is really good  for our environment.   Why is that? I know some people don't like the production of energy  in America, but here is a fact: We need energy, ``all of the above''  energy. My State has it all, all the things that I just mentioned--oil,  gas, renewables. We have an enormous abundance in Alaska.   But here is the other fact: We produced these energy opportunities,  we produced this energy in America with a higher environmental standard  than any other place on the planet. That is a fact. That is a fact. So  if we need energy, which we do, ``all of the above'' energy, which we  do, we need to make sure we are producing it in a place with the  highest standards, in a place that will employ American people workers.  By the way, energy jobs are great jobs.   Here is one other thing. You look at the intel. You talk to people  who know the region. The Communist Party in China recognizes this  comparative advantage, and it scares the living daylight out of them  because they are very energy dependent, and we have literally become,  through the hard work and ingenuity of so many in our great Nation,  energy independent.   By the way, not only has this helped our environment, it has helped  with regard to greenhouse gas emissions. From 2005 to 2017, the United  States reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by almost 15 percent--15  percent. You don't hear that often, but it is a fact--more than any  other industrialized nation in the world.   China was going like this. Still is. By the way, right now, the  latest numbers on greenhouse gas emissions--China is producing more  than the United States, the EU, and India combined. That is also a  fact.   So we have reduced global greenhouse gas emissions dramatically. Why?  We all know why. It was the revolution and the production of American  natural gas. That is a fact. That is a fact.   So if we want to grow our economy, have an enormous comparative  advantage relative to China and adversaries like Russia, produce more  good-paying jobs, protect our environment, and enhance our national  security and foreign policy, continuing the production of ``all of the  above'' energy, which we are going to need for decades, is something  that we should be doing.   Now, some in the Biden administration understand this. Others don't  and want to restrict production of American energy, and when those  people speak, guys like John Kerry, the leaders in China and Russia are  smiling. They are smiling.   Fortunately, this legislation here, the Endless Frontier Act, is  focused on outcompeting the Chinese, all of us coming together and  outcompeting them in many different areas--artificial intelligence,  quantum computing, and, yes, energy as well.   Specifically, what is in the bill is called advanced energy and  industrial efficiency technologies, advanced energy technologies. That  is in the legislation.   Again, I think it is here because we recognize what a critical,  comparative advantage we have relative to China in this sector, so we  want to take advantage of it. It is in the legislation.   Advanced energy technology is not defined in this bill, but that is  because the Congress has been abundantly clear on what this means. In  my discussions with Senators and, more importantly, what the Congress  has passed a number of times, advanced energy technology means what it  states in the definition of a law unanimously passed in the Senate and  in the House just two Congresses ago, 42 USC 18632. It actually has the  definition of advanced energy technology, which is what is the focus of  this bill, the Endless Frontier Act.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 42 USC 18632 be printed  in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  42 U.S.C. 18632: Energy Innovation Hubs         Text contains those laws in effect on May 27, 2021       Sec. 18632. Energy Innovation Hubs         (a) Definitions        In this section:        (1) Advanced energy technology        The term ``advanced energy technology'' means--        (A) an innovative technology--        (i) that produces energy from solar, wind, geothermal,       biomass, tidal, wave, ocean, or other renewable energy       resources;        (ii) that produces nuclear energy;        (iii) for carbon capture and sequestration;        (iv) that enables advanced vehicles, vehicle components,       and related technologies that result in significant energy       savings;        (v) that generates, transmits, distributes, uses, or stores       energy more efficiently than conventional technologies,       including through Smart Grid technologies; or        (vi) that enhances the energy independence and security of       the United States by enabling improved or expanded supply and       production of domestic energy resources, including coal, oil,       and natural gas;        (2) Hub        (A) In general        The term ``Hub'' means an Energy Innovation Hub established       under this section.        (B) Inclusion        The term ``Hub'' includes any Energy Innovation Hub in       existence on September 28, 2018.        (3) Qualifying entity        The term ``qualifying entity'' means-        (A) an institution of higher education;        (B) an appropriate State or Federal entity, including a       federally funded research and development center of the       Department;        (C) a nongovernmental organization with expertise in       advanced energy technology research, development,       demonstration, or commercial application; or        (D) any other relevant entity the Secretary determines       appropriate.        (b) Authorization of program        (1) In general        The Secretary shall carry out a program to enhance the       economic, environmental, and energy security of the United       States by making awards to consortia for establishing and       operating hubs, to be known as ``Energy Innovation Hubs'', to       conduct and support, at, if practicable, one centralized       location, multidisciplinary, collaborative research,       development, demonstration, and commercial application of       advanced energy technologies.        (2) Technology development focus        The Secretary shall designate for each Hub a unique       advanced energy technology or basic research focus.        (3) Coordination        The Secretary shall ensure the coordination of, and avoid       unnecessary duplication of, the activities of each Hub with       the activities of--        (A) other research entities of the Department, including       the National Laboratories, the Advanced Research Projects       Agency-Energy, and Energy Frontier Research Centers; and        Each Hub shall maintain conflict of interest procedures,       consistent with the conflict of interest procedures of the       Department.        (4) Prohibition on construction        (A) In general        Except as provided in subparagraph (B)--        (i) no funds provided under this section may be used for       construction of new buildings or facilities for Hubs; and        (ii) construction of new buildings or facilities shall not       be considered as part of the non-Federal share of a Hub cost-      sharing agreement.        (B) Test bed and renovation exception        Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the use of funds       provided under this section or non-Federal cost share funds       for the construction of a test bed or renovations to existing       buildings or facilities for the purposes of research if the       Secretary determines that the test bed or renovations are       limited to a scope and scale necessary for the research to be       conducted.        (Pub. L. 115-246, title II, Sec. 206, Sept. 28, 2018, 132       Stat. 3137.)     The definition of advanced energy technology, which is  in the bill, the Endless Frontier Act, and is defined in 42 USC 18632  is along the following lines. It says ``Definitions,'' ``advanced  energy technology'' means an ``innovative technology that produces  energy from solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, tidal, wave, ocean, or  other renewable energy.''   That is important for our country. It goes on to say ``that produces  nuclear energy''--that is important for our country--``for carbon  capture and sequestration.'' Again, a critical comparative advantage.  ``That enables advanced vehicles, vehicle components,  [[Page S3876]]  and related technologies that result in significant energy savings.''  Again, important.   And it also says ``that enhances the energy independence and security  of the United States by enabling improved or expanded supply and  production of domestic energy resources, including coal, oil, and  natural gas.''   That is in the definition of advanced energy technologies, and that  is the definition that was passed two Congresses ago, unanimously, and  that is why it has not been defined here because it has already been  defined in this.   Congress is very clear on what advanced energy technology means in  the Endless Frontier Act. That is a huge comparative advantage, as I  mentioned, oil, gas, renewables. And that is an important element of  this legislation in our competition with China, and I am glad that is  recognized.   One final area of what, again, the current administration's National  Security Advisor called a situation of strength relative to China, and  that, of course, is our military. To be honest, this is where I am  worried.   The second term of the Obama-Biden administration cut defense  spending by 25 percent. That is actually one of the reasons I ran for  the Senate. I never ran for anything, but what I saw what was happening  to the U.S. military--an institution I love and I served in for over 25  years--that was enough motivation for me to say I need to help do  something. The readiness of our forces during that era, the second term  of the Obama-Biden administration--the readiness of our forces  plummeted--plummeted. And our adversaries in Moscow and Beijing watched  this and were gleeful.   We can talk about AI and everything else that we are talking about in  this bill, but if we are gutting our military, that is one of the worst  things we can do with regard to sending a message to China about our  seriousness. I worry.   Last year on this floor--last summer--we had a big debate in the NDAA  over defense spending. The majority leader--who was then the minority  leader--and the Senator from Vermont, Senator Sanders, put forward an  amendment they called--no kidding--``defund the Pentagon'' then. That  was the name of their amendment, with 14 percent across-the-board cuts  to the entire U.S. military. My response was: There they go again.  There they go again.   Well, now that they regained power, it looks like this movie is  coming to a theater near us again, and it is not going to be nice.  Tomorrow, the Biden administration's budget is going to be coming out.  The numbers that we are anticipating are about a 16-percent increase in  domestic spending and a real decrease in military spending--inflation- adjusted decrease in military spending again. Beijing will be watching  this and will be gleeful.   When Republicans were in the White House and the Senate majority just  recently, we were respectful of our colleagues in the minority, and  there was an agreement essentially about a one-for-one, domestic  programs increasing and the military budget is going to increase by  about the same amount. That is what we all agreed on here. That is what  we worked on here. Now, it looks like it is going to be 16-for-1 or  maybe even worse. This is something we really need to focus on.   Make no mistake, we can talk about supply chains, intellectual  property, competitiveness, which is what we are talking about here with  this legislation. These are all important topics. But all the policy  changes that we are debating here right now are not going to amount to  much in our overall competition with respect to China if we lose our  military edge with respect to China.   Unfortunately, some of my colleagues just don't recognize that or  don't want to recognize that. Soft power isn't much good without hard  power to back it up. We learned that lesson before. It has been a  painful lesson, if you look at our history.   But the Chinese Communist Party certainly appears to understand this.  According to one watchdog, it has increased its military investments by  76 percent over the last decade, and we are going to put out a budget  tomorrow with an inflation-adjusted decrease in our military spending,  despite the runaway domestic spending proposed by this administration.  That is worrisome, and that is not operating from a position of  strength with regard to the Chinese Communist Party. We need to watch  out for that one. I am very concerned.   Yes, there is a lot of bipartisan work going on in the Senate, but if  the leadership on the Senate floor and the House leadership as well and  the Biden administration work together to cut defense spending, that is  going to be one of the worst things we can do for our long-term  competition with regard to China.   As we are focused on these challenges with the rise of China, let me  conclude by predicting that not only is this challenge going to be with  us for decades, but how we need to address it. I have talked about some  of these situations of strength. We must face this challenge with  confidence and strategic resolve.   As I have noted and I just talked about a few, America has  extraordinary advantages relative to China: our global network of  alliances, our military power, and economic leadership, our innovative  society, our abundant and innovative energy supplies, advanced energy  technology as defined in this bill and other bills, the world's most  productive workforce, and a democratic value system.   Yes, it can be messy, but that makes countries around the world, and  particularly in the INDOPACOM region, far more comfortable as American  partners and allies than as subservient members of a New Middle Kingdom  led by China. As a result of the long twilight struggle with the Soviet  Union, we also know what works: maintaining peace through strength,  promoting free markets and free people at home, and having the  confidence in George Kennan's insights when he set forth the strategy  of containment in the late forties to deal with the Soviet Union--that  the Chinese Communist Party, like the Soviet Communist Party, likely  bears within it the seeds of its own decay. While democracies are  resilient, adaptive, and self-renewing, there are many vulnerabilities  embedded in Chinese's perceived strength.   One-man rule creates acute political risks. Historical grievance can  bring violent nationalism. State-directed economic growth can produce  massive overcapacity and mountains of debt, and the gradual snuffing  out of freedom that we are literally seeing daily in places like Hong  Kong sends fear throughout the entire region.   China's budding military power and historical view of itself as a  natural and cultural superior to many others is beginning to alarm  neighboring states, inspiring them to want to step up security  cooperation with the United States, not with China. Nearly half of  wealthy Chinese want to emigrate. Remember, these are the winners from  China's four decades of heady economic growth.   As we have in the past, we can prevail in this geopolitical and  ideological contest, but doing so will require a new level of strategic  initiative, organization, and confidence in who we are as a people and  what we stand for. This also means that we must redouble our efforts in  making this strategic case to others around the world, particularly our  allies. This kind of work here--although it can be messy, although it  can be difficult, although it can be challenging--is part of the  process we need to put together to compete.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
