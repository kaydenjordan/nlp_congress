 Madam Speaker, when the news of Justice Ginsburg's  passing broke, the first text I received was from my daughter, quickly  followed by messages from female friends and family from every phase of  my life. The immediate outpouring of tributes was a natural and  authentic testament to the Justice's outsized impact on American women  over the last half century.   Justice Ginsburg carried the torch for us for justice, for women's  rights, and, even as tiny and soft-spoken as she was, as a voice for  the voiceless. She broke barriers; she changed the status quo; and she  never stopped pushing our country to become a more perfect Union.   In so doing, she became a source of intergenerational inspiration and  a pop culture icon. But that intergenerational inspiration was a two- way street. I am reminded of one of the last times I heard her speak.   After making her remarks, a college student asked the Justice: What  gives you hope?   The Justice said: What gives me hope is the number of women running  for office and the activism of younger generations, because from what I  have seen, they will be the ones to effect change.   We must have the courage to pass on a better nation to our children  and our grandchildren. Justice Ginsburg's words are a reminder, as we  serve the people's House, as we manage this challenging time, as we  prepare to vote in this election, that what each of us does matters and  what we don't do matters.   May we never stop learning from Justice Ginsburg, and may her memory  be a blessing to our country.                            ____________________
