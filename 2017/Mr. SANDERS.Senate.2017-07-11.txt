 Mr. President, my staff recently had the pleasure  of visiting with Jen Kimmich of The Alchemist Brewery in Stowe, VT.   The Alchemist owners Jen and John Kimmich are model employers who  have shown considerable dedication toward creating positive working  conditions for their employees. Their workers receive excellent  benefits and working conditions, including livable wages, paid sick  days, vacation time, health insurance, wellness opportunities, paid  family leave, and generous retirement benefits. The Alchemist not only  produces an internationally award-winning product, but it has also  fostered a workplace culture where people are put before profits.   Further, I would like to thank Jen for her statewide leadership  championing workers' rights. She serves on the State Workforce  Development Board helping to create opportunities for good jobs in  Vermont. Through her volunteer work with Main Street Alliance, Jen has  advocated for paid sick leave and paid family leave legislation.   I also commend the company for developing The Alchemist Foundation.  [[Page S3917]]  The Foundation provides college scholarships and career pathway  opportunities for area youth.   I am grateful for all that they do for their employees, their  community, and the entire State of Vermont. Companies across the Nation  should follow in The Alchemist's footsteps by supporting workers'  rights and creating a positive workplace.                            ____________________     Mr. President, let me be as clear as I can be. The so- called healthcare bill that passed in the House of Representatives  several months ago, strongly supported by President Trump, is the most  anti-working-class legislation that I have ever seen. The Senate bill,  also supported by Mr. Trump, in some respects is even worse.   At a time when working families in Vermont and all across this  country are working longer hours for low wages--many people in my own  State are working two or three jobs just to bring in enough income to  maintain a family--this legislation will cause devastating harm to  millions of our families from one end of America to the other.   The American people are united. This weekend I was in West Virginia  and Kentucky--so-called conservative States--but I tell you that what  is true there, what is true in Vermont, and what is true all over this  country is that the American people are standing up and saying loudly  and clearly that we will not allow 22 million Americans to be thrown  off of the health insurance they currently have in order to give over  $500 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest 2 percent, to the drug  companies, to the insurance companies, and to other profitable  corporations. We will not support a bill that takes from the most  vulnerable people in our country--the children, the elderly, the  disabled, the sick, and the poor--in order to make the very, very rich  even richer. This is unconscionable, un-American, and the American  people will not accept it.   Plainly stated, this so-called healthcare bill is really nothing more  than a massive transfer of wealth from the working families of this  country to the very rich. While this bill contains massive cuts to  Medicaid; while seniors will pay far, far more in premiums; while  Planned Parenthood will be defunded, the 400 highest income taxpayers,  most of whom are billionaires, will get about $33 billion in tax cuts.    There is no State in this country--none, not the most conservative-- that thinks that you throw 22 million people off of health insurance,  including disabled children, in order to give $33 billion in tax breaks  to the wealthiest 400 Americans. At a time when so many people in  America are struggling, the very wealthy are already doing phenomenally  well. They do not need more tax breaks.   Not only is this bill a disaster, but the secretive, backroom process  by which it has been written is unprecedented and literally beyond  belief. That is not just me speaking; I think a number of my Republican  colleagues who disagree with me on everything make that point as well.  This bill impacts one-sixth of our economy--over $3 trillion--and by  definition, dealing with healthcare, it impacts virtually every  American. Yet the discussions and negotiations on this legislation have  never been made public. In fact, I suspect they are going on right  now--not here on the floor but behind closed doors.   Unbelievably, with legislation that would completely revamp our  healthcare system, there have been no doctors, no nurses, no hospital  administrators, no representatives of senior citizens, no experts on  the opioid crisis--which is sweeping our country--who have testified in  public about the impact this legislation will have in our country. How  can one possibly dream of drafting a bill of such enormous magnitude  without hearing one public comment from the most knowledgeable people  in America with regard to healthcare?   How can you possibly go forward without one public hearing where  Senators have the opportunity--Democrats, progressives, Independents-- to ask questions? But that is precisely the process this legislation  has gone through.   I fully understand there are a lot of people who will say: Well, big  surprise, Bernie Sanders, a strong progressive, opposes this Republican  bill. What else is new?   But I want you all to understand that it is not just Bernie Sanders  or Democrats here who oppose this legislation; this legislation is  opposed by virtually every major healthcare organization in the United  States.   I am not quite sure how we can go forward with major legislation  impacting one-sixth of the economy, opposed by every major healthcare  organization in the country, and not have one hearing. I am not quite  sure how that can be done, but that is precisely what the Republican  leadership here is doing.   It is not just Bernie Sanders who opposes this legislation. It is the  AARP, which is the largest senior group in America. It is the American  Medical Association. Hey, those are our doctors. When you get sick, you  go  [[Page S3928]]  to a doctor. Many of them are members of the American Medical  Association. They say this bill is a disaster. It is not just doctors.  It is nurses. It is hospital administrators. It is the American Cancer  Society, the American Heart Association, the American Academy of Family  Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American  Psychiatric Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, the  Catholic Health Association, the American Lung Association, the Cystic  Fibrosis Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National MS Society, and  the American Nurses Association, among many other organizations that  oppose this bill being written behind closed doors.   Several months ago, as I think everybody knows, with the strong  support of President Trump, the House passed their disastrous  healthcare bill. Now, we know what is in the House bill. The Senate  bill probably is being worked on as we speak, so we don't know what is  in that exactly, but let me tell my colleagues what the House bill  does. At a time when 28 million Americans today--before the Republican  bill--have no health insurance and millions more are underinsured, with  high deductibles and copayments, this bill from the House will throw  another 23 million Americans off of the health insurance they currently  have.   Think about it. Gee, if we have 28 million Americans off of health  insurance, what most Americans would say is: OK, how do we lower that  number? In fact, the Affordable Care Act added another 20 million  people to the ranks of the insured. This bill throws 23 million on top  of the 28 million we currently have uninsured, almost doubling the  uninsured in America to over 50 million people. Think about it. People  have a hard time even beginning to believe that legislation that is  being seriously debated would almost double the number of uninsured in  America.   Everybody understands--there is no debate about this--that the  Affordable Care Act is far, far from perfect. This is a point I have  been making from the day the Affordable Care Act was passed. Premiums  in my State of Vermont and around this country are too high,  deductibles are too high, copayments are too high, and too many  Americans remain uninsured or underinsured. But in each and every one  of these legitimate concerns, the Republican legislation that has been  brought forward and passed in the House would only make a bad situation  much worse.   The Republicans say: Oh, the Affordable Care Act is a bad piece of  legislation. It has problems. The Affordable Care Act does have  problems. Their legislation exacerbates every single one of the  problems that it has.   So our job today, and I think what the average American understands-- OK, we have problems. What are the problems? We have listened.  Deductibles are too high. Copayments are too high. Premiums are too  high. Prescription drug prices are way too high. OK. Let's discuss it.  What is your idea? How do we deal with these problems? That is what the  American people want. The American people want us to address  the problems that are in the Affordable Care Act, not destroy it.    It seems to me clearly that our job right now--and the American  people are rising up. They are not going to accept this Republican  legislation. Together we are going to defeat it.   I wish to speak for a moment about what it means if this legislation  were to pass. What are the implications of throwing 22 million people-- that is the Senate bill--off of health insurance, and 23 million people  in the House bill? Let me tell my colleagues. I want every American to  think about this. Just think about it. Think about somebody today who  has cancer and is maybe in chemotherapy or maybe in radiation, somebody  who has heart disease, somebody who has diabetes or some other life- threatening disease. There are God knows how many people in this  country right now who are sick. What happens if they lose their health  insurance? A simple question. You have cancer, you are getting  treatment today, and the Republican bill takes away your health  insurance. What happens to you when you cannot afford to go to the  doctor when you feel a lump in your breast or when you have problems  with your heart? What happens to you if you have a heart attack or a  stroke and need significant care, but you have no health insurance and  you don't have the money to pay for the outrageously high cost of care?   Here is the horrible and unspeakable truth that has to be brought out  into the open; that is, if this legislation were to pass, many  thousands of our fellow Americans would die, and many more would suffer  and become much sicker than they should. Now, I am not suggesting that  there is anybody in this body who wants to see anybody die  unnecessarily. Nobody does. But people have to take responsibility for  their actions, and if you throw 23 million people off of health  insurance, many of whom might have life-threatening illnesses,  thousands of people will die.   Several weeks ago I was on a television program, and I said just  that, and then right after that, I was criticized by Republicans and  rightwing critics: Why did you say that? What a terrible thing. Why are  you frightening the American people? ``Some people will die''--that is  not true.   Well, PolitiFact is a nonpartisan organization that checks out what  public officials say, and they took a look at well over 10 different  studies on the issue of mortality rates and lack of insurance coverage.  That is what they studied. They looked at more than 10 different  studies looking at mortality rates and lack of healthcare coverage.  What PolitiFact concluded is that the point that I made--that many  thousands will die--is well supported. It is not Bernie Sanders. I am  not coming up with some idea off the top of my head. This is what many,  many medical and scientific studies have told us.   Obviously nobody can predict exactly how many people will die if 23  million people lose their health coverage, but what experts at the  Harvard School of Public Health estimate is that if 23 million people  are thrown off of health insurance, as the House bill does, up to  28,000 people could die each and every year--28,000 people. That is  nine times more than the tragic loss of life we suffered on 9/11, and  that would take place each and every year. In the wealthiest country in  the history of the world, we must not allow that to happen.   This bill would impact the children, many of whom are covered by the  CHIP program, covered by Medicaid. You tell me what happens to a kid  who has a disability right now and whose family receives Medicaid. Some  of those children may have Down syndrome. Some of those children may  have cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, maybe autism. They may have  mental health needs, such as depression or anxiety, or complications  from premature birth. Today, Medicaid and CHIP cover 5 million--or 44  percent--of those kids, providing them with coverage so that they can  live with dignity and security.   But it is not just the children who will be impacted, it is also the  elderly. What every person in America should understand--and many do  not--is that Medicaid now pays for over two-thirds of all nursing home  care. So I ask my Republican friends: What happens when you slash  Medicaid? Who will pay for somebody's mom or dad in a nursing home  dealing with Alzheimer's disease? How many seniors in this nursing home  will get thrown out on the street or be forced to live in their  children's basement? Well, we don't know the answer to that. We haven't  had any hearings. We haven't heard any people testify to that. But I  think we will see a whole lot of families disrupted, having to make the  choice about whether to take care of their parents or provide for their  kid to go to college.   It is not just nursing home care. What happens if you are just an  older worker. Maybe you are 60 years of age. Well, the likelihood is  that if you are a 60-, 62-year-old worker, the cost of your premiums is  going to soar. Again, this is not Bernie Sanders' view; it is what the  AARP says.   This is a quote from the AARP from June 22:         This new Senate bill was crafted in secrecy behind closed       doors without a single hearing or open debate--and it shows.       The Senate bill would hit millions of Americans with higher       costs and result in less coverage for them.        AARP is adamantly opposed to the Age Tax, which will allow       insurance companies to charge older Americans five times more       for coverage than everyone else while reducing tax credits       that help make insurance more affordable.    That is the AARP.   What about the opioid epidemic, which is hitting my State of Vermont  hard and hitting States all over this  [[Page S3929]]  country? Each and every day, more than 90 people in America die from an  opioid overdose. Can you believe that? Ninety people die every single  day. Nearly 4,000 people begin abusing prescription painkillers, and  about 600 start using heroin. We have a major, major crisis in opioid  addiction and heroin overdoses.   It turns out that if you cut Medicaid by $800 billion, which is what  the Republicans are talking about, our ability to address the opioid  crisis will be severely curtailed. At a time when we should be  expanding prevention efforts, expanding treatment efforts, the  Republican bill will make it much harder for us to deal with the opioid  crisis.   This legislation is not what the American people want. I understand  that the Republican leader today suggested that Members of the Senate  may have to stay here for a few more weeks in August, and I can  understand that. If I were the Republican leader, I would not want my  Senators to go home to hear what the American people have to say about  this legislation.   The truth is, poll after poll shows overwhelming opposition to this  disastrous legislation. According to the latest USA TODAY/Suffolk  University Poll, just 12 percent of the American people support the  Republican bill.   As a matter of fact, according to a recent report, this is the most  unpopular piece of legislation in the last three decades. It is more  unpopular than the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street. That is pretty  unpopular. The American people are catching on as to what is in this  bill, and they do not want to see it.   Let me conclude by saying what is as obvious as can be. It is what  the American people want. Are there problems with the Affordable Care  Act? Absolutely. Premiums are too high, deductibles too high,  copayments too high, prescription drug prices are off the charts.   Let's deal with it. What is the problem? Let's deal with it. Put it  on the table, and let us address those problems. The American people  want to improve the Affordable Care Act, not destroy it.   Let me now, speaking for myself only, say this. I hope very much  there can be bipartisan efforts to improve the Affordable Care Act, but  I happen to believe we have to go further than that. I intend to help  lead that effort.   In my view, there is something profoundly wrong when the United  States of America is the only major country on Earth--the only one-- that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people as a right, while at  the same time we spend far more per capita on healthcare. We spend far  more per capita on prescription drugs, and our healthcare outcomes are  not particularly good compared to many other countries.   I think the time is long overdue as to why we do not ask ourselves:  How is it Canada can guarantee healthcare to all people, the UK can do  it, Germany can do it, France can do, Scandinavia can do it? Every  major country on Earth recognizes that healthcare must be a right, not  a privilege.   I happen to agree with that. That is why I will--as soon as this  debate is over and as soon as, hopefully, we defeat this disastrous  Republican legislation--introduce a Medicare-for-all, single-payer  bill, which will in fact guarantee healthcare to all of our people in a  cost-effective way.   Let me conclude by saying that the current Republican bill in front  of us is a moral outrage. There are very few people in America who  think you should throw 22 million of our people off of health insurance  in order to give huge tax breaks to billionaires. This is a moral  outrage, and it must be defeated. I will do everything in my power to  see that it is defeated.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, like many of our colleagues during the  Fourth of July break, I spent much of my time crisscrossing the State  of Maryland. On the Fourth of July, I attended many parades. The very  first parade of that day was in a part of Maryland outside of Baltimore  City, called Dundalk, MD, where Donald Trump had done very well in the  past election.   What I found during that parade was a lot of people there who were  still supportive of President Trump but not one person at that parade  who was in favor of TrumpCare or the Senate Republican so-called  healthcare bill--not one.   I was listening to the Senator from Vermont about the most recent  polling. The polling I had seen previously had shown 17 percent of the  American people in favor of this, which was very low. I am not  surprised to hear it is even lower now at 12 percent because my own  personal experience in these places in Maryland that had been  supportive of Donald Trump, and in many ways still are, were that they  were not in favor of this healthcare bill. In many ways, they had felt  betrayed by it.   After all, during the last campaign, Donald Trump said he wasn't  going to cut Medicaid, and yet the bill before us has dramatic cuts to  Medicaid. In fact, the Senate bill has even deeper cuts to Medicaid  over time than the House bill.   We all remember the House bill. President Trump had a great  celebration in the Rose Garden in public, but behind closed doors he  called it mean. Yet the Senate bill, when it comes to Medicaid cuts,  will make them even deeper over a period of time, according to the  report issued by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office, just as we all left town for the Fourth of  July break.   It was an interesting experience to hear people, on the one hand,  saying let's find ways to work together on many of the challenges we  have in this country--and we should find ways to work together--but are  strongly opposed to the healthcare bill that is before the Senate right  now. The reason is, they are paying attention. They are concluding  about this bill the same thing that the AMA, the American Medical  Association, has concluded. In opposing this bill, America's doctors  say it violates the No. 1 principle of medicine, which is: First, do no  harm. That is the Hippocratic Oath. This Senate so-called healthcare  violates that very simple proposition. At the very least, we want a  healthcare system that doesn't do greater harm than what would  otherwise be flawless. Yet we know, from this legislation, in looking  at it, that it does do great harm to our healthcare system in the  United States of America.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has looked at it and  concluded that if you pass this legislation, 22 million fewer Americans  will have access to affordable care than if you don't pass the bill. So  it does harm compared to where we are today.   It is absolutely true that the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. In  fact, the healthcare exchanges specifically can be improved. We need  more choices. We need more competition there. Make no mistake, the  Senate Republican bill and the bill that passed the House don't improve  the Affordable Care Act. They destroy those parts of it that are  working and have been of great benefit to tens of millions of  Americans.   The Congressional Budget Office also tells us that premiums will go  up next year. The Congressional Budget Office also tells us that if you  are a senior between the ages of 50 and 64, you are in for a walloping  increase in your premiums, which of course is what the AARP calls the  age tax and why they are on the warpath against this legislation-- because it will be greatly damaging to those seniors who are in the  individual market who are now going to have to pay huge increases in  premiums. Those have been documented by the nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office.   I would remind my colleagues that the head of the Congressional  Budget Office was someone selected by the Republican chairman of the  Senate Budget Committee and the Republican chairman of the House Budget  Committee, and the CBO is our referee in this place.   If we all could make up our own facts, which in many cases the  debates go in those directions anyway, it would be an even more unruly  place. At least we have the CBO to provide that analysis. It is not  just the CBO. This is masquerading as a healthcare bill.   I ask the question of my colleagues, Why is it that every single  patient advocacy group that has weighed in on this bill has weighed in  against this bill? These are not Democratic organizations or Republican  organizations:  [[Page S3930]]  the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the  American Diabetes Association, the National Association on Mental  Illness, National Breast Cancer Coalition, the National Multiple  Sclerosis Society, the Alzheimer's Association. These are our  constituents.   They don't wake up every morning thinking about a Democratic plan or  Republican plan or Independent plan. These are organizations dedicated  to patient health. They are all against a bill that is parading as a  healthcare bill.   How can that be the case, that every single advocacy group that has  weighed in on this bill that has a healthcare mandate and is  nonpartisan is against it?   I ask my Republican colleagues to go back to the drawing board. This  is not a healthcare bill, not when every single patient advocacy group  weighed in against it, not when nonpartisan analysis tells us that 22  million people will lose out, not when the American Medical Association  says it violates this simple principle of, first, do not harm.   It is not just the doctors. It is the nurses. It is the hospitals. It  is the National Rural Health Association. I spent a good amount of time  in rural Maryland over the Fourth of July break. Rural hospitals are  terrified of the consequences of this legislation, not just because of  the harm that will befall their patients because their patients will be  denied access to affordable care--but when they no longer have patients  who are covered by insurance who come through their doors and there is  an emergency so they provide that care anyway, then the hospital all of  a sudden is not getting paid for the care it provides. They are deathly  afraid they are going to have to scale back their operations and lay  off people in a lot of these rural hospitals.   I really hope and believe this is a moment where the Senate can look  at this situation and decide let's not go down this road because the  American people are asking themselves why are we doing this. It is one  of those cases where I think people sort of lost track of why, other  than the fact that, as many have said today, there had been this call  to get rid of ObamaCare, to get rid of the Affordable Care Act but  never a lot of thought as to what was going to replace it.   Now what we are learning is the proposals that would supposedly  replace it will do harm. They will do a lot more harm than the place we  are at today. Rather than do harm and hurt tens of millions of  Americans, let's find a way to improve the current system. There are  practical ideas for how we can improve the healthcare exchanges, the  marketplaces within the Affordable Care Act. Many of us have put  forward ideas, and I would be more than happy to explore with our  colleagues ways we can improve upon those exchanges without doing harm.   When you look at this legislation and you realize it is not about  healthcare, you have to ask yourself: What is it about other than  simply saying we are going to fulfill this pledge of getting rid of the  Affordable Care Act? At its core, there are two pillars to this bill.  They are rotten pillars, but that is what they are. One is these very  dramatic cuts to Medicaid, very dramatic. As I said, the Senate cuts  even deeper over a longer period of time than the House bill. In the  Senate bill, that cut is around $770 billion, and then there are also  cuts to tax credits that help more Americans afford healthcare. So if  you cut Medicaid, you get rid of tax credits that make healthcare more  affordable. On the other side of the ledger is this whopping tax cut--  whopping tax cut that goes to some very powerful special interests and  some very wealthy individuals. Many of us heard Warren Buffett a couple  of weeks ago on TV saying: I don't need a $670,000-a-year tax cut as  part of a bill that is going to put the health of my fellow Americans  at risk.    I think a lot of people are asking the question: If this is a  healthcare bill, why is the core of it this huge cut to Medicaid and a  huge tax break for the wealthiest Americans? And by the way, if you  make $1 million a year, you get a $57,000-a-year, on average, tax break  in this so-called healthcare bill.   So let's put aside a bill that is rotten to its core. I heard a lot  of talk about trying to fix this. I would just warn my colleagues to  make sure our constituents know that cosmetic changes aren't going to  fix this. You can't put a little deodorant on this and make it come out  smelling great. It is just not going to happen. But if people are  genuinely interested in finding ways to improve the exchanges, I am all  in. We certainly should work together to reduce the cost of  prescription drugs, and there are lots of proposals out there to do it.  The President at one time even talked about making that a priority, but  that seems to have fallen away. We all know there are ways we can  smartly save money in our healthcare system by continuing to move away  from a system that is based simply on the quantity of care and the  volume of care and move toward one that rewards the value and quality  of care. Let's do that.   The final thing I want to point out is that I was in Southern  Maryland over the break, down in a place called St. Mary's County. I  visited one of the substance abuse treatment centers called Beacon of  Hope Recovery Center. These are people of great faith coming together  to help people who are victims of the opioid epidemic, which has had a  devastating impact on Maryland, as it has on so much of the rest of the  country. We talked about some of the former patients who were there,  people who are now actually part of the operation to help save the  lives of other people who are racked with addiction. We met with these  dedicated staff members, former patients, and with local law  enforcement all around a table, recognizing that if we are really going  to conquer the opioid epidemic, we need to provide treatment services.  This recovery center was pleading with all of us--with me, asking me to  plead with all of our colleagues to not cut Medicaid because they are  going to be relying on continuing Medicaid funding in order to provide  those treatment services.   I think people around the country are just beginning to learn that  Medicaid has been helpful and will become even more helpful in the  fight against the opioid epidemic; that it is helping our kids with  disabilities and special education in our schools; that it helps low- income working families who may work for an employer who doesn't  provide health insurance and who still pays so low that they are at an  income level where they qualify for Medicaid. People are also learning  that most of the money spent in Medicaid goes to individuals in nursing  homes and people with long-term disabilities, people who need long-term  care. That is where most of the money goes. And 2 out of 3 dollars  spent on nursing home care in the United States are Medicaid dollars.   So we are all in this together. Those deep cuts to Medicaid are going  to have a devastating impact, as will the other changes that are going  to make health insurance premiums go up for so many people, especially  for seniors. And the provisions are going to harm those with  preexisting conditions in various ways.   I will end with one of many stories that I have gotten, personal  testimonies I received from constituents throughout the State of  Maryland.   This one is from Sarah from Arnold, MD, who says:         Without the Affordable Care Act, my family would not have       affordable, reliable health insurance. When my 3-year-old was       2 months old, he had emergency brain surgery for a benign       cyst. Because of this, and even though he does not have any       lingering effects or medical needs as a result of this       surgery, we were denied coverage for him before the ACA.    That, of course, is because before the ACA, people could be denied  coverage because of a preexisting condition. At the age of 2 months, he  had the cyst. He was forever marked as someone with a preexisting  condition and therefore could not get affordable coverage.   They wrote:         We were denied coverage before the ACA. In 2014, my husband       opened up his own family law practice. Because of this       decision, we were on our own for health insurance.    So they bought into the exchange.         And we are now in our second year of excellent coverage       thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Having a fixed monthly       payment with the options and privileges equal to those who       work for big companies has been immensely helpful. The       Affordable Care Act has worked for me and my family.    Mr. President, my point is not that the Affordable Care Act is  perfect. There are improvements that can be  [[Page S3931]]  made. We should work together to make improvements, but let's not do  something that violates what the doctors call the Hippocratic Oath.  Let's not do something that does more harm in our system. Let's not do  something that will result in 22 million fewer of our fellow Americans  having access. Let's do something good together that actually builds on  what we have, fixes what is broken, because we can make improvements in  the Affordable Care Act, not by doing a U-turn and going backward but  by looking forward.   Mr. President, I really hope that we will do that together.   Thank you.                            ____________________
