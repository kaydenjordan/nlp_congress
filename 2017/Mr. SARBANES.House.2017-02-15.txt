 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to yet another  reckless attack by the majority on the retirement security of millions  of Americans. I don't get why the majority is so determined to go after  the retirement security of so many millions of Americans across this  country, but that is what H.J. Res. 66 would do.   It may get harder for everyday Americans to prepare for their  retirement. The resolution we are considering today would prevent State  governments--it doesn't make any sense to do this--from providing  retirement savings opportunities for their citizens.   The fact of the matter is, as was just alluded to, this resolution  was designed at the behest of Wall Street and well-connected lobbyists  to sideline competition and transparent financial products in the  retirement savings market. But this isn't the first time.   They put all their energy behind blocking the automatic IRA when it  was a proposal that came forward a few years back, even though it was a  Heritage Foundation proposal. Then they went after the fiduciary rule  that President Obama and the Department of Labor sought to put in place  that would protect our retirees from unscrupulous investment advisers.   Then President Trump comes in with an executive order to undo what  the Department of Labor was trying to do. So we shouldn't be surprised  by this action, but we ought to be furious about it.   My State, Maryland, was one of the States that tried to figure out  how to protect retirees because we couldn't get it done up here. Now,  what are we doing? The party of states' rights is advancing a  Congressional Review Act resolution designed to hinder State  legislatures that are working to provide access to safe and affordable  retirement savings options for their citizens. We shouldn't allow this  to happen.   I encourage my colleagues to reject this senseless resolution.
