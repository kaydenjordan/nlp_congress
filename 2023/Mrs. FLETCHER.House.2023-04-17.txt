 Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome the Greater Houston  LGBT Chamber of Commerce on their first trip to Washington.   I am so proud to represent so many thriving LGBTQ+ and allied  businesses in my district and in the Greater Houston area.   This week, Chamber representatives are in Washington to advance  policies that foster economic inclusion and equality for the LGBTQ+  business community. I want them to know how welcome they are here in  Washington, in the U.S. Congress, the people's House. I want to  recognize them for being here, for their efforts and engagement, and  for being great partners and leaders.   The Greater Houston LGBT Chamber of Commerce brings the best of our  diverse, dynamic, and inclusive community to Washington this week, and  I could not be more proud to represent them or to welcome them here to  the people's House.                            ____________________
