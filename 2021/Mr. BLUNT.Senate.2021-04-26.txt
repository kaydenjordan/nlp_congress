 Mr. President, I am saddened by the passing of Hal  Sullivan. He had a unique ability to bring together organizations and  private sector partners to make sure clients of the Fathers & Families  Support Center had the tools they needed to be successful. I  appreciated learning what he was seeing and hearing, and hearing his  advice over the years. His work touched the lives of so many families  throughout the St. Louis region, and his legacy of service will have a  lasting impact throughout our State for generations to come.                            ____________________
