 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of a true American  hero. Neal Kenneth Todd of Akeley, Minnesota, enlisted as a Fireman  First Class in the U.S. Navy and was stationed on the USS Oklahoma in  Pearl Harbor.   He tragically lost his life on Sunday, December 7, 1941, when  Japanese torpedoes caused the ship to capsize.   Initially, Neal Todd was reported missing in action, and his family  went almost 3 months without answers before learning of his death. To  make matters worse, his body was never identified, leaving his family  without the closure that they deserved.   After nearly 80 years of unimaginable grief and unanswered questions,  Neal's remains have finally been identified, beginning the process of  returning him home to Minnesota.   On July 10, Neal Todd will be buried with full military honors next  to his brother and parents. It will be my distinct privilege to join  his family in Akeley when he returns home.   Witnessing this American hero laid to rest after decades will be an  honor, but it will also be a somber reminder that freedom comes at such  a heavy price.   Madam Speaker, we can never forget the sacrifices made by heroes like  Neal Todd. Americans like him are the reason that this Nation is known  as the land of the free and the home of the brave.   God bless Neal Todd and God bless his family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, over the past year, it really has felt like  our small businesses, our middle class, our communities have really  taken one punch after another.   First, we were handed mandatory shutdowns of our restaurants, our  small businesses, and our churches, while Walmart and Lowe's and other  big box retail stores were allowed to remain open. In some places  around the country, we were not even allowed to leave our homes unless  it was for a purpose that the government deemed essential.   Like all Americans, I am extremely excited and pleased to see that  most of the economy in our communities have reopened. But we can't help  but observe that it seems like the reopening is occurring because of  the independence and resilience of the American people, despite the  best efforts by some to keep us shuttered indefinitely.   It is baffling that during this time when our neighbors have the  opportunity to finally get back to work, Democrats are pushing policies  to hurt them.   Oh, you are trying to find employees for your diner so you can  reopen?   Well, they are paying those employees more to sit at home.   You have a corner store in central South Dakota?   Sorry, but President Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline and  instantly caused your customers to lose their jobs.   You want to go back to work, but have two children at home?   Well, unbelievably, the Biden education plan included zero  requirement that your son's or daughter's school reopens.   You were excited for your hotel to be busy this spring?   Well, the CDC was still advising Americans not to travel, even if  they were vaccinated.   Your bait shop along the Canadian border has been struggling since  the border closure?   Too bad President Biden and Justin Trudeau decided that couldn't be  solved at the G7 last week.   You need gas to get to work, to get to your job site?   Well, it costs you $50 more this year than it did last year.   Mr. Speaker, this is a staggering laundry list of policies that  individually would be an enormous impediment to our success, but  together it is a brick wall. Without urgent changes to these antijobs,  anti-small business policies, our communities will continue to struggle  to reopen completely, and more families will feel the negative impacts  of the Biden-Pelosi economy.   As a small business owner myself, I know what these men and women are  going through. I know that they were the ones who built their business,  not the government. And despite opposing efforts, they won't let the  government take it away from them either.
