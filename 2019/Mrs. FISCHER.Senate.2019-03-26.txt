 Mr. President, I rise to speak to the historic flooding  that has devastated hundreds of communities throughout my home State of  Nebraska.   After a long, cold, and snow-filled winter, the catastrophic storm  known as a bomb cyclone struck Western Nebraska with extreme blizzard  conditions, while the central and eastern portions of the State were  ravaged by record-setting floods. What were small streams became raging  rivers, pouring over the banks, and breaching levees to flood towns and  farmland.   The floods, which carried car-sized blocks of ice in some areas,  isolated entire communities and deposited sand, mud, and debris over  large areas of our land.   Homes have been destroyed, roads and bridges ripped apart, businesses  and schools forced to close for an uncertain period of time. It is with  a heavy heart that I say that three Nebraskans have lost their lives as  a result of this storm: James Wilke, a farmer from Columbus; Aleido  Rojas Galan of Norfolk; and Betty Hamernik of Columbus. I send my  sincere condolences to their families. Their loved ones will not be  forgotten.   Cities like Fremont and farms across the State became islands,  leaving people and livestock stranded. The bomb cyclone has demolished  thousands of acres of family farmland and ranchland, resulting in a  devastating number of livestock deaths and demolished farms, grain  bins, hay supply, and farm equipment.   One farmer recorded that he lost 700 of his hogs after 7 feet of  floodwater swept through his land within minutes. A top concern for our  ag producers is how do we replace ruined feed and the countless miles  of washed-out fences.   The Nebraska Department of Agriculture initially projects that the  damages will total a loss of $440 million in crop losses and another  $400 million in cattle losses. The devastation continues to grow as our  farmers and ranchers across Nebraska assess lost land use and more  livestock deaths.   I heard from ranchers in Central and Western Nebraska who fought  through this blizzard during calving, and what I heard most was that  even though they suffered losses, they knew of others who were worse  off.   Farmers stood looking at once fertile land now covered with sand,  mud, and unimaginably huge slabs and chunks of ice. They are worried  what the future will bring.   I agree with Gov. Pete Ricketts, as he has called this catastrophic  weather ``the most widespread disaster we have had in our state's  history.''   Water from the Missouri River and Papio Creek has overwhelmed the  southeastern side of Offutt Air Force Base and rendered some parts of  the base as inoperable. I welcomed Secretary of the Air Force Heather  Wilson to survey the flood damage at the base. Some buildings were  filled with nearly 8 feet of water. Offutt leadership provided us with  a preliminary damage assessment and discussed the response efforts that  were successfully taken by the airmen.   At the flood's peak levels, one-third of the base was affected,  causing tens of millions of dollars in damages. I will continue to work  closely with Secretary Wilson to ensure that Offutt receives the  funding to meet the needs of the base and to restore one of America's  most important national security assets.   According to the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, 81 of our 93  counties, 98 cities, and 5 Tribes have declared states of emergency.  This covers over 59,000 square miles, which is about 76 percent of  Nebraska.   To put this in perspective, well over 1.7 million Nebraskans are  affected by this storm. That is more than 95 percent of our State's  population.   The Governor has estimated that more than 2,000 homes and 340  businesses are damaged or destroyed. Significant damage to Nebraska's  critical infrastructure is still being assessed at this time, but the  Nebraska Department of Transportation released a preliminary estimate  of $200 million that is needed to reconstruct hundreds of miles of  roads and to repair or replace 15 bridges throughout the State.   Nebraska is hurting. However, as our Nation has seen the sheer power  of this storm, I want America to understand the courage, strength, and  resiliency Nebraskans have shown in response. Overwhelming loss and  grief have been met with stories of bravery and heroic efforts of our  neighbors and first responders. Ordinary Nebraskans, without any prior  training, grabbed their personal boats, jet skis, trucks, and planes to  save their neighbors who experienced life-threatening situations.   There have been countless stories of heroes who disregarded personal  risk to help their neighbors in need--Nebraskans helping Nebraskans,  neighbors helping neighbors.   Hundreds of volunteers in Fremont stepped forward to fill sandbags  and create barriers to protect the city from floodwater. Local pilots  in affected cities across Nebraska have flown their personal planes to  deliver and evacuate people who have been surrounded by water.  [[Page S1973]]    In Boyd County, firefighters continued to stay on the job and rescue  those in need, even after their own homes were flooded.   In the Nebraska Panhandle, one State patrol officer even scaled a  barbed-wire fence to rescue a calf that was frozen to the ground.   Last week, a staff sergeant with the Nebraska Guard was helping lead  rescue efforts in Fremont, where the town was left without fresh food  and water for 2 days because of the surrounding floodwater. She said:         As we approached the town, I saw people coming out of their       houses, standing on street corners, waving and clasping their       hands in joy. . . . As we began carrying bottled water into       the store, an elderly lady, who had been waiting for hours       hugged me and was overcome with emotion. . . . She was so       thankful and relieved knowing that even in difficult and       trying times, there are Nebraskans doing things ``the       Nebraska way'' by watching out for our most vulnerable       citizens.    That is who we are. These stories are inspiring, and they speak to  the character and integrity of my fellow Nebraskans.   I have been traveling across Nebraska to see the impact of this  disaster firsthand.   In Omaha, I joined Governor Ricketts at the Nebraska Strong phone-a- thon for relief and support for flood victims. The event, sponsored by  the Nebraska Broadcasters Association, raised nearly a half million  dollars to benefit the American Red Cross in Nebraska and Southwest  Iowa.   In Winslow, I met with families and residents of the area who had  been hit hard by the floods. Every structure in that town was flooded.  I spoke to a mother of three who told me she had just 15 minutes to  gather her children and her family's belongings before the floodwaters  entered their home.   Winslow Volunteer Fire Chief Zachary Klein, informed me that his team  was able to get boats to help with their recovery efforts. Chief Klein  and his team saved 29 local residents from their flooded homes.   In Plattsmouth, the town's water treatment facility is currently  powered down and inaccessible. Like many affected communities across  Nebraska, their main concern is being able to gather the facts and to  make decisions about how they can move forward with their lives.   In Valley, I toured the devastation in the community with Mayor  Carroll Smith and Councilwoman Cindy Grove. Large piles of wreckage can  be found everywhere in town as people begin that cleanup process, but  the people of Valley are resilient. Residents have started a donation  center where people in need can get clothes, equipment, and other  supplies as needed. More than 150 people have signed up as volunteers.   I also spent some time with local residents and city and county  personnel in North Bend. The community is understandably concerned  about how their community will rebuild their lives, but it also warmed  my heart to listen to stories of how the town is pulling together to  support one another.   Time and again, I heard of how proud the North Bend community is of  their volunteers who are managing donations and distributing food and  supplies to those in need.   I want all Nebraskans to know that my office stands ready to help in  any way that we can. Recently, I led the Nebraska delegation in a  letter to President Trump outlining the extent of damage to our State  and the projected cost of recovery. I want to thank the President for  his rapid approval of Governor Ricketts' expedited request for Federal  disaster assistance.   Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and I discussed the crisis that  ag producers are facing. He assured me that USDA is committed to  assisting our farmers and ranchers in any way they can. I also visited  with Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao by phone to share with her  how this historic storm has damaged our critical infrastructure. The  Secretary and the Department of Transportation, as a whole, are ready  to help Nebraska.   I spoke with Major General Bohac to discuss the Nebraska National  Guard's flood response, the ongoing state of emergency, and ways my  office can assist with their relief efforts. In the coming days and  weeks, I will continue to work closely alongside Governor Ricketts to  assist in coordinating Federal relief efforts for our State. I have  spoken to President Trump and shared with him the needs of our State as  we recover. He reassured me that Nebraskans will receive the help we  need.   I take great pride in the way our State has pulled together in this  disaster. To know communities like Fremont, Plattsmouth, Columbus,  Ashland, Norfolk, Spencer, or Niobrara is to know the definition of  strength in unity and an unwavering pride in your State and country.  Above the floodwaters, you will still see the American flag waving  proudly in all of these communities. If you know Nebraska as I do, you  know our State is filled with towns like these from one side to the  other.   I am proud to represent our great State every day in the U.S. Senate.  Though much is uncertain for the victims of this disaster, our  communities are rallying to endure and recover from these historic  weather conditions.   I close by offering my sincere thanks to our State and local  officials, our emergency responders, and National Guard, who are  working around the clock to provide lifesaving assistance to our  citizens in need.   We have much work to do, but Nebraskans are resilient, we are tough,  and we are compassionate. Hour by hour and day by day, we will get  through this difficult chapter in our State's history, and we will  remain Nebraska Strong.   I yield the floor.
