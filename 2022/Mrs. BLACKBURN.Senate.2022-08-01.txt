 Madam President, Joe Biden and the Democrats have  ushered us into what will be remembered as one of the most cynical and  dangerous periods in our Nation's history. For 18 months, they have  wreaked havoc on the economy, welcomed drugs and crime into their own  backyards, and enabled the rise of the new axis of evil, which is my  term for Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.   Last week was really a particularly bad week for the Biden-Harris  administration, but it was even worse for the people watching it play  out, sitting at home in their communities. Inflation hit a 41-year  high, consumer confidence hit a historic low, and we confirmed that the  American economy is indeed in a recession.   But rather than taking responsibility, my Democratic friends decided  they would go on an all-out campaign and redefine the word  ``recession,'' and they insisted that the economic ruin that they have  rained down on us all is in our imaginations. The economy is in great  shape, they say. It is better than ever, they say. But Tennesseans  sitting at their kitchen table, trying to figure out how to make ends  meet, they know different.   If ever there were a time to listen to what the American people are  telling each and every one of us, it is now. Yet here we are facing now  what is possibly the Democratic Party's most cynical and dangerous move  to date: a trillion-plus--a trillion-plus-dollar spending spree. It is  full of tax increases and policies so unpopular that its negotiators  had to hide its existence from our own colleagues.   Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin have dubbed this secret plan--I guess  is what it was--they have dubbed it the Inflation Reduction Act, which  immediately brings to mind one simple question: How out of step can you  possibly be with where the American people are? You are so out of step.  And do you truly think that the American people are so stupid that they  think raising taxes is going to bring a reduction in inflation?   If the situation weren't so dire for people back in Tennessee, I  would assume this was some sort of joke, but it is not. The American  people are drowning, and Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin have thrown them  a cinder block instead of a life preserver. People cannot believe this.  They absolutely cannot believe this.   This bill represents the worst elements of a radical socialist agenda  that Americans have already rejected: a multihundred-billion-dollar tax  hike that will kill tens of thousands of jobs, sabotage energy  producers, and make it even more expensive to heat homes and fill gas  tanks; a multihundred-billion-dollar payday for climate activists and  the environmental lobby; innovation-killing price controls on  prescription drugs; and tax breaks, but only for the wealthiest  Americans.   Nothing in this bill will make life easier. Nothing in this bill will  lower gas prices or reduce inflation. But it is exactly what  Tennesseans were afraid would happen if Joe Biden and the Democrats  took control of the Federal Government.   This week, every Member of this body has a choice to make: Will you  stand with the American people, or will you make their life harder  every day because of more spending, more tax increases, and more Green  New Deal? Will you ease their pain, or will you make their pain worse  by supporting this bloated, foolish spending spree?   I hope that my colleagues will come to their senses because this is a  breaking point between Congress and the American people.   I cannot tell you how many times I heard that very statement this  weekend from Tennesseans. They cannot even believe another trillion  dollars in spending--another trillion. Money does not grow on trees.   If you, as an individual who has a vote on this bill, if you choose  to support this bill and tax and spend this country into oblivion, that  is a road that you are going to have to go down alone because the  American people cannot afford to go down this road with you.                               PACT Act of 2022    Madam President, the Democratic press machine has done a great job  framing the debate over much needed changes to the PACT Act as an  attack on our most vulnerable veterans. This framing ignores reality.   I supported the PACT Act. I voted for final passage last time around.  I have worked for years on the issue of toxic exposure. I intend to  vote for the bill again, so do many of my colleagues who have joined me  in still pushing for critical improvements to this bill.   Before we vote on final passage this week, I would ask my colleagues  one question: Why wait to fix the problems we all know will hamper the  effectiveness of this bill? Why not fix the PACT Act now and ensure  that veterans actually have access to the care they deserve once this  bill leaves the President's desk with his signature? That is the real  choice here.   Now, I know my Democratic colleagues are on a tight timeline. They  want this thing done. They want it done before the elections. They want  this signed. They want to get out there and campaign on this. They want  us just to move on and not have to fix it until later.    But it is not my job to make Chuck Schumer's life easier or those  running for election, to make their lives easier. It is my job to be  certain that I represent these veterans in Tennessee who have given  their commitment to defend this Nation. They have done it honorably.  They have done it expecting care from the VA for harms that have come  their way. And we should make certain that they have access to the care  that they need.   The PACT Act in its current form is not the best that we can do, but  we can get it there in a few more hours with a few amendments that  would make sure this bill can help veterans suffering from the effects  of toxic exposure and help them get the care that they deserve.   And I want to make it clear that Senator Schumer and Chairman Tester  know this. The majority of my colleagues who sit with me on the  Veterans' Affairs Committee support a vote on these amendments, so much  so that, at one point, we had all agreed to give these amendments a  vote because we all know that the VA is not capable of implementing  this bill as it is currently written.   The VA cannot deliver on the promise that is in this bill. In fact,  it will do the exact opposite. Right now, the claims backlog at the VA  sits at 168,000 cases. You heard me right on that--168,000 cases. That  is the current backlog.   The PACT Act, as written, will increase that backlog by more than-- get this--1 million cases--1 million. That is not according to me. That  is according  [[Page S3798]]  to the Biden-nominated, Senate-confirmed VA Secretary Denis McDonough.   Here is what he told us in testimony delivered to the committee on  March 29, 2022:         Estimates from VA's initial technical assistance . . .       demonstrated a potential backlog increase to 1.5 . . .       million claims by the end of fiscal year . . . 2023.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have Secretary  McDonough's testimony printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                Title II: Toxic Exposure Presumption Process                                   summary         Title II, called the Fairly Assessing Service-related Toxic       Exposure Residuals Presumptions Act, or the FASTER       Presumptions Act, would create new provisions in chapter 11       of title 38, U.S.C., regarding determinations relating to       presumptions of service connection based on toxic exposure.        The new 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1171 would establish the process by       which VA could establish or modify presumptions of service       connection based on toxic exposures.        The new 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1172 would establish a Formal       Advisory Committee on Toxic Exposure.        VA could consult with, and seek the advice of, the       Committee with respect to cases in which Veterans are       suspected of having experienced a toxic exposure during       active service or dependents of such Veterans.        The Committee would have to assess cases of toxic exposures       of Veterans and their dependents by conducting ongoing       surveillance and reviewing scientific literature, media       reports, information from Veterans and information from       Congress. These assessments would cover suspected and known       toxic exposures.        The Committee also would be responsible for periodically       assessing the accuracy of the Individual Longitudinal       Exposure Record (ILER) and the data collected.        The Committee could develop a recommendation for formal       evaluation under the new 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1173 to conduct a       review of the health effects related to an exposure if the       Committee determines that the research may change the current       understanding of the relationship between an exposure to an       environmental hazard and adverse health outcomes in humans.       Based upon evidence regarding the periods and locations of       exposure covered by an existing presumption, the Committee       could nominate for formal evaluation under new 38 U.S.C.       Sec. 1173 modifications of the periods and locations for       eligibility for benefits.        The new 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1173 would require VA to establish a       process to conduct a formal evaluation for each       recommendation of the Committee established under proposed       Sec. 1172.        Under this process, VA would have to conduct research       regarding the health effects related to a case of toxic       exposure or to evaluate evidence regarding the periods and       locations of exposure covered by an existing presumption of       service connection.        Each formal evaluation would have to cover scientific       evidence, claims data and other factors as VA determined       appropriate.        The formal evaluations would have to evaluate the       likelihood that a positive association existed between an       illness and a toxic exposure while serving in active service       and assess toxic exposures and illnesses to determine whether       the evidence supported a finding of a positive association       between the toxic exposure and the illness.        Not later than 120 days after a formal evaluation is       commenced, the element of VA that conducts the evaluation       would have to submit to the Secretary a recommendation with       respect to establishing a presumption of service connection       for the toxic exposure and illness, or modifying an existing       presumption of service connection, covered by the evaluation.        The new 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1174 would require VA to commence       issuing regulations if the Secretary determines, based on a       recommendation under Sec. 1173, that the presumption or       modification is warranted or to notify the public that the       presumption or modification is not warranted. If VA removed a       presumption, Veterans and other beneficiaries who were       receiving benefits based on that presumption would continue       to receive such benefits.        The new 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1175 would allow VA to modify the       process under which it conducts formal evaluations under       Sec. 1173 and issues regulations under Sec. 1174.        VA would have to ensure the new evaluations cover the       evidence, data and factors required by Sec. 1173(b).        VA would have to notify Congress and wait 180 days before       implementing such changes.        VA also would have to seek to enter into an agreement with       a nongovernmental entity or a Federally funded research and       development center to conduct a review of the implementation       of this subchapter.        The new 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1167 would require VA, whenever a       law, regulation or Federal court decision established or       modified a presumption of service connection, to identify all       previously denied claims that were submitted to VA that might       have been decided differently had the presumption been in       effect at the time of the application.        VA would have to allow for the re-evaluation of such claims       at the election of the Veteran.        Notwithstanding 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5110, VA would have to       provide compensation with respect to claims approved pursuant       to such reevaluation based on the date of the submission of       the original claim.        VA also would have to conduct outreach to inform relevant       Veterans they may elect to have a claim re-evaluated under       this authority.        This section would apply to presumptions of service-      connection established or modified on or after the date of       enactment.        Title II also would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1116 to require VA       to ensure that any determination made on or after the date of       enactment regarding a presumption of service connection based       on exposure to an herbicide agent under this section would       be made pursuant to the new authorities described       previously.        In addition, title II would require VA to submit to       Congress:        Not less frequently than annually, a publicly available       report on recommendations for research and any       recommendations for legislative or administrative action from       the Committee established under Sec. 1172; VA would have to       submit a publicly available report on the findings and       opinions of VA with respect to the Committee's report.        Within 2 years of enactment, a report on the implementation       of, and recommendations for, the new Sec. Sec. 1171-1175. On       a quarterly basis during the 2-year period beginning on the       date of enactment, VA would have to provide to Congress a       briefing on the implementation of these provisions.        Within 540 days of enactment, a report containing the       review by the nongovernmental entity or Federally funded       research and development center on the implementation of the       new Sec. Sec. 1171-1175.                         impact on care and benefits         As the President said in the State of the Union earlier       this month, VA already is pioneering new ways of linking       toxic exposures to diseases, thus helping more Veterans       receive their benefits. Based on a focused review of       scientific and medical evidence related to exposure to fine       particulate matter and the subsequent development of rare       respiratory cancers, VA recently announced its intention to       initiate rulemaking that would consider adding presumptions       of service connection for several rare respiratory cancers       for certain Veterans. This announcement follows VA's       rulemaking action last year establishing a presumption of       service connection for three chronic respiratory conditions,       including asthma, rhinitis and sinusitis.        We appreciate that the bill, as passed, includes changes       made in collaboration between VA and the House Committee on       Veterans' Affairs. For example, removal of the Science Review       Board and Working Group on presumptions of service connection       would allow VA to implement an efficient, science-driven       process. We are concerned, though, that the creation of a new       Committee, particularly one subject to the Federal Advisory       Committee Act, would likely slow existing mechanisms for       proposing and conducting research.        Rather than using an advisory committee that would create       significant administrative burdens and slow down the       presumptive decision-making process, we recommend Congress       consider requiring VA to publish in the Federal Register an       annual list of conditions the Department plans to evaluate       under VA's presumptive decision model, explain why the       conditions were chosen for evaluation and seek input from the       public on that list. This approach would enable transparency,       intentionality and allow for public participation. It also       would allow for a timelier decision-making process. We       further recommend that Congress establish clear effective       dates indicating when the proposed changes would take effect.       VA recommends that sufficient time be given to allow it to       implement this authority based on a variety of factors,       including the regulatory development and public comment       process, as well as the significant implementation       requirements and dependencies (such as staffing and       resources) associated with the bill as a whole.        We also are concerned that the current bill text is       ambiguous, notwithstanding the four ``strength of evidence''       categories listed in proposed Sec. 1173, as to when a       presumption is warranted. It remains unclear whether Congress       intends for the Secretary to adopt the recommendations from       the bill's proposed process as a matter of course. If       Congress intends to allow VA to determine the applicable       standards for creating a presumption, it would be helpful to       make that clear and to provide specific guidelines for when       VA must create or modify these presumptions. For example, if       the strength of evidence for a particular condition falls in       the category of ``equipoise and above,'' it is unclear       whether the Secretary would be required to establish a       presumption or if the Secretary would have discretion in       those instances. If Congress intends any specific, triggering       standards governing these determinations, it would be helpful       to clarify such standards in the bill. The court orders in       the long-standing, complex class action litigation in Nehmer       v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs (Nehmer) were based on a       finding that, in creating presumptions based on herbicide       agent exposure, VA applied standards inconsistent with       Congressional intent. It would be helpful for the Committee       to clarify Congressional intent on this point to avoid       similar consequences with respect to this bill.  [[Page S3799]]         The new Sec. 1167 would impose a Nehmer-type effective date       mechanism for new presumptions. We want to be clear to the       Committee, though, that applying a Nehmer-like retroactive       effective date provision in this instance would create a       significant exception to the legal structure governing       Veterans' benefits. Applying this standard makes it difficult       to predict the consequences of this type of effective date       provision. VA would be required to apply the provision in       this new authority not only to the presumptions created in       this bill but also to any future presumptions created by       regulation, statute or court order. This requirement would       present extraordinary workload challenges to the agency and       unprecedented delays in the delivery of benefits to Veterans.       For example, every previously denied claim for any of the       presumptive conditions identified in or contemplated by this       bill (out of the nearly 3.5 million Gulf War-deployed       Veterans) would now be subject to a retroactive effective       date as far back as 1991 for Gulf War I Veterans and 2001 for       Global War on Terrorism Veterans.        We would welcome the opportunity to work with Congress to       ensure that new authorities in this area support our ongoing       work to help us make informed decisions as quickly as       possible.                             costs and resources         VA is concerned that an extremely large and unprecedented       disability claims backlog would be created if the Nehmer-like       provisions in this bill are retained. Based on VA's previous       experience in implementing similar retroactive effective date       provisions, we understand this provision would result in       complex and time-intensive claims processing procedures. In       this case, claims processors would be required to review 20       to 30 years of evidence for a single issue. Considering that       more than 1.9 million Gulf War-era deployed Veterans have       filed disability claims in the past 30 years (over 900,000 of       whom filed claims for respiratory issues), VA is very       concerned about the impact of this provision. VA claims       processors would be required to re-adjudicate hundreds of       thousands of previously denied claims for earlier effective       dates. Estimates from VA's initial technical assistance,       without this provision, demonstrated a potential backlog       increase to 1.5 and 1.8 million claims by the end of fiscal       year (FY) 2023. Any further application of retroactive       presumptions would drive further benefit delivery delays for       all Veterans.                                   research         Title II would establish a new Committee and institute new       processes related to the identification of and support for       research related to toxic exposures. As noted previously, we       are concerned some of the specific provisions in this title       would prove more onerous and less nimble than our current       approach.     Now, the reason I have paid so much attention to this  backlog is because every single week the team that works with me in  Tennessee handling these issues with our VSOs--our veterans service  officers--keeps track of what we hear from the veterans.   Right now in Tennessee, I have veterans telling me they are waiting  almost 100 days for a primary care appointment at the VA. Now, for many  vets, this is just step 1. So once they contact the VA, it is 100 days.  Think about that: 100 days before they get that primary care  appointment, and that is if the appointment doesn't get canceled or it  has to be rescheduled. So that is an average to get to step 1--first  step.   Across Tennessee, veterans are waiting yet another 39 days to get  mental healthcare. Now, if they are needing dental appointments, dental  surgery, or dental care, that is 44 days. If they go for that primary  care appointment and they need to go see a cardiologist, that is 33  days; 28 days to see a gynecologist; 30 days to go talk to someone  about chronic pain.   Look at what is happening. The VA cannot meet the load in front of  them. Our veterans--our veterans who have defended our Nation's  freedom--cannot get the care they need in a timely manner.   Now, we have done a lot of work over the years to help the VA help  itself. We have given them support for hiring. We have given them  support for retention. But, Madam President, it takes 90 days for this  Agency, the VA, to hire one person--90 days. And think of the number of  caseworkers they would have to hire to implement this. Throwing money  at the problem isn't going to make these wait times and backlogs  disappear.   It is imperative that we fix the PACT Act so it is not a false  promise, so it is not false hope. If the PACT Act is going to work for  our veterans, then the VA needs to embrace community care.   I proposed an amendment to the bill that would have eliminated  arbitrary bureaucratic hurdles for toxic-exposed veterans who will  inevitably face these long wait times. It would allow them to seek care  in the community right there where they live if they could get it  faster than they could from the VA.   I offered this amendment based on my conversations with Tennessee  veterans who are chronically ill but cannot get in to the VA to see a  doctor and get that primary care appointment so they can move on to  specialty care. Many of them are deteriorating at an alarming rate, and  they deserve access to care as soon as they can get it. The only way  that access to care for them is going to happen is if we allow them  community care. They have fought for this country. They deserve to have  access to that care, but right now, they cannot get it.   Madam President, I know you more than most understand how imperative  it is for veterans to have access to the care they need, that this  government make good on its promise to our veterans, that we stop these  long wait times, that we stop the delays, and that we allow them that  access that they have earned and that they deserve.   There is a way to fix this bill. I know there are some who say: Well,  we are afraid this will privatize the VA. That is their fear, and I  understand that. But at some point, veterans want us to take that  action to put them first--not the bureaucracy first, put the veterans  first--allow the veterans to make that choice if they cannot get to the  VA in a timely manner. If the VA can't get them in for an appointment,  let's open this up and let the veterans out into community care so  their needs can be met in a timely manner.   A promise in a piece of legislation ought not to end up as a false  hope when it comes to our Nation's veterans. The best way we can  fulfill our promise to toxic-exposed veterans is to give this bill the  time it needs for an amendment that will allow our veterans to access  the care they need without having to wait on the VA to figure out how  to implement this bill.   Surely, surely, we can do this. Let's have a vote on these amendments  and fix this bill before it is signed into law.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
