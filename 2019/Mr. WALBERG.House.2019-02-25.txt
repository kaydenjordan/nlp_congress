 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 583, the  PIRATE Act, led by Chairman Tonko and Representative Bilirakis.   The bipartisan bill takes an important step to protect the vital  public safety announcements, news, and educational benefits local  broadcasters serve to their communities.   When illegal pirate radio operators interfere with important public  safety communications, it can be detrimental to the public. These  illegal pirate operators also interfere with critical aviation  frequencies, potentially putting lives at risk.   Legitimate, licensed broadcasters who provide the foundation of our  Nation's Emergency Alert System must be protected from this type of  harmful interference.   H.R. 583 would give the FCC stronger tools to continue their  enforcement sweeps and fine violators in order to better protect  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce  Committee for their leadership on this bipartisan legislation, and I  urge its passage today.
