 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1980) to establish in the Smithsonian Institution a  comprehensive women's history museum, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1980         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Smithsonian Women's History       Museum Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Since its founding, the United States has greatly       benefitted from the contributions of women.        (2) Historical accounts, monuments, memorials, and museums       disproportionately represent men's achievements and       contributions and often neglect those of women. For example--        (A) a study of 18 American history textbooks concluded that       10 percent of the material documented contributions of women;        (B) 9 statues out of 91 in the United States Capitol's       National Statuary Hall depict women; and        (C) only one of the 44 monuments operated by the National       Park Service specifically honors the achievements of women       after the 2016 designation of the Belmont-Paul Women's       Equality National Monument.        (3) There exists no national museum in the United States       that is devoted to the documentation of women's contributions       throughout the Nation's history.        (4) Establishing a comprehensive women's history museum       representing a diverse range of viewpoints, experience, and       backgrounds is necessary to more accurately depict the       history of the United States and would add value to the       Smithsonian Institution.       SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF MUSEUM.         (a) Establishment.--There is established within the       Smithsonian Institution a comprehensive women's history       museum, to be named by the Board of Regents in consultation       with the council established under section 4.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the museum established under       this section shall be to provide for--  [[Page H1030]]         (1) the collection, study, and establishment of programs       relating to women's contributions to various fields and       throughout different periods of history that have influenced       the direction of the United States;        (2) collaboration with other Smithsonian Institution       museums and facilities, outside museums, and educational       institutions; and        (3) the creation of exhibitions and programs that recognize       diverse perspectives on women's history and contributions.       SEC. 4. COUNCIL.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1980, the Smithsonian  Women's History Museum Act.   H.R. 1980 will establish a comprehensive women's history museum  within the Smithsonian Institution. We cannot tell the story of America  without telling the story of women in America.   From the days leading up to our founding through today, the United  States has benefited from the contributions, accomplishments, and  sacrifices of women.   In the 1760s, the Daughters of Liberty came together to protest  unjust laws like the Townshend Acts, helping to spark the American  Revolution. Soon after the Revolution, Abigail Adams urged her husband,  John, and other Members of the First Continental Congress to:  ``Remember the ladies.'' She would later become one of President Adams'  most influential advisers and confidants.   In the years leading up to the Civil War, Harriet Tubman escaped from  slavery and guided dozens of slaves to freedom throughout the  Underground Railroad, and she didn't stop there. She went on to raise  money for newly freed slaves and joined other women like Elizabeth Cady  Stanton and Susan B. Anthony in their fight for women's suffrage.   During World War II, 6.5 million women entered the labor force to  support the war effort, including my own late mother, who helped build  airplanes in south San Francisco to fight the Nazis. They were  exercising new power with jobs outside the home, and this power has  continued to grow over time, albeit more slowly than many of us would  like.   Later in the 20th century, Rosa Parks sparked the Montgomery bus  boycott, and Sandra Day O'Connor took the bench as the first woman ever  appointed to the Supreme Court.   More recently, Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the first and second  female Speaker of the House. In 2018, a record 102 women were elected  to the House of Representatives.   However, these and countless other accomplishments by women  notwithstanding, historical accounts, monuments, and museums  disproportionately represent the achievements of men while neglecting  those of women. Furthermore, studies have shown that history textbooks  discuss the accomplishments of men exponentially more often than those  of women. This should change.   The contributions and experiences of American women deserve  celebration and recognition, and I can think of few better ways to  celebrate and recognize American women than by establishing a women's  history museum at the Smithsonian, our country's preeminent museum and  research institution.   The Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act mirrors the highly  successful National Museum of African American History and Culture Act.  Like that bill, this bill calls for a 50-50 split between Federal and  non-Federal funding, a model that worked very well for the National  Museum of African American History and Culture.   The House Administration Committee considered this legislation at a  hearing with Secretary Lonnie Bunch in September. During our markup in  November, we agreed to an amendment offered by the minority to ensure  diversity of political viewpoints in exhibits and programs.   Women have come a long way since the Daughters of Liberty began  boycotting British goods and organizing protests in the 1760s. But  despite how far we have come, we still have a long way to go. I am  hopeful that today, a century after women were granted the right to  vote, we will take a critical step in creating a museum to recognize  these achievements and inspire our daughters and our daughters'  daughters to follow in the footsteps of the incredible women who came  before them as we continue our unending work to form a more perfect  Union.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, we are fortunate that the author of this  bill, the gentlewoman from New York, is here with us today. She is  someone who has been pursuing this idea for our country for so many  years, and she would never give up until we got to this day.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), who has been tireless and persistent. We  would not be here today without the effort of Chairwoman Maloney.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), who is a leader for women in Congress and in  the country.    Madam Speaker, our speakers have all been detained at  markup so I would invite the gentleman to close, and then I will also  close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I will just say a few words here in closing.   First, I again thank Carolyn Maloney, who, for the last 22 years, has  worked to be here on this day.   I think it took Carolyn 22 years, a female Speaker of the House, 101  women in the House, and a female chair of the Committee on House  Administration to come together and get to this day where I believe we  are going to finally approve this bill and send it over to the Senate.  Hopefully, it will be such a large vote that the Senate will feel a  degree of pressure to do the right thing.   Madam Speaker, just a word of caution on how long it takes after we  vote to approve this and the Senate, hopefully, and the President,  hopefully, will sign it, if we pass it.   Secretary Lonnie Bunch is the secretary for the Smithsonian Museum.  He has done a fabulous job. But one of his claims to fame is that he  brought the National Museum of African American History from an idea to  reality. He knows how to do this. And he cautioned us that from the  moment you say go to the moment you open the doors to the museum, it is  about 10 years.   You have to raise the money. You have to get the scholars to do the  scholarship and the exhibition. So unless you take that first step, you  don't get there.   That is the advice he gave us last September: If you don't take the  first step, you never get there. So this is the first step, and it is  an important one.   Madam Speaker, I want to say that along with the fabulously important  and famous women who this museum will honor, it is also going to go to  the heart of America, the women who maybe weren't famous but built the  country, the women like my mother, who walked out of their homes and  built airplanes so the United States could win World War II; the women  who raised their children, who worked many jobs, who ran the PTA, who  helped form the next generation; the women who are the beating heart of  this country will be honored by this museum.   Madam Speaker, you really don't know where you are going unless you  have some sense of where you came from. That is why this museum will  help all American women and men to have a brighter American future.   I will just say this: We do not fool ourselves that having this  wonderful museum will solve all the problems that American women face.  We still have no family leave policy in this country, so women are  squeezed between taking care of their children, taking care of aging  parents, not having an opportunity to get time off from work to do the  things that life calls them to do. We still have pay disparity in this  country. We still lack constitutional protections under the equal  rights amendment until we resolve the issue on the latest wonderful  vote in Virginia. All of those things remain.   But this museum will be a point of pride. It will be a touchstone. It  will be something that every boy and girl in America will be able to  know about because it is not going to be just a building. It is going  to be a virtual reality, Secretary Bunch has told us, a virtual reality  throughout the United States.  [[Page H1035]]    Madam Speaker, this is a proud day for this institution. We can  support this bill. We can send it to the Senate and look forward to the  day when we join Congresswoman Maloney in walking through the doors of  the women's history museum.   Madam Speaker, I urge that we support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
