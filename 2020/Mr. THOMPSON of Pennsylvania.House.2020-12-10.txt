 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of Charles DaBella, Jr., known to his family and friends as  Chuckie.   Chuckie was a resident of Hastings, Cambria County, Pennsylvania. He  passed away at the age of 52 this summer on June 29 after a devastating  motorcycle accident.   Chuckie's sister, Charlene, said: ``Chuck was an amazing soldier,  brother, father, and son.''   His military legacy is one that he and his family can certainly and  forever be proud of. Chuckie was a retired Army infantryman with 13  years of service. He was with the 3rd Special Forces Group, a Green  Beret, senior parachutist, and Army range qualified, earning the bronze  German Armed Forces Badge of Marksmanship.   Chuckie was also the recipient of four Purple Hearts and the Bronze  Star.   The pain that comes from the loss of a loved one never truly fades,  but I want the DaBella family to know that they are in my thoughts, and  my prayers are with them during this incredibly difficult time. We are  proud of the service and legacy that Chuckie has left.    May God watch over Chuck, who left us far too soon.                            ____________________
