 Mr. Speaker, I rise to inquire of the majority leader  the schedule for next week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield formally to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), my friend, the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   As it relates to the reconciliation bill that the Budget Committee  will be taking up tomorrow, the initial estimates on that bill are that  it would, roughly, add up to be about $3.5 trillion in new taxes and  spending.   There are now estimates that that number will mushroom to well over  $4.2, $4.3 trillion or higher, but we still don't have a CBO score on  the lion's share of that legislation. The word we are getting from CBO,  it may be weeks or months that we would get that score.   Does the gentleman know what the timeline is for getting an actual  estimate from CBO on what the cost of that legislation is and will be,  come tomorrow, when the Budget Committee takes it up?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Then last week, I think we had about a dozen committees in Congress  that took up different parts of that bill. Unfortunately, it seems that  the cost keeps going up.   Could we get an assurance that before the bill actually comes to the  floor for a vote before this House, we would get a CBO score to know  how many trillions of dollars in new taxes and in new spending would be  included and voted on before the House?    And, obviously, paid for would include new taxes--   --including things like that are in this bill. There is a  tax on natural gas, which every family in America that uses natural gas  to heat their homes in winter or cool their homes in summer would have  to pay.   I know that President Biden had committed that nobody making under  $400,000 would pay any new amount in taxes. Clearly, that provision of  the bill would violate President Biden's pledge.   I am not sure if the gentleman anticipates new taxes like that being  removed from the bill so that the President's pledge would not be  violated.   If you have any insight on that, I would be happy to yield.    Does the gentleman know if there is a possibility that  the bill before the Budget Committee tomorrow, because they did  expedite that hearing--just yesterday, there wasn't supposed to be a  Budget Committee on Saturday to take up the reconciliation bill, so,  clearly, it has been sped up. Is that because there is a possibility  that the reconciliation bill could be voted on before the House next  week?    Does the gentleman have any idea on when we would find  that out?    Well, I will be watching, for sure.    We all will.   On Monday, the schedule shows that the infrastructure bill is  supposed to be coming up before the House floor. Is that going to be  for debate and consideration, or will there be an actual vote on Monday  night on the infrastructure bill?    Well, we will be very involved in that debate as well.   As it relates to the next few weeks, there has been some talk that  possibly the week of October 4 or beyond may be taken back as district  work schedules to come back here.   Does the gentleman have any insight into what the schedule holds from  October 4 and beyond?    Well, we know that next week we anticipate, as the end  of  [[Page H5161]]  the fiscal year comes, that there would be the continuing resolution  possibly coming out of the Senate.   I know when it came out of the House, it was very clear that the  Senate was not going to entertain the debt ceiling as part of the  continuing resolution. So, clearly, the Senate is going to have to  resolve what happens with the debt ceiling, although we have been told  extraordinary measures would continue through October. So that is not  as looming of a deadline as the September 30 government funding  deadline that the CR would be involved with.   I know, on our side, we were very disappointed to see when something  had to be pulled out on Tuesday, whether it was going to be the Iron  Dome funding or the debt ceiling. Knowing that the Senate was not going  to process the debt ceiling as part of that instrument, it would have  seemed, to keep that on track, to remove the debt ceiling and deal with  that separately, as the Senate ultimately will have to, and then keep  the CR with the Iron Dome funding moving forward on something that  could be a bipartisan vote.   Obviously, that didn't happen Tuesday. I would expect we will see  something very different happen in the Senate. They may send that back  to us sometime next week.    Does the gentleman have a timeline for what we should expect on  legislation dealing with the funding of government prior to the  September 30 deadline?    Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the gentleman that if you  go back, both Republican and Democrat Presidents, whether it was a  Republican Congress or a Democrat Congress, you had budget agreements  that involved both agreements on spending and on debt. Bipartisan  agreements.   The gentlemen should also recognize that this year there has been no  such effort to reach out to the Republican side to get agreements. The  gentleman is well-aware that under President Biden, while he promised  during the campaign that he would work with everybody, he would work  with Republicans, work with Democrats, instead, it has been a go-it- alone strategy on spending and on debt.   Very much to our opposition, we were against the trillions of new  spending. We weren't consulted about the debt.    Mr. Speaker, I will yield, but I first need to point  out, because the gentleman did mention, that when we cut taxes, the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act, that cutting taxes reduced revenue to the Treasury.  Maybe under a liberal ideology that is the thought process of how  economics would work, but that is not how economics worked, and it is  not how reality worked.   When we cut taxes, we actually kick-started our economy. We brought  millions of jobs back to America, and the Federal Treasury took in more  money. Cutting taxes brought in more revenue to the Treasury. In fact,  if you go look at States like New York that raised taxes to try to go  after millionaires and billionaires and picking winners and losers and  dividing people, as they raise tax rates, they see people moving out of  their State, less revenue.   In America, when we saw higher and higher tax rates ultimately  getting to a 35 percent corporate rate, highest in the industrialized  world, what we also  [[Page H5162]]  saw was great companies moving out of America, out of America to be  able to stay afloat, not to avoid paying taxes. They were still paying  taxes. They were just moving to other countries where they could remain  competitive because they could no longer remain competitive in America.   It was by the hundreds that we would see what are called inversions,  great companies moving out of America. Now, on the left, every time  they would move they would wring hands and call the company's name. We  would call the companies, and say, Why are you leaving? They didn't  want to leave. They wanted to stay afloat so that they didn't have to  fire the thousands of America workers they had. They wanted to stay  viable.   So when we cut taxes, do you know since the day the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act was signed into law, there has not been a single inversion in  America. Not a single American company moved out of America. In fact,  the opposite. We saw companies by the droves moving back in. We saw  jobs by the millions coming back to America.    So, again, to give an economics lesson, when we cut taxes the Federal  Treasury actually took in more money, not less, because people created  more jobs in America. They brought jobs back to America.   Companies increased wages. In fact, the biggest wage earners--and you  can go look at the Department of Labor statistics--the bigger wage  earners were lowest-income workers. All that goes away if this bill  coming before the Budget Committee tomorrow is to pass. I hope it  doesn't. But if it does, every economics expert that looks at the  success of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has also recognized that it will  lead to millions more jobs leaving America if they raise those rates.   If you put a natural gas tax on families, estimates are over a 12  percent increase in household electricity rates on families which, by  the way, would hit lower-income people the hardest. That is the reality  of tax increases and tax decreases.   So that brings us to the debt ceiling. The reason we voted against it  were many. One was that, for whatever reason, the majority party  decided to gut the Iron Dome funding that was initially in the bill; a  billion dollars to allow Israel to replenish the Iron Dome missiles  that were used defending themselves against terrorist attacks from  Gaza, fueled by terrorist organizations, and backed by proxies like  Iran. That is one of the driving reasons that you saw all of those  ``no'' votes.   But if you also look at where the debt came from, it came from very  partisan policies. There are 14 different bills this year where the  majority party waived the PAYGO rules. PAYGO was a policy that said,  you pay as you go. You want to pass policy, you want to spend money,  pay for it.   It is a pretty commonsense idea, except on 14 different pieces of  legislation this year, the Democrat majority waived PAYGO, racking up  trillions in new debt. We didn't vote for this spending. If the  majority party wants to go it alone and have a partisan spending spree  that jacks up trillions of new spending and debt, then it is incumbent  upon the majority party to go address the debt ceiling consequences  that were created by this reckless spending.   Fourteen different times your party waived PAYGO. We didn't vote for  that. But then you want us to pay for it? That is not how this works.  If the majority party wants to work with us on a budget agreement, we  are right here. We have never been asked to be a part of a budget  agreement. We surely weren't consulted about the spending because we  opposed those levels.   There were things we wanted to do, including on some of the relief  packages where we felt, let's focus in on helping people who are  struggling, not paying people not to work, not bailing out States that  are flushed with multi-billion dollar surpluses, while sending that  bill to our kids.   That is not responsible, but that is what the majority party did. And  as they jacked up all that spending, they jacked up debt and bumped us  against the debt limit. We are not going to be a part of that because  we didn't agree with the spending. We weren't consulted on the  spending.   If your party wants to spend money, your party ought to be  responsible enough to deal with the consequences of it. We are more  than happy to work with you on how to solve this spending and debt  problem in a bipartisan way, and I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   I do need to correct the Record because the gentleman implied that  the relief packages from 2020 were part of the debt ceiling that is  being raised in the current legislation that is moving forward. That is  just not accurate.   I have seen talking points out there, but Mr. Speaker, if you look at  the trillions that my friend and I supported that were good policy,  that was included in the debt ceiling negotiation from last year. It  was in there. It was part of the debt ceiling negotiation from last  year. That was passed on a bipartisan basis.   What we are talking about for this year, including the $1.9 trillion  that was not a bipartisan package, is new debt. What is being  anticipated in the $4 trillion, $5 trillion-dollar-package that the  Budget Committee is taking up is going to be new debt that would be  included in the debt ceiling negotiation that my friend would expect us  to vote for.   We don't support that new spending and that new debt. We did support  the spending and the debt from last year in the relief packages that we  all supported--and we paid for it--in the debt ceiling negotiations  from last year. The gentleman might have different talking points, but  that is a fact. It was legislation that was voted on in a bipartisan  fashion.    It was voted on on a bipartisan basis and was passed by  Congress. Where the debt ceiling is today is ultimately going to be  negotiated in the Senate, but it won't be in the bill that was sent  over to the Senate on Tuesday.   The Senators have made it clear. They don't have 60 votes for that  bill. It is a 60-vote bill. They might have to take it up under a  reconciliation package. That is for the Senate to decide. Maybe in the  next few days the Senate will decide that and send it back, but that  was not something that anybody expected the Senate to pass when it left  the House on Tuesday.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Again, this will continue as we see whatever comes out  of the Budget Committee that will be trillions. We know it is  trillions. We just don't know how many, maybe 4, maybe 5 trillion in  new debt that the date that was put in the legislative text--it wasn't  an amount, it was a date that the majority party included--in December  of 2022 that maybe that changes in the Senate, but it would include the  trillions, not only that were included in the $1.9 from earlier this  year that was partisan, but also on this tax-and-spend bill that is  moving through Budget tomorrow.   I would like to ask one final question about other potential  legislation for next week. I know the gentleman and I have had  conversations in the past about bills that maybe aren't currently  scheduled that could be, some of them have been added to the schedule,  not all.   We know there is a crisis at our southern border. There are a number  of legislative instruments that have been filed to try to confront it.  I haven't seen any of those come to the floor. They are surely not  listed for next week, but there are a number I would at least like to  bring to the gentleman's attention to see if they could--as we are  watching the border get even more out of hand--potentially give tools  to the President to address it in a way where he is not addressing it  today.   We know there has been a bill by Ms. Herrell, the number of that bill  is H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act, which would allow for enforcement of Title  42 in a way more clear than the administration has expressed their  abilities.   We also have H.R. 4828 by Mr. Katko which gives even more additional  tools to help secure the border.   I would hope the gentleman would look at those legislative  instruments. As there are maybe more days we will be here than there  are legislative instruments anticipated, these could be other bills  that we could take up that would deal with very pertinent and serious  problems that our country is facing that aren't being addressed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that, and I look forward to  having those conversations with the gentleman from Maryland on that and  all the other issues that will come before us next week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
