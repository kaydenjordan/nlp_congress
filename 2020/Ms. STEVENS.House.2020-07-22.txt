 Madam Speaker, Congressman John Lewis was the embodiment  of human prosperity as measured by love. Not only was he the richest  man I have ever known, but he was absolutely the most generous. John  Lewis gave out love and, boy, did love come back. He was always  showering people in love.   When I saw him in Kentucky long before I knew I would ever join this  Chamber at the encouragement of a friend from Georgia, he was talking  about Comic-Con and that his new book with pictures, ``March,'' had  just come out.   We have so much work to do. John Lewis, we will heed your words. We  will not despair. We will look up. We will keep moving and marching  forward. We will pass that Voting Rights Act. And we will remain  dedicated to your pursuits.
