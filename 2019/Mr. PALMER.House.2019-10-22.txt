 Madam Speaker, calling this a constitutional impeachment  process is a farce and a gross misrepresentation of what is taking  place. The entire process has flown in the face of precedent,  procedure, and decency, with no regard whatsoever for the good of the  country. It is politics at perhaps the worst we have seen in our  Nation's history.   The Democrats started their effort to depose President Trump even  before he took office, starting with the Russia collusion hoax.   Witness interviews are being conducted behind closed doors while  Members of Congress, who have the responsibility to vote on the  testimony of these witnesses, are shut out.   The chairman of the Intelligence Committee is having secret phone  calls, talking with alleged whistleblowers, and withholding information  from Members of Congress and the public that is vital to this inquiry.   This is shameful. This is really a conspiracy to remove a duly  elected President.   The Democrat majority is engaged in an effort to conduct a trial with  a predetermined outcome to remove President Trump from office using  tactics unbecoming and unfitting the Republic we serve and this House.   This is not a legitimate inquiry; it is a coup attempt. It is time to  stop this charade.                            ____________________
