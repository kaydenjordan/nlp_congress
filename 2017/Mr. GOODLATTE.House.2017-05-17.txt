Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2266, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We are here today to address an imposing threat to one of the  foundational aspects of our economy, the national bankruptcy system. A  well-functioning bankruptcy system provides relief to consumers, allows  businesses to reorganize, preserves jobs, maximizes the value of  assets, and ensures the proper allocation of resources. Our bankruptcy  judiciary is the heartbeat that keeps this system moving. If that  judiciary is strained and undermanned, that system will grind to a  halt, eliminating the essential benefits it provides and sending  repercussions throughout the economy.   There are presently 29 temporary bankruptcy judgeships in the  bankruptcy system with a lapse date of May 25. These temporary  judgeships comprise more than 8 percent of the current bankruptcy  judgeships nationwide. After May 25, 2017, these judgeships are at risk  of being permanently lost, resulting in larger caseloads shared by  fewer judges and causing further strain on our judiciary system.   The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017 converts 14 of the existing  temporary judgeships to permanent status and creates 4 new permanent  bankruptcy judgeships in districts with some of the highest caseloads  in the country. In fact, since the enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse  Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, when a majority of the  temporary judgeships were created, these districts have seen weighted  filings increase by more than 55 percent.   This bill is based on a comprehensive study of judicial resource  needs conducted by the Judicial Conference and is supported by the  Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The Conference has assured us  that its request comes only after it has taken steps to maximize all  other alternatives to reduce judicial workloads. Moreover, the  Conference has demonstrated that, while a district may have a permanent  judgeship, it will not be filled unless completely necessary.   Importantly, this bill will not present any new costs for the  taxpayers. The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act includes an increase in the  quarterly U.S. Trustee fees for large chapter 11 debtors, excluding  small businesses. This fee increase is directly tied to the balance of  the United States Trustee System Fund and will only be applied when the  balance of the fund falls below a $200 million threshold, thereby  ensuring that the Office of the U.S. Trustee is properly funded.   These temporary bankruptcy judgeships were first set to lapse in  2010. Most have been extended for over 12 years, and some even longer.  Despite this committee's efforts to address the issue, to date there  have been only limited, short-term fixes. Additional permanent  bankruptcy judgeships have not been authorized since 1992.   The time has come for Congress to address bankruptcy judgeship needs  more permanently. We need a bankruptcy system that has a sufficient  number of judges to be able to manage the caseloads in a just,  economical, and timely manner. The efficiency of this system is too  important to our economy to risk. This bill helps ensure that we have  such a system.   I would like to thank Ranking Member Conyers for his efforts on this  issue. I would also like to thank Regulatory Reform, Commercial and  Antitrust Law Subcommittee Chairman Marino and Ranking Member Cicilline  for joining me as original cosponsors of the bill. I urge my colleagues  to vote in favor of this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, permanent bankruptcy judgeships have not been authorized  since 1992. Over the past 25 years, we have limited our protection of  the bankruptcy system to short-term temporary fixes. A well-functioning  bankruptcy system, however, is too important to our economy to risk.  Now is the time for Congress to address bankruptcy judgeship needs more  permanently.   The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act is a measured, long-term solution  carefully crafted and based on the well-developed recommendation of the  Administrative Office of the Courts. Not only does it ensure the  viability of our bankruptcy  [[Page H4248]]  system, but it also addresses the funding concerns of the Office of the  United States Trustee.   This bill is a bipartisan measure that enjoys broad support from  outside groups, including the American Bar Association, the Federal Bar  Association, the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, and the  American College of Bankruptcy. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 419) to require adequate reporting on the Public Safety  Officers' Benefits program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 419         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

DUE DILIGENCE IN PAYING BENEFIT CLAIMS.         ``(a) In General.--The Bureau, with all due diligence,       shall expeditiously attempt to obtain the information and       documentation necessary to adjudicate a benefit claim filed       under this part, including a claim for financial assistance       under subpart 2.        ``(b) Sufficient Information Unavailable.--If a benefit       claim filed under this part, including a claim for financial       assistance under subpart 2, is unable to be adjudicated by       the Bureau because of a lack of information or documentation       from a third party, such as a public agency, and such       information is not readily available to the claimant, the       Bureau may not abandon the benefit claim unless the Bureau       has utilized the investigative tools available to the Bureau       to obtain the necessary information or documentation,       including subpoenas.''.       SEC. 5. PRESUMPTION THAT OFFICER ACTED PROPERLY.         Section 1202 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and       Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796a) is amended--        (1) by striking ``No benefit'' and inserting the following:        ``(a) In General.--No benefit''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(b) Presumption.--In determining whether a benefit is       payable under this part, the Bureau--        ``(1) shall presume that none of the limitations described       in subsection (a) apply; and        ``(2) shall not determine that a limitation described in       subsection (a) applies, absent clear and convincing       evidence.''.       SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICABILITY.         The amendments made by this Act shall--        (1) take effect on the date of enactment of this Act; and        (2) apply to any benefit claim or application under part L       of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act       of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796 et seq.) that is--        (A) pending before the Bureau of Justice Assistance on the       date of enactment; or        (B) received by the Bureau on or after the date of       enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 419, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in 1976 Congress passed and the President signed into  law the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act. The act was designed to  offer peace of mind to men and women seeking careers as public safety  officers, namely, that if something happened to them in their dangerous  roles, their families would have support.   It shows that America places enormous value on those in our  communities who protect and serve, those whose response to danger is to  face it head-on and who put others before themselves daily.   The PSOB program, administered by the Department of Justice, provides  death benefits in the form of a one-time financial payment to eligible  survivors of public safety officers who have died in the line of duty.   The program also provides benefits to public safety officers who are  permanently and totally disabled because of injuries sustained in the  line of duty.   Finally, the PSOB program provides financial assistance to help pay  higher education costs for the spouses and children of public safety  officers who have died or been injured in the line of duty.  [[Page H4250]]    It is a program that is meant to help the loved ones of fallen  officers move forward in the aftermath of tragedies.   Unfortunately, in recent years, the PSOB program has had some  incidents of delay, and some families were left in the dark about the  status of applications. These families were unable to move forward  after their tragic losses, and we recognize that is not acceptable for  a family that has sacrificed so much for their communities.   Legislation was introduced in the last Congress, and again this  Congress as S. 419, to address these regrettable failings. This bill  provides for transparency in the processing of claims in the PSOB  program and codifies measures to ensure the system is streamlined and  operates in a fair manner.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleagues for their work and strong  support of these law enforcement families. I would especially like to  commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. King) for his unwavering  support of the families of law enforcement.   In his second inaugural address, President Lincoln reminded the  American people: ``To care for him who shall have borne the battle and  for his widow and his orphan.'' This legislation is designed to do  exactly that for the brave men and women in blue who protect and serve  all of us every day.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday this bill passed the Senate unanimously. I  urge my colleagues to support this important legislation today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  only to say that I very much appreciate the work on both sides of the  aisle, particularly the gentleman from Michigan.   This is a good, bipartisan bill which should be passed today. I urge  my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 583) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control  and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize COPS grantees to use grant  funds to hire veterans as career law enforcement officers, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to Dave  Reichert for taking the lead on this very appropriate Special Order to  recognize our Nation's law enforcement. No one better represents that  law enforcement here in the United States Congress than former Sheriff  Reichert. And I thank him for not only his leadership in the House but  also for his service as a sheriff for many years prior to his election  to Congress.   Our Nation was founded on the rule of law. The Preamble to the United  States Constitution stated that its purpose was, in part, to  ``establish justice'' and ``insure domestic tranquility.'' Every day,  law enforcement officers carry out this legacy. They fight crime,  promote justice, and keep the peace. They patrol late at night and  early in the morning, while we sleep in the comforts of our homes.   And over the past 16 years, our Nation's law enforcement officers  have often been the first to respond to terrorist attacks. On that  fateful day, nearly 16 years ago, first responders were running into  the crumbling towers as everyone else was running out. Following the  Boston Marathon bombings in April of 2013, Boston police responded  immediately to aid the wounded and implement emergency plans. That  legacy has carried on through the recent catastrophes in San  Bernardino, Orlando, and too many others.   Sadly, many law enforcement officers have made the ultimate sacrifice  on our behalf. Just this year already, 50 law enforcement officers have  died in the line of duty, including Deputy Sheriff Curtis Allen  Bartlett of Carroll County, Virginia, who was killed in a vehicle crash  while responding to assist another deputy and a Virginia State Police  trooper who were involved in a pursuit. These are tragic reminders that  our law enforcement professionals face danger every day as they carry  out their duties.    Chillingly, in recent years, police officers have increasingly become  targets for violence and ambush-style attacks. Tomorrow, this House  will vote to ensure that State and local law enforcement officers  receive the same protections as their Federal counterparts. In fact,  this week, the House will pass more than half a dozen bills to help  officers do their jobs and return home safely.   As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have the privilege to work  with Federal law enforcement. All too often, we fail to recognize how  the dedicated men and women of law enforcement make sacrifices to  promote law and order and keep our neighborhoods safe. That is true at  every level: our local police and sheriff's deputies, our State police,  and Federal law enforcement officers in many different departments of  the Department of Justice and other agencies.   As a father, grandfather, husband, and citizen, the men and women in  blue have my profound respect and sincere thanks.
