 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Civilian  Conservation Center Enhancement Act.   The worsening climate crisis has wrought destruction across the  country, and Oregon is not immune from that devastation.   Every year, our wildfire season becomes more severe. In fact, right  now, there are 19 active wildfires in Oregon alone, burning thousands  of acres, threatening properties, and upending daily life for hundreds  of Oregonians.   Yet as the risk of wildfire has grown, our wildland firefighting  capacity has fallen far behind, and that is where the Civilian  Conservation Center Enhancement Act comes in.   This bill will actually cut through the red tape to ensure the Forest  Service can hire brave Americans who are ready, willing, and able to  battle these blazes.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Representatives Hoyle, Guthrie,  and Edwards, for their support of this bill, and I look forward to  seeing its passage.                            ____________________
