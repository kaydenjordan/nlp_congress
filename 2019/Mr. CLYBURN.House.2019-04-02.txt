 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, back in 1966, at a healthcare conference, the late  Martin Luther King, Jr., said: ``Of all the forms of inequality,  injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane.''   I often think of the debate back in 2009 and 2010 when we were trying  to pass the Affordable Care Act. I remember one day I was conducting a  call-in program on the local radio station. A gentleman called in and  said to me: I want you to keep your hands off of my health insurance. I  like what I have got, and I don't want you and President Obama messing  with it.                                time  1715    I assured the gentleman that we were going to do nothing to interrupt  his relationship with his insurance company or his policy.   But then a little while later, a lady called in, and she said,  Congressman, I don't have a question, but I would like to say something  to the gentleman who just called in. I want to say to him that I had  insurance for 30 years, and I thought I liked it, until I tried to use  it. When I went for my second treatment for breast cancer, I got a  notice, she said, from the insurance company that I had used up my  lifetime of benefits.   And then she said, I would like to say to that gentleman, Maybe he  likes what he has because he has never tried to use it.   And that is what you have reference to here when you talk about junk  policies. What we did with the Affordable Care Act was to make  healthcare accessible and affordable for all American citizens.   We created the possibilities of States expanding Medicaid so that  low-income people could have access to healthcare.   And if you want to know a little bit about what can be done if we  were to, in some way, get rid of the Affordable Care Act, just look at  the States that have refused to expand Medicaid; the number of low- income people today who still do not have access to healthcare.   Think about those middle-income families who had a family member get  sick and find out that they are in bankruptcy because they are trying  to pay the bills.   The Affordable Care Act is an attempt, like everything else ought to  be here.   If we are talking about education, it ought to be accessible and  affordable.   If you are talking about housing, it should be accessible and  affordable.   Healthcare; accessible and affordable.   And we all know that until we passed the Affordable Care Act,  healthcare was not accessible and affordable for all Americans.   We hear the slogan that takes place throughout this country. We don't  need to Make America Great Again. America is great. It has always been  great. That is not our challenge.   Our challenge, it seems to me, is to make the greatness of America  accessible and affordable to all Americans; apply it fairly and  equitably.   That, to me, is what this country is all about.   So I want to thank you, my friend from California, Mr. Garamendi, I  want to thank you for all the work that you are doing on H.R. 1884,  because I think before we go home this week, we are going to pass a  resolution, a resolution to condemn this administration for attempting  to legally take away healthcare from so many citizens.   And I want to close with this: You talk about preexisting conditions.  I think that people tend to think about preexisting conditions in a way  that deals with people that they know or can relate to. I want all of  our listeners, and those looking on, to just think of what you are  doing.   If you say to a child born with diabetes, a child who didn't ask to  come here, and even if that child could ask to come, they certainly  wouldn't ask to come sick. Diabetes; born with it.   And then the insurance company says that it is a preexisting  condition and you cannot come on to your family's insurance policies.   If we cannot see the wrongness in that, I am not too sure anything  anybody says about anything can be ever wrong in your eyesight.   So I want to thank you so much for the work that you are doing here.  I want to thank the American people for keeping our focus on making  healthcare accessible and affordable for all Americans.
