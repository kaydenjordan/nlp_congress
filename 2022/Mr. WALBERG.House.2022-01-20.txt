 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, having done this many times  over the course of the past 14 years, to speak on behalf of life  itself. It is the first and foremost gift that is given to us, and I  think of the over 60 million children who have been taken out of that  opportunity.   It is my hope that we will never have to march again for the repeal  of Roe v. Wade after the Supreme Court decides but, rather, that we  stand and continue to march for life and the freedom of opportunities  for individuals to not only  [[Page H273]]  grow and be benefited by the greatness of this country but also to  bring the greatness of this country.   Life is a gift of God. It can only be sustained by people who  understand that same gift, and I just pray that the Supreme Court and,  ultimately, Congress and the legislatures of our land will stand for  life.                            ____________________
