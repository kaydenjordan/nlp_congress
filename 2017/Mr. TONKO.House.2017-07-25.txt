 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding.   Certainly I understand the anger, Representative Garamendi, and I  know I am not alone. I know all of my colleagues are hearing the  outbursts in our given districts about the foolishness and the hard- heartedness of taking away a very valuable asset. Healthcare coverage  is so important now to the American public, but in a particular way, it  is near and dear to those who most recently realized that coverage.   I will tell you, being on this floor when the Affordable Care Act was  passed, that was a monumental effort. It was difficult to launch that  program. It took a lot of hard work, years of messaging, going to  hearings, working those amendments that were suggested into the  discussion, and making certain that the package met the mission that we  embarked upon. So it is important now to make certain that we only go  forward and upward from this moment.   Like many programs before the Affordable Care Act--Social Security,  Medicare, Medicaid--they were difficult to launch; but unlike those  programs, Congress and the Presidents in those given eras came forward  and said: Okay. What did we learn from that launch? How can we improve  upon the package? How can we strengthen some of the dynamics of  concern?   Here we have people, as you indicated, that are not only unwilling to  make those reforms possible, but disguising what they call healthcare  reform in the name of a tax package for the wealthy. How vulgar is  that, when you can sweep the dollars, the savings from denying people  healthcare coverage, and utilize it to relieve taxes for those most  comfortable in our society? For those 400 households of which you  spoke, the on-average relief was on the order of $7 million. Imagine  that: taking away healthcare from people who live paycheck to paycheck  in some cases, and using that to provide for tax relief for those most  comfortable.   That is not in keeping with the spirit of this legislation. It is not  in keeping with the harmony that was necessary to create this  legislation.   The spirit was to speak to the fundamental needs of healthcare for  individuals and families across this country to be able to get past  difficult moments and situations like preexisting conditions,  preexisting conditions that can be with an individual toddler from the  moment of birth, as we have heard in the news.   This hard-hearted approach, this senseless attitude, this insensitive  expression to Americans across this country by these reform efforts,  today we know that the United States Senate went forth with a vote to  proceed on their efforts. What will it be? Straightforward repeal, as  the President recommends, where 30-plus million people lose their  healthcare coverage, you rip it away from those tens of millions? Or  will it be repeal and delay? Or will it be repeal and replace?   So far with the iterations, the versions of healthcare reform that  have come forth from this House, that were approved in this House and  sent over to the Senate, those devised by the Senate have been  heartless.   This is about expressing compassion, about being just and fair.   Just this weekend I was with groups of constituents. The first that  comes to mind is a fundraising effort for individuals who live with  cystic fibrosis. Before I was even to walk into the room, where  hundreds of people gathered to support the efforts for this cause,  individual sets of parents came to me and said: Keep up the fight to  keep Medicaid in the equation.                                time  1845    Our daughter, our son, can't do it without Medicaid. And these people  were proud of their given children, adult children, in some cases, who  had graduated with honors, played athletics and were athletes, star  athletes in their high school years who, then, earned full scholarships  to college. And his daughter made him most proud; he cited that moment  of pride when he witnessed her on her campus wheeling her IV to class.   That is what we see out there, motivation, inspiration, respect for  people who live with difficult challenges in life. And we were  responding as a compassionate society, one that should separate us from  the rest of the world because, within our abundance, we want to share  that with everybody.   And it is so wonderful, Representative Garamendi, that you would  bring that quote from the memorial, that speaks to the abundance of  those who have where we are, evidently, with some of the constructs of  legislation here, adding to that abundance, at the expense of those who  have precious little. And so we can do better than this.   One other gathering that I attended was for developmentally disabled,  differently-abled individuals whose programs focus and strengthen their  abilities, focus upon and strengthen their abilities; again, people  approaching me saying: Keep up the fight for Medicaid.   We cannot, our consumers cannot, do it. Our loved ones cannot do it  without Medicaid. And I think the rejection of Medicaid expansion in  this House that was offered by this House, by this town, by Washington,  to the many States across the country, the rejection by those States, I  believe, was sheer politics. And so, we denied people in States who pay  Federal taxes the benefits of Medicaid expansion.   What sense does that make? What heart does that show? We are better  than that. We are better than that.   Finally, I will say this, because I know we have colleagues who are  looking to share their thoughts and their stories. I looked at some  constituents this weekend, in the eyes, and in heartfelt conversation  said: Do you think it is fair, do you think it is just to rip away  healthcare from people so you can afford a tax cut for the very  wealthy? Is it fair to deny preexisting condition coverage for  individuals? Is it unfair to take it away?   What about the essential health benefits package, those of our  neighbors and friends who struggle, who live with mental illness and  mental health disorders, those who are dealing with the illness of  addiction? Is it fair not to help them?   I looked at them, and I said: Okay, I know who you voted for. This is  a nation where we have the freedom of choice. But when we vote for  whomever, it is also our duty, our responsibility to see if they are  acting accordingly. Do you think your candidate of choice is being fair  and just?   They couldn't answer me about that situation. They wanted to redirect  the conversation. Why?   Because I think it is difficult to say that people, leaders in this  town, the President and leaders in the House and the leaders in the  Senate, are not listening to America; and so it is unfair to utilize  the sweeping of services, of healthcare and response to tens of  millions of individuals and families, and utilize those dollars for a  tax cut for the wealthy.   We are going to watch this aggressively, with laser sharp focus. The  people of America have spoken. They are continuing to speak. They don't  like the injustices. They don't like the unfairness. They don't like  the calculated ripping away of healthcare insurance for tens of  millions of people. Whether it is 30, 23, 22, 21, whatever the  iteration, shame on us for allowing something like that to happen.   America deserves to be--as an industrialized nation that did not have  access, affordability, and quality of care as givens for many  households in this country, they need to express those terms in a much  better format.  [[Page H6289]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Garamendi for leading us in a  discussion this hour to alert people to the fact that the Democrats in  this House are still battling for those families that would have  healthcare coverage ripped from them so that we can afford a tax cut  for the wealthy.    I thank the gentleman from California for yielding, and,  Representative Garamendi, I am so honored to associate my comments with  those of yours, to connect with you in this effort to make certain that  we stop this foolishness coming from this House and the United States  Senate that totally rejects the pleas of Americans across this country  to make certain that the dynamics that drove the Affordable Care Act  still stay in place, and that being affordability, accessibility, and  quality of care. Those are such essential forces. They are the  underpinning of the foundation of the Affordable Care Act.   When I heard your expression of concern here tonight and pinpointing  those various elements of the positive reinforcement that comes from  the Affordable Care Act legislation, hearing the voice of two  Congresswomen here from New Mexico and Ohio on the floor joining us, it  reminds me that our force is the essential force on the Hill in  Washington to make certain that the people's voices are heard. There is  anger out there, there is injustice, there is unfairness, and it has to  be addressed.   I am proud of the efforts that have been made in my State. I know  that you talked about the progress in California. In New York, I am  proud of what the Governor, Governor Cuomo, and the legislature did in  building those exchanges. It took response from each of the 50 States  to make this work, or at least we had hoped each State would respond  fully. But in New York, we are managing that effort through sound  exchanges.    I get worried when I see tweets from the President when things didn't  work for awhile in the Senate, when they couldn't move forward with the  repeal or repeal and delay or repeal and replace: Well, we will just  let the Affordable Care Act die of its own right.   What are you talking about? That sounds to me like a poor attitude,  one that wouldn't do the very best to underpin, through the agencies  that are connected to this legislation, to reinforce the markets out  there. That is part of this response.   When I hear an attitude like that expressed, I am concerned about  what the voice over to these agencies will be saying: Look, we need to  be a good partner, a sound partner, an effective partner with the  Affordable Care Act.   I don't know if we would get that. So that worries me if your  attitude is let it just die and crumble. Why? Why can't you put the  American public before politics?   Let's do our best effort. Let's, in earnest, do our best. Let's be  genuine in our approach.   I think it is absolutely incredible. You know, as the Republicans,  Representative Garamendi, in the Senate race to pass TrumpCare, a bill  that would rip coverage away from tens of millions of people, perhaps  as many as 30 million--if you would allow me to share a few stories  from my district, I think it is so important to put a face onto these  discussions. I have documented some of the recent stories we have heard  from constituents.   Cathryn, a 30-year-old in my district, left work to return to school  to pursue graduate studies in social work, and she used the ACA  exchange, their plans, to bridge gaps in employer-based coverage.                                time  1915    The ACA plans provided her with essential preventative healthcare  services and ensured that a major health event would not leave her  bankrupt as she was doing what we asked people to do: develop your  talent and your skills to serve the general public.   So she was pursuing graduate studies. The security and affordability  of Catherine's ACA plan was tremendously reassuring, allowing her to  take risks in order to build a career in service to others. That is  what the ACA afforded Catherine to do, a 30-year-old in my district.   Robert, a 52-year-old in my district, purchased insurance on a  healthcare exchange while suffering from diabetes. Before buying an  exchange plan, Robert spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars each month  just to purchase insulin, and no other health coverage.   Because of the ban on discrimination that could be utilized against  him based on his preexisting conditions, Robert can now afford a health  plan that covers himself and his family.   A couple of other examples, if you will allow me.   Tracey, a 38-year-old from my district, a certified nursing  assistant, needs multiple drug prescriptions to treat preexisting  conditions, including diabetes. The Affordable Care Act has made it  possible for Tracey to get health coverage for herself and her family.  Without the ACA, Tracey would not be able to pay her doctors or her  drug companies. As recently as January, Tracey was still paying off old  bills for her medical care.   This has provided hope for people. We need to make certain we don't  have people digging deeper into their pockets for healthcare coverage.  We want to relieve that pressure that is upon them. We want to make  prescription drugs affordable. We want to make certain that  efficiencies are there in the system so we can save, but get the care  to people.   That is the difference that we need to cite here. The contrast is  that we are trying to make this ACA better and make it work, and we are  asking for a bipartisan, bicameral, executive legislative partnership  to make it better. Is that too much to ask?   Let me share one more story.   Elliot, a 56-year-old in the 20th Congressional District of New York  lost his job in September last year after his company made a massive  layoff, even though he just started his job. So through no fault of his  own, he lost his employment. Elliot was then left to figure out how to  support himself and his 19-year-old son who was a Syracuse University  student. A COBRA plan would have cost $2,000 a month. Because of  Medicaid, Elliot and his son now have quality health coverage as Elliot  continues to look for work and his son is pursuing his college  education.   These are real stories, real hardships, real challenges, real help,  real assistance that has come in the way of these families. We don't  need to take that good news and suffocate it. We need to build upon  these stories.   Now, Senate Republicans are racing to pass a bill that would open the  doors to less coverage, rip it away from tens of millions of people,  and in many ways perhaps provide for an imposition of lifetime limits  on care.   What does that do?  [[Page H6292]]    It is a death sentence for far too many people. It would impact  severely upon those who are struggling with cancer--working their  hardest to defeat that, working with their doctor, their medical  community to defeat that impact of cancer in their lives--heart  disease, and other long-term illnesses.   My friends, this is about being a compassionate voice. It is about  utilizing the advancements in medical care, technology, making  affordable our healthcare system, making affordable prescription drug  costs.   There is improvements that we want to make, not give a tax cut for  the rich, which has been a terrible response. People would say: Oh, the  Affordable Care Act is not working.   So if there were improvements required, be fair, be only honest with  the public you represent, be there for them.   Finally, the last point I will make right here is Medicaid and the  changing profile of Medicaid in many of our States. In New York, people  need to see where the growth in Medicaid is. And because we have a  disproportionate senior population in upstate New York, you are seeing  the growth of Medicaid the farther north you go.   I ask my colleagues to be sensitive to their constituent base. Don't  be heartless. Don't be cruel in the outcome. Walk away from this.   The silence is deafening at times when it comes to some of the  proposals being sent by leadership in this House and in the Senate.  Silence is not what is called for here. Outspoken rejection of some of  these harsh measures is what we need, and bipartisan cooperation,  bicameral activity is what will serve the public best.   So I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for bringing us  together in what is a very important discussion here in this Special  Order.    To repeat what my colleague just said, I will say that we  want to work with the American public. We have said over and over again  that it is about affordability, accessibility, quality of care. Share  with us the improvements that you think will work. Let us know of the  hurdles in the road that you have faced.   Remind us that Medicaid serves the needs of our parents and  grandparents in nursing homes. Remind us that those who are born with  challenges in life are served well by healthcare coverage and Medicaid.  Remind us that those living with developmental disabilities, showcasing  their abilities requires Medicaid to make it work; chronic illnesses  requiring an insurance clause that addresses preexisting conditions,  building upon an essential health benefits package.   We are with you. We walk with you. We raise our voices with you. We  lift our hearts with you. We want to be victorious with you and for  you. Let's not let them rip away this health insurance for the  opportunity to provide tax cuts for the very wealthy.   Again, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak forcefully  in this given Special Order. It is so important to save the Affordable  Care Act, make it stronger, and respond to the needs of people across  this country who are speaking out.
