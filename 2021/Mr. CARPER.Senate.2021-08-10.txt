 Mr. President, Senator Capito has been very, very  gracious in her thanks and praise, and it is now her turn to be on the  receiving end.   We have all heard of the Gang of 20 or the Gang of 22--the Group of  20 or 22--but before there was a gang or a group of 22, there was a  gang of 1--the Senator from West Virginia, my native State.   She joined in with the President and the President's team to really  get the ball rolling and sort of took the hand off from what we had  done working with the administration, meeting with the administration,  meeting with the President.   But with the President, after our meeting, they decided to engage.  They decided to engage with the Senator.   And, eventually, to use a football analogy here, she might not have  gotten the ball into the end zone, but I say to the Senator, you  certainly got it into the red zone, and we are grateful for all of your  work, and, really, your good humor and good treatment when things were  tough.   Sitting right here on my left is Mary Frances Repko, the staff  director of our EPW Committee on the Democratic side. And she is joined  today, I think, on the floor by John Kane, by Mackie McIntosh, and by  Tyler Hoffman. And we have Adam over here sitting next to the ranking  member--Adam.   I have gone before through the names of your staff, but I will just  say you all are back here, and we are grateful for the great support  and work that you have done, each one of you.   I would be remiss if I didn't thank--you don't get to be floor  managers without somebody in the leadership saying: Well, we would like  you to be floor managers. So to Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell,  thank you for putting your confidence and trust in Senator Capito and  me.   To the floor staff, the folks who work for the leaders, thank you  very much for keeping us on the straight and level and heading in the  right direction.   Rob Portman is still here on the floor. I don't see Kyrsten Sinema.  Rob is here. Rob, Senator Portman, succeeds George Voinovich. He was a  dear  [[Page S6202]]  friend as Governor. We were Governors together and Senators together. I  miss George every day, but you have more than filled his shoes, my  friend, and I salute you for your leadership.   Kyrsten Sinema is relatively new here, but she has really, really  impressed a lot of people, taken the bull by the horns, never gave up,  just wouldn't give up. And because of her efforts and the partnership  she has with Senator Portman, we are here today.   I quoted a couple of times during debate the words of Winston  Churchill. Winston Churchill, when he was thrown out of office at the  end of World War II, was asked as he left 10 Downing Street: Is this  the end?   He replied, famously: This is not the end. This is not the beginning  of the end. This is the end of the beginning. The end of the beginning.  And so it is here with us today.   We are nearing the end of a debate and the final vote on the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021. And before we take a  vote on the adoption of this measure, I just want to take a moment to  reflect briefly on how this bipartisan infrastructure bill came to be.   Senator Capito has already referred to this, but I wanted to  reinforce it. In February of this year, at my encouragement, President  Biden invited Senator Capito, Senator Cardin, Senator Inhofe, and me-- all senior members of the Environment and Public Works Committee--to  the White House to discuss the need to make bold investment in our  Nation's crumbling infrastructure. He asked us, the Environment and  Public Works Committee, to lead the effort to address that need; to get  to work in our committee by crafting and reporting to the full Senate,  to this body, surface transportation legislation--roads, highways,  bridges--as well as drinking water and water sanitation infrastructure,  climate change legislation by springtime. That was the request.   In the weeks that followed, working together with all 22 members--20  members, rather, of the Environment and Public Works Committee, that is  exactly what we did--10 Democrats, 10 Republicans working together. In  May, we reported out of our committee a 5-year transportation bill with  a unanimous bipartisan vote of 20 to 0.   By more than a third, we increased investments in our roads, our  highways, and our bridges, with a historic climate title to help  address the most serious challenge facing our planet, and that is the  threat of global warming.   That Transportation bill is at the core of the legislation we  consider today, along with the drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure legislation that was also reported unanimously out of  the Committee on Environment and Public Works earlier this year and  passed by the full Senate right here, earlier this year, by an 89-to-2  vote.   That bill targets the most impoverished communities across America to  help them meet their drinking and wastewater treatment needs.   I am proud--we are proud--of the work that our committee has done,  made possible by the partnership that we enjoy. I think of the work  that we did--I think of it as laying the foundation. Clean drinking  water, wastewater sanitation, roads, highways, bridges, climate really  are the foundation on which this package was built.   And we tried to provide an example to the rest of the Senate and the  other committees of jurisdiction, and I like to think that maybe we did  that.   Leadership is all about leading, and the President sought and  encouraged us to try to lead earlier this year, and I think we have met  that request and then some. I want to thank him. He didn't give up  either. And he has been negotiating with Senator Capito and negotiating  with the team, the gang of 22. He never gave up. A lot of people said  this was a fool's errand. He never gave up. I am proud of him and the  leadership that he has provided.   The bill that is before this body today builds on the strong  bipartisan work of our committee, Environment and Public Works, as well  as the good work done by our colleagues on other committees--the  Commerce Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee among  them. My appreciation to all who worked so tirelessly on this Herculean  undertaking.    Now, let me be clear. This legislation isn't perfect. It has been  said before. You will hear that again. I have never written a bill that  was perfect, and this certainly, even though we had a fair hand in  writing a lot of it, is not perfect. In spite of making real progress,  it doesn't go as far as we would like to go in advancing equity, the  way we treat other people--the Golden Rule, treating other people the  way we want to be treated--in tackling the existential crisis of our  time, and that is climate change.   There is much more work to do on these issues--issues that, in my  mind, we have a moral obligation to address. So rest assured I will be  joining my colleagues in fighting for progress on these fronts in the  days and weeks ahead.   But let's not make the perfect the enemy of the good. And make no  mistake, the bill before us does a whole lot of good. It is the largest  long-term investment in our Nation's infrastructure in almost a  century--almost a century--and the largest Federal investment in  history when it comes to public transit, clean energy transmission,  climate resiliency, clean drinking water, and wastewater  infrastructure.   Now, on this day, the American people are looking for us to  strengthen our economy and support our communities and build for our  future. On this day, we have a President dedicated to moving past  partisan divides and meeting the moment for our Nation. And on this  day, leaders in this body from across the political spectrum have come  together in shared purpose, in common cause, and commitment to find a  way forward.   I want to close with the thought that there is a lot of bridge money  in here, a lot of money to fix bridges all over: West Virginia,  Delaware, Ohio, Maine. You name it. There is a lot of troubled water in  our country, troubled water. And I would like to think, with this  legislation, crafted together across the aisle, bipartisan, with the  administration, we have created a bridge over troubled waters. Think  about that: a bridge over troubled waters--and right at a time when we  really needed one. And we could use a few more as we go along.   Sometimes when I travel people ask me--they say: What do you do? What  do you do anyway?   They don't know what I do, on the airplane or whatever. I say: I help  people.   They say: How do you help them?   I think the best way we can help people is help them find a job, have  a job where they can support themselves and their families. We can help  make sure that they have clean water to drink. We can help make sure  they have clean air to breathe.   Those are ways that we are helping people with this legislation--big  time, big time--and we will be doing it for a long time.   Colleagues, on this day, we can vote to make a downpayment on a  brighter future for our country. I want to ask you to join me in  seizing the day in voting to advance this legislation together. On this  day, let us seize the day. Carpe diem. Carpe diem.   I yield the floor                      Recognition Of The Majority Leader     Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3330 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, the amendment that I have called up is  clear, it is simple, and it is straightforward. It makes clear that we  are going to address the climate crisis. We are going to do it through  policies that do several things: one, create jobs; two, create jobs  here in the United States; policies that strengthen our economy--all  while reducing the pollution that hurts our health and our environment.   We are in a code red situation. This is all hands on deck when it  comes to the climate crisis. We don't have a moment to waste. We need  to put politics aside and act now on climate change.   The budget resolution should allow us to develop legislation that can  respond to the urgent challenge of climate change.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I would like to speak in opposition to  the amendment. Let me be clear. Colleagues, let me be clear. Let me be  clear.   The EPA is not acting to regulate methane from cows or any other farm  animals. This amendment is designed as a messaging amendment to suggest  that the Agency is undertaking actions that it is not considering.   Democrats are working to advance policies that assist farmers and  ranchers in participating in efforts to address greenhouse gas  emissions in ways that inure to their bottom line.   Methane is a super climate pollutant. It is at least 80 times more  powerful than carbon dioxide in terms of global warming. In order to  stem the tide of climate change, we must reduce methane emissions.   The Biden administration and my Democratic colleagues are laser- focused on making sure our Nation's largest source of methane--the oil  and gas sector--is doing all it can to reduce or eliminate methane  emissions.   The American people should rest assured that no one is focused on  regulating cow emissions, as this amendment would suggest.   I recommend a ``no'' vote. Thank you.
