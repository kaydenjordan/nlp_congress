 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the JavaScouts, a  youth robotics team from my hometown of New Hartford, New York.   In December, the JavaScouts competed in the regional qualifier for  the FIRST Tech Challenge at Sauquoit High School, where they qualified  for the regional championship in New York.   The JavaScouts also received the FIRST Tech Challenge Inspire Award,  which is presented to the team that judges feel acted as a positive  role model to other teams and embraced the challenge of this program.   I would like to extend my congratulations to the JavaScouts team  personally: Keegan Birt, Liam Evans, Kyle Grover, Ari Sprague, Kyle  Tuttle, Jimi Wadnola, and Leon Zong.   I wish the JavaScouts continued success as they move forward to the  regional championship. I take great pride and it is a great honor in  representing these young constituents who place such an emphasis on  determination, ingenuity, and education in achieving these many worthy  goals.                            ____________________
