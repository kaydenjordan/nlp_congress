 Madam Speaker, I couldn't have said that better  myself. I thank the ranking member, my dear friend from the great State  of Texas, for his leadership on this very important trade deal, our  largest and most important relationship of all of our trading  relationships.   I thank our chairman, Chairman Neal, for keeping this thing on track  and keeping people in the game so we could have a bipartisan consensus.  That is the only way this could work, so the chairman is to be  commended for his efforts.   But let's give credit where credit is due, for the one who led the  charge, who did the heavy lifting, our President, Donald J. Trump. I am  saying this because in 2016, he was already calling out some of these  trade deals as a rip-off of American workers and manufacturers.   While NAFTA was a great deal for farmers and ranchers, we saw a 400  percent increase in trade for ag products since the inception of NAFTA.  It hasn't been good all the way around. It hasn't been fair all the way  around. It hasn't been productive, in terms of keeping jobs here in the  United States.                                time  1200    So kudos to our President for his dogged commitment to American-first  trade policies. That doesn't mean America only. It means that we  negotiate from strength, and we negotiate what is in the best interest  of American workers, manufacturers, and farmers.  [[Page H12255]]    That is what this does: $70 billion in economic growth, 170,000 jobs,  and billions in investment that will go into the auto manufacturing  sector.   Our producers, dairy producers and other farmers, are going to have  open access to new customers in Canada, so this is a huge win for  America.   I want to join all my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, and  champion this all the way through. So I urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle, vote ``yes'' for USMCA, and vote for an even  greater America and an even greater prospect for American prosperity.   God bless America.   Go west Texas.    Madam Speaker, I want to first commend my colleague  from New York (Mr. Suozzi) for his passionate advocacy for his  district. I understand where his heart is, I understand his motives, I  know they are pure, and it makes it a lot easier to work with people  who approach public policy that way.   But as I have mentioned to him in committee, I think this is  wrongheaded and fundamentally bad public policy. It certainly is not in  keeping with benefiting the general welfare of the public, restoring  these SALT deductions. I am sure many of these points being made  earlier discourage localities and States from keeping their taxes low.  They also penalize States like Texas who keep their tax rates low, and  the majority of the benefit of these deductions will go to  millionaires. That is not an exaggeration. Over 50 percent of the  benefit will go to people who are millionaires. In fact, 95 percent of  the benefit will go to folks who make over $200,000. That is real money  in west Texas.    Madam Speaker, I think one of the biggest problems I  have with this, ultimately, is we are raising that top rate after we  cut taxes, restored more freedom to the markets, and unleashed growth  and job creation, all a tremendous response from the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act, and now we are putting a tax burden on the American people.   We are raising taxes on small businesses. One-third of the taxes  being raised here will fall on small businesses, mom-and-pop shops,  community banks, and family farmers. Main Street will be negatively  affected in a big way.   So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, west Texas is the breadbasket and energy  basin of the United States of America. Our producers feed, clothe, and  fuel this great Nation--and not with just conventional fuels, Mr.  Speaker.   Texas is, by far, the largest producer of wind energy in the Nation.  This is not only good for rural economies, but it also diversifies our  energy production, and helps support our Nation's energy independence  for future generations.   Today, I would like to recognize one of our outstanding west Texas  wind energy developers, Tri Global Energy, and its CEO and good friend,  John B. Billingsley, as they celebrate their 10th anniversary this  year.   I commend Tri Global for their excellence in renewable energy over  the past decade, and I wish them the very best success in the decades  to come.                            ____________________
