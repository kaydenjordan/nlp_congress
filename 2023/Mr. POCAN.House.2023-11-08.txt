 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This  amendment would prevent the FTC from implementing its policy statement  explaining the scope of the commission's authority over unfair methods  of competition.   It will create confusion and legal uncertainty in cases in which the  FTC seeks to use this authority to stop unfair methods of competition  that hurts consumers, honest small businesses, and workers.   The November 2022 policy statement informs the public, business  community, and antitrust bar how the agency interprets the law based on  principles from prior case law and agency.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   Current law requires that a party wishing to complete an acquisition  must delay the transaction for at least 30 days following the  submission of a pre-merger notification to give the FTC and DOJ an  opportunity to review the transaction and determine whether to  investigate it further. The statute gives the FTC and DOJ the ability  to grant an individual case exemption from this requirement to wait 30  days. Granting this early termination, however, consumes agency  resources, and the delay for parties associated with suspending early  termination is minimal.   I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.   The proposed revisions that this amendment seeks to block to OMB  Circular A-4 include updates that consider the social cost of carbon  and other climate-related factors in regulatory impact analyses. This  change recognizes the urgency of addressing climate change and aligns  Federal agencies with efforts to mitigate its impacts.   I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   Treasury's Climate Hub was created to leverage the Department's  finance and financial mitigation efforts to confront the growing threat  of climate change.   In just over 2 years, the hub has been instrumental in the  implementation of the tremendously successful Inflation Reduction Act.  The hub also contributed to successful negotiations that led to a  substantial public-private climate finance commitment with South Africa  and Indonesia.   This amendment would impede the Treasury's climate policy strategy as  our Nation faces growing climate threats.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arkansas  (Mr. Womack).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arkansas.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Chair, I stand with the bipartisan statesmen who have  argued against this amendment. I oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, the amendment doesn't do anything. It simply  says funds in the bill can't be used to prevent voluntary disclosures.  The administration is already doing this.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment does nothing, and we oppose  it. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   This amendment would fully block any rulemaking that the Office of  Management and Budget's, Office of Information Regulatory Affairs  determines to be significant. Each year that division can review  anywhere from 300 to 700 rules.   There is no available data to determine how many of these reviews  result in a significant determination. However, roughly, 100 rules each  year clear the higher economically significant threshold.   This amendment would block any work on the roughly 100 economically  significant rules the government promulgates annually and likely blocks  countless others that result in a significant determination.   This amendment would grind government to a halt and interrupt vital  work to improve the lives of Americans across a range of policy areas.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    To my distinguished colleague from Arkansas (Mr. Womack):  I so appreciate your promptness that we run on your subcommittee, I was  just giving you the promptness through this process. So that is why I  was allowing you to use the time you had. I just want to explain that  so you realize why I was sitting back.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. The  White House Gender Policy Council is vital in advancing gender equity  and equality. It helps ensure that all individuals, regardless of their  gender, have equal opportunities and rights. The council takes a  holistic approach to addressing gender issues and looking at areas such  as economic security, healthcare, education, and violence prevention.   This comprehensive strategy allows for a more effective response to  gender-related challenges leading to better outcomes for individuals  and communities.   By establishing a dedicated council at the highest levels of  government, the White House sends a clear message about the importance  of gender equity and inclusion. The White House Gender Policy Council  is important for advancing gender, equity, and equality.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment, I urge a ``no'' vote,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Chair, you heard from our Democratic leader. Democrats  strongly oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This  amendment doesn't belong in this bill. We don't deal with the IMF and  Special Drawing Rights. That would be in the State-Foreign Operations  bill, which we have already taken up on the floor.   Mr. Chair, I urge the sponsor to take up that bill in the fiscal year  2025 bill, assuming we ever get to that.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as I said, we are not debating the merits of  the amendment. It is just not appropriate in this bill, period.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The Treasury Department has identified significant technical concerns  with this amendment. Specifically, the agency has concerns about how  the amendment's construction would impact general licenses authorized  by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.   I strongly agree with the need to enforce the sanctions included in  Executive Order No. 13902 with respect to any person determined to  operate in the construction, mining, manufacturing, or textile sectors  of the Iranian economy. However, some terms like ``Islamic Republic of  Iran'' and ``for, or on behalf of'' are vague and would create  confusion as to how they would relate to existing authorizations.   Treasury believes this phrasing could cause unintended consequences  outside of the intended scope.   Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I oppose the amendment and recommend a  ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This  amendment doesn't belong in this bill. We don't deal with the IMF and  shareholding. That would be part of the State and Foreign Operations  bill, which has already gone through this body.   I urge the sponsor to take up the issue in that bill, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

For years, the Small Business Administration has rightly been  concerned about small businesses from underserved communities accessing  SBA loans. Through the agency's affiliation rule, the agency aims to  combat persistent gaps in accessing capital that affects these small  businesses.   By modernizing the lending criteria and conditions for SBA's small  business loan programs and reducing red tape for SBA lenders, we will  see improved access to capital for underserved businessowners,  including women, minorities, veterans, and rural entrepreneurs.   Unfortunately, this amendment pulls the rug out from underneath the  SBA's important effort to better support these businesses.   I strongly oppose this amendment. I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. It  seems shortsighted to defund an effort to even look at an issue. The  Central Bank Digital Currency Working Group is intended to complement  the Fed's efforts by considering the implications of a U.S. CBDC.                                time  1700    It would be a good idea to examine whether there are economic  benefits, including lower transaction and borrowing costs for U.S.  households, businesses, and government.   In addition, the U.S. uses sanctions and other financial measures to  address national security threats and deny criminals and other illicit  actors access to the U.S. and international financial system.   Development of foreign CBDCs, including multi-CBDC platforms, could  diminish the use of our dollar and the effectiveness of our tools in  this space. I think it is at least worth letting Treasury look at the  issue.   I oppose this amendment, urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the  balance of my time.
