 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in  support of this resolution. Congress has constitutional authority when  it comes to one of the most important decisions any of us can make: to  send our brave men and women of the Armed Forces into harm's way in  service of our country.   Recent events demonstrate just how important this congressional role  is. When the President decided to strike a high-level Iranian official,  he made a decision that was provocative in the strongest sense of the  word. He did that without any meaningful congressional consultation.   The information that we have received is woefully insufficient,  including the notification and the briefing provided by senior  officials yesterday.   Congress and the American people have no assurance that the President  is acting as part of a well-thought-out strategy that makes Americans  safer rather than sets us on a war path.   I am deeply opposed to an unauthorized war with Iran. That is why I  support this resolution, which reiterates that only Congress can  declare war and that we have not done so here.
