 Mr. Speaker, on the 18th anniversary of  the September 11th attacks, Patriot Day, we remember Islamic extremist  terrorists hijacked passenger jets to murder nearly 3,000 innocent  Americans in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania. It is sickening to  think of the men and women and children who were slaughtered. Our  remembrance promotes the legacy of the people who were mercilessly  murdered.   I am humbled and inspired by the strength and resilience, just as my  colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee, of our country when we stand together to  remember this mutual tragedy. Today, I remain inspired by Todd Beamer's  heroic immediate response, ``Let's roll.''   This summer, I visited the sites of Islamic extremist attacks in  Buenos Aires, Argentina, of 1994 and in Mumbai, India, of 2008. The  brave people of America, Argentina, and India are prepared to stand  together to resist further mass murder.   On this day, we honor the lives of those affected by the attack. It  is also a day to salute our military who served to protect our freedom  and to deny Islamic extremists a safe haven in Afghanistan.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
