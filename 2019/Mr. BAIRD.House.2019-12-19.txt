 Madam Speaker, for several months now, I have been very  vocal about the importance of passing the USMCA for Indiana. I have  heard from constituents about their desire to get this deal done. I  have also encouraged my colleagues to push for a vote.    So I applaud the leadership to get this historic deal accomplished.  Today's passage of USMCA will give businesses and farmers across our  district increased opportunity to grow.   In 2018, our State exported more than $18 billion to Mexico and  Canada. Under USMCA, that number will rise.  [[Page H12265]]    This trade deal is a big win for our automotive industry and  agricultural community and for the protection of our intellectual  property. With this improved trade agreement, we will see better market  access and job growth here at home.   I am proud to support the passage of USMCA and look forward to  supporting more victories for the U.S. economy.
