 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Jenkins and Ranking  Member Lewis for their work on this, and I am pleased that the  underlying bill includes the RESPECT Act, which deals with civil asset  forfeiture abuses by the Internal Revenue Service, and I strongly urge  the other body to take this up.   Mr. Speaker, I want to pick up on one of the themes that the  gentlewoman from California just mentioned--the Free File Program--and  explain why it is important.   She mentioned a decentralized program which makes all of the sense in  the world. She mentioned a level of predictability that makes all the  sense in the world. There are opponents to this, however, and I just  scratch my head. There are some fringe groups that have said: Oh, no,  no, no, that is a bad idea.   Instead, what they are proposing is this: that the Internal Revenue  Service fills out your tax returns; that the Internal Revenue Service  acts as judge, jury, and executioner. That is a terrible idea. It is  called ReadyReturn. It is a disaster. We ought not do that.   Instead, as the gentlewoman from California said, let's do this  program. It saves untold sums of money. It is a great benefit to modest  taxpayers--those who are earning less than $66,000 in their adjusted  gross income--and it also puts the onus on the private sector to  actively participate in this process. So in a nutshell, this is a good  bill. It is well thought out. It is bipartisan. It has been well  crafted and well contemplated, and I urge its passage.
