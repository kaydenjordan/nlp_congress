 Mr. Speaker, Homeland Security Secretary  Nielsen brazenly told the American people that there was no policy of  family separation. Then she reversed and said there was a policy, but  she is not going to apologize for defending it. Then she reversed again  and said it is actually not a policy, that only Congress can change the  laws on it.   Yesterday, the executive order by Donald Trump puts her statements  very clearly in the spotlight as all lies. Her credibility has been  shredded. She needs to resign.   By the way, there are 2,300 babies and children still separated from  their mothers and fathers. That is evil. That is sinful. We need to  know where those children are and how we are going to reunite them.   Mr. Speaker, 20 days ago, I led a letter to Secretary Nielsen, along  with other Members of Congress, asking very basic questions:   How do you make sure that some of those kids are not put with child  molesters?   How do you make sure we reunite those kids with their parents?   She still has been unable to answer those questions. She needs to go.  She needs to resign. She is a national embarrassment, and she is  executing an evil policy.                            ____________________
