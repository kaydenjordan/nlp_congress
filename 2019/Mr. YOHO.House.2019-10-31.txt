 Madam Speaker, Michel de Montaigne once said: ``Valor is  stability, not of legs and arms, but of courage and the soul.''   This quote describes Sergeant First Class Bryan Jenkins of  Gainesville, Florida, who tragically lost his life during a military  exercise last week in Georgia.   Throughout his 18-year military career, he has distinguished himself  as a true patriot. Sergeant First Class Jenkins has a long list of  accomplishments. He went on two tours in Iraq and also earned 14  different military awards.   Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Shana; his three  children, Branson, Bryanna, and Delilah, as well as the families of the  other two colleagues, Corporal Thomas Walker and Private First Class  Antonio Garcia who were also killed during this exercise.   The impact that Sergeant First Class Jenkins had on those around him  will not soon be forgotten. We thank him for all the sacrifices he made  for this great Nation. He truly was a man of honor.                            ____________________
