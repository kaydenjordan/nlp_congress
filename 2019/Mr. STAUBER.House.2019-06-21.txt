 Madam Speaker, I rise today ahead of a public hearing  set to be held in my congressional district by the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service on the proposed delisting of the gray wolf. The gray  wolf has recovered.   In fact, back in 2013, the Obama administration delisted the gray  wolf for precisely the same reason we are today: because of science.  Yet the gray wolf remains listed, and without a State-developed  management plan in place, the population in northeastern Minnesota is  growing at an uncontrollable rate.   Within the Duluth city limits, which is the largest city in  Minnesota's Eighth District, a Labrador retriever was recently attacked  by wolves while its owner was just a few feet away. Attacks on cattle  owned by farmers trying to make ends meet continue to be all too  common.   Madam Speaker, my State's Department of Natural Resources will  effectively manage the species once the Federal Government moves itself  out of the way.   I am incredibly grateful to Interior Secretary Bernhardt and the Fish  and Wildlife Service for choosing to hold this forum in the heart of  gray wolf country. No one knows this issue better than those living in  northeast Minnesota.                            ____________________
