 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week to  ask my colleagues to support H.R. 2378, the Kerrie Orozco First  Responders Family Act.   As we approach the 4-year anniversary of Omaha Police Officer Kerrie  Orozco being killed in the line of duty, this legislation will show our  first responders that we care about them and have their back.   The Kerrie Orozco First Responders Family Act will amend the  Immigration and Nationality Act to allow for the surviving family  members of a fallen U.S. citizen first responder to be naturalized upon  compliance with all requirements, waiving any residency waiting period.  This bill is simply extending the privileges to first responders that  current law affords to spouses of U.S. military killed while serving  our country.   In 2015, Officer Orozco was killed. Her husband, Hector, was going  through the immigration process. His immigration status was put in  jeopardy because his wife made the ultimate sacrifice protecting our  community.   Every day, thousands of first responders leave loved ones to risk  their lives for our safety. They need to have the peace of mind that if  something should happen to them, their loved ones will be taken care  of.   I look forward to working with Democrats and Republicans alike to  protect our first responders and their families by passing the Kerrie  Orozco First Responders Family Act.   It did pass unanimously last Congress. We need to pass it again, get  it to the Senate, and get it done.                            ____________________
