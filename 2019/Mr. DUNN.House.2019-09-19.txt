 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Florida  Sheriffs Youth Ranches and similar community care centers for at-risk  children across our Nation.   Founded in 1957, the Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches have been  improving the lives of at-risk children throughout our State with its  comprehensive programs in six Florida locations, including one in my  district, Live Oak, Florida.   The Sheriffs Youth Ranches are credited with helping more than  152,000 children and families in Florida alone. I have visited them,  and I admire their work. It goes well beyond basic care and provides a  sense of security, guidance, and belonging to these children who are  coming from incredibly difficult circumstances.   Without action by this House, on September 30, the title IV-E child  welfare waiver will expire, adversely affecting the support provided to  children's homes across the country.   It is our responsibility to ensure that vital services to vulnerable  children and families are not interrupted. We must guarantee that the  system has the same amount of resources necessary to achieve safety and  permanency for all of these children.                            ____________________
