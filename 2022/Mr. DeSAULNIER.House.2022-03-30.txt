 Mr. Speaker, I regret that I was unable to vote today  as I was unavoidably detained at a committee hearing while supporting a  family from my district as they testified about the loss of their  daughter, a Seaman in the U.S. Navy. Had I been present, I would have  voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 90, H.R. 5706.
