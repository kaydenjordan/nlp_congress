 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is  devastating families and communities in my home State of New Hampshire  and across the United States: the fentanyl, heroin, and opioid crisis.  This crisis is the most pressing public and safety challenge that New  Hampshire faces. It does not discriminate. It affects people in every  community and from every walk of life.   In 2016 alone, 485 people in New Hampshire lost their lives as a  result of this epidemic. The rising use of synthetic drugs like  fentanyl is making matters worse, killing people faster with smaller  amounts. Last year, 72 percent of drug-related deaths in New Hampshire  involved fentanyl. Behind those numbers are real people--moms and dads,  sons and daughters who are dying. Their loss reverberates in pain and  suffering for the family and friends whom they have left behind.   The people of my State have a longstanding tradition of sharing their  stories and their priorities with their elected officials who represent  them. Everywhere I go, I hear stories from those families and friends  of people who have been affected by this crisis. Granite Staters are  stepping forward and explaining what they have gone through, all in an  attempt to break down the stigma of addiction, push for solutions, and  hope that they can help others by making their voices heard.   Earlier this year, Greg and Linda of Derry, NH, reached out to my  office to share the story of their son, who was also named Greg. They  wrote to say:         If you were to put a name and face to this disease, it       would be that of the devil. Let's change that. Let's put a       face of hope and humanity to the disease of addiction. If by       doing so, even if just one life is saved, it is worth it.    I would like to share some of Greg's story today. Greg was born on  November 16, 1985. He and his younger brother Neil were raised in a  caring and loving home, where their parents did their best to teach  them right from wrong, stressing the importance of being considerate,  polite, and kind.   When Greg was 15, his parents moved to Derry, where he attended  Pinkerton Academy and graduated with honors in 2004. During his senior  year, like so many other students his age, he applied for college,  eventually deciding on Keene State College, pursuing a major in  biochemistry. He had a dream of becoming a physician.   He excelled academically, but his mom Linda said that during his  transition between his freshman and sophomore year, something began to  appear off. She wrote:         I saw firsthand that something was off about him. He was       very quiet and withdrawn. He was showing obvious signs of       depression which runs in both sides of the family.    Even as his depression progressed, Greg battled through. He graduated  cum laude with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry. After graduating  and moving back home, his parents urged him to seek help, but Greg held  back. During this time, he had an outpatient surgery, after which he  was prescribed an opioid-based painkiller. His mom said that after he  was prescribed that opioid, he went from bad to worse.   Eventually Greg sought help. He saw a physician and was prescribed an  anti-depressant. His mom said he seemed to be coming back around; he  seemed happier. He took steps to advance his career, hoping to find a  job with his biochemistry degree that would offer him a reimbursement  on tuition so that he could continue to pursue a career in medicine.  Though the job market was tough, his mom said:         Hands down, I have to say that one of the happiest days of       my life was when he finally got a decent job. . . . The dark       cloud was lifted--temporarily.    Unfortunately, Greg eventually lost that job, and then things  spiraled out of control. His mom wrote:         The years following were a nightmare to remember. Just       imagine a loved one slowly losing all sense of themselves.       Legal trouble, bouncing from one job to the next, losing his       license more than once while we drove him back and forth from       jobs--some an hour away.        A restraining order here, a night in jail there. Debts that       weren't getting paid. Fits of rage, fights, a lack of       interest in family, friends, and basic hygiene.    She said:         By the time our worst fears were confirmed, he was using       heroin, we basically lost the soul of our son.    Greg's last few years were filled with back-and-forths. He had  overdosed, his brother finding him in the bathroom of their home. Tired  of being dependent on heroin, he sought help, signing up for a  methadone clinic, entering rehab, and giving his parents hope that he  would make progress.   Unfortunately, he started to use again but was getting ready to enter  a drug court program. After joining his family on a vacation to visit  an ailing relative, he decided to clean up his act, going to the gym  and eating right.   Tragically, though, his mom wrote:         This was short lived however, as the demon snuck into his       room and stole him from us. All he left for us was a lifeless       body on the floor behind a locked door.    Greg's death and his heartbreaking story is the story of far too many  people in New Hampshire and across the country, of people with dreams,  hopes, and aspirations, whose lives are cut short as a result of this  illness. Greg wanted to be a doctor. He wanted to be a husband and a  father. He loved dogs and video games, and he loved to watch Patriots  games on Sunday with his mom, his dad, and his brother. As his mom put  it:         Brilliant and head strong, he was to be reckoned with, and       as his parents, we will never stop trying, on his behalf, to       see that there is an end to this epidemic.    His parents wanted to make clear that his substance use disorder  really grew as a result of the opioid he was prescribed following  surgery, a painkiller that was originally manufactured for terminally  ill patients. They believe that pharmaceutical companies marketed this  drug at the expense of their son, saying: ``Given to ease pain and  suffering, ironically, it has caused irreparable pain, suffering, and  death.''   We can never thank families who have lost loved ones enough for  speaking out about this issue and for working tirelessly and  courageously to try to prevent others from suffering as they have. Nor  can we forget to thank law enforcement and first responders who are on  the frontlines of this epidemic.   I want to make a special mention of Greg's father, Greg senior, who  is a firefighter in Nashua, witnessing as a first responder every day  the havoc that this crisis wreaks on other families and living with the  reality of his own family's loss too.   Greg's mom said that at the moment of his death, she vowed that she  would ensure that his life would not be in vain. His family reached out  because they wanted to make a difference. I am grateful for their  efforts to do this because they do, in fact, have the ability to make  change.   Speaking up helps break down the stigma that prevents too many from  seeking help and prevents too many others from offering it. It provides  a  [[Page S6805]]  voice to the voiceless, making those who have died more than just a  statistic. It gives us a perspective from which we can learn, and it  pushes us to take action.   While thanking these families for their bravery is appropriate, it is  simply not enough. Their bravery and their struggle must be marked by  constant vigilance and urgent action. We must continue to focus on an  ``all hands on deck'' approach at all levels of government and with  those on the frontlines in order to make progress, save lives, and end  this epidemic.   I am going to continue fighting and working with Members of both  parties to combat this crisis, and I will continue sharing the stories  of the people of my State. It is up to all of us to stop this from  happening to more families.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
