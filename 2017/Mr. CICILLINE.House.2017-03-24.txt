 Mr. Speaker, last night we watched the President and  the House Republicans scramble to achieve political points at the  expense of the American people, working through the night. Imagine if  they worked this hard on a jobs bills or a bill that raised family  incomes or a bill to rebuild our infrastructure. But instead they are  trying to pass a tax cut for the rich disguised as a healthcare bill, a  bill that will require us to provide big, gigantic tax cuts.   To do that, they impose higher costs on families, higher premiums,  higher deductibles. They strip 24 million hardworking Americans from  health care, including 60,000 Rhode Islanders. They impose a crushing  age tax. They steal from Medicare, and they will destroy nearly 2  million jobs, all so they can give the wealthiest Americans and the  most powerful special interests a big, huge tax cut.   Shame on President Trump. Shame on the Republicans.   This is wrong for our country. We can do better than this. We need to  protect access to health care, not rob millions of Americans from  health care.  [[Page H2388]]
