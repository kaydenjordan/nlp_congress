 Mr. Speaker, as President Biden laid out at the State  of the Union, House Democrats and the Biden administration have  delivered for the American people.   Because House Democrats put people over politics, our economy saw the  creation of more than 12 million new jobs in the past 2 years.   We enacted landmark legislation that made historic investments in  infrastructure and lowered costs for America's working families, all  while decreasing the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion.   We are rebuilding our economy and American pride by reigniting the  spirit of American manufacturing and industrial strength.   As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to strengthen the  middle class, fix our crumbling infrastructure, safeguard Social  Security and Medicare, protect reproductive freedom, uphold our promise  to our Nation's veterans, and create a fair economy that works for all  Americans.   House Democrats are committed to finishing the job and continuing to  work and deliver for the people.                            ____________________
