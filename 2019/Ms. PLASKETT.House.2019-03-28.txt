 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the disparities  in pay between men and women in this country.   Today, women are paid only 80 cents for every dollar paid to men,  resulting in a gap of $10,169 each year. The gap exists in every State,  regardless of geography, occupation, education, or work patterns.   This disparity is worse for women of color. On average, Hispanic  women are typically paid 53 cents; Native American women, 58 cents; and  Black women, 61 cents for every dollar paid to White, non-Hispanic men.   The Paycheck Fairness Act would help to close these punishing gaps by  eliminating loopholes in the Equal Pay Act.   The wage gap between America's men and women denies women $900  billion in income each year. Across the country, this disparity  directly affects children. In my district of the Virgin Islands, 32  percent of families with children live in poverty. Of that number, 76  percent are headed by a single mother.   We know that families who live in poverty have higher rates of  instability and that children living in poverty perform worse in school  than their counterparts. By paying each woman the $10,000 they lose per  annum to the wage gap, we can do the right thing, and the fiscally  responsible thing, and raise millions of families above the poverty  line.                            ____________________
