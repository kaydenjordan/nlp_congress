 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the MORE Act,  legislation that takes an important step in rectifying some of the harm  caused by the failed war on drugs.   The enforcement of marijuana laws has been a major driver of mass  incarceration in the United States. Hundreds of thousands of people are  arrested each year for marijuana-related charges, very often just  possession.  [[Page H4092]]  This has, in turn, led to our Federal prison system operating at 103  percent of capacity, and too many of these offenders are serving time  for nonviolent drug-related crimes.   A drug-related conviction, even for possession, can be devastating  for the rest of a person's life, making it difficult or even impossible  to vote, get a job, be approved for a loan, or even qualify for a  government program. As we know, these consequences have had massively  disproportionate impact on communities of color, as Chairman Jeffries  just mentioned.   This current system, frankly, doesn't work. It doesn't make any  sense--not for community safety, not for the functioning of an  effective prison system, and not for successful rehabilitation.   By removing marijuana from the Federal controlled substances list,  allowing for the expungement of marijuana offenses, and providing  support to communities most impacted by the failed war on drugs, the  MORE Act is a long overdue step in restoring justice and reversing the  harms caused by the war on drugs.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Nadler for his extraordinary  leadership on this issue. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this  legislation and to support it here today. I urge my colleagues to join  me in voting ``yes'' in reversing the gross injustice that the war on  drugs has produced and bring sensible policy back into place.   I again want to end by thanking everyone who has worked on this for  so many years, but particularly our chairman for his passionate and  strong leadership.
