 Madam Speaker, it is said that a civilized society that can  no longer feel outrage can no longer be civilized.   Ten people slaughtered in their grocery store. Nineteen children and  two teachers massacred in their school, only to have parents who had  dropped their children off in the morning wait in some horror line to  offer DNA samples. At least 15 people murdered in mass shootings just  this weekend, including in my home city, Philadelphia.   Outrage. We must feel the outrage. Do these tragedies from guns in  the hands of bad actors sound like the well-regulated militia  explicitly mentioned in the Second Amendment? Of course not. It is  outrageous.   We want to save our children. We want to save our babies. We want to  save our families, the elderly who live in constant fear.   Yet, did you hear, Madam Speaker, the argument on the other side of  the aisle? A God-given right for an 18-year-old to slaughter children  in a school? Enough is enough.
