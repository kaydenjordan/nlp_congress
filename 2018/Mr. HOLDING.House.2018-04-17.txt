 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill  [[Page H3368]]  (H.R. 5438) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow  officers and employees of the Department of the Treasury to provide to  taxpayers information regarding low-income taxpayer clinics, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5438         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PROVISION OF INFORMATION REGARDING LOW-INCOME                     TAXPAYER CLINICS.         (a) In General.--Section 7526(c) of the Internal Revenue       Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following       new paragraph:        ``(6) Provision of information regarding qualified low-      income taxpayer clinics.--Notwithstanding any other provision       of law, officers and employees of the Department of the       Treasury may--        ``(A) advise taxpayers of the availability of, and       eligibility requirements for receiving, advice and assistance       from qualified low-income taxpayer clinics receiving funding       under this section, and        ``(B) provide information regarding the location of, and       contact information for, such clinics.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section       shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 5438, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5438, and encourage my  colleagues to back this commonsense bill.   Mr. Speaker, this is a short and sweet bill. It allows the IRS  employees to provide taxpayers with information on low income taxpayer  clinics. Specifically, IRS employees would be permitted to provide  program details, including the eligibility requirements to receive  assistance from a low income taxpayer clinic, also where the centers  are located, and how to contact them.   As many of my colleagues know, the low income taxpayer clinic program  provides matching grants to organizations that assist low-income  taxpayers as well as those who speak English as a second language.  These clinics primarily work with taxpayers on dispute resolution  issues with the IRS. They provide representation for audits, appeals,  collection matters, and Federal tax litigation.   These clinics are operated by nonprofit organizations or academic  institutions, and services are provided for free or for a very small  fee.   My district in North Carolina is served by one of the clinics that is  operated by North Carolina Central University School of Law, a fine  institution just to the west of my house.   North Carolina Central's motto is: ``Truth and Service.'' And this  clinic allows individuals to come and get tax assistance from law  school students who work under the supervision of the staff attorney  there at the law school. I appreciate the hard work that those  volunteers are doing in my community.   This legislation before us today would allow the IRS to notify our  various constituents of these clinics and their services. These clinics  play an important role by helping taxpayers, and I am pleased to see  this legislation move forward and see the help that it will give to our  constituents by making them aware of the tools available in their own  communities. This is a practical proposal that will improve taxpayers  experience with the IRS.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman Lewis from Georgia, my  colleague on the Ways and Means Committee, my friend, for partnering  with me on this bill. This bill was approved with unanimous bipartisan  support by the House Ways and Means Committee, and I urge my colleagues  in the House to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his support, and I urge all  Members of the House to support this commonsense legislation.   Mr. Speaker, the IRS is long overdue for an update, and today's bills  mark a significant step in providing a reform that the agency needs and  the American people deserve.   Late last year, House and Senate Republicans ushered through a new  and improved Tax Code which allows individuals to keep more of their  hard-earned tax dollars. Along with the new Tax Code, we need a new and  improved IRS. The multiple bills we are taking up today accomplish that  goal to some degree.   The taxpayer needs to come first. I am glad that Republicans and  Democrats in the Ways and Means Committee have come together to work  and make this a reality.   The bills before the House today are centered on improving the  functionality and the taxpayers experience with the IRS. From directing  the IRS to develop a customer service strategy, to codifying the Free  File program, we are reforming the IRS into an agency that works for  the American people.   It puts the American people first. These bills will improve the ease  and efficiency of filing taxes and retrieving information.   We also established an independent Office of Appeals to ensure that  taxpayers receive a fair and impartial review of any disputes that may  arise. But most of all, we guarantee that customer service goals are  set by the IRS and that we assure the IRS is accountable for meeting  them.   That is not all. Mr. Speaker, in today's world, the value of privacy  cannot be understated. The IRS continues to face serious cyber threats  that are becoming more and more advanced. It is necessary that the IRS  stay ahead of these threats.   Mr. Speaker, today we are faced with an incredible opportunity to  modernize the IRS and put the American taxpayer first. So I urge my  colleagues to support this bill, H.R. 5438, and other bills that are  before the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
