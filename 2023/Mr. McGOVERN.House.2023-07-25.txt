 Mr. Speaker, on July 12, the United Nations Food and  Agriculture Organization, the FAO, released its annual assessment on  the state of global food security.   This year's report, titled ``The State of Food Security and Nutrition  in the World 2023,'' confirmed that nearly 30 percent of humanity, or  roughly 2.4 billion people, lacked access to adequate food in 2022. A  greater number, 3.1 billion, were unable to afford a healthy diet.   The report paints a world where hundreds of millions of people face  more precarious circumstances, deepened by the ravages of climate  change, regional turmoil, and rising food costs. It describes how the  recovery from the global coronavirus pandemic has been uneven and how  the war in Ukraine has affected access to food, especially nutritious  food.   Last year, UNICEF reported that 148 million children under the age of  5 were stunted, meaning that their inadequate diets impaired their  growth. The FAO director general called this the ``new normal,'' where  climate change, conflict, and economic instability are pushing those on  the margins over the edge.   Mr. Speaker, as someone who believes food is a fundamental human  right for everyone on this planet, I believe the American people can  and should be proud of the leadership the United States has shown in  addressing the global crisis. We have provided billions in aid to those  most affected by droughts, natural disasters, violence, and conflict.  We have literally saved millions of lives.   Our farmers have provided food--wheat, soy, corn, rice, beans,  lentils, peas, and cooking oil--to those most in need around the world.  Our peanut farmers and specialty processors have provided therapeutic  foods for severely malnourished children. Our NGOs are on the ground in  many of the most desperate regions of the world. They make sure that  food is provided to those most in need and work with local communities  to build resilience to survive future economic and extreme weather  shocks. Yet, we must all do more.   I recently met with the new executive director of the World Food  Programme, Cindy McCain. She took over the reins in April and is  determined to strengthen efficiency and transparency at the WFP, to  stretch every dollar and every food contribution to its maximum. She  needs to make those donations stretch because she is facing an  impossible task, too many crises, too many people in need, and not  enough money.   The WFP has already been forced to cut food rations and the number of  people it serves all over the world, including in places like Syria and  Haiti. Unlike the U.S., too many donors have yet to respond and too  many nations like the Gulf states and the Middle East have failed to  contribute their fair share.   The world cannot afford to stand by when heat waves, heavy rains, and  flooding are wrecking crops and casting more uncertainty over the  availability and cost of food.   I know that many fear a global migration as millions are forced to  abandon their homes and livelihoods. For me, a greater concern is how  massive internal displacement within countries, from rural areas to  cities, might undermine agriculture, food security, and economic and  social stability inside those nations and regions. The internal  movement, that instability, is not in the best interest of anyone,  including the United States.   I know from experience that the U.S. and the global community can  respond effectively to this crisis if we have the political will to do  so. Even now, we see improvements happening in Latin America and Asia,  so there is hope.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, I am so dismayed by efforts inside this  Congress to undermine or even eliminate the very programs that  contribute to alleviating the suffering of hunger, famine, and food  insecurity around the world, including among children.   Like our farmers, like our NGOs, and like the WFP and countless other  nations and groups, we in Congress must do our part. We must make sure  these  [[Page H3900]]  programs are well funded so that the United States has the resources it  needs to lead the world in ending global hunger.                            ____________________
