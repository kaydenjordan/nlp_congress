 Mr. Speaker, the consent of the governed; no taxation  without representation; no conscription without representation; a  republican form of government for American citizens.   All of our most essential democratic principles underwrite the  trajectory of American political development, which  [[Page H2074]]  has been the admission of 37 new States since the original 13 launched  the Union. All of these States were admitted by one mechanism, and one  mechanism only, an act of Congress exercising congressional power under  Article IV, Section 3 to admit new States.   There has never been a new State admitted by constitutional  amendment. There has never been a State admission struck down by the  United States Supreme Court, because the admission of new States is a  political question in the juridical sense, which means it is vested  exclusively in Congress to decide whether or not to admit new States.  It is an exercise of the plenary power and judgment of the Congress,  the people's branch. It is up to Congress to act.   The opponents of democracy for 712,000 tax-paying, draftable American  citizens right here in Washington, D.C., have now focused on the 23rd  Amendment as the basis of their opposition. But the 23rd Amendment is  no obstacle in any way. The purpose of the 23rd Amendment was to make  sure that the local population got to participate in Presidential  elections. The admission of the new State vindicates that  constitutional purpose.   H.R. 51 itself would immediately repeal the Federal statute that  organizes the electoral college for the District of Columbia, taking  care of the problem that our friends are concerned about.   So why don't they support H.R. 51?   Well, the floor leader gave the game away when he said, for him, this  is all about two new progressive, liberal Democrat Senators. It is all  about two new liberal Democrat Senators. They don't see taxation  without representation. They don't see military service without  representation, when tens of thousands of people from the Nation's  Capital have served America in every war that we have ever had, going  back to the Revolutionary War. They don't see governance without  representation, without the consent of the governed. All that they see  is two new liberal Democrat Senators.   But that cuts against everything that we believe in about American  democracy. We do not deny people the right to vote based on our  expectation of how they will vote. We don't disenfranchise people  because we disagree with who they might elect.   I would defend with my life the right of the people of Kentucky and  Arizona to send my friends here to represent them, even though I  disagree with most of what they stand for, including their rejection of  the rights of people from Washington, D.C. I would never disenfranchise  just because of that.    Mr. Speaker, the people of Washington came to our aid on  January 6. When we were being attacked by violent Fascist  insurrectionists in this body, in this Chamber, in this Congress, they  came to our aid. They sent hundreds of Capitol Police officers and  National Guardsmen to defend us.   The people of Washington defend our democratic rights.   Will we defend theirs?   That is the question of H.R. 51. Let's pass statehood for the people  of Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that our distinguished colleagues don't flatter  themselves to think that they are the first Members of Congress who  oppose other Americans' democratic rights to wrap their arguments in  constitutional clothing, because this has actually been the standard in  American history.   With Texas, it was said that Texas could not be admitted because it  would be unconstitutional and because it was its own country, and the  Constitution nowhere gives Congress the power to admit a foreign  republic as a State.   It was said Hawaii and Alaska could not be admitted because they  weren't contiguous.   West Virginia, everyone knew, couldn't be admitted because it used to  be part of Virginia, just like Kentucky was part of Virginia.   Oklahoma, it was said, was too poor and, therefore, did not meet  constitutional requisites.   Utah was too Mormon.   New Mexico was too Catholic.   And on and on and on.   So this is very much in the mainstream of partisan political  opposition to vindicating the rights of American citizens.   My colleague from Virginia invites us to say, well, just give  Washington, D.C., back to Maryland, thereby conceding, of course, that  Congress has the power to modify the boundaries of the District of  Columbia, as was established in 1847, with the retrocession of  Virginia.                                time  1045    There is one problem with this argument, the people of Washington,  D.C., haven't asked to go back to Maryland, and Maryland has not  requested that the land be given back to Maryland.   Instead, what we have is American citizens exercising their rights  under the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution, organizing a new State  and petitioning for admission to the Union. That is how America has  grown.   They have demonstrated their commitment to our democracy by defending  us against violent insurrectionists on January 6. Let's show our  commitment to their democratic rights.
