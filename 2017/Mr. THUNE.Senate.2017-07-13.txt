 Madam President, I wish to express my appreciation for the  opportunity to welcome to the U.S. Senate Pastor Bill Ewing.   Pastor Bill Ewing started a ministry called Christian Life Ministries  in the early 1980s in Rapid City, SD, along with his wife Nancy. It is  a ministry that has impacted thousands of people across this country,  my wife Kimberly and I being among those, and our family. We have  benefited enormously from Pastor Ewing's spiritual mentorship, his  always wise and godly council, and his example of faithfulness.   In addition to those in my State of South Dakota and across the  country, the ministry has been involved through the years in  ministering to people who have been through very difficult  circumstances. They were there after 9/11 in New York and after  Hurricane Katrina. There have been countless examples of things that  happened not only here at home but also around the world--all the  things that have gone on in the country of Haiti--Christian Life  Ministries has been on the scene and has been very ably ministering to  people who have been impacted by these horrific events.   Bill Ewing is a lifelong South Dakotan, although he did venture over  to Wyoming to go to college, where he was a two-time All American  baseball player and actually was in the California Angels farm system  for a number of years before an injury ended his career, but that loss  to the California Angels and Major League Baseball was an enormous win  for people all over South Dakota and all across this country who have  benefited from the work he and his team in Christian Life Ministries  have done.   So it is my honor to be able to welcome Pastor Bill Ewing to the U.S.  Senate. I thank Chaplain Black for his hospitality and generosity for  allowing my friend and pastor, Bill Ewing, to be the visiting Chaplain  here in the U.S. Senate.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
