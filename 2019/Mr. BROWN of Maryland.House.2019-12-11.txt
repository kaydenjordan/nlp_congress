 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for his  hard work, as well as the committee staff on an NDAA that affirms our  values and delivers progressive wins for the American people.   The NDAA tackles the pressing security challenges facing our country  and makes important investments in our warfighters and their families.   We confront Russian aggression by bolstering the European Deterrence  Initiative and providing our allies in Ukraine with additional military  support.   We make a commitment to a diverse and inclusive military by:  Increasing defense spending at historically Black colleges and  universities; incentivizing more minority and women-owned businesses to  be part of our defense industrial base; and finally, gender integrating  basic training for the Marine Corps.   This NDAA makes good on the commitments to address serious problems  with private military housing; and give military families a pathway to  seek justice, if they suffer from medical malpractice.   Yet, this NDAA is also a compromise. I am disappointed that we  couldn't reverse the President's ban on transgender servicemembers or  force Congress to reconsider the 2001 AUMF. But ultimately, this NDAA  gets the job done, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
