 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, transparency, the American people deserve  transparency, and they resoundingly rejected the bad policies proposed  by the Democratic Party this week. Yet, my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle are doubling down to pass legislation that will radically  change our country for the worse.   We are talking about transparency. We need transparency right now to  understand the tax increases on all Americans; the outsourcing of  energy and manufacturing jobs outside this country; and a half a  trillion dollars to misguided, new green policies that will, no doubt,  bankrupt this country and saddle our children and grandchildren with  more debt.   The misprioritized placating of green special interests that this  administration has rushed to are unbelievable. It is Midland over  Moscow; it is Odessa over OPEC; it is the Permian Basin over Putin, not  the opposite. But blue State millionaires and journalists and those  purchasing electric vehicles now, apparently--in the 2,000-plus pages-- are going to get a handout.  [[Page H6221]]    I am voting ``no'' on this radical legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
