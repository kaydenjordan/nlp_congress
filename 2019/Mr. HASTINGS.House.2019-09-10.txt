Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Arizona  (Mrs. Lesko), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 548, providing for consideration of  H.R. 205, Protecting and Securing Florida's Coastline Act of 2019; H.R.  1146, the Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act; and H.R.  1941, the Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act.   The rule provides for consideration of each bill under a structured  rule. The rule provides one hour of debate on each bill equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on  Natural Resources. Additionally, the rule provides one motion to  recommit on each bill.   Mr. Speaker, together these three bills block oil and gas drilling in  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Atlantic and Pacific Coast,  and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.   For those of you that have worked with me over the years, you know  that I have said, and I mean, that I will be the last person standing  before offshore oil drilling is expanded off the coast of Florida. I am  a native Floridian, and I have seen substantial changes in my State,  and I have seen that coastline on either side threatened by a variety  of issues that man should not be undertaking.                                time  1230    Mr. Speaker, I am glad it didn't have to come to that. I am glad that  the people's House is taking up these measures that undoubtedly will  protect our Nation's environment, climate, and the economies of coastal  communities that rely on tourism, outdoor recreation, and fishing. I am  glad that the House of Representatives is demonstrating to the American  people that we work for them, not for the oil and gas industry.   Mr. Speaker, last year, in a radical move, the Trump administration  proposed a plan to open nearly all U.S. coasts to oil and gas drilling.  This disastrous plan brought to mind the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster  in the Gulf of Mexico, where the explosion not only killed 11 people  and injured many, but it poured millions of gallons of oil into the  Gulf waters and also killed hundreds of thousands of birds, marine  mammals, fish, and sea turtles. Just the prospect of oily beaches led  to hundreds of hotel cancellations along Florida's Gulf Coast, even in  places the oil never reached.   Mr. Speaker, I was living there during that period of time, of  course, and many around this Nation saw that continuous loop shown on  television of oil spilling into the Gulf. It has not all gone away, and  much of the industry along that coastline has been decimated.   Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration's plan is risking billions of  dollars and millions of jobs from the industries that depend on a  clean, healthy ocean. Make no mistake about it, our coastal communities  are the backbone of the United States economy.   According to the National Ocean Economics Program, coastal States  encompass over 80 percent of the Nation's population, GDP, and  employment. Moreover, the ocean economy's tourism and recreation  industry singlehandedly provides 71 percent of the jobs to the United  States economy. In fact, our coastlines provide 12 times the amount of  jobs of the offshore oil industry.   If that is not enough, in 2016, the U.S. Atlantic Ocean economy and  California's ocean economy contributed more than $94 billion and $43.5  billion to the country's GDP, respectively, during that period of time.  National parks on both coasts and in the eastern Gulf States  contributed $6.2 billion to the local economies. And the Department  [[Page H7568]]  of Defense has made it abundantly clear that the continuation of the  moratorium in the Gulf on oil and gas leasing is essential to vital  military readiness activities.   Mr. Speaker, there is widespread bipartisan support for ending  offshore drilling.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the entire Florida delegation for the work that  they have done, with special emphasis to Ambassador Rooney, Ms. Castor,  Ms. Shalala, and others of our colleagues who have been drilling down  on these issues legislatively.   Opposition includes nearly all the coastal Governors; over 2,200  elected officials across the political spectrum; more than 300  municipalities, including all in my district; 47,000 businesses; and  500,000 fishing families.   Mr. Speaker, America needs to conserve energy, safeguard our natural  resources, and look to clean energy and innovative ways to build a  sustainable energy portfolio. Offshore oil drilling is simply not the  answer.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my good  friend, just enunciated the number of jobs that the oil and gas  industry provides, and the figure that she reported was 300,000. There  are 242,000 jobs as a result of solar energy in this country, 102,000  jobs on wind farms in this country, and the coastline that we are  talking about provides 12 times the amount of jobs than the offshore  oil and gas industry.   Mr. Speaker, I won't be here with you all 20 years from now, but I  predict for you that the fossil fuel industry, interestingly enough,  the leaders in that industry will own a lot of the solar in this  country. It is just a matter of time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Shalala), my dear and good friend, and a member of the distinguished  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Hudson), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would say to the previous speaker that eight  Republican amendments were made in order; perhaps none that he offered,  but I thought that the rule was particularly fair.   I would also say to him that no oil that is being produced in this  country right now is affected by anything having to do with this  legislation.   Yesterday, Ambassador Rooney made it very clear to us in the Rules  Committee that, at the present rate of production of oil, we are  producing enough oil to go into 66 years of oil production. That is at  the present rate, without going anywhere else.    I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman had done well until he, in  the words of my grandmother, ``stepped on the cutout'' when he talked  about the eastern Gulf. I just offer BP as an example of what happens.   If he were to come and go down that coastline with me and see the  businesses that went out of business, including all of those in the  fishes industry, oysters, the whole coastline has been impacted. We are  still suffering the residual.   And I might add, on the floor of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, they  call it snow something that is on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's position, but I will be the  last man standing on not having oil drilling off the coast of Florida.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, through you, I would advise my good friend  from Arizona that I have no further speakers and I am prepared to close  whenever she is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my friend just said that the three measures that we  offer are going to be dead in the Senate.   One of the regrets in this country is that virtually everything that  we are doing in the House of Representatives goes over to the Grim  Reaper's office and dies on his desk. And that includes substantial  measures having to do with prescription drugs, sensible gun  regulations, and a variety of measures, adding up to close to 75 that  are on his desk now that could be sent to the President of the United  States.   I would imagine that we are going to continue down this path of when  we offer sensible measures that will help the United States citizens,  that one person is going to hold them up for whatever reason, and that  includes sensible gun regulation, such as background checks that more  than 90 percent of the American people want us to pass.   I don't know how the Senate works, but I do know that the Senate  ain't working right now, and it is being held up by one person.   Mr. Speaker, it is not enough to oppose drilling off one's State's  coastline. Oil spills travel and climate change knows no borders.   Our Nation's coastlines are vital, recreational, economic, and  ecological treasures that will be polluted by expansion of offshore  drilling. Let's underscore that all of the drilling that is going on in  the Gulf right now is not affected by this particular measure. What we  are saying is, no more. Please, don't give us your oil on our beaches,  BP, and others in that industry.   House and Senate Republicans can stick their heads in the tar sands  all they want, but pumping more fossil fuels out of the ocean and into  the atmosphere will not sustain the American economy nor provide the  economic prosperity that will benefit all Americans.   As I said earlier, I won't be with you 20 years from now, but I can  assure you that during that period of time, we will have electrically  driven cars. We will have moved substantially in the solar, and wind,  and thermal areas in this country, and it will benefit us immensely as  well as benefit this planet.   I can't imagine that we will have fossil fuel in 2050, and I can't  imagine that our children would not be worse off if we did.   Now, one thing that you can be assured, the people with the money are  going to control the deal. So when we move to solar energy, the  existing energy mongrels are going to be about the business of owning  solar energy. It is just that simple. They will know when the  transition is going to take place.   In the meantime, what they want to continue to do, is to pollute the  environment that we live in, destroy the habitat of the ocean that is  provided for mammals that are there as well as fish and a variety of  other spinoffs in our ocean activity.   We have polluted the ocean in a very bad way in many forms. We don't  need to add to that with further development at this point.   I might add, America is the leading producer of oil and gas in the  world. We are exporting oil and gas. Therefore, I don't see that we are  suffering a single bit as we transition from fossil fuels to solar,  wind, thermal, and other forms of energy that will be developed along  the way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote on  the previous question.                                time  1315    The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 548         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution,       the House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House       on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       4261) to prohibit the use of federal funds for payments in       support of campaigns for election for the offices of Senator       or Representative of Congress. The first reading of the bill       shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on House Administration. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. When the committee rises       and reports the bill back to the House with a recommendation       that the bill do pass, the previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4261.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
