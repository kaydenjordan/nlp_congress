 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote  in favor of the American Rescue Plan. This past January marked 1 year  since the first case of coronavirus was found in the United States. In  my home State of Alabama, nearly 10,000 people have contracted COVID-19  and almost 9,000 have died, and over half a million of the workers have  filed for unemployment.   We know that the effects of this pandemic have disproportionately  impacted our communities of color and low-income workers, who are more  likely to be frontline workers and less likely to be able to afford  access to quality healthcare.   Thankfully, because of the leadership of the new Biden  administration, we recently witnessed a record drop in COVID cases and  hospitalizations in Alabama; and with over 815,000 vaccine doses  administered in our State, hope is finally on the horizon.   That said, we have a long way to go before there are enough of the  vaccines available to our communities to be really safe from the virus.   As this pandemic continues, I know Alabama families are struggling to  make ends meet.    The time for decisive action is now. I strongly support the American  Rescue Plan because it will not only crush the virus, but also help us  to get back to schools safely, as well as to provide emergency  financial support to struggling families and small businesses.   First, the President's American Rescue Plan will create a national  vaccination program that will make sure that underrepresented  communities are not left behind. The bill also ramps up testing and  contact tracing, increases the supply of critically needed PPE, and  makes healthcare more accessible by enhancing the Advanced Premium Tax  Credit.   That was so important to so many Americans who could not afford  otherwise to purchase quality healthcare coverage. This is critical in  a non-Medicaid expansion State like Alabama, where people have fewer  available healthcare coverage options.   Secondly, the American Rescue Plan delivers immediate financial  relief to working families. This bill would provide critically needed  $1,400 economic assistance checks to individuals so we can help  families recover and cover the costs of necessary expenses, like  childcare, groceries, rent, utilities, and so much more.   I also fought to ensure that the unemployment insurance was extended  and expanded to $400 a week from $300 a week. This is so important.  When we think about the fierce urgency of now, we know that the  unemployment, the Federal pandemic unemployment insurance benefits will  actually expire March 14 if we do not act. That is why it is so  incredibly important that we here in Congress do our part.   I also worked with my colleagues in the Ways and Means Committee to  ensure that the American Rescue Plan includes important provisions for  our most vulnerable families. I am proud that the package includes an  additional $7.6 million in childcare funding for the State of Alabama,  which will help our frontline and hourly workers, who have been our  true heroes in this pandemic.   Furthermore, the package provides over $10 million for Alabama  through a TANF pandemic emergency fund so that families with necessary  emergency needs get the essentials that are so necessary for their  survival.   I am especially proud this bill will also include lifesaving  expansion to child tax credit and earned income tax credit, and I have  championed that for many years. In my district alone, 53 percent of the  children do not receive the full benefits of this credit because it is  not fully refundable. We will make it fully refundable and we will  expand it, lifting millions of children out of poverty.  [[Page H628]]    This bill also provides direct support to local government, cities,  and counties directly who have not benefited from their States  directly. This is critically important to small communities and large  communities all across this Nation.   Finally, the American Rescue Plan supports our small businesses and  our frontline workers in our minority communities. In this bill, we  expand PPP eligibility and we provide critical resources to our  frontline healthcare workers, transit workers, and teachers.                                time  1100    Mr. Speaker, economists and healthcare experts agree, if we do not  take bold action now, we will have more deaths later and risk an  economic downturn.   Mr. Speaker, I am asking my colleagues, both Republicans and  Democrats, to listen to President Biden's call for bipartisanship and  pass this bill.   I am reminded during this Black History Month of the powerful words  of Dr. Martin Luther King, who said, ``We must use time creatively, in  the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right.''   Mr. Speaker, let's pass this package so that we can begin to Build  Back Better and reassure our constituents that help is indeed on the  way.                            ____________________
