The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from North Carolina?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 984.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
