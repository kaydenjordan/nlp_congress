 Madam Speaker, last night President Biden gave his  interpretation of the state of our Union, but after hearing his  version, one thing is clear: our President lives in an alternative  reality.   We all know the problems:   Crippling inflation and soaring interest rates, making it harder to  save money and do business;   An open border with nearly 5 million illegal crossings since this  administration took office;   A drug and crime crisis harming our communities; and   A more dangerous world with feckless leadership out of the White  House, from a botched Afghanistan withdrawal to an emboldened CCP.   The fact is that Americans know the real state of our Union every  time they buy groceries, put gas in their tanks, can't find baby  formula or medications, or lose a loved one to the fentanyl pouring  over our border.   That is why Americans elected House Republicans last November to  bring change back to Washington.   We have already got to work by passing legislation to defund 87,000  IRS agents, establishing a select committee to compete with China,  halting the COVID vaccine mandate for servicemembers, and ending the  national emergency and fully reopening the Capitol to the American  people.   We are just getting started. To use the words of President Biden:  House Republicans plan to finish the job the right way for the American  people.                            ____________________
