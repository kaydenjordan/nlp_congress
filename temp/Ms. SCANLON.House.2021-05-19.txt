 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule and  underlying bills before us today.   It has been over 4 months since the attack on the Capitol, an attack  which disrupted a joint session of Congress and threatened one of the  most essential pillars of our American Government: the peaceful and  democratic transfer of power. That lawless assault threatened not just  the foundations of our government, but also the lives of those who  served their fellow citizens here. That assault shattered the illusion  of security and sanctity of this building, the United States Capitol.   We remain eternally grateful for the bravery and patriotism of the  members of the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan Police who heroically  defended this building, its occupants, and our democracy.   But it is long past time to launch an independent, bipartisan  examination of what occurred on January 6, why it occurred, and how to  prevent it from ever happening again. We need a commission with the  power and authority to collect evidence and make recommendations across  multiple agencies, committees, and branches of government impacted by  the attack.   Almost as soon as the tear gas and broken glass had been cleared in  the wee hours of January 7, we began hearing calls for unity. But what  has remained illusive is a shared set of facts behind which the Nation  can unify and forge a path to healing and accountability for the events  of January 6. That path starts with these bills.   We cannot repair the damage to our government and the rule of law so  long  [[Page H2569]]  as we have national leaders or those who seek to be propagating lies  about why our government was attacked and the gravity of the events of  January 6. Those falsehoods are incredibly dangerous, and so long as  they remain unchallenged by a bipartisan, independent commission, we  are never going to get past the dark part of our history.   In addition to creating this bipartisan commission, we also need to  pass the emergency supplemental appropriations bill to fund the many  additional expenses which were created by the Capitol attack, including  overtime, staffing, training for law enforcement, reimbursing the  National Guard, and so much more.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this rule.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage young people in  my district to learn more about the opportunities offered by our U.S.  service academies.   One of the greatest honors of being a Member of Congress is having  the ability to nominate outstanding students for appointment to West  Point, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, and the Merchant  Marine Academy.   As high school students contemplate what they will do after  graduation, I encourage them to consider the benefits of attending one  of our service academies, including the unique opportunities for  leadership and entry to a range of careers, at no cost to the student  or their family.   The process is competitive, so it is never too early to get started.   I encourage any students in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional  District who might be interested in attending a service academy to  attend our next virtual information session hosted by my office on May  27 at 7 p.m. They may sign up at scanlon.house.gov.    I look forward to nominating another amazing group of young leaders  to the service academies this fall.  [[Page H2595]]                                ____________________
