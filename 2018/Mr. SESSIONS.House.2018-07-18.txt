 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  pressing issue that has the potential to exponentially worsen the  humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country of Syria.   I know I don't need to remind this body or the American people of the  dire circumstance that the Syrian people face as their country  continues to be ripped apart by a known war criminal, their President,  Bashar al-Assad.   While millions of Syrians have fled the country, seeking asylum and  safety in neighboring countries, the majority of these refugees' only  hope is to one day return back to their home. However, the Syrian  regime recently passed a law that will make that nearly impossible.   Law 10, passed in April of this year, forces all Syrians, regardless  of where they are currently residing, to register and provide proof of  ownership of their private properties in Syria within 30 days, or else  they will be forced to hand their properties over to the state of  Syria. This amounts to a massive land grab by the corrupt Syrian regime  that would essentially push out the nearly 13 million displaced Syrians  and ensure that they never have a chance to return home.   Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that this body will understand this and we  will speak loudly.   I urge my colleagues and this administration to take a serious and  critical look at this law that would have far-reaching implications for  the United States and our allies who have offered these refugees  temporary asylum in our nations and the disastrous consequences for the  Syrian people for generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the facts of the case tend to find  themselves to the surface at some point or another, and, in fact, there  was a vigorous debate at the Rules Committee last night, yesterday.  There was a vigorous debate, and I do recognize that my Democratic  colleagues simply lost the vote. It did not stop the debate, however,  because an amendment was brought forward that each member of the  Democratic Party voted for it at the Rules Committee.   And under testimony that was given last night, it would be a counter  play for the Democratic Party. When Republicans said we should not have  a carbon tax, my Democratic colleagues came to the Rules Committee and  argued they would be for a bill that would raise hundreds of billions  of dollars in taxes that would be placed on energy in this country,  hundreds of billions of dollars, at minimum. That is what they stood  for.   So the policy behind what we are talking about here is, we said we  believe that America should have a robust energy policy that is not  taxed, that harms the American people. We should have a system of not  just economics, but of energy policy that would also include green  energy; would also include nuclear energy, which I consider pretty  clean since it is a non-emitting source; that we would also allow the  marketplace to have natural gas and something which they vigorously  want to defend, and that is, home heating fuel, which is diesel fuel to  be dumped by the billions of gallons in the Northeast.   Mr. Speaker, what we talked about yesterday also included the  discussion about the Election Commission. In fiscal year 2018, funding  provided $380 million across the country for the Election Assistance  Commission, which was a final payment that was made in 2002, of $3.65  billion, because, you see, way back in 2002, just before that, there  was an election that many people thought the outcome was wrong; so  Republicans agreed we would put $3.65 billion available for States to  buy what they would choose for brand new voting machines to ensure the  assistance was given from the Federal Government to States for the  security of the voting public.   Of the 2018 funds this year, only weeks before the election, 39  percent of those dollars are still available. Thirty-nine percent has  not even been asked for this year, and 19 States have yet to even ask  for any application to be able to go in and update or change their  system.   The House Administration and the Homeland Security Committees are  working diligently with law enforcement to find out what, if any,  difficulty there was in the balloting process.   I have no doubt--none, no doubt--that there was interference in this  last campaign election by outside forces, maybe even Russians. And it  might not have just been Russians. It might have been a number of  people.   Special Counsel Robert Mueller said we were duped; the American  people were duped. We did not recognize the interference.   But I don't know whether it was at the ballot box or getting people  to the ballot box, their will or desire to vote, or how they would  vote. I am not sure we know that yet. But the special counsel is going  to let us know that.   So, as we were talking about funding for 2018, 2019, Mr. Speaker, at  this time there is no request for even 40 percent of the funds that we  have. It is at the end of $3.65 billion. The States have had this fund  available.   So we think that the facts of the case, as we give them today, should  be enough evidence, not only to you, Mr. Speaker, but for the American  people that there is not at this time a request necessary for more  money.                                time  1315    I will cease my discussion now, Mr. Speaker, but will tell you that  the resolution that is directly in front of us says we should not tax  the middle class of this country, we should not tax further disabled  people or the community of elderly people who have enjoyed the price of  fuel going down because of what the Republican policy initiatives have  enabled us to achieve.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
