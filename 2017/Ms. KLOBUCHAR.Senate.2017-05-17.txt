 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the recent  firing of FBI Director Jim Comey and Russian interference in our  democracy. Jim Comey was my law school classmate, and I know that in my  State he has a lot of respect from our agents and also from law  enforcement in general in our State.   When we had the stabbing in the mall in St. Cloud, MN--it was just  with our police chief from St. Cloud--it was the FBI that came in and  helped at the crime scene and with other things, because for a smaller  police department it is difficult to deal with something like that and  because they also had work to do working with the community to calm  people.   The result was a good one because of the courageous work of an off- duty police officer. While people were injured, no one was killed, and  the investigation was completed.   This is just one example of the work the FBI has done when Director  Comey was in charge. I think we focus very much on what goes on in this  town, but there are a lot of agents and law enforcement out there who  have deep respect for him.   Last week, when Director Comey was fired, I came to the floor and  said that in the recent months foundational elements of our democracy-- including the rule of law--have been questioned, challenged, and even  undermined. Today I return to the floor with the same concern.   In the last 48 hours alone, we have learned that, in addition to  sharing top secret intelligence information with Russia without  checking about it ahead of time--and we know Presidents have the right  to share information and declassify it, but in instances of which we  are aware, the President checks with intelligence agencies ahead of  time. Was this shared with an ally? No. This was shared with Russia, a  country that 17 intelligence agencies in the United States of America  established was trying to undermine our election; Russia, which was  found responsible for trying to shoot down and successfully brought  down a plane, killing innocent people in Ukraine; the same regime that  has poisoned dissidents; the same regime that has put people to death  for simply expressing an opinion that is different from Vladimir  Putin's. That is the country with which the President chose to share  this information.    What else happened in the last 48 hours? Well, President Trump  allegedly urged Director Comey--this news dropped in the last 48  hours--to end the investigation into ties between Russia and General  Flynn and to put reporters who publish classified leaks in prison. This  was information I didn't know before. It happened in the last few  months, of course, but it all came out in the last 48 hours.   The American people are looking to Congress for answers in the face  of this assault on our democracy. It is our job to give them the  answers they deserve and to right this ship. That is why I continue to  call for a special prosecutor. Ever since the Attorney General had to  recuse himself because of his own meetings and ties with Russia and  ever since this mess kept getting messier, I have been calling for a  special prosecutor. I believe that is the way to go.   Also, I have long called for an independent commission, and this is  for a different purpose. As the Senate Intelligence Committee continues  its bipartisan work, a special prosecutor and the FBI would get to the  bottom of any criminal investigation. To me, the purpose of an  independent commission would be to set the rules of the road so that  this doesn't happen again and so our country can protect itself. This  would be a panel of experts appointed by both sides. Their focus could  well be to take these facts but to put them into a future election, as  in, what do we do when campaigns get information that clearly is from a  cyber attack from a foreign power?   Our Founding Fathers have said that our elections are precious and  that they should be protected from foreign powers. Way back then, they  were thinking of Great Britain. Now we are thinking of Russia. Next  time, it could be another country. We should have some rules of the  road.   It is not that long ago that--I remember when Presidential campaigns  would be given some information that they weren't supposed to get from  the opposing side, and they would actually return it to the opposing  side. We could go back to that kind of day.   We could also have the media have some rules of the road. Look at  what happened with the recent French election when there was a cyber  attack there. The media didn't put out every rumor and everything they  got out of that cyber attack; they showed some discretion.   Those are the kinds of things we could do with an independent  commission in addition to factfinding.   I will start with this special prosecutor. The stack of reasons why  we need a special prosecutor is getting higher and higher every day.  Aides and surrogates of the Trump administration during both the  campaign and in the transition were in contact with officials from a  foreign government that was actively working to tear our democracy  apart. That is pretty much established.   We know that the campaign chair for the Trump campaign had to step  down because of his ties to Russia. We know that General Flynn was on  the phone with the Russian Ambassador on the very day President Obama  declared he wanted to expand sanctions against Russia. We also know he  then lied to the Vice President of the United States about it. Those  things happened during the campaign and during the transition.   Last week, former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former  Director of National Intelligence James Clapper reminded us--I was  there in the Judiciary Committee--they reminded us that on the very day  that President Obama imposed those sanctions, that was when General  Flynn--the former National Security Advisor; the person charged with  the most sensitive matters of U.S. national security--was contacted-- the Ambassador--and then he later lied to the Vice President about that  contact.   I actually asked them specifically that after the fact that Flynn  knew he was on tape, that they knew that, that there was a tape of him  saying one thing to the Russians and then another to a high-ranking  official in America--that would be the Vice President--I asked them if  that was material for blackmail. They both said definitively that it  was.   Yet, when Sally Yates went to the administration twice for two formal  meetings with other people--this wasn't just a little heads-up at a  cocktail party; she actually went to the White House to inform them  that she believed the National Security Advisor had been compromised.  What happened? They let him stay on for 18 days. And 2 days in, he was  on an hourlong call between Vladimir Putin and the President of the  United States of America.   Then, of course, we have the fact that the Attorney General was  forced to recuse himself from any involvement with the Russia  investigation because he met with the Russian Ambassador.   I will note that he met with the Russian Ambassador just a few days  after President Obama and President Putin had met at an international  meeting. At that meeting and then publicly President Obama had said:  No, I am not pulling back these sanctions. Then what happens? Jeff  Sessions, who was closely affiliated with the Trump campaign, a  surrogate for the campaign, goes and meets with the Russian Ambassador.   Because of that and some things that happened in his confirmation  hearing, he has now recused himself from any matters regarding the  investigation between Russia and this administration and the campaign.   In addition to the recusal, we have seen two people resign, as I  noted: the campaign manager, the campaign chair, and the National  Security Advisor. The one thing they have in common is Russia and  President Trump.    We have seen three people fired. One is Sally Yates, who was the  Acting Attorney General of the United States. While the reasons given  for her firing were, of course, related to the refugee order, in fact,  she was fired on the very  [[Page S2998]]  same day she had gone to the White House to talk to them about General  Flynn. We have Preet Bharara, who was fired after saying he could stay  on. He was the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, in a very major position to  investigate these kinds of issues and crimes. And then, of course, we  have Jim Comey. The one thing they all have in common is that they were  all investigating various facets of this.   In fact, Director Comey, as I noted--who had gotten support and  respect from law enforcement--was fired the same day Federal  prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas to Michael Flynn's associates,  just days after Comey requested more resources, according to news  reports, to carry out the Russia investigation, and 2 days before he  was scheduled to testify publicly before the Senate Intelligence  Committee, where Members of that committee were going to ask him about  Russia.   Think about it. The independent government officials who are charged  with getting to the truth, no matter where it leads, were fired. And  the President of the United States reportedly now--and this is what we  have learned in the last 48 hours, and of course we want to get to the  bottom of the evidence, but according to news reports, he urged the FBI  Director to end the investigation into the ties between Russia and Mike  Flynn.   We owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of what is  going on here. It is our job to get to the bottom of this. The  President can't fire Congress. He can fire the Acting Attorney General.  He can fire the FBI Director, although I think it is very important  that we get to the bottom of why the FBI Director was fired and whether  it was for the reasons that were given in the memo that was prepared by  the Justice Department or whether it was because of what President  Trump has said--that it was related to Russia--or whether was because  at one point he said he wasn't doing his job, which is not what I have  heard from agents on the street. The one group the President cannot  fire is right here in this room. The President cannot fire the U.S.  Senate. The President can't fire the House of Representatives. He is  not above the law.   This administration cannot investigate itself. We have the ongoing  and important investigation led by bipartisan leaders, Senator Burr and  Senator Warner. That is important and must continue. We also need a  special prosecutor to look into the President's most recent conduct and  all contacts between Trump campaign aides and surrogates and Russian  officials during the campaign, the transition, and the administration.  This prosecutor must be fair and impartial and completely unattached to  either political party. Above all, this prosecutor must be comfortable  speaking truth to power.   In addition to a special prosecutor, we need an independent  commission. When I came back from my trip with Senator McCain and  Senator Graham to Ukraine, the Baltics, and Georgia, I made it very  clear--I remember speaking to my colleagues about this--that what we  saw there made me even more concerned about the finding of our  intelligence agencies because those countries have seen this movie over  and over again where Russia has cyber attacked them. It happened in  Lithuania just because they had the audacity to invite members of the  Ukrainian Parliament from Crimea, who were in exile in Kiev, for their  25th anniversary, and they got hacked into. It happened in Estonia,  where they moved a bronze statue out of a public square and into the  cemetery with other statues of soldiers. But this was a Russian  soldier. The Russians didn't like it. This was in 2007. What did they  do? They shut down the internet for the entire country. This is not  just a single incident involving one candidate or one political party  or one election or even one country; this is something widespread. It  is an attack on democracy.   That is why, when I came back from that trip, I stood with Senator  Cardin and House Members Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings to stand up  for a bill, which has a number of other sponsors, to create an  independent, nonpartisan commission to uncover all the facts and make  sure future elections and political campaigns are safeguarded from  foreign interference.   For months, U.S. intelligence agencies--17 of them--have said that  Russia used covert cyber attacks, espionage, and harmful propaganda to  try to undermine our democracy. Reports show it. The facts prove it.  Some $200 million dollars was spent alone on Russian TV on our own  election. Much of it was passed out on the internet.   Last week, the former Director of National Intelligence, James  Clapper, testified that Russia will continue to interfere in our  election system. This is what he said:         I believe [Russia is] now emboldened to continue such       activities in the future both here and around the world, and       to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a       clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the       very foundation of our democratic political system, this       episode is it.    Vigilance. He said that Russia felt emboldened by what happened. What  happened in the last 48 hours? We find out that he had given high-level  intelligence to the Russians before we gave it to any of our allies,  before we checked it out with intelligence agencies. That actually  emboldens them. We find out that, in fact--because Director Comey kept  such meticulous notes, we find out that allegedly the President asked  him to discontinue the investigation into General Flynn. What does that  do? That emboldens Russia even more.   What former Director Clapper was telling us was that we need  vigilance. We need oversight. We need to send a clear message that they  cannot continue doing this. We do not need to embolden them.   What message does it send when the President urges the person in  charge of the investigation into Russia's election interference to let  it go? It is not one of vigilance in seeking the truth and fighting  against a foreign adversary.   An independent commission of nonpartisan experts can get to the  bottom of this and tell us how we can prevent this from happening  again. They can provide recommendations to help prevent future attacks  on our democracy from being successful.   In addition to a special prosecutor and independent commission, we  also need our congressional committees to continue to exercise their  oversight authority. Since the election, we have heard a lot about the  three branches of government and our system of checks and balances. One  of the fundamental jobs of Congress is to closely oversee the executive  branch to ensure that the law is being properly followed and enforced.  That means we need congressional committees to continue their  investigation into Russian inference in our political system. We have  subpoena power for that reason, and we need to use it. There are tapes.  The President says there may be tapes. Of course, redact the classified  information. We don't want to hurt anyone any further from what has  been happening in the last few weeks. But we should see the  transcripts. We should have the tapes. There is bipartisan support for  turning over this material, including the memos prepared by Director  Comey.    (Mr. LEE assumed the Chair.)   Today Senators Grassley, Feinstein, Graham, and Whitehouse sent a  letter to the FBI and White House Counsel requesting these documents.  Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand the  importance of doing our jobs to get to the bottom of this. The ongoing  bipartisan Intelligence Committee investigation is vital to addressing  the covert and classified aspects of Russian interference, but we also  need transparency because the American people deserve to know as much  as possible about what happened and how we are going to prevent it in  the future.   That is why I fully support the Judiciary Committee hearings that  Senators Graham and Whitehouse have held in the Subcommittee on Crime  and Terrorism. I also believe, as a member of the Judiciary Committee,  that if the Director is to testify--former Director Comey--he should  come before the Judiciary Committee because these are matters related  to his service as an FBI Director. They are related to the justice  system, to the criminal justice system, and we should hear from him.   I hope Senator Grassley has requested that he come before our  committee. I am aware that the Intelligence Committee also would like  him to come, but I think it is important, given the substance of what  is at issue  [[Page S2999]]  here. Yes, he should appear before Intelligence about ongoing matters  related to the Russian investigation, but there is also the issue of  the fact that he was fired. We heard one thing in a memo from the  Justice Department, we heard one thing from the White House, we heard  another thing from the White House, and then we heard another thing  from the President. That is all true. We need to get to the bottom of  this.   On Monday, Republican Senator Bob Corker said that the administration  was in a ``downward spiral.'' He used the word ``chaos.'' That was  before we even knew that the President may have urged the FBI Director  to end the Russia investigation and put reporters in prison. This is an  unprecedented time in our country's history.   The Presiding Officer, having written a book on the Constitution,  knows that one of our jobs is to stand by that Constitution. Yet we are  witnessing a singular moment of constitutional and democratic unease.   On this day in 1973, the Senate Select Committee on Presidential  Campaign Activities began televised hearings on Watergate. One week  later, Professor Archibald Cox was sworn in as special Watergate  prosecutor. Like Director Comey, who was leading the investigation into  Russian interference in our election, Archibald Cox was eventually  fired by the President for doing his job. The night that Archibald Cox  was fired by President Nixon for investigating Watergate, he said:  ``Whether ours shall continue to be a government of laws and not of men  is now for Congress and ultimately the American people.'' He was right.   The American people deserve a thorough, independent investigation  into whether this administration obstructed justice and the extent of  Russia's interference in the 2016 Presidential election. They need to  know it because we are a democracy. We don't hide things like this. We  get the facts. We get the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the  truth. That is what our democracy is about, and that is what our  justice system is about. But they also need to know it because our  democracy is the basis of our freedoms. If we don't protect our  democracy in the coming elections, then we hurt those freedoms. The  only way we figure out how we are going to protect that democracy is  getting to the bottom of the truth, so we can figure out how to prevent  it from happening in the future. This is not a partisan issue; this is  an American issue, and Americans deserve answers.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
