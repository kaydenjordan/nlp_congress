 Mr. Speaker, at around 3 a.m. on Sunday, September 22, a  fire broke out and punctured the calm of an assisted living facility in  my community, Pennsylvania Seven, at Heather Glen Senior Living in  Allentown, Pennsylvania.   Firefighters answered the call, rushing into the building as flames  gained force and tore through the roof. With extraordinary skill, they  got to work saving the 82 elderly residents as the fire raged, carrying  these men and women on their shoulders out of windows on to ladders.  They brought all of the residents, as well as the five staff members  working that night, to safety swiftly, while containing and ultimately  defeating the fire.   In total, 45 agencies across four counties participated in this  operation, coming together as a single unit in complete dedication to  the mission at hand. In their example we see the best of the Greater  Lehigh Valley and of our Nation.  [[Page H9067]]    Today, I ask my colleagues from across our country to join me in  recognizing and honoring the service, sacrifices, and everyday heroism  of these first responders.   Mr. Speaker, before our Nation, I want to thank them for everything  they have done. They are the pride of our community.                            ____________________
