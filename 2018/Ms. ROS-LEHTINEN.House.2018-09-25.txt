 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, my colleague from  Florida, for the time.   Mr. Speaker, when the Dalai Lama was awarded the Congressional Gold  Medal in the year 2007--and this was through legislation that I had the  privilege of authoring with Tom Lantos, our esteemed late chairman of  the Foreign Affairs Committee and the only Holocaust survivor to have  served in this body--when we passed that in the House and we had the  celebration of the Dalai Lama right down the hall, the plight of the  people of Tibet was at the forefront of U.S. policy toward China.                                time  2030    But in the years since, as China has gained both in strength and in  power, I have grown increasingly worried that Tibet has been pushed to  the periphery, to the edges. It is an afterthought.   I was worried that China's bullying and intimidation tactics, on  display throughout the world, had extended so far that our United  States Congress no longer had the will, no longer had the desire, to  speak out in support of Tibet.   But with this bill, Mr. Speaker, authored by my good friend and my  colleague, Congressman Jim McGovern, we are finally reversing that  trend. We are sending a clear message, a true signal, to the regime in  Beijing that the United States has indeed not forgotten about the  people of Tibet, that Congress will not accept Beijing's bullying and  its intimidation, and that we will stand up in support of human rights  for the people of Tibet.   From demolishing Buddhist temples to jailing more and more prisoners  of conscience, Beijing's policies in Tibet are not only immoral and  unjust, but are threatening the stability of a crucial area for U.S.  interests. We must put pressure on China to stop its repression.   This bill demonstrates that Tibetan human rights continue to be an  important factor in our relations with Beijing, and I encourage all of  my colleagues to give Mr. McGovern full support for this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 1595) to amend the Hizballah International Financing  Prevention Act of 2015 to impose additional sanctions with respect to  Hizballah, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1595         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(2) In section 302(a) (22 U.S.C. 9241(a)), by striking       ``Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act'' and inserting ``Not later than 120 days after the       date of the enactment of the Hizballah International       Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2018, and periodically       thereafter''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we will consider a House-Senate agreement on  additional measures targeting Hezbollah, Iran's leading terrorist  proxy, with tough new sanctions that we will impose with this bill.   Last Congress, the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act  was signed into law. This legislation threatened to cut off any  financial institution that knowingly facilitates significant  transactions for Hezbollah from the U.S. financial system. That was a  major step in the financial fight against Hezbollah.   In the immediate aftermath of the law's enactment, Hezbollah's leader  gave a public speech blasting U.S. sanctions as ``unjust and false  accusations.''   Hezbollah also asserted that it ``does not have any funds in any bank  in the world . . . or in Lebanese banks and the central bank and the  directors of banks must not panic.''   Well, if a terrorist organization must publicly state that they are  not panicking, then they are definitely panicking. And Hezbollah was  panicking, Mr. Speaker, following the passage of this landmark  legislation.   Hezbollah reportedly had to cut salaries, defer payments to  suppliers, and slash money stipends to allied parties. Facing increased  financial pressure, Hezbollah has also lashed out most recently by  bombing a Lebanese bank in an effort to intimidate the board members  into noncompliance. But Hezbollah's cowardly stance and its scare  tactics have not worked.   Lebanese banks have gone above and beyond the letter of the new U.S.  law to proactively offload Hezbollah-linked bank accounts, forcing  Hezbollah to look elsewhere for financial services.   Yet, as time has progressed, Hezbollah has found temporary, albeit  cumbersome, workarounds. It is time to send Hezbollah into a panic  again, and this new legislation that we are considering tonight will do  just that.   First, the legislation mandates the application of sanctions against  agencies of foreign states that provide weapons to Hezbollah--namely,  Iran. Iran is the principal, external financial backer of Hezbollah, a  fact that the leader of Hezbollah has openly admitted to for years.   It is estimated that Iranian funding to Hezbollah exceeds $700  million per year. This is in addition to a rapid expansion in both the  quantity and the quality of weapons provided to Hezbollah by Iran.   In May, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the governor of  the Central Bank of Iran and another senior bank official, accusing  them of funneling millions of dollars to Hezbollah. But more can be  done, and more must be done.   This new legislation takes aim at Hezbollah's enablers, both inside  and outside of Lebanon. It mandates sanctions against any person or  entity that engages in a transaction with anyone aiding Hezbollah's  fundraising or recruitment.   This includes Hezbollah's foreign relations department, its  television station, and its companies that maintain Hezbollah's social  media accounts.   This legislation also requires the administration to issue a report  laying out the assets of senior Hezbollah members and associates. This  should clearly be applicable to Hezbollah's senior allies in the  Lebanese Government.   Hezbollah is constantly expanding and exploiting its extensive  criminal networks from narcotics trafficking to human trafficking in  order to escape sanctions and attack Western interests. So to address  this new threat, this legislation also imposes transnational organized  criminal organization sanctions on Hezbollah's criminal networks, and  it requires the administration to report to us in Congress on  Hezbollah's racketeering activities, which can serve as a basis for  applying RICO penalties to Hezbollah.   In sum, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is an important expansion of  our efforts to take aim at Hezbollah, to take aim at its enablers, and  to take aim at its state sponsor, Iran.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this effort to ensure  that the United States continues to have the tools to respond to the  threats caused by Hezbollah.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on S. 1595 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, September 7, 2018.      Hon. Edward R.

The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of S. 1595 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to S. 1595 and would ask that       a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included       in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, September 7, 2018.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of S. 1595, the Hizballah International       Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2017, so that the bill       may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on S. 1595 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our very bipartisan committee,  the Foreign Affairs Committee, Chairman Ed Royce, as well as Matt Zweig  on his staff--he will be embarrassed that I say that--and Ranking  Member Eliot Engel. I thank Mr. Engel for those wonderful words. I am  going to miss working with him greatly. We have worked on so many  important pieces of legislation together. And Mira Resnick and Edmund  Rice on his staff, what a delight they have been. I thank them for  their collaboration in developing this critical legislation. I am going  to miss working with all of them.   I also want to thank Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo and Ranking  Member Sherrod Brown, and John O'Hara and Colin McGinnis of their  staff, for their hard work and commitment to achieving the strong,  sound, bipartisan agreement that we have before us today.   Finally, I thank my hometown Senator, Senator Rubio, as well as  Senator Shaheen, who have taken the lead on this effort on the other  side.   For 30 years, Mr. Speaker, Hezbollah has remained Iran's proxy. Iran  remains Hezbollah's primary source of financial support. What a  terrible relationship these two have had.   This bill builds on our past efforts. It ramps up pressure on this  dangerous terrorist group. It sanctions regimes, including Iran and  Syria, because they are providing weapons to Hezbollah. It targets  Hezbollah's innovative fund-raising and recruiting efforts, including  its attempt to crowdsource small donations to support its fighters. And  it recognizes that Hezbollah is more than a terrorist group; it is also  a global criminal organization, an enterprise that profits from drug  trafficking, money laundering, and counterfeiting.   This bill gives the administration the tools to respond accordingly.  We must employ a combination of law enforcement, financial, criminal,  civil, and regulatory tools to deter, disrupt, and publicly illuminate  the global illicit Hezbollah network. And we have to continue to work  together to confront this threat.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I echo Mr. Engel's remarks that, under  the leadership of Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel, our Foreign  Affairs Committee is one of the most bipartisan committees of the  House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5433) to require the Secretary of State to design and  establish a Vulnerability Disclosure Process (VDP) to improve  Department of State cybersecurity and a bug bounty program to identify  and report vulnerabilities of internet-facing information technology of  the Department of State, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5433         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, a massive breach of the State Department's unclassified  computer network in 2014 exposed grave weaknesses in its information  technology systems. And in the years since that attack, problems have  continued to mount.   The Department's cybersecurity response program received a D rating,  the lowest of any agency, on its Federal Information Security  Management Act report card in 2017. And just this month, the Department  revealed that it recently suffered a breach of its unclassified email  system, which exposed the personal information of some of its  employees.   Mr. Speaker, more must be done to ensure cost-effective solutions to  the Department's information technology security challenges.   The Hack Your State Department Act, authored by my Foreign Affairs  Committee colleagues Ted Lieu and Ted Yoho, will help address  cybersecurity gaps at the Department. This bill will crowdsource  solutions and offer a layered approach to information technology  security, consistent with the 2017 Report to the President on Federal  IT Modernization.   This bill achieves this in two ways:   First, the bill establishes a vulnerability disclosure process to  give security researchers clear guidelines for discovering and  reporting cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This is considered a best  practice in the private sector and, frankly, should be done in all  government agencies.   Second, this bill would establish a bounty pilot program at the  Department to reward ethical hackers for discovering and reporting  vulnerabilities. Numerous private-sector companies and the Department  of Defense have used programs like this to improve their cyber defenses  at minimal cost.   The Department said that its Hack the Pentagon program ``demonstrated  the power of engaging the hacker community to help address  cybersecurity challenges of the Department of Defense.''   In its first pilot, hackers identified over 130 unique  vulnerabilities, exceeding the Defense Department's expectations so  much that it announced plans to expand the program to all of its more  than 700 websites.   Both the vulnerability disclosure process and the bounty pilot  program are designed to complement persistent network scans currently  done by the Department of Homeland Security and other cybersecurity  activities undertaken by the Department of State.   As a national security Department, the State Department must do more  to secure its networks. The Hack Your State Department Act is a small  but important step to bring cost-effective solutions commonly used in  the private sector to bear in support of this goal.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Mr.  Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank my colleagues--Ted  Lieu, a hardworking member of our Foreign Affairs Committee, and Ted  Yoho, chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific--for  crafting this bipartisan legislation.   By unleashing the expertise of patriotic hackers, this bill will help  the State Department identify and patch vulnerabilities on its computer  systems.   The Hack Your State Department Act takes an innovative approach to  improving network security at a Department that is in such desperate  need of new solutions and improved capabilities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bipartisan bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, Wendy Grant was a south Florida  philanthropist who dedicated her all-too-brief life to serving others.  Hers was a legacy of service to our community. She was also a well- respected aide to both Senator Connie Mack when he served here in D.C.  and our Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush.   Here is a picture of lovely Wendy Grant. It says: A life lived for  the greater good.   That was Wendy Grant.   Wendy was also a zealous advocate for children through her work with  the St. Jude Children's Hospital, and she raised funds for its noble  mission year after year.   Anyone who knew Wendy loved Wendy. She was famous for her birthday  emails recognizing each of her friend's birthdays and updating us all  on everyone's lives.   Remedios Diaz-Oliver, Lilliam Machado, and I were about to bestow  upon Wendy the title of Honorary Cuban American, because she loved our  history and our traditions. We will present the certificate when we  honor her life next week at her church for her service.   Wendy Grant was a south Florida person to the hilt. She was warm; she  was caring; and she was loyal. We will all miss Wendy Grant dearly.   Godspeed, my friend.                            ____________________
