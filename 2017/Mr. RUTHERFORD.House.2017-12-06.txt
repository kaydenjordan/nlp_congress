 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, in my 41 years of law enforcement, 12 years as a sheriff  of Duval County, Florida, I can tell you I have seen many, many times  where good, law-abiding citizens used legal firearms to stop dangerous  people from harming them, their loved ones, and even their neighbors.    Mr. Speaker, as a law enforcement professional, I want good people  carrying firearms.   The Fraternal Order of Police that represents thousands of officers  all across the United States of America supports good people carrying  firearms. Do you know why? Because we know, as law enforcement officers  we understand that, at our agencies, our priority one response time  target is 7 minutes.   In a life-and-death situation, we target getting there in 7 minutes.  That is in a well-policed community. I want to put Republicans,  Democrats, and everyone on notice that, for that 7 minutes, you better  be prepared to protect yourself.   If an active shooter in a mall, in a school, in a church like we just  saw in Sutherland Springs, Texas, is killing people, let's say to the  tune of five people per minute, that is an average of 35 dead, unarmed  citizens before the police can even arrive at the scene.   Believe me, we want good, law-abiding citizens who are authorized to  carry firearms to have the ability to intervene in a violent situation  before law enforcement can even arrive at the scene. We need the  Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act to ensure that these good, law-abiding  citizens can retain the constitutional right to bear arms legally  across State lines and hopefully be able to stop a violent incident.   Mr. Speaker, none of our other constitutional rights stop at a State  line. Our Second Amendment rights should not stop at that line either.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 38  and save lives.
