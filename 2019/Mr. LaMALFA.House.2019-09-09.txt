 Madam Speaker, during our August recess, we had a very  successful trip to the Tahoe area looking at some of the work that has  been done following the Angora Fire some years ago for recovering our  forested areas and doing the types of thinning and management that  needs to be done to make our areas much more fire-safe and sustainable  into the future.   This has been a very successful and bipartisan effort. Senator  Feinstein, as well as our local Members of the House, had support of  this work. And we are at that time of year again--devastating fires  affecting the West, affecting my own district in California right now.  The one known as the Walker fire is burning our national forest in  Plumas County--people are being displaced, having to desperately move  their cattle out of the area.   And a lot of good work is being done. A lot of dozers are up there, a  lot of aircraft are going. But why do we have to do this year after  year after year? We should be managing our assets--the people's  assets--our national forest--in a way that makes it fire-safe, it makes  the habitat safe for the wildlife that is there. And later on, all the  negative effects you have from all the ash and all the things that get  into the streams, you have negative water quality. We need to be much  more proactive.   Madam Speaker, there are 44,000 acres burning in my district right  now, just on that one Walker fire and the fear people have to put up  with, and the loss of wildlife.   We have to do much more. We need the Forest Service to be empowered  with the tools to get this work done.                            ____________________
