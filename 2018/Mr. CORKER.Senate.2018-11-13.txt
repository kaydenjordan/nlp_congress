 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION       United Kingdom--H-47 Chinook (Extended Range) Helicopters and                                Accessories         The Government of United Kingdom has requested a possible       sale of sixteen (16) H-47 Chinook (Extended Range)       helicopters; thirty-six (36) T-55-GA-714A engines (32       installed, 4 spares); forty-eight (48) embedded GPS inertial       navigation units (32 installed, 16 spares); twenty (20)       common missile warning systems (16 installed, 4 spares);       twenty-two (22) radio-frequency countermeasures (16       installed, 6 spares); nineteen (19) multi-mode radars (16       installed, 3 spares); nineteen (19) electro-optical sensor       systems (16 installed, 3 spares); forty (40) M-134D-T mini-      guns, plus mounts and tools (32 installed, 8 spares); and       forty (40) M240H machine guns, plus mounts and tools (32       installed, 8 spares).

Total estimated cost is $3.5       billion.        The United Kingdom is a close NATO ally and an important       partner on critical foreign policy and defense issues. The       proposed sale will enhance U.S. foreign policy and national       security objectives by enhancing the United Kingdom's       capabilities to provide national defense and contribute to       NATO and coalition operations.        The proposed sale will improve the United Kingdom's ability       to meet current and future threats by providing a heavy lift       rotary wing capability able to execute missions in extreme       environments across a full range of military operations. The       United Kingdom will have no difficulty absorbing these       helicopters into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor of this sale will be Boeing       Defense and Space, Ridley Park, PA. There is no known offset       agreement associated with this proposed sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require       approximately 29-32 U.S. Government personnel and 26       contractors assigned to the United Kingdom plus 3 equivalent       man years TDY to support fielding and initial sustainment for       a duration of 3-5 years.
