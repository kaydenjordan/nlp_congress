 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment  to permit American farmers to help alleviate hunger in Cuba. As one of  the co-chairs of the Bipartisan Cuba Working Group, I thank  Congresswoman Tlaib for offering it, and I thank the Speaker and my  working group co-chair, Chairman Jim McGovern for making it in order.   After more than six decades, the U.S. embargo on Cuba has  accomplished nothing except to cause suffering among the Cuban people.  This policy is a complete failure. And yet it continues, a policy that  divides families and hurts working people in Cuba.   This amendment would permit American farmers to help alleviate the  current hunger crisis in Cuba that is made worse by COVID and our  embargo. In one fell swoop, we could show that America puts  humanitarian values first, and head off competition from countries like  China who seek to make inroads in our hemisphere.   This amendment is good for American farmers, good for the Cuban  people, and good for healing Cuban-American families divided by  misguided U.S. policy. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.
