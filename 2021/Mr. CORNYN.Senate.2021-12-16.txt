 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the eyes of the world are on Russia as  it stages a military buildup on the Ukrainian border. Russia could  literally invade Ukraine at any time. And the United States and the  international community need to take strong, decisive action to  dissuade a Russian offensive from invading Ukraine. I was glad to see  the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO,  denounce Russia's action earlier today, but clearly words are not  enough. Statements of support are not enough to counter an invasion.  The United States and our NATO allies must provide additional support  to Ukraine as they defend their borders, and time is of the essence.    Senator Durbin, the Senator from Illinois, and I have introduced a  resolution to provide complete clarity on the U.S. Senate's position on  this imminent conflict. Our resolution affirms the unwavering support  of the United States for a secure, democratic, and independent Ukraine,  but it also asserts the need for action. Our resolution calls on the  Biden administration to provide additional lethal aid to Ukraine to  counter ongoing Russian aggression.   Senator Durbin and I have been proud to notch a long list of  bipartisan cosponsors, and I hope the Senate will pass this resolution  before we break at the end of the year.                             Biden Administration    Madam President, on another matter, the first year of the Biden  Presidency and the Democratic-majority controlled Congress is quickly  coming to an end. Looking at everything that has happened so far this  year, it is tough to imagine the American people are happy with how  things are going.   President Biden raised all of our hopes and expectations during his  inauguration, as he built his campaign and then spoke at his  inauguration on a simple theme: unity. He talked about the need for  people across the country to come together and empathize with one  another and to work together. He promised to be a uniting force in  Washington, DC, and pointed to his service in the U.S. Senate as  evidence of his ability to work across the aisle to broker bipartisan  deals.   Clearly, this message was welcomed by the American people. After all,  they gave him the job in the first place. But just because voters  picked a Democratic President doesn't mean they signed off on a radical  transformation of our country. The American people elected a 50-50  Senate and lessened the Democratic majority in the House.   In short, Americans selected a President who promised to work across  the aisle and a closely divided Congress--and gave us a closely divided  Congress to ensure that he kept his word, but the American people have  not gotten what they expected.   Right from the start, there were clear signs of where things were  headed. At the beginning of the year, the two party leaders negotiated  an organizing statement to determine how the 50-50 Senate would  function. In light of the far-left's newfound obsession with  eliminating the filibuster, Leader McConnell asked for assurances from  Leader Schumer that the filibuster would remain intact. After all, it  is not unreasonable to ask your negotiating partner to commit to not  breaking the rules.   Even though Senator Schumer once said we should ``build a firewall  around the legislative filibuster,'' he refused to agree to leave it  alone, which was not very encouraging. Fortunately, two of our  Democratic colleagues have committed to protect the filibuster, which  ensures that there will be something that maybe is a little unnatural  for human nature--to try to force us to work together to build  consensus to do things like we did yesterday: pass the National Defense  Authorization Act. That is not necessarily our first instinct.   But protecting the filibuster is important. It provides stability and  continuity and predictability in our Nation's laws and to make sure  that we don't add to the chaos by, every 2 years, after every election,  reversing everything that had been done the previous 2 years.   We saw how tempted our Democratic colleagues were to use their  newfound powers in the majority. That meant, unfortunately, forget  working across the aisle or striking bipartisan deals--Senator Schumer  made clear he wanted an easy path for purely partisan legislation.   The first item on his agenda was a $2 trillion liberal wish list  unconvincingly disguised as pandemic relief. It included things like  backdoor funding for Planned Parenthood, a blank check for mismanaged  union pension systems, and money for climate justice. This had very,  very little to do with COVID-19 and the pandemic, which is how it was  sold.   The Democratic leader got a taste of partisan legislating and decided  that he wanted more of it, so he tried to break the two Democratic  Members on his side of the aisle who were protecting bipartisanship and  consensus building. He lined up votes on some of our colleagues' most  controversial bills, all of which were designed to fail. There was a  bill that exploited the cause of pay fairness to line the pockets of  trial lawyers. Unsurprisingly, it did not pass.   Senator Schumer forecasted votes on two bills that were so unpopular  among Democrats that they didn't even make it to the Senate floor. One  was to erode the American people's Second Amendment rights, and another  would punish  [[Page S9227]]  schools and hospitals that refused to comply with ``woke'' social  norms.   But without a doubt, the most dangerous legislation Democrats have  pushed is to overhaul America's election system. The version of the  bill we voted on this summer was so bad that I was surprised Democrats  even had the gall to hold a vote on it.   The bill would have turned the bipartisan Federal Election Commission  into a Democratic-controlled, partisan body. It would have seized  States' constitutional authority to draw their own congressional  districts, instead handing all the power to independent redistricting  commissions. It would have federalized ballot harvesting--literally  vacuuming up ballots and delivering them to a paid campaign staffer and  political operatives who had a stake in the outcome of the election.  The only thing it would have done for the people is decide the outcome  of virtually every future election and--spoiler alert--make sure that  Democrats would never lose.   If this bill weren't so dangerous, it would have been laughable. It  is no surprise that the only bipartisan thing about this bill was the  opposition. In both the House and the Senate, Republicans and Democrats  joined together to defeat this bill.   Still, our Democratic colleagues refused to throw in the towel. They  rewrote the bill, tried to rebrand it, and brought it up for another  vote in October. Once again, it failed. The Democratic leader has said  this partisan legislation will resurface again sometime before the end  of next year, but I don't expect the outcome to change.   Of course, amid all the partisan jockeying, there has been a large,  dark cloud looming overhead known as the Build Back Better--or, rather,  I think more accurately, ``Build Back Bankrupt''--bill. This  legislation would drive up the cost of childcare for families and cut  healthcare for the uninsured. It would hurt our energy security and  increase the already sky-high energy costs. It would put taxpayers on  the hook for massive handouts to blue State millionaires, organized  labor, trial lawyers, wealthy media corporations, and a host of  powerful friends of the Democratic Party.    Our Democratic colleagues have used every trick in the book to make  the price of this spending spree look as small as possible. One of our  Democratic colleagues even acknowledged the disingenuous advertising.   Fortunately, the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax  Committee have provided an honest score of the bill that passed the  House and that has been proposed here in the Senate--one which ignores  the gimmicks our colleagues initially tried to use. The Congressional  Budget Office says that this bill would cost $4.9 trillion in the first  10 years alone--not zero, as President Biden has disingenuously  claimed; not $1.75 trillion, as our Democratic colleagues have claimed;  but $4.9 trillion, nearly triple the price Democrats have previously  been willing to acknowledge. And deficits--money that would have to be  repaid by the next generation and beyond--would increase by a  staggering $3 trillion over the next decade.   As it turns out, spending trillions of dollars on unnecessary  programs and dolling out handouts for the wealthy is not an easy sell.  Senator Schumer apparently can't convince all 50 Democrats to vote for  the bill.   While our colleagues have focused on these wholly partisan endeavors,  they have ignored clear opportunities to work together in a bipartisan  effort.   For example, Members of both parties agree that something must be  done to bring down prescription drug prices for the American people.  This was a major focus last Congress, and there are a range of  bipartisan bills that support this goal, including one I have  introduced with Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut. So far, we have  made no progress for the American people on high prescription drug  costs.   Then there is the crisis at the border. On President Biden's watch,  annual border apprehensions have hit an alltime high. For most of the  year, though, Democrats refused to acknowledge that any sort of problem  actually existed at the southern border. They adopted the same rules as  ``Fight Club''--they just didn't talk about it. Vice President Harris,  named ``border czar'' by President Biden, didn't even visit the border  until late last June, long after the humanitarian crisis had ballooned  to unimaginable heights, and even then, she stayed away from the  hardest hit sectors.   Senator Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, and I have introduced  legislation with commonsense reforms to address the crisis, but the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Durbin, has declined to  mark up the bill or even convene a hearing of the Judiciary Committee  to investigate the border crisis and explore possible responses to it.   Democrats and Republicans have shown a willingness to work together  to put DACA recipients on a strong legal footing. These are young  people known as Dreamers but frequently referred to as DACA, deferred  action on childhood arrival, which is the name of the administrative  process used by the Obama administration to provide them some legal  standing in which to stay in the country. But they have been embroiled  in 10 years of unnecessary litigation, and they are uncertain about the  outcome of their case. I think this is an area where we could work  together to provide them some certainty and some finality.   There are other things we could and should be doing, like securing  our most critical supply chains, encouraging innovation in the energy  sector, and solving many of the challenges American families are facing  every day. But rather than work across the aisle to address these  bipartisan priorities, our colleagues have wasted a year on purely  partisan exercises. Again, this is not what the American people thought  they were getting when they elected Joe Biden President and when they  gave the Senate a 50-50 split.   The 2020 election wasn't an invitation to codify a liberal wish list;  it was a call to work together. And there is no better place for the  work that can be done than in the U.S. Senate. There is a lot we can  and should accomplish next year, but this sort of partisan, unilateral  approach to governing has made that nearly impossible. You can only  hope for better next year.   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle got what they wanted,  which was a Democratic majority, given the tie-breaking vote of the  Vice President. They have been given the keys to the kingdom, and now,  next year, we will see how long they can hold on to them, or perhaps  they can change course and return to bipartisan legislating and  consensus building for the benefit of the American people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
