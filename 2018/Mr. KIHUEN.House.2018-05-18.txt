 Mr. Chair, during rollcall Vote No. 202 on H.R. 2, I  mistakenly recorded my vote as ``no'' when I should have voted ``yes''.               Amendment No. 31 Offered by Mr. Banks of Indiana     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Jordyn  Rivera, who attended the Route 51 festival in Las Vegas on October 1.   Jordyn was looking forward to graduating from California State  University with her bachelor's degree in healthcare management. She was  set to graduate in the spring of 2018.   Jordyn was incredibly smart and was even a member of her school's  National Health Education Honor Society. Her parents were always very  proud of Jordyn and loved the close bond they had with her. She had a  love for Jesus, her family, and country music. She had a gift that  allowed her to reach out to others and bring people together.   Jordyn's parents remember her as being personable and adventurous.  She was warm, optimistic, and had an infectious energy.   I would like to extend my condolences to Jordyn Rivera's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
