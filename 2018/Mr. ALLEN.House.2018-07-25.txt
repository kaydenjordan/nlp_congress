 Mr. Speaker, it is very refreshing here and a historic day  in Congress when we are working together to do something big, and I am  just proud to be a part of it.   During my time in Congress, I have traveled the 12th District,  visiting many schools, and I have spoken to numerous groups of young  students. One question I always ask is why they are getting an  education.   Typically, students will respond with a wide variety of reasons, but  the answer is to prepare for a job, to build a successful career, to  live the American Dream. Oftentimes, a 4-year degree isn't the right  fit.   Work is a God-given right, and I believe that young people today have  the greatest opportunity to live the American Dream than at any time in  my lifetime. I am proud to say that I helped create legislation that  prioritizes these in-demand job skills and education.   H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the  21st Century Act, does a lot of great things. But as a small-business  owner, I made sure, during the drafting process, that this legislation  would bridge the gap between the business and education community by  finally bringing business leaders to the table to create CTE programs  for in-demand jobs in our hometowns.   Thanks to tax reform and deregulation, our economy is booming: 6.7  million jobs are open and available, and the American Dream is right  there for the taking.    Mr. Speaker, for far too long, my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle have advocated for a one-size-fits-all approach to  healthcare. But as we have learned of the failures of ObamaCare,  Federal Government mandates do not work for the American people. They  demand choice.   Part of the House Republican's Better Way agenda is to restore the  doctor-patient relationship and put patients back in control of their  healthcare decisions. That is what we have done today.   I congratulate my colleagues on passage of H.R. 6311. H.R. 6311, the  Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings  Accounts Act, will provide more choice by expanding health savings  accounts to help people plan and save for their healthcare needs, while  also assessing lower cost healthcare plans.   Instead of paying high premiums, Americans can save their hard-earned  money in tax-favored health savings accounts. It also delays  ObamaCare's tax on health insurers for an additional 2 years, providing  relief from the premium increase caused by the tax itself.   Simply put, our current healthcare system is failing the American  people,  [[Page H7674]]  and I believe this reform will lower the cost of care while enhancing  competition.                            ____________________
