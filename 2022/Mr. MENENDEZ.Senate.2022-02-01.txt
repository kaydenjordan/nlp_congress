Madam President, for nearly 30 years, first as a member  of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and, to this day, as chairman of  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have had the privilege of  engaging in the most pressing foreign policy and national security  issues facing our Nation.   While we are rightly focused on the crisis unfolding around Ukraine,  we must not lose sight of how dangerously close Iran is to becoming a  nuclear-armed state, for we know that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose  an unacceptable threat to U.S. national security interests, to our  allies in Europe, and to overall stability in the Middle East.   As someone who has followed Iran's nuclear ambition for the better  part of three decades, I am here today to raise concerns about the  current round of negotiations over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of  Action and Iran's dangerously and rapidly escalating nuclear program  that has put it on the brink of having enough material for a nuclear  weapon. Three to four weeks--a month or less--is how long most analysts  have concluded it would take Iran to produce enough fissile material  for a nuclear bomb if they chose to do so. That is not a timeline we  can accept.   That is why I am calling on the Biden administration and our  international partners to exert more pressure on Iran to counter its  nuclear program, its missile program, and its dangerous behavior around  the Middle East, including attacks on American personnel and assets.   Now, before I continue, let me set the record straight. While some  have tried to paint me as belligerent to diplomacy or worse, I have  always believed that multilateral, diplomatic negotiations from a  position of strength are the best ways to address Iran's nuclear  program, and I have always advocated for a comprehensive diplomatic  agreement that is long-lasting, fully verifiable, and with an  enforceable snapback system of sanctions should Iran breach any terms.   It was for very specific reasons that I opposed the JCPOA back in  2015 as well as an underlying concern that I just could not shake, a  sense that the deal itself at the time was the best case scenario,  hinging on good-faith actors and overly optimistic outcomes without  enough consideration for the worst case scenarios that might arise from  the behavior of bad actors. Today, many of the concerns I expressed  about the JCPOA back in August of 2015 are coming back to haunt us in  the year 2022.   First and foremost, my overarching concern with the JCPOA was that it  did not require the complete dismantlement of Iran's nuclear  infrastructure. Instead, it mothballed that infrastructure for 10  years, making it all too easy for Iran to resume its illicit nuclear  program at a moment of its choosing.   The deal did not require Iran to destroy or fully decommission a  single uranium enrichment centrifuge. In fact, over half of Iran's  operating centrifuges at the time were able to continue spinning at its  Natanz facility. The remainder--more than 5,000 operational centrifuges  and nearly 10,000 not yet operational--were to be merely disconnected.  Instead of being completely removed, they were transferred to another  hall at Natanz, where they could be quickly reinstalled to enrich  uranium, which is exactly what we have seen happen over the past year,  nor did the deal shut down or destroy the Fordow nuclear facility,  which Iran constructed underneath a mountain to house its covert  uranium enrichment infrastructure. Under the JCPOA, it was merely  refurbished.    Now Iran is back in business at Fordow, spinning its most advanced  centrifuges and enriching uranium to a higher level of purity than  before it entered into the JCPOA.   In the 2 years since President Trump left the JCPOA, Iran has resumed  its research and development into a range of centrifuges, making rapid  improvements to their effectiveness--huge strides that we will never be  able to roll back.   Today, Iran has more fissile material--2,500 kilograms--more advanced  centrifuges, and a shorter breakout time--3 to 4 weeks--than it had in  2015. This is exactly why I was so concerned  [[Page S457]]  over the JCPOA's framework of leaving the vast majority of Iran's  nuclear program intact. This is how Iran was able to rapidly rebuild  and advance its enrichment capabilities once the agreement fell apart.  That was a serious mistake.   Back in 2015, I also expressed my grave concern that Iran only agreed  to provisionally--provisionally--apply the Additional Protocol of the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Additional Protocol is what  allows the International Atomic Energy Agency to go beyond merely  verifying that all declared nuclear material and facilities are being  used for peaceful purposes and provides it with a verification  mechanism to ensure states do not have undeclared nuclear materials and  facilities.   The Additional Protocol was particularly important because Iran has  never fully come clean about its previous clandestine nuclear  activities. For well over two decades, mounting concerns over Iran's  secret weaponization efforts united the world. The goal that we have  long sought, along with the international community, is to find out  exactly what Iran accomplished in its clandestine program, not  necessarily to get Iran to declare culpability but to determine how far  they advanced their weaponization program so that we would know what  signatures to look for in the future.   David Albright, a physicist and former nuclear weapons inspector and  founder of the Institute for Science and International Security said:         Addressing the IAEA's concerns . . . about the military       dimensions of Iran's nuclear program is fundamental to . . .       [any] long-term agreement. [An agreement] that sidesteps the       military . . . issues would risk being unverified.    The reason that he said that an agreement that sidesteps the military  issues would be unverifiable is that it makes a difference if you are  90 percent, in terms of enriched material down the road in your  weaponization efforts, or only 10 percent advanced; 90 percent or 10  percent makes a big difference. The state of Iran's weaponization  efforts significantly impacts the breakout time for the regime to  complete an actual deliverable weapon so this verifiability is  critical.   In 2015, I explained that the JCPOA did not empower international  weapons inspectors to conduct the kind of anytime, anywhere inspections  needed to get to the bottom of Iran's previous weaponization program,  and in February of last year, 2021, we saw the consequences of not  insisting that Iran permanently ratify the Additional Protocol. Iran  simply decided they were done with the Additional Protocol and refused  to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to fully investigate  locations where it found traces of uranium enrichment.   It is now obvious that the IAEA, or what we call the International  Atomic Energy Agency, is significantly limited in its ability to  determine the extent of Iran's previous nuclear program and whether  further militarization activities have continued all this time. Without  the complete adoption of the Additional Protocol, the JCPOA did not  empower the IAEA to achieve this task.   So that was then and this is now, and though I had my concerns with  the JCPOA, as I have expressed, I am also absolutely clear-eyed, as  everyone else in this Chamber should be, that the way in which  President Trump unilaterally withdrew from the deal--with no diplomatic  plan for constraining Iran's nuclear ambitions, without the support of  any of our allies, without any kind of serious alternative--emboldened  Iran to pursue its nuclear ambitions like never before.   Now, we can't live in a counterfactual world where all parties remain  in full compliance, but we do know that, even for the first couple of  years of the JCPOA, Iran's leaders gave absolutely no--no--indication  that they were willing to look beyond the scope of these limited terms  and fought vigorously to keep their highly advanced nuclear  infrastructure in place, and that was under a more ``moderate'' regime.  They continued their destabilizing activities and support for terrorism  in the greater Middle East with abandon.   So today I ask: Why would we try to simply go back to the JCPOA--a  deal that was not sufficient in the first place and still doesn't  address some of the most serious national security concerns that we  have?   Let me lay out specific concerns about the parameters of the JCPOA,  which, it appears, the Biden administration is seeking to reestablish.   For decades now, Iran has pursued all three elements necessary to  create and to deliver a nuclear weapon: producing nuclear material for  a weapon, the fissile material--that is basically what we just talked  about being 3 to 4 weeks away; the scientific research and development  to build a nuclear warhead--that is why we don't know the full  dimensions of what they were doing in terms of how advanced they got to  the weaponization, the ability to have the nuclear warhead that makes  the bomb go boom; and then the ballistic missile to deliver them--that,  they already have.   So if you think about it, they have the missiles capable--I will talk  about that a little bit more in a few minutes--they have the missiles  capable of delivering. They have the fissile material--are on the verge  of having the fissile material necessary to create the ability for an  explosion. These are checked off. The only question is the warhead. At  what point are they there? And we don't fully know.   Since the Trump administration exited the deal, Iran has installed  more than 1,000 advanced centrifuges, enabling it to enrich uranium  more quickly. While the deal the United States and our partners are  pursuing in Vienna would ostensibly seek to reverse technological  advancements, the acquisition of knowledge--that is never reversible.   As Kelsey Davenport of the Arms Control Association has said,  ``Iran's nuclear program hit new milestones over the past years.'' To  quote it, it says: ``As it masters the new capabilities, it will change  our understanding about how the country''--in this case, Iran--``may  pursue nuclear weapons down the road.'' That is exactly why the  starting position of the United States and our partners during our  original negotiations was the complete dismantlement of Iran's  enrichment facilities and capacity.   According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has  produced uranium enriched to more than 60 percent purity--more than 60  percent purity--at the Natanz facility. Why is 60 percent purity so  alarming? Well, as the Director General of the International Atomic  Energy Association--the U.N. international watchdog on these issues-- Rafael Grossi has stated, Iran's decision to enrich uranium to 60  percent to produce uranium metal has no--no--justification for civilian  purposes--no justification for civilian purposes.   Iran says: Well, we only want nuclear energy for domestic energy  consumption. But, as the IAEA's head says, it has no justification to  enrich uranium to 60 percent for civilian purposes. In other words,  Iran has already done most of the heavy lifting.   Furthermore, the IAEA reports that Iran's nuclear stockpile has grown  to nearly 2,500 kilograms. That is nearly 2\1/2\ tons of enriched  uranium and eight times--eight times--the cap that was agreed to in the  JCPOA. More and more advanced centrifuges, a much larger nuclear  stockpile, and vastly higher levels of enrichment are a dangerous  combination.   As I noted before, Iran's breakout time is now a mere 3 to 4 weeks,  but according to a report from David Albright and others at the  Institute for Science and International Security, Iran could enrich  uranium for a second weapon in less than 4 months. Once they hit this  breakout period, which is 4 weeks away, then to get their second bomb,  we are talking about 4 months.   So while the United States has recognized Iran's right to civilian  nuclear power, Iran's behavior continues to indicate that it is  actively moving toward developing nuclear weapons capabilities. Adding  to the alarm is the fact that we don't even have the full picture of  exactly how far it has gone. Again, that is why full access was and is  such a critical component of any deal.   As the original deal was being negotiated, we started from a place of  anywhere, anytime inspections that we wanted--anywhere, anytime--but  that is not where the deal landed.   While I recognize that other factors have contributed to Iran's  efforts to block inspectors, simply put, I was not satisfied in 2015  with the level of visibility the agreement afforded.  [[Page S458]]    Today, indeed, the IAEA readily states it does not have the necessary  level of access. In fact, in September of 2021, the IAEA Director,  Rafael Grossi, warned that ``Iran's failure to fully cooperate and  communicate with the IAEA `is seriously compromising' the IAEA's  ability to have full insight into Iran's program.'' IAEA inspectors  were denied access three times to the Karaj centrifuge component  production facility in their efforts to install new surveillance  cameras to monitor Iranian activities.   In addition, Iran is not cooperating with the IAEA's ongoing 2-year- old investigation into the presence of nuclear materials found at four  locations outside of Iran's declared nuclear program sites. Iran has a  lot of access to two of those locations but has denied and delayed  access to the other two.   The IAEA has further warned Iran multiple times that their ``lack of  substantive engagement'' in resolving these issues ``seriously affects  the agency's ability to provide assurance''--assurance--``of the  exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program.''   But Iran's obstruction has gone far beyond reneging on the inspection  protocols agreed to in the JCPOA. As I mentioned previously, in  February of last year, Iran suspended implementation of the Additional  Protocol. Following that suspension, the IAEA managed an arrangement  where Tehran agreed to certain surveillance activities. But even though  there was an agreement, it refused to transmit any data from that  surveillance until it got all the sanctions relief the regime felt  entitled to under the JCPOA--never mind their own repeated failures to  meet their obligations under the JCPOA.   We are not dealing with a good-faith actor here. Iran's consistent  obfuscation, continued stalling, and outlandish demands have left us  flying blind, especially when it comes to verifying that Iran is not  engaged in activities related to the weaponization process, activities  related to the design and development of a nuclear explosive device,  activities which were explicitly banned in section T of the JCPOA. I am  talking about utilizing computer models to simulate nuclear explosions,  developing the diagnostic equipment for nuclear testing, and  researching conventional explosives for triggering a nuclear explosion.   The JCPOA banned these activities because substantial evidence  indicated that Iran had, in fact, pursued them in the past. Yet we  cannot verify whether Iran is pursuing them again. We cannot know for  sure because the Iranian Government has repeatedly stated the IAEA  lacks the authority to inspect the very military sites where these  activities took place--the activities where the IAEA has wanted to go  to but has been denied.   With Iran's breakout time now less than a month, we must be able to  verify the scope of Iran's weaponization research, and this must  include Iran's ballistic missile program. We already know that Iran has  ballistic missiles that could carry a warhead to the Middle East and  parts of Europe. Indeed, given how far Iran's enrichment capabilities  and research and development have advanced, the only element left is  preventing Iran from weaponizing its stockpile.   All of this contributes to why we have a well-founded, deep mistrust  of Iran's willingness to seriously curtail its nuclear program. And, of  course, Iran keeps reminding the United States and our Arab Gulf  partners that its missile program presents its own unique threats  outside of the nuclear file.   I remain highly skeptical it will suspend any of its other  threatening and destabilizing activities, from ballistic missile  development to support for terrorist proxies. Even as the United  States, our P5+1 partners, and Iran convened in Vienna for indirect  negotiations about returning to the JCPOA, Iran's leaders took it upon  themselves to antagonize all parties and show, my view, their true  intentions.   In December, they launched a rocket with a satellite carrier into  space to remind us all that even as they dragged out diplomatic  negotiations, their ambitions remain acquiring the ability to  eventually deliver a nuclear warhead. This launch was yet another  provocation like those we have seen over the past several years, some  of which directly--directly--violate the terms of U.N. Security Council  resolution 2231. That resolution codified the JCPOA, our agreement with  Iran, and plenty of others that are far outside of the limited scope of  the deal.   Beyond this failed launch into space, Iran's dangerous behavior has  hit closer to home. In recent years, Iran has increased direct threats  to U.S. personnel and assets and continued providing weapons to  terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East.   The U.S. intelligence community last year assessed that ``Iran and  its militant allies continue to plot terrorist attacks against U.S.  persons and interests. . . . Iran has the largest ballistic missile  force in the region . . . [and] is increasingly active in using  cyberspace to enable influence operations.''   The Center for Strategic and International Studies reports that Iran  not only has the largest and most diverse ballistic missile program in  the region, but it has also used those ballistic missiles to attack  U.S. personnel stationed in Iraq--personnel who, let's be clear, have  been there at the invitation of the Iraqi Government. While our last  President made light of what he called headaches, the fact is, nearly a  dozen servicemembers suffered from traumatic brain injuries during the  attack on Al Asad Air Base in 2020.   Already this year, there have been 3 rocket and drone attacks, with  public reports of 14 rockets hitting an Iraqi air base hosting U.S.  forces and wounding 2 American servicemembers.   Allow me to share an article in the New Yorker by Robin Wright  entitled ``The Looming Threat of a Nuclear Crisis with Iran.'' She  writes of a conversation with CENTCOM commander Gen. Kenneth McKenzie  in which he said the following:         The lesson of Al Asad . . . is that Iran's missiles have       become a more immediate threat than its nuclear program. For       decades, Iran's rockets and missiles were wildly inaccurate.       At Al Asad, ``they hit pretty much where they wanted to       hit''. . . . Now they ``can strike effectively across the       breadth and depth of the Middle East. They could strike with       accuracy, and they could strike with volume.    The article continues:         The regime has concentrated on developing missiles with       longer reach, precision accuracy, and greater destructive       power. Iran is . . . one of the world's top missile       producers. Its arsenal is the largest and most diverse in the       Middle East, the Defense Intelligence Agency [has] reported.    Now, as President Biden's Special Envoy on the question of  negotiations on a potential return to the JCPOA, Robert Malley, has  said, ``Iran has proven that using its ballistic-missile program as a  means to coerce or intimidate its neighbors'' is a real challenge.   Now, Iran can fire more missiles than its adversaries--more missiles  than its adversaries, including the United States and Israel--can shoot  down or destroy.   Tehran has achieved what General McKenzie calls overmatch, a level of  capability in which a country has weaponry that makes it extremely  difficult to check or defeat.   ``Iran's strategic capacity is now enormous,'' McKenzie said.  ``They've got overmatch in the theatre--the ability to overwhelm.''   Iran now has the largest known underground complexes in the Middle  East housing nuclear and missile programs. Most of the tunnels are in  the west, facing Israel, or on the southern coast, across from Saudi  Arabia and other Gulf sheikhdoms.   This fall, satellite imagery tracked new underground construction  near Bakhtaran, the most extensive complex. The tunnels, carved out of  rock, descend more than 1,600 feet underground. Some complexes  reportedly stretch for miles. Iran calls them ``missile cities.''   A recording of deceased General Suleimani echoes in the background:  ``You start this war, but we create the end of it.''   An underground railroad ferries Emad missiles for rapid successive  launches. Emads have a range of a thousand miles and can carry a  conventional or a nuclear warhead.   The Islamic Republic has thousands of ballistic missiles, according  to U.S. intelligence assessments. They can reach--we see on this map  that there are different missiles. But how far they can reach? Its  farthest: 2,000 kilometers. They can reach as far as 1,300  [[Page S459]]  miles in any direction--deep into India and China to the east; high  into Russia in the north; to Greece and other parts of Europe to the  west; and as far south as Ethiopia, in the Horn of Africa, and dozens  of countries in between. About a hundred missiles could reach Israel.   The Biden administration has hoped to use progress on the nuclear  deal to eventually broaden diplomacy and include Iran's neighbors in  talks on reducing regional tensions.   Ms. Wright then again quotes Special Envoy on Iran Rob Malley as  saying:         Even if we can revive the JCPOA, those problems are going       to continue to poison the region and risk destabilizing it.       If they continue, the response will be robust.    Well, it may be too late. Tehran has shown no willingness to barter  over its missiles as it has with its nuclear program.   She also quotes Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on missile proliferation at  the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, who  said:         Once you have spent the money to build the facilities and       train people and deliver missiles to the military units that       were built around these missiles, you have an enormous       constituency that wants to keep them. I don't think there's       any hope of limiting Iran's missile program.    And President Raisi, of Iran, told reporters after his election:  ``Regional issues or the missile issue are non-negotiable.''   Nonnegotiable. Now, the U.S. military is still vastly more powerful  than anything built or imagined in Iran. Yet Iran has proven to be an  increasingly shrewd rival. It has trained a generation of foreign  engineers and scientists to assemble weaponry. It has dispatched  stateless dhows loaded with missile parts for Houthi rebels, who have  fired missiles at military and civilian targets in Saudi Arabia. It has  provided the older ``dumb'' rocket technology to Hamas and Islamic  Jihad.   The majority of the ``precision project'' kits crossing at Abu Kamal  go to Lebanon, where Hezbollah upgrades its short-range rockets and  missiles to hit more accurately and to penetrate more deeply inside  Israel. Hezbollah is now estimated to have at least 14,000 missiles and  more than 100,000 rockets, mostly courtesy of Iran.   As McKenzie says, ``they have the ability to strike very precisely  into Israel in a way they've not enjoyed in the past.''   I shared this article on the floor today because I believe it  captures the gravity of our present reality, and I encourage all of our  colleagues to read it.   Beyond what Ms. Wright has laid out above with excellent sources and  details, let's also not forget that Iran continues to be a steady  fighting partner for the murderous Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, all  the while expanding its military footprint along our ally Israel's  northern border.   And, let's not forget, all of this belligerent behavior has escalated  despite the ballistic restrictions under U.N. Security Council  resolution 2231.   Madam President, resolution 2231 of the United Nations was the  framework that endorsed the JCPOA and imposed other restrictions. So  just think of where Iran will go when these restrictions expire next  year. They expire, under existing law, next year.   Beyond this alarming aggression throughout the region, within its  borders Iran continues to remind the world it has no respect for human  rights. It is a country where dissidents and activists who want a  better future are persecuted and killed. Indeed, just last January,  Baktash Abtin, a prominent Iranian poet and human rights activist who  was jailed for ``propaganda against the state,'' died in the notorious  Evin prison from COVID-19.   Iran's judicial system is a sham that denies basic human rights like  freedom of expression and condones torture and extrajudicial killings.  Last year--get this--the U.S. Justice Department indicted four Iranians  for conspiring to kidnap and kill an Iranian-American journalist, Masih  Alinejad, surveilling her daily activities in Brooklyn, NY, here on  American soil.   And we cannot forget the four American citizens who Iran continues to  wrongfully detain--Babak and Siamak Namazi, Emad Shargi, and Morad  Tabhaz--who are suffering in prison and whose family members are  desperately seeking their return.   It is against this backdrop of bad behavior that Iran is ostensibly  negotiating a return to the JCPOA--or maybe just dragging out the time.  It took years of crushing U.S. and international sanctions to bring  Iran to the negotiating table in the first place. I know because I was  the author of many of them. And we had to remain united in order to  bring them to the table, and now we have to remain united as well.    Now, I have been cautiously optimistic about the Biden  administration's initial efforts. I waited for the last year to see  results.   Before the Foreign Relations Committee, the Secretary of State and  others--senior members of the administration--insisted that they would  look for a ``longer and stronger'' agreement. I have a pretty good  sense of what I think ``longer and stronger'' means. Longer is obvious:  more time. Stronger: dealing with elements that had not been previously  dealt with.   However, a year later, I have yet to hear any parameters of longer or  stronger terms or whether that is even a feasible prospect. And even  when it seemed that a constructive agreement might be possible last  summer, upon taking office, the Raisi government abandoned all previous  understandings and, as I mentioned, made absolutely clear that Iran's  ballistic missiles and regional proxy networks are ``not negotiable''-- his words: ``not negotiable.''   Moreover, at this point, we seriously have to ask: What exactly are  we trying to salvage? What are we trying to salvage?   Iran has moved so far out of compliance with so many of the terms of  the JCPOA and of the terms of the U.N. Security Council resolution  2231. Meanwhile, the arms embargo that we had has already expired, and  restrictions on Iran's missile program are about to expire next year.   To quote again Rob Malley, the President's Iran negotiator, trying to  revive the deal at this point would be ``tantamount to trying to revive  a dead corpse.''   I think he is right. It is time to start thinking out of the box and  consider new strategies for rolling back Iran's nuclear program and  addressing its dangerous and nefarious activities. These new efforts  should include creative diplomatic initiatives, stricter sanctions  enforcement, and a steely determination from Congress to back up  President Biden's declaration that Iran will ``never get a nuclear  weapon on my watch''--his words.   One critical first step is vigorously enforcing the sanctions we have  in place.   A few weeks ago, the Washington Post reported on the Iranian  Revolutionary Guard Corps' extensive oil smuggling operations  throughout the Persian Gulf: ``Smuggled Iranian fuel and secret  nighttime transfers: Seafarers recount how it's done.''   Now, I was pleased to see the Department of the Treasury dispatch a  senior official to the United Arab Emirates, which has been part of  this, to help stop it. More significantly and despite what it says  publicly, numerous reports also suggest that China continues to buy  Iranian crude oil at a discount--a lucrative lifeline for the Iranian  regime that both subverts international oil markets and gives China yet  another inroad into the Middle East.   Using a sophisticated web of shipping, delivery, and tanker flagging  techniques, private energy analysts--here is where we see their  abilities, in this space right in here, to make these transfers that  ultimately go to China, through tanker flagging techniques--private  energy analysts estimate that China bought an average of 350,000 to  650,000 barrels per day--per day--last year.   And according to United Against Nuclear Iran, this amounted--that  reality of how many barrels they are buying per day amounted--to about  $10 billion going to the Iranian regime, in violation of existing  sanctions.   We can't turn a blind eye to these violations. The Biden  administration must rigorously enforce our sanctions, including  targeting Chinese entities in a way that will impose a serious cost. We  must use our sanctions to crush the illicit, underground economy of  Iranian oil shipments throughout the world.   The international community must also leverage a full range of tools.  We have to urge our P5+1 partners to call for snapback sanctions on  Iran under the parameters of the JCPOA, and we should be urging the EU  to reimpose its pre-JCPOA sanctions on Iran.  [[Page S460]]    Now, of course, we have to be realistic here. Former President  Trump's disastrous withdrawal from the JCPOA hampered our ability on  the sanctions front. Indeed, when former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  went to the U.N. in the summer of 2020 and attempted to invoke the  snapback mechanism, our European partners and the rest of the P5+1  roundly rejected him and pointed out that the United States, from their  view, did not even have the standing to do so having exited the deal.   That was then. That said, I believe the Biden administration has  diligently worked to build back trust and cooperation with our  partners, and I believe the remaining partners must look at the facts  and officially invoke the snapback mechanism to send a strong signal to  the Iranians.   We must also be thinking beyond the JCPOA. It is worth noting that  even though President Trump's withdrawal, from my view, was a  strategic, serious error, nothing technically constrained his ability  to do so. Iran's leaders insist they want a guarantee that the United  States will not withdraw from any future agreement.   As these negotiations continue, the best guarantee of a sustainable  diplomatic agreement with Iran and the international community is to  build one that garners bipartisan political support. One such idea that  I have been working on with Senator Graham is a regional nuclear fuel  bank that would provide Iran with access to fuel on the condition that  it forgoes all domestic uranium enrichment and reprocessing.   Now, that idea may sound lofty, but it is worth noting that the IAEA  already runs a nuclear fuel bank that provides access to members in the  case of a disruption to their existing fuel arrangements.   Iranian leaders have long maintained their nuclear program is for  domestic energy development, and yet it belies logic that Iran would  need to highly enrich uranium or undertake any number of the steps they  had been taking over the past few years for a purely peaceful nuclear  energy program, to say nothing of the fact that Iran was the fifth  largest crude oil producer in OPEC in 2020 and the third largest  natural gas producer in the world in 2019. So it has an abundance of  natural resources for energy purposes within its own country.   It doesn't need nuclear fuel for domestic energy consumption. But if  you accept that--well, we want to keep our oil and gas to sell, and we  want nuclear power for the purposes of domestic energy consumption,  fine, then why do you bury your program thousands of feet under a  mountain? Why do you hide what you are doing? Why are you enriching to  a grade that even the IAEA says has no civilian purpose whatsoever? Why  won't you show us that, in fact, your previous actions that we believe  may lead to weaponization exist? Why won't you show us, dispel it?   The kind of arrangement we are talking about would truly satisfy the  need for a peaceful nuclear program. Now, while we understand that  there are both political and logistical challenges regarding this  proposal in the past, we don't believe we should close any potential  doors. We believe, actually, that our proposal opens new doors because  while we are just now talking about Iran--and we have been having this  conversation with our P5+1 allies and Iran in a bilateral arrangement  because of our concerns about Iran's nuclear program--we could be  talking about the entire region.   We have successfully negotiated nuclear cooperation agreements with a  number of countries in the region on a bilateral basis, including  Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. In the future, such a fuel bank--a  regional fuel bank--could even be expanded to guarantee that any  Iranian Gulf state--or further beyond in the Middle East for that  matter--can peacefully fuel its commercial nuclear reactors through the  IAEA fuel bank. That means you don't enrich, but you get the fuel  necessary if you want domestic energy consumption.   Of course, regional investment into any diplomatic solution--from  Gulf countries and Arab neighbors and Israel--is absolutely critical  for success. Just as we know our sanctions are most effective when we  work with our international partners, multilateral cooperation is  critical to finding a successful outcome.   But, particularly, what would be attractive to the Iranian regime?  Well, what is attractive--or should be attractive--to the Iranian  regime is this arrangement would decouple the view that the West is  only seeking this arrangement from Iran.   Iran would not have to give up its right to enrich, but would,  without a loss of national pride, delegate that right to a multilateral  nuclear fuel bank. And by including other Gulf countries in such a  reasonable natural fuel bank with the same terms and conditions, Iran  would not have to worry about other Gulf countries attaining nuclear  weapons and posing a security threat to them.   And finally, if we can succeed at a regional nuclear fuel bank, would  we stop a nuclear arms race in what is already a tinderbox of the  world? Because if Iran can acquire a nuclear weapon, you can be sure  that the countries in the Gulf--Saudi Arabia, Emirates, and others-- they are going to say, under the theory of mutual self-destruction, We  have to have nuclear weapons too. And now, we begin an arms race in a  part of the world that can ill-afford it.   As we look to a new approach, I also believe that we should revisit a  number of proposals I laid out in 2015. First, we should seek the  immediate ratification by Iran of the Additional Protocol to ensure  that we have a permanent international agreement with Iran for access  to suspect sites.    Second, we need a ban on centrifuge R&D--research and development-- for the duration of such an agreement because it is that advanced R&D  that allowed Iran to be 4 weeks away from crossing the nuclear  threshold so that Iran could not have the capacity to quickly break  out, just as the U.N. Security Council Resolution and sanctions and  snapback is off the table.   Third, Iran should close the Fordow enrichment facility. After all,  the sole purpose of Fordow was to harden Iran's nuclear program to a  military attack. But if Iran has nothing to hide and it is all for  peaceful purposes, why do you put it deep underneath a mountain?   Fourth, the world needs full resolution of the possible military  dimensions of Iran's program. We need an arrangement that isn't set up  to whitewash this issue. The world needs to be able to go to sleep at  night saying Iran has not achieved the ability to weaponize its  desires. Iran and the IAEA must resolve the issue before permanent  sanctions relief takes place. Should Iran fail to cooperate with a  comprehensive review into the military dimensions of their program,  then automatic sanctions must snap back.   Fifth, rather than extend the duration of the agreement, we need a  permanent agreement. One of the single most concerning elements of the  original deal is its 10- to 15-year sunset of restrictions on Iran's  programs, with off-ramps starting after year 8.   Well, think about it: 2015-2022--7 years--this shows you how quickly  that, in fact, Iran can be proceeding in a way that we would not want  it to be able to proceed.   And sixth, we need an agreement about what penalties will be  collectively imposed by the P5+1 for Iranian violations, both small and  midsized, as well as a clear statement as to the so-called grandfather  clause which exists in paragraph 37 of the JCPOA, to ensure that the  U.S. position about not shielding contracts entered into legally upon  reimposition of sanctions is shared by our allies. Everybody should be  in the same boat. We are seeing that. And without these elements  clearly delineated, there is room for interpretation admission.   I believe there is space for a deal with Iran. And I believe that one  that garners bipartisan support would be the best guarantor of the  political longevity the Iranians insist they want.   Our goal must be the right deal, not just any deal. We must not agree  to an arrangement that merely delays the inevitable.   As we think about broader diplomatic options, we must be clear about  what a good negotiation entails: Getting more, obviously, requires  giving more. If Iran were willing to make greater concessions on  halting uranium enrichment, destroying nuclear infrastructure, and  seriously constraining its ballistic missile program, the United States  and the international community should consider lifting a  [[Page S461]]  broader scope of sanctions, potentially including some primary  sanctions.   While Iran's leaders are scraping by in the resistance economy, the  truth is that the whole country would be better off if the regime  abandoned their enrichment and weaponization efforts and focused on  providing everyday Iranians with real economic opportunity.   At the same time, Iran must also fully understand that the United  States will not hesitate to take any action necessary to protect our  interests and those of our allies, and that includes the use of  military force where appropriate and necessary. One of our greatest  strengths is our enduring security partnerships with nearly every  country in the Middle East region.   Last month, a group of senior bipartisan diplomats, military  officers, and former Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle  issued a statement to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  about the importance of a credible military threat should Iran breach  certain red lines. Let me quote from their statement. They said:         Indeed, the Vienna negotiations are in danger of becoming a       cover for Iran to move toward achieving a threshold nuclear       weapons capability. . . . While the United States has       recognized Iran's right to civilian nuclear power, Iran's       behavior continues to indicate that it not only wants to       preserve a nuclear weapons option but is actively moving       toward developing that capability. Indeed, as the director-      general of the International Atomic Energy Association,       Rafael Grossi, has stated, Iran's decision to enrich uranium       to 60 percent and to produce uranium metal has no justifiable       civilian purpose. . . . Without convincing Iran it will       suffer severe consequences if it stays on its current path,       there is little reason to hope for the success of diplomacy.    This is all from their statement.         Therefore, for the sake of our diplomatic effort to resolve       this crisis, we believe it is vital to restore Iran's fear       that its current nuclear path will trigger the use of force       against it by the United States. The challenge is how to       restore U.S. credibility in the eyes of Iran's leaders.       Words--including formulations that are more pointed and       direct than ``all options are on the table''--are also       necessary but not sufficient.        In that context, we believe it is important for the Biden       administration to take steps that lead Iran to believe that       persisting in its current behavior and rejecting a reasonable       diplomatic resolution will put to risk its entire nuclear       infrastructure, one built painstakingly over the last three       decades.        Such steps may include orchestrating high-profile military       exercises by the U.S. Central Command, potentially in concert       with allies and partners, that simulate what would be       involved in such a significant operation, including       rehearsing air-to-ground attacks on hardened targets and the       suppression of Iranian missile batteries.        Also important would be to provide both local allies and       partners as well as U.S. installations and assets in the       region with enhanced defensive capabilities to counter       whatever retaliatory actions Iran might choose to make,       thereby signaling our readiness to act, if necessary.        Perhaps most significantly, fulfilling past U.S. promises       to act forcefully against other Iranian outrages, such as the       drone attack by Iran-backed militias against the U.S. base at       al-Tanf in Syria and Iran's illegal capture of merchant ships       and killing unarmed seamen, might have the salutary impact of       underscoring the seriousness of U.S. commitments to act on       the nuclear issue.    Again, I encourage everyone to read this statement from colleagues,  congressional colleagues, military leaders, and diplomats on both sides  of the aisle.   Last year, following years of quiet cooperation and the narrowing of  shared security concerns, the United States and our partners and allies  welcomed Israel into the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.  We have a number of shared interests--from maritime security to  confronting a growing threat of ballistic missiles and UAVs--and we  must continue to strengthen our bilateral and regional partnerships to  ensure that we have all the means necessary to protect our interests.   Moreover, we must forcefully and proportionately respond to Iran's  ongoing attacks on our diplomatic and military facilities in Iraq and  Syria. We will not fail to respond against direct attacks on the United  States that threaten our diplomat and servicemembers. Full stop.   Let me close by saying that the Iranian nuclear threat is real, and  it has grown disproportionately worse by day. It is becoming a clear  and present danger. The time is now to reinvigorate our multilateral  sanctions efforts and pursue new avenues, new ideas, new solutions for  a diplomatic resolution.   But today, I call on the Biden administration and international  community to vigorously and rigorously enforce sanctions, which have  proven to be among the most potent tools for impacting Iran's leaders  and the IRGC. We cannot allow Iran to threaten us into a bad deal or an  interim agreement that allows it to continue to build its nuclear  capacity, nor should we cling to the scope of an agreement that it  seems some are holding on for nostalgia's sake.   As I said 7 years ago, hope is not a national security strategy. In  the words that I spoke in 2015, I said:         Whether or not the supporters of the agreement admit it,       this deal is based on ``hope''; hope that--when the nuclear       sunset clause expires--Iran will have succumbed to the       benefits of commerce and global integration . . .    Well, I hate to say, they have not.         . . . hope that the hardliners will have lost their power       and the revolution will end its hegemonic goals . . .    They have not.         . . . and hope that the regime will allow the Iranian       people to decide their own fate.    The hardliners are more entrenched, and they have not allowed the  Iranian people to decide that future.         Hope is part of human nature, but unfortunately it is not a       national security strategy. The Iranian regime, led by the       Ayatollah, wants above all to preserve the regime and its       Revolution--    Unlike the Green Revolution of 2009. This is still true.       So it stretches incredulity to believe they signed on to a       deal that would in any way weaken the regime or threaten the       goals of the Revolution.    They will not.         I understand that this deal represents a trade-off, a hope       that things [might] be different in Iran in 10-15 years.        Maybe Iran will desist from its nuclear ambitions.    But it has not.         Maybe they'll stop exporting and supporting terrorism.    But it has not.         Maybe they'll stop holding innocent Americans hostage.    But they have not.         Maybe they'll stop burning American flags.    But it has not.         Maybe their leadership will stop chanting ``Death to       America'' in the streets of Tehran.    But it has not. Or the hope was maybe that they won't do those  things. Well, they have continued to do all of those things.   While there are so many crises brewing across the world, we cannot  abandon our efforts to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran and the arms race  it will surely set off in the Middle East. We cannot ignore Iran's  nefarious support for terrorism or accept threats to American interests  and lives. We must welcome legitimate and verifiably peaceful uses of  nuclear power but remain true to our nonproliferation principles and  our unyielding desire to build a more stable, safer, prosperous world  for the American people and for all peace-loving people to thrive. In  order to do so, Iran cannot and must not possess a nuclear weapon.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that with  respect to S.
