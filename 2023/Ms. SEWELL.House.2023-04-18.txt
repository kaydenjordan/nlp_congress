 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary  career of a legal giant and civil rights activist, Alabama's first  Black Federal judge, the Honorable U.W. Clemon, who celebrated his 80th  birthday on April 9.   A native of Alabama, Judge Clemon was born in 1943. Despite spending  much of his childhood in the segregated school system of Jefferson  County, Clemon broke down barriers, graduating as a two-time  valedictorian, first at Westfield High School in 1961 and then Miles  College in 1965.   As a college student, Judge Clemon was a leading voice for civil  rights. He marched in countless student demonstrations under the  direction of Dr.  [[Page H1765]]  King and played a pivotal role in the Selective Buying Campaign to  boycott segregated stores in downtown Birmingham.   Before graduating from Columbia Law School in 1968, Clemon clerked at  the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, forming a lifelong association serving as  local counsel on numerous civil rights lawsuits throughout Alabama.   Judge Clemon always understood the importance of the law in the fight  for justice and equality. He quickly gained a reputation as an  effective and fearless lawyer, taking on Coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant to  desegregate the all-White University of Alabama football team. He took  on the U.S. Steel Corporation, which led to the desegregation of the  American steel industry.   By 1974, Judge Clemon took his advocacy to the Alabama State  Legislature, making history as one of the first two African Americans  elected to the Alabama Senate since Reconstruction.   His tenure as a pioneering lawmaker and skilled attorney caught the  attention of President Jimmy Carter, who appointed then-Senator Clemon  to serve as Alabama's first Black Federal judge in 1980. He went on to  serve on the Federal bench for 30 years until 2009.   Judge Clemon was a highly respected jurist inside and outside the  courtroom. He was known as fair but tough. He demanded that lawyers  before him represent their clients competently and effectively. Judge  Clemon served as the Chief Judge for the United States District Court  for the Northern District of Alabama from 1999 to 2006.   Despite retiring from the bench in 2009, Judge Clemon has remained a  vibrant member of the Birmingham legal community where he continues to  practice law, serving the underrepresented, vulnerable, and  underserved.   He has received numerous awards, holds three honorary degrees, two  street namings, and most recently, an elementary school was named in  his honor.   On a personal note, Judge Clemon is a trusted adviser, counselor, and  a loving father figure to me. My most formative legal experience was  serving as a law clerk for Judge Clemon after graduating from law  school in 1992.   I learned so much serving as his law clerk. I learned more about the  practice of law and saw firsthand what justice looks like by witnessing  him in his courtroom. Sitting with him in his chambers was always an  educational experience. The judge tested my knowledge, stretched my  legal acumen, challenged my views, and inspired me to be a better  lawyer and person.   I know that I now serve as Alabama's first Black Congresswoman  because I was blessed by a transformative experience clerking for  Alabama's first Black Federal judge.   I thank his loving family, his wife of 50 years, Ms. Barbara, and his  two children, Michelle and Isaac, for sharing him with so many of us.   I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 80th birthday and  the extraordinary career of an exceptional jurist, lawmaker, public  servant, and wonderful counselor, Judge U.W. Clemon, whose life's work  stands as a testament to the power of one person to change the world.   May the seeds that Judge Clemon sowed continue to bear fruit for  generations to come.   Happy birthday, Judge.                            ____________________
