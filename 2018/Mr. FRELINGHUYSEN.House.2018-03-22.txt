 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 796, I  call up the bill (H.R. 1625) to amend the State Department Basic  Authorities Act of 1956 to include severe forms of trafficking in  persons within the definition of transnational organized crime for  purposes of the rewards program of the Department of State, and for  other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today to present House amendment to Senate amendment to H.R.  1625, the final appropriations package for fiscal year 2018. This  legislation contains full funding for all the 12 annual appropriations  bills. It represents thousands of hours of work and input by Members of  Congress and our great staff.   Starting 1 year ago with 12 appropriations bills moving through the  committee process last spring, these bills were then considered and  passed on the House floor under a transparent and inclusive process.  This represents the first time the House has passed all 12 bills before  the end of the fiscal year since 2010.   After the bipartisan budget deal was enacted last month,  appropriations committee leadership, House and Senate leadership on  both sides of the aisle, and the White House quickly went to work,  negotiating in good faith and in the best interest of the American  people.   The bill we are considering today is a product of that hard-fought  agreement. In total, the legislation provides $1.3 trillion in  discretionary funding for the Federal Government, including $78.1  billion for the global war on terror and overseas contingency  operations. This meets the caps provided in the recent budget  agreement. Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, it includes historic  investments in our Armed Forces, including the largest year-to-year  increase in  [[Page H2017]]  funding for the Department of Defense since the beginning of the war on  terror.   It fully funds the 2.4 pay increase for our servicemen and -women,  the largest in 8 years, and provides the largest dollar total ever for  the Department of Veterans Affairs.   In addition to strengthening our national defense, this legislation  boosts security here at home: stronger border infrastructure,  additional boots on the ground, and better technology and equipment  that will close the gaps at our borders. Specifically, this includes  more than $1.5 billion for physical barriers and associated technology  along the southwest border.   Overall, funding for border security and law enforcement is increased  by over 30 percent above last year. Funding is also focused on critical  domestic priorities, addressing urgent needs that will improve the  quality of life for all Americans and support economic growth and job  creation, especially infrastructure, providing more than $21.2 billion  in new funding for transportation infrastructure, as well as energy and  water infrastructure, and technology like broadband and cybersecurity.   This passage also targets approximately $84 billion to fight the  opioid epidemic that is devastating families across the country--the  largest investment in addressing this public health issue and emergency  to date. Funding is also directed towards school safety, providing the  training and mental health services and grants to communities that will  help prevent the kind of tragedy and heartbreak that occurred recently  in Florida, and it provides robust funding for wildlife firefighting  prevention programs, and includes long-sought forest management and  fire budgeting reforms that will provide for budget security certainty  and improve the health of our forests.   All these investments are made responsibly, implementing strong  oversight at every level of government to ensure we get the most out of  every dollar. Consequently, Mr. Speaker, I hope that every Member  supports this package.                                time  1115    Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to acknowledge the many  people who helped bring this bill to the floor: to Mrs. Lowey, my  counterpart, the ranking member, thank you for your support and  friendship; the 12 committee chairs and their ranking members for the  hard work that they did over the last 12 months; the Appropriations  Committee staff, all true professionals, some behind me, some across  the floor, some in the galleries, for putting in countless hours and  sleepless nights to help us bring this bill to the floor within a few  weeks of the cap deal.
