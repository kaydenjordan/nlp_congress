 Madam Speaker, and still I rise.   Madam Speaker, I rise because I love my country, and, Madam Speaker,  ``Shall any man be above justice?'' That is the question posed in 1787  by George Mason at the Constitutional Convention.   Shall any man be beyond justice? Madam Speaker, if this President is  allowed to thwart the efforts of Congress  [[Page H12157]]  with a legitimate impeachment inquiry, the President will not only be  above the law, he will be beyond justice. We cannot allow any person to  be beyond justice in this country.   In the name of democracy, on behalf of the Republic, and for the sake  of the many who are suffering, I will vote to impeach, and I encourage  my colleagues to do so as well.   No one is beyond justice in this country.
