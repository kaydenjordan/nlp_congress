 Madam Speaker, the Society for Neuroscience, SFN, is  the world's largest organization of scientists and clinicians focused  on studying the brain and the nervous system. This week, we welcomed  them to Capitol Hill to give us an update on their progress and their  impact.   Federal funding from agencies like the National Institutes of Health  and the National Science Foundation is absolutely critical to their  work. Sustained, reliable funding is critical to continuing  advancements in neuroscience and to scientific advancement in general.   This week is Brain Awareness Week, and I want to commend the BRAIN  Initiative partners. The 2018 total for the BRAIN Initiative program at  NIH is more than $400 million.   I have long supported research investments in neuroscience research.  It is opening up a vast understanding of our brains, and it is vitally  important to the over 100 million Americans impacted by  neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric brain  disorders.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting robust funding for the  National Institutes of Health so that the BRAIN Initiative can continue  its outstanding achievements.                            ____________________
