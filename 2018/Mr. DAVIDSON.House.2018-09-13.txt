 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Douglas Laux  of Coldwater, Ohio.  [[Page H8181]]    After attending Indiana University, Doug served for 7 years with the  Central Intelligence Agency as an operations officer. Unknown to his  family and friends, Doug operated undercover in Afghanistan and Syria,  fighting America's global war on terror.   Working in Afghanistan, Doug quietly penetrated the ranks of al-Qaida  and the Taliban, where he was able to infiltrate and eliminate one of  the largest IED manufacturers in the world.   Doug left the CIA in 2013 and now lives quietly in Coldwater, Ohio,  his hometown.   While Doug does not seek recognition for his past service, his  actions struck a major blow to the enemies of our country, and they  deserve commendation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing the bravery of Mr.  Laux and to wish him continued success as a private citizen.                            ____________________
