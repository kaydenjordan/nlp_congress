 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my five children and my nine  grandchildren and everyone I know, as a matter of fact, I thank the  gentleman for being a champion for privacy for the American people. I  thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle) for his  leadership. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) for his  leadership. The gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo) has been a  champion on this issue as well.   Mr. Speaker, Americans turn to the internet for so many things these  days: buying books, filing taxes, learning about why they are feeling  sick. The Republicans want this information to be sold without your  permission: the websites you visit, the apps you use, your search  history, the content of your emails, your health and financial data.  Overwhelmingly, the American people do not agree with the Republicans  that this information should be sold, and it certainly should not be  sold without your permission.   Our broadband providers know deeply personal information about us and  our families: where we are, what we want, what we are looking for, what  information we want to know, every site we visit, and more. Our  broadband providers can even track us when we are surfing in private,  browsing in a private browsing mode.  [[Page H2498]]    Americans' private browser history should not be up for sale. Yet  Republicans are bringing S.J. Res. 34 to the floor to allow internet  service providers to profit--to profit; this is about profit--from  America's most intimate personal information without our knowledge or  our consent. Republicans' use of the Congressional Review Act will do  permanent damage to the FCC's ability to keep Americans' personal  information safe.   As FCC Commissioner Clyburn and FTC Commissioner McSweeny warned:  ``This legislation will frustrate the FCC's''--the Federal  Communications Commission's--``future efforts to protect the privacy of  voice and broadband customers.''   It is important for our constituents to know that, if the Republicans  had a problem with this particular policy, they might tweak it and say  we don't like it this way or that in regular legislation so that we  could have a debate on it. It could go back to the Federal  Communications Commission. They could revise it and send it back if it  were a legitimate presentation of concerns. But it is not about a  legitimate presentation of concerns. It is about increasing profits at  the expense of the privacy of the American people.   So, as I say, the Republicans' use of the Congressional Review Act  does permanent damage and also damages the FCC's ability to keep  America's personal information safe. With this measure, Republicans  would destroy Americans' right to privacy on the internet--we made that  clear--and forbid any effort to keep your personal information safe.  Republicans are bending over backwards.   Think of it. Think of the context of all of this.   Since Gerald Ford was President, every candidate for President, every  nominee of a major party, every candidate for President of the United  States, Democrat and Republican, has released their income tax returns  out of respect for the American people--out of respect for the American  people. Week in and week out--in fact, sometimes day in and day out--in  committee as well as on the floor, the Republicans have kept the  President's income tax returns private when the public has a right to  know that, that the public has always known that about every President  since Gerald Ford--in fact, since Richard Nixon; although, in his case,  it wasn't voluntary.   So while they are hiding President Trump's tax returns, some discrete  piece of information that the public has a right to know, they are  selling your most personal, selling your most personal and sensitive  information--again, your browsing history, your children's location,  everything--to anyone with the money to buy it.   Incognito tabs or private browsing modes will not protect you from  the internet service providers watching and selling, as Mr. Capuano  pointed out, watching and selling. Republicans have picked the week  after Russian spies were caught hacking into half a billion American  email accounts to open the floodgates, overturning the requirement that  internet service providers keep their sensitive data secured from  cybercriminals.   The American people deserve to be able to insist that intimate  details and information about their browser history be kept private and  secure.   So how is this?   We have this magnificent technology that science has made available  to people to facilitate commerce, to learn about different subjects, to  privately pursue, in a way that they may not even want their families  to know, what symptoms they have and what illness that might tell them  about.   Most Americans have no or limited choices for broadband providers and  no recourse against these invasions of their privacy because, with this  measure, Republicans turn their back on the overwhelming number of  Americans who want more control over their internet privacy.   Americans can choose who represents them in Congress. Americans are  paying close attention. They want to know who is taking a stand with  them in opposing efforts to sell the private information of the  American people.   This is staggering. This is almost a surrender. If the Republicans  are allowed to do this, we have surrendered all thoughts of privacy for  the American people.   Privacy is a value that the American people treasure. It is about  their dignity. It is about their dignity. We cannot allow the  Republicans to sell the dignity of the American people. I hope that  everyone will vote ``no'' on this most unfortunate assault on the  dignity of the American people.                                time  1700
