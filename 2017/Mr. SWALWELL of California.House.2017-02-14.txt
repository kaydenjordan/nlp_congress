 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McGovern for his  work on this issue. I love my country, and I don't doubt that every one  of my colleagues in this Chamber also loves this country. I admire  every man and woman who has so bravely fought to defend it. After all,  this is a country, this is a democracy worth defending. That is  actually what defeating this previous question would take us to, the  question of is this democracy still worth defending.   This past election, our democracy was attacked. The attack was  electronic, and it was nearly invisible. It came from a foreign  adversary in Russia, ordered by Vladimir Putin. It was intended to help  Donald Trump. Most concerning, the public intelligence report about  this attack, the last finding is, Russia intends to do this again. They  are undertaking a lessons-learned campaign so they can attack the  United States again and attack our allies, the best check against  Russia through the NATO alliance.   Yesterday, the President removed a rotten plank in what is a  compromised platform, Michael Flynn. In 2015, he went to Russia and sat  next to Vladimir Putin, was paid for it, and, The New York Times  reported yesterday, did not disclose that in the proper way he is  supposed to to the Department of Defense. Because Russia attacked us,  President Obama issued sanctions against Russia on December 28. Michael  Flynn called Russia, its Ambassador, five times, at least five times,  and discussed those sanctions, likely in violation of the Logan Act. He  lied about it, lied to the Vice President about it, who went on  national TV and defended Michael Flynn, saying it never happened.   But here is what we also learned. We learned that 3 weeks ago the  White House knew, because acting Attorney General Sally Yates told the  White House, that Michael Flynn had lied and had put himself in a  position where he could be compromised through blackmail by the Russian  Government. Yet, despite knowing this, the White House allowed Michael  Flynn to remain as the National Security Adviser, receive security  briefings at the highest level, and advise our President on our  security.   All of the arrows continue to point to the Russian Government. We  have more questions today than we did yesterday about whether there  were any personal, political, or financial connections between  President Trump, his family, his businesses, his campaign, and the  Russian Government before the election and whether there are any  efforts right now going on to pay back the Russian Government.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.  [[Page H1143]]        Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman.    All of the arrows continue to point to  Russia. It is not disputed that Russia carried out this attack. It is  not disputed that it was ordered by President Putin. It is not disputed  that they sought to help Donald Trump. It is not disputed that Donald  Trump admires President Putin and can't say a single bad thing about  him. Despite disparaging our allies in Australia and Mexico, he can't  say a bad thing about Putin. In fact, he wants to ease some of the  sanctions against Russia and wants to roll back the influence of NATO.   Of course, while all of this is going on, the President will not show  us his tax returns. With all of those arrows pointing to Russia, the  American people deserve to know what was the political, personal, and  financial relationship between the President and his team and Russia.  The only way to get there is to have an independent, bipartisan- appointed commission.   Defeating the previous question and bringing up the Protecting Our  Democracy Act will get us one step closer. I believe that my Republican  colleagues--who love this great country as much as I do--can join us,  and this can be a bipartisan quest to say that never again will we  allow a foreign adversary to interfere in our elections.
