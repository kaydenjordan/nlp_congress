 Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment to suspend  implementation of section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division D (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to implement, administer, or enforce a rule issued       pursuant to section 13(p) of the Securities Exchange Act of       1934.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, this misguided provision in Dodd-Frank  requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to mandate that public  companies disclose whether so-called ``conflict minerals'' they use in  their products benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the  Congo and its nine adjoining countries.   Despite its best intentions, section 1502 has been ineffective and,  in some cases, has been shown to have increased violence is central  Africa. That is why this suspension that I am proposing passed the  House last year as an amendment to the FSGG appropriations bill, and a  full repeal of section 1502 passed the House this Congress as part of  the Financial CHOICE Act.   Conflict minerals refer to tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, which  have been used in a variety of products, from cell phones, cosmetics,  jewelry, footwear, apparel, and even auto suppliers located in west  Michigan.   Mr. Chairman, the breadth of voices opposing section 1502 is  remarkable, and I would like to start with those that matter most. For  too long, the people of central Africa have been overlooked in this  debate, even though they are the ones who suffer from Dodd-Frank's  unintended consequences.   I include in the Record an open letter from 70 Congolese leaders and  other regional experts.                               An Open Letter         Dear governments, companies, non-governmental       organisations, and other stakeholders implicated in efforts       of various kinds related to the issue of `conflict minerals',        In early 2014, two international industry giants--Intel and       Apple--issued refined corporate social responsibility       policies for minerals sourced in the eastern Democratic       Republic of the Congo (DRC). The announcements followed an       unprecedented wave of  [[Page H7354]]       guidelines, law-making, and initiatives over the past few       years to `clean up' the eastern DRC's mining sector, and were       met with widespread praise.        Perhaps the most widely publicised of these efforts is US       legislation known as Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act,       which asks all companies registered on the US stock market to       reveal their supply chains to the Securities and Exchange       Commission (SEC) when sourcing minerals from the eastern DRC       or neighbouring countries. Canada is in the advanced stages       of developing similar legislation, and many other countries       are looking closely at the issue. The European Union has       introduced a voluntary conflict minerals regulation scheme       for all member states, and the United Nations (UN) and       Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)       have developed guidelines on sourcing natural resources in       high-risk areas such as the eastern DRC.        These efforts primarily target artisanal (or `informal')       mining in the eastern DRC, due to widespread international       recognition that so-called conflict minerals (most notably       tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) produced by artisanal       mining in this part of the world have helped conflict actors       generate revenue to finance their operations in the DRC over       the past two decades.                                The Situation         Despite successes of activists in shaping policy, the       conflict minerals campaign fundamentally misunderstands the       relationship between minerals and conflict in the eastern       DRC. First, while the minerals help perpetuate the conflict,       they are not its cause. National and regional political       struggles over power and influence as well as issues such as       access to land and questions of citizenship and identity are       just some of the more structural drivers of conflict. The       ability to exploit and profit from minerals is often a means       to finance military operations to address these issues,       rather than an end in itself. Internal UN assessments, for       instance, show that only 8% of the DRC's conflicts are linked       to minerals, and specific motivations vary greatly across the       vast array of different armed groups.        Second, armed groups are not dependent on mineral revenue       for their existence. The eastern DRC is a fully militarised       economy, in which minerals are just one resource among many       that armed groups--and the national army FARDC--can levy       financing from. The M23, until recently the most powerful       non-state armed group in DRC, never sought physical control       over mining activity.        Moreover, few local stakeholders have been included in on-      going international policy-making, and as a result realities       on the ground have not always been taken into account.       Setting up the required systems and procedures to regularly       access and audit thousands of artisanal mining sites in       isolated and hard-to-reach locations spread across an area       almost twice the size of France would be a challenge for any       government. In the eastern DRC, where road infrastructure is       poor to non-existent and state capacity desperately low, the       enormity of the task is hard to overstate. But in demanding       that companies prove the origin of minerals sourced in the       eastern DRC or neighbouring countries before systems able to       provide such proof have been put in place, conflict minerals       activists and resultant legislation--in particular Section       1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act--inadvertently incentivize buyers       on the international market to pull out of the region       altogether and source their minerals elsewhere.                                  The Result         As a result, the conflict minerals movement has yet to lead       to meaningful improvement on the ground, and has had a number       of unintended and damaging consequences. Nearly four years       after the passing of the Dodd-Frank Act, only a small       fraction of the hundreds of mining sites in the eastern DRC       have been reached by traceability or certification efforts.       The rest remain beyond the pale, forced into either       illegality or collapse as certain international buyers have       responded to the legislation by going `Congo-free'.        This in turn has driven many miners into the margins of       legality (for instance, feeding into smuggling rackets),       where armed actors return through the loopholes of       transnational regulation. Others have simply lost their jobs,       and in areas where mining has ceased, local economies have       suffered. To put this in context, an estimated eight to ten       million people across the country are dependent on artisanal       mining for their livelihood. Some former miners have returned       to subsistence agriculture, but persisting insecurity levels       leave them in abject poverty facing dire living conditions,       in fear of missing harvests due to displacement. Others have       been prompted to join militias as a means to quick cash in       the absence of other opportunities; a particularly perverse       impact, when one considers the intentions of the movement.        Alongside the impact on mining communities and local       economies, several armed groups have responded by turning to       different businesses such as trading in charcoal, marijuana,       palm oil, soap, or consumer goods. Those remaining in the       mining sector have largely traded mineral exploitation on       site for mineral taxation a few steps down the supply chain,       operating numerous roadblocks that can bring in millions of       dollars a year. Others are reported to have sent in family       members or civilian allies to run business for them on site,       while they remain safely at a distance.        For the few mining sites fortunate enough to be reached by       Joint Assessment Teams responsible for determining their       `conflict-free' status, these teams have been unable to       provide the regular, three-month validation visits envisaged       in legislation. There is an additional delay of several       months following these visits before the Congolese Ministry       of Mines reviews and approves the assessment at the national       level. Given the speed at which situations can change in       volatile environments, infrequent assessments and lengthy       delays raise concerns over the accuracy of certification and       the credibility of the system.        More worrying still, multinational corporations such as       Apple and Intel are auditing smelters to determine the       conflict-free status of the minerals they source, and not the       mines themselves. As smelters are located outside of the DRC       and audits are not always conducted by third parties, these       processes raise further concerns over whether conflict-free       certifications reflect production realities.        By far the most advanced site in terms of producing       `conflict-free' minerals for sale to the international market       is Kalimbi, a tin mining area home to externally-financed       initiatives running an industry-led bagging-and-tagging       scheme called iTSCi. Yet even here, despite the establishment       of a `closed pipeline' from mine to exportation, the mine       still suffers from the sporadic influence of armed actors,       and miners are made to bear the additional costs of       `conflict-free' schemes. This raises further concerns over       the credibility of the system in place, and its suitability       for the scale-up and expansion to other, more remote mine       sites currently underway. Coupled with slow progress in       implementation, the trend towards the monopolisation of       `conflict-free' supply chain initiatives, in particular       traceability by iTSCi, is economically damaging to local       populations since it currently excludes and isolates the       overwhelming majority of mining communities from legal access       to international markets.                               The Alternative         There is broad consensus for the need to clean up the       eastern Congo's minerals sector, yet much disagreement about       the international community's current model for achieving       this goal. As such, efforts to improve transparency in the       eastern DRC's mineral supply chains should continue. Yet a       more nuanced and holistic approach that takes into account       the realities of the eastern DRC's mining sector and the       complexity of the conflict is needed. To this end, we make       the following five recommendations:        Improve consultation with government and communities:       Congolese government and civil society were poorly consulted       on Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act prior to its passing,       and as a result many were unaware of its implications. The       few who were consulted were unanimously pro-Dodd-Frank,       creating additional conflicts on local levels where       endorsement and dissent compete. More Congolese voices must       be listened to, and the local context and power structures       taken into account. This would ensure greater understanding       of the local context and better harmonisation with existing       national and regional initiatives, such as the International       Conference of the Great Lakes Region's (ICGLR) Regional       Initiative against the Illegal Exploitation of Natural       Resources.        Work towards meaningful reform: The audit process should be       designed to improve policies and practices rather than to       just provide window-dressing. The dominant belief that static       oversight and validation processes ensure `conflict-free'       mineral trade is misplaced given the volatile security       situation in most of the eastern DRC. Both mines and smelters       should be regularly inspected and the time period between       inspection and certification minimized. Where this is not       feasible, additional waivers or similar measures should not       be ruled out.        Create incentives towards better practice: Legal frameworks       must be supported by real projects on the ground that can       meet their requirements. If this is not possible--which is       clearly still the case today, nearly four years after the       passing of Dodd-Frank--then transition periods must be       extended and the lowering of excessively high standards for       `conflict-free' minerals should be considered. Similarly,       former conflict actors should be incentivised where       appropriate to join new `conflict-free' schemes. This may       help avoid the eventual subversion or infiltration of the       `clean' system put in place, as has been seen to date.        Promote fair competition: Regulation must be based on       competition that allows not only international businesses but       also Congolese producers to influence (i.e. increase) local       price schemes. This in turn would encourage a regime that       ensures minimum wages which mining cooperatives can guarantee       to their members based on their increased leverage on the       price fluctuation.        Widen the lens: Root causes of conflict such as land,       identity, and political contest in the context of a       militarized economy, rather than a single focus on minerals,       must be considered by advocates seeking to reduce conflict       violence. Furthermore, efforts to eradicate conflict minerals       should not overlook the fact that artisanal mining is a key       livelihood in the eastern DRC that holds as much potential to       help steer the region away from conflict as it does to       contribute towards it. More supportive measures are needed--      such as those found in the earlier 2009  [[Page H7355]]       draft of the US Conflict Minerals Act--that can help capture       the economic potential of artisanal mining. Finally, other       critical challenges such as access to credit, technical       knowledge, hazardous working conditions, and environmental       degradation should not be ignored by multinational       corporations if they seek to improve business practices and       increase transparency in their supply chains.        So far, progress has been made in producing more ethical       products for consumers, but stakeholders have not yet       proceeded to improve the lives of Congolese people, nor       address the negative impact current `conflict-free'       initiatives are having. If the conflict minerals agenda is to       lead to positive change on the ground, legislation passed by       national governments and steps such as those outlined by       Apple or Intel need to be grounded in a more holistic       approach that is better tailored to local realities. Failure       to do so will continue to seriously limit the ability of       conflict minerals initiatives to improve the daily lives of       the eastern Congolese and their neighbours. Worse, these       initiatives will risk contributing to, rather than       alleviating, the very conflicts they set out to address.                             List of Signatories         1.

All the signatories listed express their support to the       open letter in its above form but not necessarily approve of       accompanying opinion pieces and/or explanatory notes, which       remain their respective authors' views.     Mr. Chair, they state in the letter that section 1502  provisions ``. . . inadvertently incentivize buyers on the  international market to pull out of the region altogether and source  their minerals elsewhere.   ``As a result, the conflict minerals movement has yet to lead to  meaningful improvement on the ground, and has had a number of  unintended and damaging consequences.''   Dodd-Frank's impact on African miners may seem unimportant to many  rich-country activists, but in the Congo, it has been the question of  life or death.   According to a Washington Post article entitled ``How a well- intentioned U.S. law left Congolese miners jobless,'' section 1502  ``set off a chain of events that has propelled millions of Congolese  miners and their families deeper into poverty.''   The article goes on to share the story of how a Congolese teenager  could no longer feed himself after Dodd-Frank ravaged the country's  mining sector, forcing the young man to actually join an armed group;  the outcome diametrically opposed in the goal of section 1502.   Mr. Chairman, no one can claim that these effects were unforeseeable.  In fact, in a letter to the SEC commenting on section 1502, leaders  from three Congolese mining cooperatives predicted that the conflict  minerals rule would lead to a devastating boycott.   These miners wrote: ``We cannot continue to suffer any longer. Do we  now have to choose between dying by a bullet or starving to death?''   I ask my colleagues to remember the Congolese aren't alone in their  suffering. The SEC's rules apply to nine  [[Page H7356]]  other nations as if they were all one single country. Section 1502  treats over 230 million Africans living in 10 distinct nations as one  undifferentiated group.   Dodd-Frank's supporters will say that at this point, some countries  neighboring Congo may help smuggle minerals on behalf of armed groups,  which is why we need to paint with such a broad brush. But I would ask  my colleagues to name another example where a country's economy and  each of its neighbors is targeted due to a presumed smuggling risk.   Do we design Russia sanctions to apply to each of its 14 adjoining  countries, too?   Do Iranian sanctions implicate all seven of its neighbors?   Perhaps advocates for section 1502 believe that there is no smuggling  from Russia and Iran, but the real issue seems to be this: Dodd-Frank  supporters have no problem treating Africans differently from other  regions of the world.   I find that troubling. So now let's consider implementation of  section 1502 itself.   In April of this year, the GAO reported that section 1502 has  produced little meaningful information on conflict mineral sourcing. It  found that more than half of the companies in 2016 couldn't even  determine what country their minerals came from. Most importantly,  virtually none of the companies could tell whether their minerals  benefited armed groups, a conclusion that echoed GAO's findings from  2015 and 2014 as well.   No wonder companies can't figure this out, Mr. Chairman. Even the  Department of Commerce has reported that it is unable to determine  whether smelters around the world use minerals traceable to armed  groups. In other words, Dodd-Frank is asking U.S. companies--some of  which are very small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in large  corporations' supply chains--to produce information that even the  Federal Government can't provide.   As if that weren't enough, the courts also struck down parts of  section 1502 for violating companies' First Amendment rights.   The Trump administration's SEC has had enough of section 1502  failures, and is now reexamining the conflict mineral rule. The State  Department is now conducting a review to see how responsible sourcing  can be undertaken more effectively. The amendment I am offering today  would suspend section 1502 while the administration completes its  assessment.   Mr. Chairman, the facts I have laid out on section 1502 aren't  partisan, and a suspension shouldn't be either. So let me close with  the words of Barack Obama's Securities and Exchange Commission Chair,  Mary Jo White, who, in 2013, said: ``Seeking to improve safety in mines  for workers or to end horrible human rights atrocities in the DRC are  compelling objectives, which, as a citizen, I wholeheartedly share. But  as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, I must question, as  a policy matter, using the Federal securities laws and the SEC's powers  of mandatory disclosure to accomplish these goals.''   It should tell us something when even Democrats' own Securities and  Exchange Commission Chair warns that Dodd-Frank overreached on conflict  minerals. A suspension would be something that Republicans and  Democrats can agree on, and I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
