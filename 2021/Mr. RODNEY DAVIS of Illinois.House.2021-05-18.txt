 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my  wife's grandmother, Mary Alice Workman, who, sadly, passed away in late  January at the age of 98.   Mary Alice was born in Decatur. She married her husband, Richard, in  1941. She was a member of the First United Methodist Church in  Assumption, Illinois.   Mary Alice will be remembered for her kindheartedness, for the love  of her large family, and for living life to the fullest.   Mary Alice is now resting peacefully with her husband, Richard; and  her favorite dog, Leo.   It is a sad loss for our family and everyone who had the pleasure of  getting to know her. It is always difficult saying good-bye to someone  we love and appreciate, especially when you couldn't see them in person  before they passed.   Shannon, Toryn, Griffin, Clark, and I send our thoughts and prayers  to her children, Kenneth, Kathleen, and Nancy; and their families; and  her other grandchildren, Randy, Kelly, Curt, Ric; and the rest of her  great-grandchildren, Trenee, Ryan, Ross, Connor, Sydney, Grace, and  Payton.   Mary Alice, may you rest in peace.                         Honoring Trevor Herderhorst     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Trevor Herderhorst of Highland, Illinois, who died on April 25 after a  courageous fight with cancer.   Trevor began his dream of becoming a firefighter in 2005 with the  Cahokia Volunteer Fire Department. Later, he graduated from SIUC with a  degree in fire service management, and went on to serve as a Granite  City firefighter. In 2018, Trevor started his dream job with the City  of Champaign Fire Department in its Operations Division. Trevor loved  being a firefighter and was a proud professional, always striving to  hone his skills to save lives.   Those who knew Trevor will remember him for his inspirational  positivity and his passion for making the world around him a better  place and his love for baseball.   My prayers are with Trevor's wife, Tiffany; his children, Chase and  Olivia; and all his friends and family spread throughout the  communities he made better with his presence. He will truly be missed.                       Recognizing Knight's Action Park     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Knight's Action Park in Springfield, Illinois, which is celebrating 91  years of business this year.   It was founded in 1930 as a golf driving range by George Knight, Sr.,  after he spent a few years touring the country as the caddy for four- time U.S. Open champion Willie Anderson.   George Knight, Jr., and his wife, Audrey, started an archery range in  1951, and later opened the family entertainment center. Knight's Action  Park spans 60 acres and three generations of the Knight family. Over  the years, it has added a water park, pub, and drive-in theater.   Like many businesses that rely on large attendance, they faced  challenges amidst the coronavirus pandemic. They credit the Paycheck  Protection Program for allowing them to survive 2020, so they can  continue to provide jobs for 200 seasonal workers, 10 permanent staff,  and family fun for me, my family, and my constituents. Hopefully, they  will be able to fully reopen soon.   Again, congratulations to the Knights on their 91st anniversary, and  I wish them all the best in the years to come.                         Recognizing Dr. Larry Dietz     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  my friend, Dr. Larry Dietz, the 19th president of Illinois State  University, who will retire on June 30 after a remarkable 50-year  academic career.   Dr. Dietz began his career at ISU in 2011 as the Vice President for  Student Affairs. In 2014, he was appointed Illinois State's 19th  president. Prior to coming to ISU, he served as Vice Chancellor of  Student Affairs at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and he held  various other leadership positions at the University of Missouri and  Iowa State University.   President Dietz's passion for higher education has taken an already  highly esteemed ISU to new heights. With his leadership, the university  is continually ranked among the top in the Nation for high graduation  and retention rates and low student loan default rates. He leaves ISU  on a footing that is full of potential.   I have had the pleasure of working with Larry since he became  president. A personal testament I have to his success is the fact that  all three of my children attend Illinois State University, the  institution he leads.   Congratulations on your retirement, Mr. President.                            ____________________
