 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3003. This is  a very positive first step toward coming to grips with an issue that  has divided this country because it is causing great damage to so many  Americans.   What we are talking about is not immigrant hysteria. That type of  mixing legal immigrants with illegal immigrants, that is the true  racism because it hurts those people who have come here legally. Now,  what we have got here are legal immigrants who are being cast into the  same pot as illegals, with the opposition to this bill.   People who are here legally understand that we need protection for  people who are here in this country against, especially, criminals who  come from overseas and illegal aliens who are criminals, at that.   Working Americans of every race, religion, and ethnic group have seen  that their families are less secure, and they are even sometimes being  murdered by the insane lack of action on the part of our government to  protect our citizens.   Our number one responsibility is to make sure our own people, legal  immigrants, and all Americans of every race, creed, and color are  protected.   And what do they see?   This massive flood of illegals coming into our country, taking jobs,  bidding down wages, lowering the education standards and the healthcare  that most Americans rely upon.                                time  1315    No wonder the American people want action. But then, when they are  faced with a city saying even criminals who have committed acts of  aggression, murder, et cetera, upon our citizens, that we are going to  let them just stay, and that there is going to be a block.   Whose side are you on is what this amendment is all about. Are we on  the side of the American people? Are we on the side of those victims  who work hard every day and try to raise their families; or are we on  the side of a massive flow of people, many of whom, and most of whom,  are good people?    Most of the people who come here, most of the people  flooding here, even the illegals, are basically wonderful people. But  that doesn't mean that we can bring in more than that, 1 million--   By the way, we need to understand, don't condemn America on its  immigration policy. We let a million legal immigrants into our country  every year, and that is more than the rest of the world combined. We  can be proud of that.   But, at the same time, we have to make sure that our people are  protected, that they don't lose their jobs, or they don't have to  accept less money for the same work because you have got somebody here  who will work for nothing.   We want to make sure when they need their healthcare, they get their  healthcare. That will bankrupt our system. Are we going to have a  sanctuary healthcare system, too, so anybody in the world can come here  and use up our scarce health dollars?   No, it is time for us to strike a blow for the protection of  Americans and legal immigrants of every race and religion and ethnic  background, not to show these things. Immigrant hysteria; shame, shame,  shame.
