 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  joint resolution (H.J. Res. 3) approving the location of a memorial to  commemorate and honor the members of the Armed Forces who served on  active duty in support of Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert  Shield.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 3         Whereas subsection (b)(1) of section 8908 of title 40,       United States Code, provides that the location of a       commemorative work in the area depicted as ``Area I'' on the       map described in subsection (a) of that section shall be       deemed to be authorized only if approved by law not later       than 150 days after the date on which Congress is notified       that the subject of the commemorative work is of preeminent       historical and lasting significance to the United States;        Whereas section 3093 of the Carl Levin and Howard P.       ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2015 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note; Public Law 113-291)       authorized the National Desert Storm Memorial Association to       establish a memorial in the District of Columbia to       commemorate and honor the members of the Armed Forces who       served on active duty in support of Operation Desert Storm or       Operation Desert Shield; and        Whereas the Secretary of the Interior has notified Congress       of the determination of the Secretary of the Interior that       the subject of the memorial is of preeminent historical and       lasting significance to the United States and may be located       in Area I: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That the       location of the commemorative work authorized by section 3093       of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (40 U.S.C.       8903 note; Public Law 113-291) to commemorate and honor the       members of the Armed Forces who served on active duty in       support of Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield,       within Area I, as depicted on the map described in section       8908(a) of title 40, United States Code, is approved.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the joint resolution under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.J. Res. 3 by Congressman Roe of Tennessee authorizes  the National Desert Storm War Memorial Association to consider sites  along or near the National Mall for a memorial to honor the members of  Armed Forces who served on Active Duty in support of Operation Desert  Storm or Operation Desert Shield.   Under the Commemorative Works Act, any memorial proposed to be  located on Federal land along or near the National Mall must be  approved by Congress after the Secretary of the Interior determines  that the proposed work is ``of preeminent historical and lasting  significance to the United States.''   The Secretary of the Interior has recommended that the Desert Storm  War Memorial Association be authorized to consider sites in Area I for  the memorial, and this resolution would provide Congress' approval of  the Secretary's recommendation. Congress provided initial authorization  for the Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial in 2014, and the  memorial is to be funded solely by private donations.   History will no doubt continue to debate the political decisions that  stopped our forces before they reached Baghdad, but it has already  recorded and judged the effectiveness, the heroism, and the devotion of  our Armed Forces and their commanders in the field who utterly  vanquished the largest army in the Middle East in just 100 hours and  who liberated the people of Kuwait from a hideous and sadistic  occupation.   This memorial will do more than honor the 382 Americans who gave  their lives in the gulf war and ensure that they will not be forgotten.  After all, as Lincoln said at Gettysburg:         The honor they earned on the battlefield cannot be added to       or detracted by us, and long after our words are forgotten,       their deeds will be remembered and celebrated.    But this monument will also remind future generations at home and  abroad, friend and foe, of what American Armed Forces can do to rescue  and protect the weak, and vanquish and punish the guilty, when  competently commanded in the field and backed by the full resolve of  the American people in a righteous cause.   I urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), the author of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure.   I yield back the balance of my time.
