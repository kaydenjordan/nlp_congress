 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Mike Langford on his retirement.   Mike had served as the president of the Utility Workers Union of  America since 2006 and has been a major leader of that union for many  decades.   During his time at the UWUA, Mike has worked hard to bring about  overdue reform that delivers safe, reliable, cost-effective, and  environmentally friendly utility services across this whole country.   I share his commitment to a cleaner environment and more affordable  services for working families. And, as a former union organizer, I  thank Mike for his outstanding dedication to American workers.   Indeed, I can personally attest to Mike's stalwart leadership of all  American workers as a member of the AFL-CIO Executive Council. And I  also want to point out that America's veterans have had no better  friend than Mike Langford, who helped set up programs to train hundreds  and thousands of them for careers in the utility industry.   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mike on his  retirement and on wishing him the very best for the next chapter of his  life.                            ____________________
