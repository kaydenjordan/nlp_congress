 Mr. Speaker, when a magician performs, they often utilize  misdirection as a way to deceive an audience. Wikipedia defines  ``misdirection'' as a form of deception in which the attention of the  audience is focused on the one thing in order to distract its attention  from another.   Today, the Republicans are performing a cruel trick on the American  people. The Nation is repulsed by President Trump's directives that  have forced the separation of over 3,000 children from their parents at  the Nation's border, placed children in cages, and terrorized children.  As one 9-year-old victim said, he was treated like a prisoner and a  dog. This is cruel, inhumane, and un-American.   Rather than have Congress take up a directive to reunite children  with their parents, the GOP is performing some misdirection to another  issue, hoping that you won't notice that they will not stand up against  the GOP's policy of family separation and putting kids in cages at our  Nation's borders. Why? Because many of the GOP Members support the  President's shameful actions.    Now they want to play politics and misdirect your  attention.   I won't be complicit in their attempts. I will vote ``present'' today  to be present for the children and parents separated at the border.   Shame on you for terrorizing children and ignoring pleas to help  them.
