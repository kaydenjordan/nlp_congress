 Madam Speaker, the United States is home to the most  remarkable people in the world. We are the most caring, giving, and  united country that has ever existed. But that is not the outlook we  see daily in the news and on social media. Big traditional and social  media outlets would have you convinced that Americans don't help each  other. The algorithms used by these companies are designed to show  controversy and to lead you to believe that there is more divisiveness  in our society than harmony.   But that is not true. Since being elected to Congress, I have seen  firsthand that the Texas Sixth Congressional District is home to many  remarkable people; so much so that each week my office sends out dozens  of recognition letters highlighting some of their achievements.   While in Washington, D.C., I have had the incredible opportunity to  work with countless individuals, a lot of whom deserve the highest  praise for their service to the American people. To be clear: These  individuals I am referencing do not just make up my own party but also  those across the aisle. Bipartisanship is alive and well up here, and I  am proud to say that I am surrounded by like-minded individuals on both  sides of the aisle who have dedicated their lives to public service,  [[Page H5971]]  working tirelessly for the betterment of the American people.   Growing up back home in Perryton, Texas, my pastor would start off  every Sunday service with what he called ``Joys and Concerns.'' During  this time, he would highlight some of the remarkable things that  members of the church were doing and some prayer requests, to unite us  as a congregation to pray for our community and those in need.   I will give my own version of ``Joys and Concerns.'' Let's start with  the joys. These upstanding constituents deserve to be recognized:   I start by congratulating the valedictorians and salutatorians for  the 2021-2022 school year.

From Arlington Seguin High School: Valedictorian, Nhi Dinh, and  Salutatorian, Linh Vu.   Again, congratulations on your remarkable achievement. I look forward  to seeing what each one of you accomplishes in the coming years.   I also want to acknowledge the 12 outstanding young men and women we  have from the Sixth Congressional District who have received and  accepted appointments to our service academies.   For the United States Naval Academy we have: Ethan Clarke and Jazmin  Lemus.   For the United States Air Force Academy: Seth Ramsey, Destiny Speltz,  Carson Yingling, Lauren St. Clair, Oluwakorede Oylalami, Megan Fellows,  and Jaiden Lanier.   For the United States Military Academy at West Point: Vinh Ho and  Charlotte Patterson.   For the United States Merchant Marine Academy: Anthony Schmidt.   Next, I want to recognize members of our community who have gone  above and beyond.   Let's start with Officer Rebecca Pevehouse. Madam Speaker, I  congratulate Rebecca on her recent appointment as a field training  officer in the Red Oak Police Department. I also recognize Rebecca for  being awarded Enforcement Hero by MADD North Texas. The hard work  Rebecca puts forth to keep our community safe has not gone unnoticed. I  thank Rebecca for all that she does.   It is an honor to recognize Priscilla Sanchez for more than 16 years  of public service in the Mansfield community. Her outstanding  performance as a senior code compliance inspector and then as the  volunteer coordinator has helped strengthen the relationship between  the residents and community members.   I congratulate Connie Hickman on her retirement from Precinct 4  Justice of the Peace in Navarro County. It is an honor to recognize her  for her nearly 40 years of public service to her community.   I welcome Chris Young and congratulate him on his new position as an  assistant fire chief for the city of Red Oak.   I congratulate Darrell Hull on his recent new position as the city  manager for Kennedale. Darrell brings a wealth of experience, and he  previously served a 25-year career in Kennedale. The city of Kennedale  is fortunate to have him in this position.   Michael Watson is a sophomore at Southwestern Assemblies of God  University in Waxahachie, Texas. He led SAGU's baseball team to a 38-16  finish and was named this year's NCAA National Pitcher of the Year.  Congratulations to Michael and the team for their outstanding work and  achievements.   Next, let me highlight the Eagle Scouts. To become an Eagle Scout  takes years of dedication and hard work. To achieve this rank, Scouts  must complete 18 hours of community service and demonstrate leadership  within their troop. Only 5 percent of Scouts reach the rank of Eagle  Scout. This year, Ethan Miller reached that goal. I congratulate him.   It is an honor to recognize Master Sergeant Roger Hardie for his 15- plus years of service in education in the Corsicana community. His  outstanding performance as the Air Force JROTC instructor has helped  strengthen the relationship between our students and community  members. I thank him for his service.    Ashley Perkins has been working as an emergency medical dispatcher in  Mansfield for several years, and in 2021, she was named Emergency  Medical Dispatcher of the Year. I thank Ashley for her continued  service to the Mansfield community.   I congratulate Fox Luu on his new position as chief of police in  Richland. Luu has been serving his community as a first responder for  many years, and I am confident he will do so for many years to come.   I congratulate Zoey Burt on starting her new position as sergeant in  the Maypearl ISD Police Department.   Ron Appleton has been well known in his community since 1966. He  started out as an ag teacher at Waxahachie ISD and worked his way to  district administration. I personally congratulate Ron on having the  Ron Appleton Agriscience Facility in Waxahachie named after him. It is  a beautiful facility, and the impact Ron has had on his students is  immeasurable. I thank him for all that he has done.   Chantell Reiper was awarded Employee of the First Quarter from  Navarro Regional Hospital for 2022. This award is a tribute to her  courageous and selfless acts working in healthcare. I truly appreciate  all the work that Chantell does in physician practice and women's  services.  [[Page H5972]]    I personally congratulate Fred Pontley on his retirement from being a  distinguished lieutenant of the Ennis Police Department. It is an honor  to recognize him for his 25 years of public service to the people of  Ennis.   This year marks the 75th anniversary of Navarro College. What started  out in 1946 with a group of returning veterans from World War II has  now become a pillar in the community not only in Corsicana but also in  Waxahachie. From the first class dubbed as the ``barracks bunch'' to  the students who graduated this year, Navarro College is dedicated to  serving our community. Congratulations to Navarro College on 75 years.   I congratulate Jerry Lozier from Waxahachie Global High School on  being named the Texas Association of Secondary School Principals Region  X Assistant Principal of the Year for the 2021-2022 school year. I  thank Jerry for his commitment to Waxahachie ISD.   Each year Mansfield ISD honors nonteaching staff with the Shining  Star Award for exceptional service and contributions to their students  and staff members. This year's recipient was Brenda Stewart. As a  crossing guard, each morning Brenda gets up to ensure the safety of all  students going to Mansfield ISD. I thank Brenda for all her hard work  and her dedication to her community.   Congratulations to Chrisanna Melick on winning first place in the UIL  State competition for journalism by leading the Waxahachie fine arts  program. I pass on my sincerest congratulations to the team of Morgan  Lenamond, Maven Navarro, Katie Walker, and Owen Bartosh. This entire  team put on a brilliant performance to take Waxahachie High School to  the top.   I congratulate Greg Ellis on being named the new head football coach  for Southwestern Assemblies of God University. I wish him good luck.   I congratulate Elizabeth Tull on being awarded the Excellence in  Community Service Award by the Rebecca Boyce Chapter of the national  Daughters of the American Revolution and for being crowned the Crape  Myrtle Queen at the annual Crape Myrtle Festival in Waxahachie.   I congratulate Nolan Haisler on being recognized for 50 years of  service as an H-E-B Ennis partner. Yes, that is 50 years at H-E-B. This  honor recognizes him for his commitment to the city of Ennis that will  leave a lasting impact for many years to come.   It is always a big deal when a small-town boy makes it to the big  leagues. From Navarro College to SMU, and now with the Indianapolis  Colts, I congratulate Trevor Denbow on his achievement. He showed hard  work pays off, and I know his family is very proud of him, as is the  entire city.   I congratulate Sonia Rivera on being awarded Detention Officer of the  Year by the Navarro County Sheriff's Office for 2021.   I want to bring attention to five young women who earned the honor of  receiving the Girl Scouts Gold Award: Dani DelVecchio, Samantha Aos,  Julia Daniel, Caelin Whitley, and Camden Woolery. To receive this  award, they each had to help fix a problem in their community or make a  lasting change in their world.   Dani worked with Legacy Oaks, a retirement facility in Midlothian, to  create garden buckets for the residents. She and her volunteers built  two garden centers containing eight semi-self-sustaining garden  buckets. The buckets are housed in a structure that allows easy access,  regardless of a person's mobility level. Plants chosen for the gardens  are easy to grow, high yielding, and compatible with each other,  eliminating the need for pesticides. The new gardens encourage the  residents to go outside, socialize, and offer an ongoing activity. The  newly formed Green Thumb Club at the facility will maintain the gardens  using instructions Dani provided.   Samantha partnered with the Texas Conservation Alliance and Ducks  Unlimited to address wood duck habitation loss. After learning that  north Texas is along the path of the central flyway, the primary flight  route for migratory birds, Samantha created resting spots and safe  havens to protect these birds from predators. Together with her  volunteers, Samantha built and installed 20 wood duck nesting boxes in  three counties in north Texas. The Texas Conservation Alliance has  agreed to monitor the boxes, which will provide homes for generations  of wood ducks to protect the eggs from predators and support population  growth.   Julia's project was designed to assist older individuals with the  difficult task of downsizing. Working with her church, Julia identified  individuals who needed to organize and declutter their homes. She set  up consultations with each family and set goals and dates to sort  through items. With volunteer assistance, each family determined what  they would donate, throw away, and keep during the process. The  families were able to declutter in a positive way, even under difficult  circumstances like a family death. The youth group at her church will  consider continuing this service with instructions on the process  provided by Julia.    Caelin used her love of performing arts to start a local theater  company to serve youth. Working with an anonymous donor and a local  dance studio, Caelin was able to offer young artists the opportunity to  be part of a theater production and work with professional actors at no  cost. Twenty-three students created a production together, running tech  or being a part of the cast. With her volunteers, Caelin organized the  rental of the performing space, the selection of the play, rehearsal  planning, and all costuming. Using Caelin's framework, The Troupe  Theater has become a nonprofit organization that will offer low-cost  theater experiences to local youth.   Camden's project supported The Outlet Thrift Store, a nonprofit that  helps fund camps and special projects for at-risk youth. The  organization historically had difficulty processing donations quickly.  Recognizing the relationship between inventory on the sales floor and  potential revenue to benefit children, Camden built shelving units,  added organizational bins with labels, and established a system to  streamline the donation receiving process. The new system allowed  merchandise to be placed on the floor for sale in a much quicker and  efficient manner. The store will maintain the new organization system  moving forward and use a similar process when they open new stores.   These are just a few examples of some outstanding people living in  Texas' Sixth District. It is my privilege to honor them on the House  floor.   Every Sunday, after the ``joys'' would come ``concerns,'' and there  was never a shortage because everyone knew in Matthew he says: ``Where  two or three are gathered in my name I am in the midst of them.'' It is  no different today, and we face a great number of challenges in our  country.   So I ask that you keep all Americans in your prayers.   Pray for our farmers and ranchers, who have faced incredible trials  and tribulations these past couple of years as they continue to provide  for all of us.   Pray for those affected by the war in Ukraine as they face an  aggressor who cares not for morality and willfully disregards the  importance of human life.   Pray for those affected by the fentanyl epidemic, which has  devastated our communities.   Pray for the families who have lost loved ones and the innocent human  life taken by human slavery as a result of the disarray in human  trafficking at our border.   Continue to keep the people of Uvalde, especially the families of  those most affected, in your prayers.   Keep those struggling with mental health in your prayers, and be a  voice of light in a time of darkness to those who need help. Keep joy  in your hearts, hope in man, and faith in God.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
