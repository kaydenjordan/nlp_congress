 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National  Charter School Week. This week, we honor the hope that charter schools  deliver to millions of students nationwide, and we are reminded that  education is about students, not politics. One such example is Piedmont  Community Charter School in North Carolina's Fifth District.   Regardless of ZIP Code, all American families deserve to decide, free  of government interference, which learning environment best suits their  child's strengths.   For 30 years, charter schools have prepared underserved students for  lifelong success. Charter school alumni graduate from college at two to  four times the national average for low-income families.   While Democrats dictate one-size-fits-all education requirements,  Republicans are fighting to offer educational freedom and choice.  Charter schools offer students from every walk of life the opportunity  to learn in an environment that works for them so they can develop  tools to thrive.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding tonight for  a very short but very serious and solemn set of comments.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to two members of the  Watauga County Sheriff's Office who lost their lives in the line of  duty on April 28.   Sergeant Chris Ward, an 8-year law enforcement officer, and K-9  Deputy Logan Fox, a former deputy of the Ashe County Sheriff's Office,  left an indelible mark on Watauga County.   This is a tremendous loss not only for Watauga County, but also for  law enforcement across the State and country. These two fallen heroes  dedicated their lives to law enforcement, and many who knew them  recognized that their passion for serving the community they were proud  to call home was second to none.   This Monday, a Community Day of Remembrance in Boone, North Carolina,  was held in their honor.   Businesses, organizations, and proud citizens of Watauga County came  together to show their overwhelming support for law enforcement and for  first responders.   Mr. Speaker, across America law enforcement officers like Sergeant  Ward and Deputy Fox wake up every day with one important goal in mind:  fulfilling their duty to uphold law and order. These proud men and  women leave for work knowing that they may not come home to their  families, but still, they answer the call to serve without a moment's  hesitation. That level of commitment to one's duty and community is  truly awe-inspiring, and I firmly believe that we owe law enforcement a  profound debt of gratitude.   Mr. Speaker, I will always support law enforcement across this  country. They are true gatekeepers of law and order, and they must be  respected.   Calls to defund the police from the left are egregious and divisive.  That rhetoric is profoundly dangerous and is an insult to the men and  women who work around the clock to protect us.   God bless the countless law enforcement officers across this country  and their families. We are forever grateful for the sacrifices you  continue to make.                                time  1930
