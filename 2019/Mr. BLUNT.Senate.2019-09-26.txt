 Mr. President, in accordance with rule 23 of the Rules of  Procedure of the Committee on Rules and Administration and pursuant to  Public Law 115-364, on September 25, 2019, the Committee adopted the  U.S. Senate Disabled Veteran Leave Regulations.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               U.S. Senate Disabled Veteran Leave Regulations    Adopted by the Committee on Rules and Administration on September 25,                                    2019       Sec. 1301 Purpose and authority.         These regulations implement 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6329, which       establishes a leave category, to be known as ``disabled       veteran leave,'' for an eligible employee who is a veteran       with a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or       more. Such an employee is entitled to this leave for purposes       of undergoing medical treatment for such disability. Disabled       veteran leave must be used during the 12-month period       beginning on the first day of employment. The Committee's       authority to promulgate these regulations is found in section       1(b) of Public Law 115-364.       Sec. 1302 Applicability.         These regulations apply to a Senate employee who is a       veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 30       percent or more, subject to the conditions specified in these       regulations. These regulations apply only to a Senate       employee who is hired on or after November 5, 2016.       Sec. 1303 Definitions.         In these regulations:        ``12-month eligibility period'' means the continuous 12-      month period that begins on the first day of employment.        ``Agency'' means an agency of the Federal Government. In       the case of an agency in the Executive branch, it means an       Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 105.        ``Employee'' has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C.       Sec. 6329(d).        ``Employing office'' has the meaning given that term in 2       U.S.C Sec. 1301(9).        ``Employment'' means service as an employee during which       the employee is covered by a leave system or leave policy       under which leave is charged for periods of absence. This       excludes service in a position in which the employee is not       covered by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6329 due to application of another       statutory authority.        ``First day of employment'' means the first day of service       that qualifies as employment that occurs on the later of--        (1) The earliest date an employee is hired after the       effective date of the employee's qualifying service-connected       disability, as determined by the Veterans Benefits       Administration; or        (2) The effective date of the employee's qualifying       service-connected disability, as determined by the Veterans       Benefits Administration.        ``Health care provider'' has the meaning given that term in       5 C.F.R. Sec. 630.1202.        ``Hired'' means the action of--        (1) Receiving an initial appointment to a civilian position       in the Federal Government in which the service qualifies as       employment under these regulations or any other regulations       promulgated to implement 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6329;        (2) Receiving a qualifying reappointment to a civilian       position in the Federal Government in which the service       qualifies as employment under these regulations or any other       regulations promulgated to implement 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6329; or        (3) Returning to duty status in a civilian position in the       Federal Government in which the service qualifies as       employment under these regulations or any other regulations       promulgated to implement 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6329, when such return       immediately followed a break in civilian duty (with the       employee in continuous civilian leave status) to perform       military service.        ``Medical certificate'' means a written statement signed by       a health care provider certifying to the treatment of a       veteran's qualifying service-connected disability.        ``Medical treatment'' means any activity carried out or       prescribed by a health care provider to treat a veteran's       qualifying service-connected disability.        ``Military service'' means ``active military, naval, or air       service'' as that term is defined in 38 U.S.C. Sec. 101(24).        ``Qualifying reappointment'' means an appointment of a       former employee of the Federal Government following a break       in employment of at least 90 calendar days.        ``Qualifying service-connected disability'' means a       veteran's service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or       more by the Veteran Benefits Administration, including a       combined degree of disability of 30 percent or more that       reflects the combined effect of multiple individual       disabilities, which resulted in the award of disability       compensation under title 38, United States Code. A temporary       disability rating under 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1156 is considered a       valid rating in applying this definition for as long as it is       in effect.        ``Senate employee'' means an employee occupying a position       of employment the pay for which is disbursed by the Secretary       of the Senate and who is covered by the leave policies of the       employee's Senate employing office.        ``Senate employing office'' means the personal office of a       Senator, a committee of the Senate, and any other office       headed by a person with the final authority to appoint, hire,       discharge, and set the terms, conditions, or privileges of       employment of a Senate employee.        ``Service-connected'' has the meaning given such term in 38       U.S.C. Sec. 101(16).        ``Sick leave'' means any paid leave offered by a Senate       employing office that can be used by an employee to continue       pay during periods of absence caused by the employee's       medical illness or injury or the employee's medical       appointments.        ``Veteran'' has the meaning given such term in 38       Sec. U.S.C. 101(2).        ``Veterans Benefits Administration'' means the Veterans       Benefits Administration of the Department of Veterans       Affairs.       Sec. 1304 Eligibility.         (a) A Senate employee who is a veteran with a qualifying       service-connected disability is entitled to disabled veteran       leave under these regulations, which will be available for       use during the 12-month eligibility period beginning on the       first day of employment. For each employee, including a       Senate employee, there is a single first day of employment.        (b) To be eligible for disabled veteran leave, a Senate       employee must provide to the Senate employing office       documentation from the Veterans Benefits Administration       certifying that the Senate employee has a qualifying service-      connected disability. The documentation should be provided to       the Senate employing office--        (1) Upon the first day of employment, if the Senate       employee has already received such certifying documentation;       or        (2) For a Senate employee who has not yet received such       certifying documentation from the Veterans Benefit       Administration, as soon as practicable after the Senate       employee receives the certifying documentation.        (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, a Senate       employee may submit certifying documentation at a later time,       including after a period of absence for medical treatment, as       described in Sec. 1306(c). The 12-month eligibility period is       fixed based on the first day of employment and is not       affected by the timing of when certifying documentation is       provided.        (d) If a Senate employee's service-connected disability       rating is decreased or discontinued during the 12-month       eligibility period such that the Senate employee no longer       has a qualifying service-connected disability--        (1) The Senate employee must notify the Senate employing       office of the effective date of the change in the disability       rating; and  [[Page S5742]]         (2) The Senate employee is no longer eligible for disabled       veteran leave as of the effective date of the rating change.       Sec. 1305 Crediting disabled veteran leave.         (a) Upon receipt of the certifying documentation under       Sec. 1304, a Senate employing office must credit 104 hours of       disabled veteran leave to a full-time, non-temporary Senate       employee or a proportionally equivalent amount for a part-      time Senate employee, except as otherwise provided in this       section.        (b) The proportional equivalent of 104 hours for a full-      time Senate employee is determined for part-time Senate       employees as follows: the 104 hours is prorated based on the       number of hours in the part-time schedule (as established for       leave charging purposes) relative to a full-time schedule       (e.g., 52 hours for a half-time schedule).        (c) When a Senate employee is converted to a different       schedule for leave purposes, the Senate employee's balance of       unused disabled veteran leave must be converted to the proper       number of hours based on the proportion of hours in the new       schedule compared to the former schedule. For short--term or       temporary employees, hours must be annualized in determining       the proportion.        (d)(1) A Senate employee who was previously employed by an       agency or employing office whose employees were not subject       to 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6329 must certify, at the time the Senate       employee is hired by a Senate employing office, whether or       not that former agency or employing office provided       entitlement to an equivalent disabled veteran leave benefit       to be used in connection with the medical treatment of a       service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more. The       Senate employee must certify the date he or she commenced the       period of eligibility to use disabled veteran leave in the       former agency or employing office.        (2) If 12 months have elapsed since the commencing date       referenced in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Senate       employee will be considered to have received the full amount       of an equivalent benefit and no benefit may be provided under       these regulations.        (3) If the Senate employee is still within the 12-month       period that began on the commencing date referenced in       paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Senate employee must       certify the number of hours of disabled veteran leave used at       the former agency or employing office. The gaining Senate       employing office must offset the number of hours of disabled       veteran leave to be credited to the Senate employee by the       number of such hours used by the Senate employee at the       former agency or employing office, while making no offset       under paragraph (d) of this section. If the Senate employee       had a different type of work schedule at the former agency or       employing office, the hours used at the former agency or       employing office must be converted before applying the       offset, consistent with Sec. 1305(c).       Sec. 1306 Requesting and using disabled veteran leave.         (a) A Senate employee may use disabled veteran leave only       for the medical treatment of a qualifying service-connected       disability. The medical treatment may include a period of       rest, but only if such period of rest is specifically ordered       by the health care provider as part of a prescribed course of       treatment for the qualifying service-connected disability.        (b)(1) A Senate employee must submit a request--written,       oral, or electronic, as required by the Senate employing       office--to use disabled veteran leave. The request must       include a personal self-certification by the Senate employee       that the requested leave will be (or was) used for purposes       of being furnished medical treatment for a qualifying       service-connected disability. The request must also include       the specific days and hours of absence required for the       treatment. The request must be submitted within such time       limits as the Senate employing office may require.        (2) A Senate employee must submit the request for approval       to use disabled veteran leave in advance of the need for       leave unless the need for leave is critical and not       foreseeable--e.g., due to a medical emergency or the       unexpected availability of an appointment for surgery or       other critical treatment. The Senate employee must provide       notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the       circumstances involved. If the Senate employing office       determines that the need for leave is critical and not       foreseeable and that the Senate employee is unable to provide       advance notice of the need for leave, the leave may not be       delayed or denied.        (c)(1) When a Senate employee did not provide the Senate       employing office with certification of a qualifying service-      connected disability before having a period of absence for       treatment of such disability, the Senate employee is entitled       to substitute approved disabled veteran leave retroactively       for such period of absence (excluding periods of suspension,       but including leave at Senate minimum pay, sick leave, annual       leave, compensatory time off, or other paid time off) in the       12-month eligibility period. Such retroactive substitution       cancels the use of the original leave or paid time off and       requires appropriate adjustments. In the case of retroactive       substitution for a period when a Senate employee used       advanced annual leave or advanced sick leave, the       adjustment is a liquidation of the leave indebtedness       covered by the substitution.        (2) A Senate employing office may require a Senate employee       to submit the medical certification described in Sec. 1307(a)       before approving such retroactive substitution.       Sec. 1307 Medical certification.         (a) In addition to the Senate employee's self-certification       required under Sec. 1306(b)(1), a Senate employing office may       additionally require that the use of disabled veteran leave       be supported by a signed written medical certification issued       by a health care provider.        (b) When a Senate employing office requires a signed       written medical certification by a health care provider, the       Senate employing office may specify that the certification       include--        (1) A statement by the health care provider that the       medical treatment is for one or more service-connected       disabilities of the Senate employee that resulted in 30       percent or more disability rating;        (2) The date or dates of treatment or, if the treatment       extends over several days, the beginning and ending dates of       the treatment;        (3) If the leave was not requested in advance, a statement       that the treatment required was of an urgent nature or there       were other circumstances that made advanced scheduling not       possible; and        (4) Any additional information that is essential to verify       the Senate employee's eligibility.        (c)(1) A Senate employee must provide any required written       medical certification no later than 15 calendar days after       the date the Senate employing office requests such medical       certification, except as otherwise allowed under paragraph       (c)(2) of this section.        (2) If the Senate employing office determines it is not       practicable under the particular circumstances for the Senate       employee to provide the requested medical certification       within 15 calendar days after the date requested by the       Senate employing office despite the Senate employee's       diligent, good faith efforts, the Senate employee must       provide the medical certification within a reasonable period       of time under the circumstances involved, but in no case       later than 60 calendar days after the date the Senate       employing office requests such documentation.        (3) A Senate employee who does not provide the required       evidence or medical certification within the specified time       period is not entitled to use disabled veteran leave, and the       Senate employing office may, as appropriate and consistent       with applicable laws and regulations, elect to either--        (i) Charge the absence against available forms of paid time       off, such as sick leave or annual leave, or reduce the Senate       employee's salary to an amount not less than the Senate       minimum annual rate of pay for the period of absence; or        (ii) Allow the Senate employee to request that the absence       be charged against the Senate employee's sick leave, annual       leave, or other available forms of paid time off.       Sec. 1308 Disabled veteran leave forfeiture, transfer,       reinstatement.         (a) Disabled veteran leave not used during the 12-month       eligibility period may not be carried over to subsequent       years and must be forfeited.        (b) If a change in the Senate employee's disability rating       during the 12-month eligibility period causes the Senate       employee to no longer have a qualifying service-connected       disability (as described in Sec. 1304(d)), any unused       disabled veteran leave to the Senate employee's credit as of       the effective date of the rating change must be forfeited.        (c) When a Senate employee with a positive disabled veteran       leave balance transfers from the payroll of one Senate       employing office to the payroll of another Senate employing       office during the 12-month eligibility period, the Senate       employing office from which the Senate employee departs must       certify the number of unused disabled veteran leave hours       available for credit by the gaining Senate employing office.       The losing Senate employing office must also certify the       expiration date of the Senate employee's 12-month eligibility       period to the gaining Senate employing office. Any unused       disabled veteran leave will be forfeited at the end of that       eligibility period. For the purpose of this paragraph, the       term ``transfers'' shall have such meaning as is ascribed to       it by the Secretary of the Senate.        (d)(1) A Senate employee with a balance of unused disabled       veteran leave who ceases employment with a Senate employing       office during the employee's 12-month eligibility period, and       later recommences employment covered by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6329       with a Senate employing office within that same eligibility       period, is entitled to a recredit of the unused balance.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S5742, September 26, 2019, third column, the following  appears: (d)(1) A Senate employee with a balance of unused  disabled veteran leave who ceases employment with a Senate  employing office during the employee's 12-month eligibility  period, and later recommences employment covered by 5 U.S.C.  Sec. 6329 with a Senate employing office within that same  eligibility period, is entitled to a of the unused balance.      The online Record has been corrected to read: (d)(1) A Senate  employee with a balance of unused disabled veteran leave who  ceases employment with a Senate employing office during the  employee's 12-month eligibility period, and later recommences  employment covered by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6329 with a Senate employing  office within that same eligibility period, is entitled to a  recredit of the unused balance.    ========================= END NOTE =========================           (2) When a Senate employee has a break in employment as       described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the losing       Senate employing office must certify the number of unused       disabled veteran leave hours available for recredit by the       gaining Senate employing office. The losing Senate employing       office must also certify the expiration date of the       employee's 12-month eligibility period. Any unused disabled       veteran leave must be forfeited at the end of that       eligibility period.        (3) In the absence of the certification described in       paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the recredit of disabled       veteran leave may also be supported by written documentation       available to the gaining Senate employing office in its       official personnel records concerning the employee, copies of       contemporaneous earnings and leave statement(s) provided by       the Senate employee, or copies of other contemporaneous       written documentation acceptable to the gaining Senate       employing office.  [[Page S5743]]         (e) A Senate employee may not receive a lump-sum payment       for any unused disabled veteran leave under any circumstance.                            ____________________
