 Mr. President, in the final days of the U.S. military's  presence in Afghanistan, our country suffered a devastating loss.  Thirteen servicemembers were killed in a terrorist attack at the  airport in Kabul, marking the deadliest day for the U.S. military in  more than a decade in that country.   These young men and women, all between the ages of 20 and 31, were  taken from loving families--parents, siblings, spouses, fiancees--even  a baby on the way.   In Laredo, TX, on Monday, I had the solemn honor of attending the  funeral for one of these heroes and offering my condolences to his  family.   U.S. Marine Corps LCpl David Lee Espinoza was only 20 years old when  he lost his life last month, but he represented the very best of the  Marine Corps, the U.S. military, and the very best of America.   From childhood, he dreamed of serving in the military. He joined the  Marines right after high school to serve his country and to protect our  freedom. And last month, he made the ultimate sacrifice in service to  that mission.   The pride in this young marine and the gratitude for his service and  sacrifice was visible throughout the Laredo community. Driving through  Laredo from the airport, the streets were lined with folks, including  schoolchildren holding up American flags in honor of LCpl Espinoza.  Veterans from across the State proudly stood outside the entrance to  St. Patrick Catholic Church to pay tribute to their fallen brother. And  across the street, a giant American flag hung from the ladder of two  fire trucks.   I attended the mass, officiated by Bishop James Tamayo, and paid my  respects to David Espinoza's family and other members of his family.   There is nothing we can do to bring back LCpl Espinoza, but we can  ensure that his service and sacrifice, and that of the other  servicemembers killed that day, will never be forgotten.   I join those across the country who are mourning the loss of their  heroes and honoring the sacrifices they have made for our freedoms. To  me, one of the most unique things about the U.S. military--this is not  just about our freedom. They were protecting the rights and the freedom  and the dignity of people on the other side of the planet. Our Nation  is forever grateful to these young men and women and their loved ones  who made unfathomable sacrifices for our freedoms.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we are back in session after a busy  August, and we are hitting the ground running in the U.S. Senate.   This week, congressional committees have heard from top Biden  administration officials about the disastrous withdrawal of our troops  from Afghanistan. In the months to come, there will be more questions  about the decisions that led to the collapse of that country and how  the administration plans to protect the American people from terrorist  threats moving forward.   You know, the whole premise of our going to Afghanistan in the first  place was to deny vacuums that could be filled by terrorist  organizations like  al-Qaida and ISIS and thus represent a threat to the homeland not only  of people in Europe and in the region but also  [[Page S6530]]  to the people here in the United States. Some called 9/11/2001 a  failure of imagination because we never imagined that terrorists  overseas would plan and execute a terrorist attack that would kill  3,000 Americans using 2 airplanes to fly into the World Trade Center.   So now, with the embarrassing and disastrous withdrawal by the Biden  administration of our troops from Afghanistan, the question is, How  long will it take the terrorists to reconstitute themselves and present  a clear and present danger to not only the region but also the  continent of Europe and the United States? But for right now, we  deserve and the American people deserve answers and accountability. And  it is not just these 13 marines who lost their lives in Afghanistan;  other American servicemembers have lost their lives and literally their  limbs to try to deny a safe haven to terrorist organizations like al- Qaida and ISIS.   I worry that they may worry that their sacrifices may have been in  vain if, in fact, these terrorists occupy this vacuum which has now  been created with a very hospitable Taliban, which was responsible for  hosting al-Qaida in the first place. I worry that these troops feel  like their sacrifice has been in vain. But I want to assure them that  they did what they were asked to do by their Commander in Chief with  honor and respect and great personal sacrifice. And no matter what  happens going forward, nothing will ever change the respect and the  honor that we have for them and their service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we also have a fast-approaching government  funding deadline. To be specific, we have about 16 days before we will  be knee deep in a government shutdown unless Congress appropriates  money to keep the lights on. Following a year and a half of economic  instability, there is no justification to unleash even more uncertainty  on our economy and on hard-working American families. Then, on top of  that, we are told that our Democratic colleagues intend to pass a $3\1/ 2\ trillion--probably closer to $5 trillion--reckless tax-and-spending- spree bill, otherwise known as reconciliation.   You know, during the last year, during the COVID-19 crisis, we worked  very well together because we knew this was a national emergency that  did not respect political parties or ideology or persons, and we had to  do everything we could on an emergency basis to help. But that  emergency is quickly getting in our rearview mirror, and our Democratic  colleagues seem to be determined to continue to recklessly spend  borrowed money that will have to be repaid by the next generation of  Americans and to raise taxes to the highest level in recent memory,  thus compounding the risk not only of inflation, which is a regressive  tax on working families when the food they put on the table, the  gasoline they buy, and the appliances they buy all are seeing prices  going up at very quickly escalating levels. There is a real danger that  this sort of reckless tax-and-spending spree will have a very negative  effect not only on them but also on our economy more generally.   For months, we know our Democratic colleagues have been debating back  and forth about how much they are willing to spend on a liberal wish  list. The chairman of the Budget Committee initially floated a  staggering figure of $6 trillion.   Now, I never dreamed that in my lifetime--certainly in my service  here in the U.S. Senate--I would ever vote for a trillion-dollar bill,  but I did during the emergency called COVID-19 because I thought it was  necessary. But this kind of reckless spending is not necessary. This is  an ideological juggernaut to try to achieve things to transform this  country into some western European social democracy--social welfare  state.   Well, after months of negotiating amongst themselves, our Democratic  colleagues have now settled not on a $6 trillion figure but on $3\1/2\  trillion. It is still a shocking number. Nonpartisan budget experts, as  I indicated, said the actual cost would end up closer to $5\1/2\  trillion, so don't be fooled by this so-called appearance of self- restraint. This plan is chock full of damaging tax hikes, permanent  welfare with no work requirements, Green New Deal climate mandates, and  a laundry list of socialist policies.   A party-line vote just before the recess laid the groundwork for the  biggest government spending bonanza in American history, but now some  of our Democratic colleagues are experiencing a little buyer's remorse,  perhaps given the rapidly approaching date for the 2022 elections, and  they are expressing some remorse or hesitation before swiping the  taxpayers' credit card once more.   Senators Manchin and Sinema have both voiced their opposition to the  extreme $3\1/2\ trillion figure. Earlier this month, Senator Manchin  wrote an op-ed explaining why he won't support such irresponsible  spending. Our colleagues ought to read it and to consider his  arguments. He said Democratic leaders in Congress have proposed passing  ``the largest single spending bill in history with no regard to rising  inflation, crippling debt, or the inevitability of future crises.''   The fractures in the reckless tax-and-spending spree aren't just  deepening in the Senate; House Democrats are beginning to wring their  hands, trying to figure out if they can justify such extreme spending  and taxing. And I must say it certainly will require some creative  thinking.   Trillions more in borrowing when American families are already being  pummeled by inflation; a sweeping amnesty with no effort to control the  growing immigration crisis at the southern border; tax hikes on  American families and small businesses--our Democratic colleagues are  proposing the most extreme policy proposals that one might imagine in  this one massive bill. So getting their Members on board is half the  battle, but we are now seeing the internal debates and discussions  among Democrats wondering if this is the wisest course of conduct,  because there is no doubt about it--this is a massive amount of money,  and Democrats are going to have to raise the debt ceiling by themselves  if they want to write a check that big.   This is where things get a little kooky. Even though this is a  partisan spending spree, our friends across the aisle expect  Republicans to join them in raising the debt ceiling, claiming that  this should be a bipartisan effort. But it is clear Democrats don't  require Republican support. They can attach this credit increase to the  tax-and-spending-spree bill and pass it with only Democratic support.  The only problem is, they don't really want to own it. They want  political cover. They want us to help them pull the pin out of the  economic grenade that they are about to toss in the laps of the  American people. When this reckless tax-and-spending spree inevitably  blows up, they want to be able to blame someone else. They want  plausible deniability.    But it is not going to work that way. Senator McConnell, the  Republican leader, and folks on our side of the aisle have made it  crystal clear on that point for months. If they want to spend alone,  they are going to have to address the debt ceiling alone. Our  Democratic colleagues can't cut Republicans out of the process when it  is convenient and then beg cooperation when they need someone else to  blame.   I have no doubt that our colleagues across the aisle will come up  with a host of gimmicks to try to get Republicans on board. Some have  suggested threatening to shut down the government or withholding  critical disaster relief. To be absolutely clear, folks on our side of  the aisle do not want a government shutdown. The American people and  our economy are already experiencing enough pain. In my State of Texas,  we suffered enough natural disasters for me to understand how critical  it is to get disaster relief out the door as quickly as possible.  Communities impacted by hurricanes and wildfires do not deserve to be  treated as political pawns on a chessboard.   If Democrats want to charge $5\1/2\ trillion to the taxpayers' credit  card, they will have to increase the credit limit themselves, and they  can do it by themselves with the $3\1/2\ trillion social welfare bill,  and they can't treat disaster victims and government funding as  hostages.   Our Democratic colleagues already went on one partisan spending spree  earlier this year--an additional $1.9 trillion under the guise of  providing COVID relief, when only about 10 percent of it actually  addressed COVID.  [[Page S6531]]  That has fueled, in the opinion of people like former Democratic  economists, office holders--Larry Summers, for example, who said that  we are risking a growth of inflation, which will raise prices on  commodities and things that people need in their daily lives in order  to live and thus form an invisible tax.   As it stands today, our debt is roughly 107 percent of our gross  domestic product--$28.7 trillion and counting. Most of us can't imagine  what a trillion dollars is, much less a billion dollars, but it is  roughly $28.7 trillion. And the sad news is, somebody is going to have  to pay that back--somebody. I believe it is simply immoral for us to  continue spending, borrow money, raise the debt, and expect future  generations to pick up the tab. We know, at the same time, families are  being hammered by inflation, as I said, and small businesses are still  trying to lure employees back to work.   So we are not going to assist with an encore performance of the  partisan spending spree that we saw earlier this year. If our  Democratic colleagues believe this partisan tax-and-spending spree is a  wise investment for the American people, they are going to have to sell  it to the American people and up the credit limit on their own.   I yield the floor.
