 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in March, Congress and the President  said to 43 million student loan borrowers that, because of COVID-19,  your student loan payments will be deferred until October 1--no monthly  payments for 6 months for student loan borrowers.   October 1 is just around the corner. So what do we say to those 43  million student loan borrowers today? I propose that we say this:   No. 1, if there is no income, there is no monthly payment. In other  words, if you have a student loan, your monthly payment is zero--if you  don't have any income for whatever reason.   No. 2, when you do begin earning income, your monthly payment will  never be more than 10 percent of your income after you deduct the  necessities of life, such as the cost of housing--rent or mortgage--and  food.   No. 3, the same generous loan forgiveness that exists today for  student loan borrowers will still exist. After 20 years of payments for  undergraduate loans and 25 years of payments for graduate loans, if you  still have an outstanding loan balance, your loan will be forgiven, and  that will include all of the months your payment was zero because you  didn't have any income.   These same policies--no income, no monthly payment--will be offered  to students who take out new loans in addition to these policies being  offered to existing student loan borrowers.   Under my proposal, new and existing student loan borrowers will be  offered one other option for paying back their loans. This option would  be like a 10-year mortgage: Make equal principal and interest monthly  payments over 10 years until the loan is paid off. Some borrowers may  prefer this option because it could mean paying less interest. Every  borrower would be eligible to switch from one option--the income-based  payment--to the other option   The remaining good news in this proposal is that the concurrent  bewildering system of nine different ways of paying off your student  loan would be thrown in the trash heap and replaced by these two  straightforward proposals: No. 1, the income-based repayment option,  and No. 2, the 10-year, mortgage-like option. These changes will give  some peace of mind to the 43 million current borrowers and the tens of  millions of Americans who are expected to sign up for new student loans  over the next 10 years.   These ideas are neither new nor my ideas. They have been recommended  by higher education experts numerous times when having testified before  the Senate Education Committee during the past 6 years while we have  considered reauthorizing the Higher Education Act. The concepts have  also been suggested by many Senators on both sides of the aisle,  Democrats and Republicans, including Senators King, Burr, Rubio,  Merkley, Portman, Warner, Wicker, Manchin, Shaheen, and Collins. All of  them have suggested these concepts.   While we are simplifying the student loan repayment system, I propose  that we also finish the job of reducing the Federal loan application of  grants and loans--which everyone calls FAFSA--from about 108 questions  to 20 to 33 questions. This is an enterprise that a number of us, both  Democrats and Republicans, have been working on for years, including  Senators Murray, Bennet, Jones, King, Collins, Whitehouse, Gardner,  Cornyn, Stabenow, Tillis, and Hassan. So, you see, there is an unusual  amount of bipartisan support for both of these ideas.   Experts before the Senate Education Committee have testified that  simplifying the FAFSA in this way would remove obstacles and would make  it easier for more low-income Americans to attend college and would  increase the number of Pell grants each year.   Last fall, Congress and the President took the first step in  simplifying the FAFSA by allowing the Internal Revenue Service to  answer 22 questions that applicants for grants and loans had already  answered on their tax returns.   There are 20 million American families who struggle to fill out this  essential but unnecessarily complex form each year who will be grateful  to Congress if we will complete the job of simplifying the Federal aid  application system at the same time we will make it simpler for 43  million Americans to pay back their student loans.   There is one more piece of good news in this proposal, and this news  is for the American taxpayer. Simplifying the student loan repayment  system, as well as the system for applying for student grants and  loans, will save taxpayers about $10 billion over 10 years, according  to the Congressional Budget Office. This is because the simpler system  will also provide more certainty in the repayment of loans.   On October 1, 43 million Americans with student loans are going to  have to restart making their monthly student loan repayments. Congress  deferred student loan payments in March, as I said earlier, when the  CARES Act--the COVID-19 relief bill--was signed into law, but that  deferment expires on September 30. There has never been a more  important time to end the maddening complexity of student loan  repayment and make it simpler for Americans to pay off their student  loans.   Let me briefly review how the Student Loan Repayment and FAFSA  Simplification Act will work. It offers student loan borrowers just two  options: the standard 10-year repayment plan, just like a mortgage, or  the income-based plan that I have described. For borrowers with no  income, if they choose an income-based repayment plan, their monthly  payments would be zero. If borrowers in an income-based repayment plan  earn income, the borrowers' monthly payments would be based on the  amounts of those incomes.   Let's take an example. The average student loan for a 4-year college  graduate today is about $30,000. So someone with $30,000 in student  loan debt who makes $52,000 each year would be expected to pay 10  percent of that borrower's discretionary income, which is about $274  per month. So if you have a $30,000 loan debt and you make $52,000 a  year, your monthly payment is going to be about $274 under this plan.  Borrowers under the plan would never have to pay more than 10 percent  of  [[Page S4334]]  their income that is not needed for necessities.   If we don't pass this legislation before October 1, here is what will  happen: Because of the confusing repayment system we have today, too  many borrowers will end up in an unaffordable, standard 10-year  repayment, mortgage-type plan and will have payments so high that they  will find themselves in default. When we are through with this  pandemic--when the economy improves and when these borrowers are ready  to tackle their debts--they will find that their student loan debts may  have soared out of control.   I and Senator Murray of Washington State, who is the ranking Democrat  on our committee, have been working on reauthorizing the Higher  Education Act for nearly 6 years. We have held 19 hearings over that  time. We are making good progress. In fact, I was hopeful we could mark  up the bill this spring, but between impeachment and COVID, that just  didn't work out.   In January, I saw a consensus emerging. It was for simpler, effective  regulations to make it easier for students to pay for college and to  pay back their loans. We discussed the complexity of the Federal  financial aid system. We heard from many experts. At one roundtable,  the president of the University of Tennessee told me it took him months  to figure out how to pay off his daughter's Federal student loan--this  was from a college president--even with the money in his hand.   So this is not a new problem, and the solution I am proposing has  been discussed by our committee and many Senators outside the committee  for nearly 6 years. It will help both those who face loan payments  starting on October 1 and the millions of students who will be  graduating with student debt.   When it comes time to start repaying those loans, students will have  to navigate through a complicated number of options today--nine in  total. I don't want to go through them in detail because it would  stagger the imagination. For example, there is the 10-year standard  repayment. There is the graduated standard repayment. There are two  extended repayment options. There are five different programs based on  your income: the income-contingent repayment, the original income-based  repayment, the revised income-based repayment, the pay-as-you-earn  plan, and the revised pay-as-you-earn repayment. Those are all of the  different ways you can pay off your student loans, which has confused  the 43 million borrowers who have them.   Now, if I lost you wandering through that, you can get a sense of how  those 43 million borrowers must feel.   The Student Loan Repayment and FAFSA Simplification Act ends that  confusion. It will reduce those nine repayment plans down to two--one  standard payment, like a mortgage, and one payment based on income.   In addition, the bill reduces the complexity for borrowers who wish  to participate in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which  creates an incentive for borrowers to pursue jobs in public service.   Today, not all of the nine current repayment plans are eligible for  public loan forgiveness, and borrowers can have a hard time figuring  out which plan to choose. Under this legislation, a borrower who wants  loan forgiveness can't choose the wrong plan because there are only two  and either applies, whether you choose the standard 10-year repayment  plan or the income-based repayment plan.   By the end of September, in less than 3 months, 43 million student  loan borrowers will be required by law to begin monthly payments again  on their loans. Many of these borrowers won't be able to afford these  payments.   I propose that we say to those borrowers: We have a better option for  you. No income, no monthly payment--whether because of COVID-19 or for  any other reason. In other words, if you have a student loan, you may  defer your monthly payment if you do not have any income. When you do  begin earning income, your monthly payment will never be more than 10  percent of your income after you deduct the necessities of life, such  as the cost of housing--rent or mortgage--and food.   Now is the time to reduce the complexity of student loan debt and  finish the job of simplifying the FAFSA and at the same time save the  taxpayers money.   I yield the floor.
