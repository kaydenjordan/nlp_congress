 Objection.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask  unanimous consent that the request be modified so that in addition to  the request of the Senator from Alaska, the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 317, S. 908, the Fluke Fairness  Act.   I request that the bill be read a third time and passed and that  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    I object.
