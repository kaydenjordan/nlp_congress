 Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote  on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate National Police  Week, I rise to honor the brave men and women who put their lives on  the line to keep our communities safe across California's 40th  Congressional District and their families.   In Congress, I will always be a loud voice for our local law  enforcement and am working to ensure that they have the resources they  need to do their jobs and to keep us safe.   We also honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line  of duty.   Unfortunately, we are again reminded of the tremendous sacrifice of  our local law enforcement as we honor Riverside County Sheriff Deputy  Brett Harris, who was killed in the line of duty on Saturday.   I join in praying for his wife, mother, father, his twin sister, and  brother.                            ____________________
