 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, during our time tonight, my  colleagues and I will recognize the great men and women of law  enforcement and the critical role they play in keeping our local  communities safe.   National Police Week is particularly important this year. Of course,  we observe it annually, but we all know, over the last year, law  enforcement has been under constant attack by the political left in  this country. Everyone can see it with their own eyes. The left has  demanded to defund police departments. Some Democrats, even elected  officials, have even gone as far as to call for abolishing the police.   Yet, in the face of that madness, police officers, nevertheless,  continue to put their lives on the line every day to protect our  communities, our families, and all of us. It is such a critical part of  who we are as Americans.   As has been noted, we have lost many more officers in the line of  duty over the past year, and we mourn those tragic losses. Despite the  sacrificial service and the bravery of law enforcement, there are some  Democrats even in this body, Mr. Speaker, who continue to push the  false and outrageous narrative that police are actually somehow to be  regarded as enemies of the communities they serve and that we don't  need them.   Well, tonight, my Republican colleagues and I are here to tell you  that they are wrong. We need police officers, and we need law and  order. Nothing makes this more apparent than the spike in violent crime  and homicides we have seen in Democrat-led cities that have defunded  their police departments.   Specifically, there are a few examples here. In Austin, Texas, they  have seen a 50 percent rise in homicides. In Los Angeles, they saw an  11.6 percent rise, and in New York City, 45 percent. By the way, in New  York City, they have a 97 percent rise in shootings.   Defunding the police is a terrible idea, and anyone who looks  objectively at this issue obviously knows that.   So, what should we do about it? We should support our police officers  and those in law enforcement. We should encourage them to continue  building strong relationships in all aspects of our communities. We  should give law enforcement the tools and training they need to  maintain law and order. Lastly, as a Nation, we must back the blue. We  would argue it may have never been as important to do that as it is  right now.   Mr. Speaker, I have a number of colleagues who will speak to this  issue, and I will begin by yielding to the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. Stauber), my dear friend, who was not only a professional hockey  player, most people know that, but a lot of people may not realize he  is also a retired police lieutenant. So, he is, obviously, qualified to  speak on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  those words straight from the heart, and he speaks, as we said, with  great authority on it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Womack), my  neighboring State, who will speak with equal passion on the issue.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from  Arkansas. We do join him in those prayers for Officer Franks and the  others around the country who are recovering from this violence that so  many law enforcement officers have had to endure over the past year.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield next to another gentleman in our  conference, who speaks with great authority on the issue, particularly  on Police Week. Mr. Troy Nehls of Texas 22 was the former sheriff of  Fort Bend County, Texas, and he knows of which he speaks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Nehls).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the sheriff for his  service and that passion. It is appropriate tonight, of course.   Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Kansas' big First  District. The district, I think, has 63 counties. It is one of the  largest in the country. He has got a lot of work to do. And they know  him well because he also happened to have been the 50th Lieutenant  Governor of the State of Kansas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  those important words.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield next to a gentleman from Utah, a  freshman who has made a big mark here in the First District of Utah. He  is also a former officer of the U.S. Foreign Service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and I  appreciate his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, from Utah, we will move over to one of our favorite  representatives from the great State of Florida.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Donalds), a  freshman who also made a big mark here and who came from the Florida  House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Florida for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, from there, I am delighted to go north a bit. We will go  to my friend GT Thompson, who is the ranking member on the House  Committee on Agriculture, and who happens to represent the largest  geographical district in the State of Pennsylvania, in terms of  congressional districts.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney),  another important voice to this Special Order tonight, my friend and  colleague and classmate. We mentioned earlier how important New York is  in this whole issue, particularly this year with the rapid rise in New  York City, in particular, of their homicide rate and violent crime. I  know she has a lot to say on the issue.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and  appreciate those remarks. That is an important perspective.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. Baird), a gentleman who also knows quite a bit about sacrificial  service to the country and our communities.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Baird. I  appreciate those comments.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Kim. You are so  right that we need to back the blue, and I am so grateful to be joined  by so many colleagues that share that sentiment.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), another freshman who has made a real mark  here on Capitol Hill and who is very passionate about this issue as  well.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Fischbach. That  is an important perspective from the great State of Minnesota.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for those  important words. You are exactly right. They need to be better funded  and given greater resources and greater training, and we support that  because we back the blue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller),  a dear friend who certainly shares that sentiment.    May I inquire as to how much time is  remaining, Mr. Speaker?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  the First District of the great State of Alabama (Mr. Carl).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from the  great State of Alabama for his remarks. Indeed, these are concerns that  we share from coast to coast. We will go back up to the great State of  New York and hear from my friend who is a legislator and former  Secretary of State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of New York (Mr.  Jacobs).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  perspective from New York. We will go from coast to coast out West back  to California.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Eighth District of  California (Mr. Obernolte).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for those  comments.   Mrs. Lesko is another good friend and colleague. We trust her voice  on so many things. Nothing highlights the need for law and order more  than the current crisis at the border created by the Biden  administration. She has seen this firsthand as she represents Arizona.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Arizona for her remarks. We will stand up for the police.   Mr. Speaker, you have heard many comments and similar sentiments here  tonight. It has been echoed over and over.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to one more of my colleagues who is from the  Sixth District of the great State of Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Those are strong words, and they are  accurate. People have politicized this issue, and it is turning them  against law enforcement, and it is a terrible, terrible situation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Sixth District of the  great State of Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield to the  gentleman from the Third District of the great State of Texas (Mr.  Taylor).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas for those great words.   I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gimenez), a very important  voice and someone who has been on the front lines of community service,  a first responder, a fire chief, which is my favorite previous job of  his, although he has been a mayor as well.    I thank the gentleman for that voice of  authority on the issue.   Mr. Speaker, I have been honored to be joined on the floor by so many  colleagues from around the country tonight to honor our law enforcement  officers this National Police Week.   I was sitting here as I was listening to the speeches tonight, and I  was reminded, as we always are as we sit on this floor of the people's  House, of the words that are inscribed right above your head there, our  Nation's great motto, In God We Trust.   We are a Nation under God, as we know, and millions of Americans find  daily inspiration in the Word of God. On National Police Week, it is  appropriate to note that we find there a useful reminder about the  noble calling of those who serve our communities so bravely. Indeed, it  is a divine calling, and I think those who are calling for the  defunding and the disrespect of our police need to remember that it was  God himself who ordained that authority.   In the 13th chapter of the book of Romans, it is subtitled Submission  to Governing Authorities. I just want to read that in closing tonight,  Mr. Speaker. It begins in verse 1 of Chapter 13:         Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for       there is no authority except that which God himself has       established. The authorities that exist have been established       by God.        Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is       rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do       so will bring judgment on themselves.        For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for       those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the       one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be       commended.        For the one in authority is God's servant for your good.       But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the       sword for no reason. They are God's servants, agents of wrath       to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.        Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities,       not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter       of conscience.        This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are       God's servants who give their full time to governing.        Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay       taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if       honor, then honor.    Mr. Speaker, I conclude tonight with that admonition, that we give  honor where honor is due. That is what National Police Week is about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
