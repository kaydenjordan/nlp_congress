 Mr. Speaker, in Trump's ``Cabinet of corruption,'' one  individual stands head and shoulders above the rest. He is a man that  Senator Udall crowned ``the Emperor of the Swamp.''   If we created a Mount Rushmore of American corruption, his face would  be carved into it. His scandals are so outrageous that even Sarah  Sanders has stopped defending him and just started telling jokes at his  expense.   I am speaking, of course, about EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.   I will give you an example. Pruitt tried to use his office to get his  wife a Chick-fil-A franchise. When he was questioned about it, the EPA  chief said:         It is one of the best restaurants in the country. We need       more of them in Tulsa and we need more of them across the       country. Anyway, it is an exciting time.    Mr. Speaker, don't get me wrong, I enjoy a chicken sandwich just as  much as any other person, but Scott Pruitt talks about Chick-fil-A like  they are some kind of social service or some group that hands out food  to the homeless. He thinks it is an organization setting up soup  kitchens and homeless shelters.   Frankly, this is probably one of the weakest excuses I have ever  heard from any administration, but this administration seems to  specialize in weak excuses.   Scott also rented a Washington, D.C., apartment from a lobbyist with  matters before the EPA. And it won't surprise you at all that he got a  really good sweetheart deal. Pruitt was paying $50 a night and was only  charged the days he actually slept there.   Now, for everybody back in Arizona who may not understand this, the  D.C. rental market is really high here. Let just assure you, what he  did was not normal and probably illegal. I am not a lawyer or a law  enforcement officer, but this arrangement definitely looks like a bribe  to me.   And that is not all. This week, we learned that Pruitt ordered his  government bodyguards to seek out a luxury moisturizer that is  exclusively offered to patrons of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu),  my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, before we go into the top 10, I think one  of the pretty scandalous other abuses of taxpayers is the fact that he  had his personal detail asking and searching for used Trump mattresses.   Now, this is not a joke, this is not from an episode of ``Veep.''  Your EPA Administrator, a supposed adult in the room, is using taxpayer  dollars to try to find used Trump mattresses.   Right now, all I can think of are two things. Number one, this person  is just egregiously using our taxpayer dollars in the worst possible  manner. And, number two, he is trying to set up one of the weirdest bed  and breakfasts in the history of Washington, D.C.   But this is actually real. This is not TV. This is actually happening  in your government.   Mr. Speaker, let me go into the top 10 things that EPA Administrator  Pruitt has done to embarrass this country, and possible corruption. And  10 is what we have. There are a lot more than that, but we have to at  least keep this somewhat bitable for everybody else.   Let me start with number 10, as recently reported: the mess hall.  Pruitt has overused his privileges at the swanky, but affordable, White  House mess hall, despite being warned against doing so.    Now, the mess hall is basically a cafeteria for the top officers of  the White House. I have been in it. I was there under the Obama  administration. It is an honor to be invited to go, and it is great  food at a very low price.   Pruitt has misused this privilege so much so that he has been asked  to not come back. You are that egregious that, as a sitting member of  the Cabinet, you have been told by White House staff to not come back  to the cafeteria. That tells you a lot.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu)  to tell us about number nine.    Mr. Speaker, I also recommend just taking the Metro. It  is much quicker, but that is just me.   Number eight, $130 fountain pens: Scott Pruitt has spent over $1,500  taxpayer dollars on personalized $130 fountain pens. Now, I recommend  the BIC pen. It does the job well.   But, more importantly, it seems like, on one hand, he doesn't seem to  mind spending taxpayer dollars on really expensive things, such as  these really fancy pens, and then personally, in his own personal life,  he is really cheap by looking for cheap used Trump mattresses. So he  is, essentially, using the taxpayer dollar as his personal piggy bank  so he can live the lifestyle he wants.   On to the mattress. Pruitt used his EPA staff to help him look for a  discount Trump Home Luxury Plush Euro Pillow Top mattress. It is  apparently his favorite.   He also inappropriately used aids to look for apartments and help  arrange family vacations to the Rose Bowl.   Ted and I are lucky to have some very smart, young staff, and they  work hard, but they are not here to be our personal valets. They are  here to make sure we do our job well, we get to our meetings, and we  have the resources that we need to make the right decisions.   They certainly aren't there to help you find the right type of Trump  Home Luxury Plush Euro Pillow Top mattress. I definitely don't  recommend that. Or, as Ted Lieu has said, there is the internet. You  can find it there also.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu).    Number five, first class travel: Pruitt has spent over  $100,000 on first class commercial travel since entering office, citing  security concerns, apparently not satisfied with his $3.5 million  currently spent on security escort.   Let me tell you, number one, unfortunately for, I think, many  Americans, nobody knows who Scott Pruitt is. You do not need to be  flying first class for, quote/unquote, security reasons, and you  certainly should not be making the American public be paying for your  first class tickets.    Number three, unsanctioned raises: In a time in America  where every American is hoping to just get a pay raise next month,  Scott Pruitt was told: You are not allowed to give your employees--the  certain employees that he wanted to give--a pay raise.   He was specifically told: They do not deserve that pay raise. You  will not give them a pay raise.   So instead, he used an obscure provision of the Safe Drinking Water  Act to actually find a way to give them a pay raise in spite of the  White House saying: You will not give them a pay raise.   Now, this would be actually somewhat okay, in my opinion, if he was  actually trying to protect safe drinking water, but, in fact, he is not  doing that. He is actually only using the fund to pay for these  increases for his well-connected friends and get them higher pay.    Look, you have an EPA Administrator who is literally  using his staff to go track down and try to speak to the CEO of Chick- fil-A to try to get a very hard-to-get franchise, essentially using his  public office to put pressure on them to get a very, very hard-to-get  and lucrative franchise.   In any world, if we had just told you that this was being done by 1  or 2 or even 10 people, this all would not just be really, really,  really weird, but really, really, really corrupt.   But the fact that there is one person that is doing this, and  consistently doing this, and has not been fired by the man who said he  enjoys firing people, by the man who had a show for so many years about  firing people, and yet for some reason, he cannot find a reason to fire  this weird, corrupt EPA Administrator, that is the problem here.   You have a corrupt Cabinet official and you have a Presidency that  will not keep him in check.   I yield to my good friend, Ted Lieu, to close.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Lieu for his  comments during this Special Order.   To finish, we had a President who said he was going to come and drain  the swamp. Scott Pruitt is the swamp. He is the biggest swamp monster  there is right now when it comes to the culture of corruption here in  Washington, D.C.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time                            ____________________
