 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for the  great remarks he made about Andrew Wheeler. You know, it is awfully  hard to find anyone who knows him well who will say anything bad about  him. I guess the only thing you can criticize him for is that he worked  for me for 14 years.   But I will tell you, during that timeframe, over a 14-year period, I  don't remember anyone ever accusing him of being unfair, of being  negative in any way at all. But a couple of things were said, and I  think I need to correct the record. I need to be the one to correct it  because I am the guy he worked for over a long period of time--both in  my personal office and in my capacity as chairman of the Environment  and Public Works Committee. Because I know him so well, I have to  correct the record on his behalf.   One allegation made against Andrew in a news article is that he  retaliated against a witness at an EPW--that is Environment and Public  Works--Senate hearing in 2005 because we were unhappy with the  witness's testimony. Nothing in the news article was true or accurate.  This was an article that came out just the other day.   The witness in question and the major source of the article was Mr.  Bill Becker. He was then the president of STAPPA, the Association of  State Air Directors. These are the State directors who are becoming  more prominent in what they are able to get through.   Mr. Becker charged at that time that in retaliation for his January  2005 testimony, the committee launched an investigation into his  organization's finances.   In reality, the investigation was actually launched almost a year  before Mr. Becker appeared before the committee. That is a huge  difference. The article cannot be true.   Prior to the hearing, my staff notified the minority staff of the  committee that he was currently under investigation, and we recommended  against calling Mr. Becker as a witness.   I still have a copy of the memo my staff prepared for me before the  hearing in 2005, noting that they had notified the minority staff about  the investigation. This is the memo, and I ask unanimous consent that  it be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Timeline of EPA Grants Oversight Involving Federal Grants to STAPPA-                                  ALAPCO         March 3, 2004--EPW Committee hearing regarding EPA grants       management where EPA IG testified to an it audit involving a       non-profit receiving federal funding in violation of the       Lobbying Disclosure Act. Inhofe subsequently began a series       of information requests announced at the hearing and       thereafter gathering information concerning EPA grant       management.        May 4, 2004--Email to EPA requesting the amounts of EPA       grants awarded to the following organizations from 1988-2004:        Association of State Drinking Water Administrators        Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control       Administrators        Environmental Council of the States        State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators        Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials        Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management       Officials (An email was sent to EPA instead of a letter       pursuant to the request of the EPA citing administrative       convenience in responding to an email.)        May 20, 2004--Email to EPA following up on previous request       for grant amounts to previous requested groups.        July 9, 2004--Letter to EPA requesting information to       clarify material EPA provided in response to May email.        July 12, 2004--Telephone conversation with EPA Grants and       Debarment Director and EPA Project Manager of STAPPA-ALAPCO       grants regarding grants. EPW staff received previous       complaints concerning the particular funding arrangement for       STAPPA-ALAPCO. EPA confirmed that it has a special funding       relationship with STAPPA-ALAPCO as it provides funding       directly out of grants that are otherwise to be provided       directly to states, and other professional associations do       not have such a relationship. State that are members of other       professional organizations provide dues funding directly to       those organizations. EPA staff also referenced the House       Report language Inhofe used in his question to STAPPA-ALAPCO       as a specific directive to the EPA requiring state and local       air agency concurrence to continue the funding practice.                           STAPPA Funding Request           WE HAVE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT WHO THEY REPRESENT FOR YEARS         During the late 90's debate on Gasoline/Sulfur STAPPA took       a controversial position defending the auto industry against       the oil industry. At the time we received letters from 14       Governors taking the opposite position from STAPPA and heard       from several State Air Directors who complained that STAPPA       did not represent their views.               WE STARTED LOOKING AT THEIR FINANCES LAST SUMMER         May 4, 2004--You requested funding information on 6       different State associations, including STAPPA from EPA as       part of our Grants Oversight.        July 9, 2004--Requested additional info from EPA on all 6.        July 12, 2004--We requested more information from EPA on       STAPPA alone. We received no complaints about the other       organizations and STAPPA's funding arrangement appears to be       different from all of the others.               SENATE APPROPS STARTED LOOKING AT THEM LAST FALL         Fall 2004--Senate Approps Subcommittee included funding       language directed specifically at STAPPA                              NOTIFIED MINORITY         Prior to invite to testify, Inhofe staff told Jeffords       staff that we would be asking questions about their financing       and how they reach their decisions.        All of the IRS information we requested is available       publicly and is necessary to determine if they are giving the       EPA the same information they give the IRS. This is part of       our long term EPA grants management oversight.     Unfortunately, facts don't seem to matter when a Trump  nomination is at stake. The story that isn't being told is about his  character and integrity. People don't remember that the Bush EPA told  minority members of the EPW Committee, the Democrats, that they  wouldn't respond to their letters.   Well, it was Andrew Wheeler who made it clear to the EPA that they  would answer any questions the minority had or, as chairman, I would  submit their questions for them. No one is telling that story, but they  are spreading other allegations.   Another negative story making the rounds is that Andrew hosted  fundraisers for Senator Barrasso and me while it was known he was going  to be nominated as Deputy Administrator of the EPA.   Well, the fact of the matter is that Andrew hosted these fundraisers  long before even being interviewed by the White House for this  nomination. All the dates are there. The facts are there.   After dispensing with the falsehood surrounding Andrew, the rest of  the opposition to him comes down to two things and two things only: He  doesn't have the correct view on environmental policy, and he worked  for the wrong people, including me. Now, those things are actually  stated on the Senate floor, and I understand that. If they consider  that to be an opposition or something that needs to be corrected, I  believe they are wrong because he was an excellent, excellent employee  during that time and all the other times. The fact that he had a choice  of someone to support when he had not even been notified that he might  be considered for this nomination is significant.   The extreme environmentalists were given free rein under the Obama  administration for 8 years, including writing the EPA's regulations,  and they can't handle the fact that the American people have said  ``enough.'' Trump and Scott Pruitt have been delivering relief for the  American people and the economy since they have been in office. Andrew  Wheeler will be a great help to Administrator Pruitt in continuing to  implement President Trump's vision of returning EPA to an agency of the  people, subject to the rule of law. He has worked in EPA before, even  winning awards from EPA, and he will be a good steward for the  environment.   It is always difficult when you know someone personally and you know  their character and you have a personal love for them and for their  career and you have played an integral part to hear things of a  negative nature said about them. As to a lot of the things they are  grouping together, maybe they don't like philosophically Scott Pruitt.  I do. I spent 20 years in business, and I know what overregulation  [[Page S2096]]  is, and I know that our economy was suffering during the 8 years that  we had others in charge. In fact, the proof of that is that the average  increase in our economy for 8 years was 1.5 percent. Now, just because  of this President and this administration getting rid of some of the  overregulations, it is now well in excess of 3 percent.   Now, people ask: How are you going to pay for the road program and  rebuilding the military that was torn down during the last  administration? They forget about the fact--and no one disagrees with  this--that for every 1 percent increase in the economic activity or  GDP, that equates to additional revenue to the Federal Government of  $1.9 trillion over a 10-year period. That is the reason we now are in a  position to do some of the things we need to be doing in terms of  infrastructure and other things and certainly for our military and  other areas. So that is significant. That is something that Andrew  Wheeler knows well, because we have gone through this in the past.   Andrew Wheeler is a wonderful guy, and I would defy anyone who knows  him well to say there is any fault in his character. He is going to do  a great job, and they need his help. I appreciate the fact that I  believe he is going to be confirmed to that position.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
