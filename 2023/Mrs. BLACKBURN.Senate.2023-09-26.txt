 Mr. President, in March of 2021, I came to the floor  and spoke about Xavier Becerra's abysmal record before voting to  confirm him as Secretary of Health and Human Services. Here is what I  pointed out to my colleagues: He had no meaningful experience in public  health, no meaningful experience in running a large-scale logistical  operation, and a career's worth of hostility toward basic  constitutional rights. My colleagues across the aisle didn't listen on  this, and now his record as Secretary is worse than anyone could have  imagined or predicted.   My colleagues who helped confirm him entrusted him with the lives of  some of the world's most vulnerable children. Unaccompanied minors who  are apprehended by Border Patrol are transferred to the care of Health  and Human Services. This is clearly a big job considering that the  Biden border crisis has led to over 300,000 encounters with  unaccompanied children at our Nation's southern border. I am sure that  these precious children thought they would finally be safe under the  care of Health and Human Services and the sponsors they were ultimately  going to be released to.   But Secretary Becerra proved what we already knew; that he was not up  to the challenge of such a large Department with such expansive  authority and that he had no experience that was relative.   Without explanation, HHS loosened the vetting requirements for  sponsors, eliminating certain background checks and reviews of the  children's files. Since then, HHS has lost contact with more than  85,000 of these children.   Back in February, the New York Times released a horrific expose  showing how these children have since been trafficked and exploited for  labor--and these are only the stories of the children that the  reporters could find.   Think about the enormity of the situation: 85,000 children. They  cannot locate them. They do not know who is in charge of them. They do  not know if they are dead or alive. They do not know if they are  working in a processing plant or a manufacturing plant, or if they are  being trafficked for sex, or if they are in a labor gang, because they  cannot find these children.   And they decided to loosen the vetting requirements: Vetting takes  too long. We need to speed up the process.   That is the mess that we find coming from Health and Human Services  and its Secretary, Chief Officer Becerra.   If you have any doubt that Mr. Becerra has direct knowledge of this  crisis, look no further than his own words. That same New York Times  report referenced an audio recording taken during a staff meeting with  the Office of Refugee Resettlement. That is a department within Health  and Human Services.   When Becerra was admonishing his staff about their lack of speed in  vetting sponsors and discharging these children into their care, he  said:         If Henry Ford had seen this in his plants, he would have       never become famous and rich. This is not the way you do an       assembly line.    If that doesn't convince you, listen to the whistleblowers who begged  HHS  [[Page S4673]]  leadership to listen. HHS employees on the ground noticed alarming  signs of exploitation and raised it to their supervisors. ``This is  urgent,'' one wrote. She was ignored.   Again and again, staffers and contractors told HHS something was  wrong, and the reports allegedly reached Secretary Becerra's desk. Even  the senior staffer overseeing the unaccompanied minors program noted in  an email to the Department's leadership:         If nothing continues to be done, there will be a       catastrophic event.    These reports were not just ignored. Those who spoke up were  retaliated against. They were fired. They were silenced.   Think about this. You are working in a Department. You see things are  going wrong. You hear the chief guy say:         If Henry Ford had seen this in his plants, he would have       never become famous and rich. This is not the way you do an       assembly line.    You report it. You say: Things aren't right here. Children are being  exploited. They are being used for labor. They are being used for sex.  We cannot find these children. Nothing has been done.   Don't just take my word for it. That is according to a report from  the Health and Human Services inspector general.   When Secretary Becerra appeared before the Senate Finance Committee  back in March, I asked him what he knew about the exploitation of these  children and when he knew it. Unsurprisingly, he evaded that question.  I didn't get an answer. So after the hearing, I wrote him a letter  asking again about his knowledge of these neglected and lost children  and what role he had in firing the very people who were trying to sound  the alarm and say that something needs to be done.   I didn't hear a word until September 8, and the response I got from  HHS was a little more than an outline of their failed policies. They  did not answer a single one of the questions about the Secretary's  involvement in the decision-making process of what needed to be done to  go find 85,000 children--not a word. So I sent a followup letter,  giving the Secretary one more chance to answer the questions.   The Senate has a duty to conduct oversight, and I take that  responsibility and that duty seriously. The Secretary should take this  responsibility and his duty to respond to us seriously.   Where are these children? How are you vetting these children?   I had really hoped that my friends across the aisle--for all of their  talk about compassion and trying to be compassionate to individuals and  looking at border policies--that they would take this responsibility  seriously as well. But our Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats seem  content with distracting and deflecting from the crisis of leadership  that is occurring over at Health and Human Services.   In a hearing back in June that was supposedly intended to ``ensure  the well-being of unaccompanied migrant children,'' Chairman Durbin  didn't call a single government witness to testify about what is  happening with these unaccompanied alien migrant children.   We cannot just turn a blind eye or try to sweep this under the rug.  We are talking about children--children who are in a strange country,  children who do not have an adult to look after them, children who  maybe were lured here on a false premise.   This is something our Judiciary Committee and Chairman Durbin should  take up. We should bring the Secretary in and find out what is  happening at Health and Human Services with the Office of Refugee  Resettlement and with these children.   I said it back in 2021, and I will say it again. Secretary Becerra is  not fit to serve as the HHS Secretary, and his continued disregard for  the lives of these children--the nonresponse on answering these  questions--proves that point.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
