 Mr. Speaker, in recent years, we have seen  the devastating toll of fentanyl and its analogs all across America. A  drug that is cheap to manufacture and, unfortunately, incredibly  potent, to the point that it is now the leading cause of death for  Americans between the ages of 18 and 49; over three decades of life.   Since July, the seizure of fentanyl at our southern border has  averaged 2,200 pounds a month, meaning that our Border Patrol agents  are now confiscating more fentanyl in a single month than they did in  the entirety of 2018.   These are not just statistics in a government report.   Last week, I spoke to the parents who had lost a son to an accidental  overdose. A vibrant, intelligent college student who had a mixture of  cocaine and fentanyl sold to him, and he lost his life.                                time  1015    As I speak today, the first responders, police officers, and coroners  in Pennsylvania tell me stories about how potent these drugs have  become and how a single dose of Narcan is often no longer enough  medication to revive a person who is suffering from an overdose.   These drugs are increasing in potency and, unfortunately, in  affordability as drug cartels in Mexico have begun to manufacture and  sell these drugs for the cost of a cup of coffee.   The human cost of this epidemic has been staggering, and it is in our  rural areas that constituents are suffering the most.   We must recommit ourselves to the unfinished work of addressing this  crisis. We need to invest in our communities and give our police  officers and medical professionals the tools that they need to save  lives and protect our neighborhoods and communities.   Unless we in Congress act, the fentanyl analogues that have become so  deadly will become legal on American streets in just 3 days. The clock  is ticking.   Our constituents are counting on us to address this issue. They are  counting on us to permanently ban fentanyl analogues that have claimed  thousands of American lives.   We need to work together to address this issue and ban permanently  the fentanyl analogues that have taken such a grave toll on all  American communities.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an  issue that will affect millions of Americans unless Congress acts.   Unless we prevent the Medicare reimbursement cut that is scheduled to  go into effect, the doctors, hospitals, and healthcare providers who  work each day to treat Medicare patients may be forced to eliminate  services, furlough staff, and delay health initiatives.   These cuts will have the deepest impact on those patients who rely on  Medicare to see their doctors.   At a time when our healthcare industry is already facing record  burnout, we cannot afford to risk losing more doctors, nurses, and  healthcare providers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in fighting these  potential cuts in order to protect American patients who rely on  Medicare each and every day.                            ____________________
