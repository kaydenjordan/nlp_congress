 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for  her incredible leadership on this very critical and important  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I rise today because I support this bill and the  commonsense amendment that I have for it. I thank the chairwoman for  her incredible hard work on this important issue.   Inspectors general play a key role in our government. They provide  transparency and accountability into government programs and spending.  They help prevent waste and fix mismanagement and abuse.   The IG Independence and Empowerment Act would ensure that they have  the autonomy and the authority to do their jobs without political  interference. My amendment is simple and in line with the goals of the  bill. It would ensure that the inspector general is paid commensurate  to their task.   Currently, IGs make less money than some of their senior advisers. I  think the person with the most responsibility should be paid  accordingly. If we want the best people to work these important jobs,  we need to make sure that their pay matches their role. My amendment  would fix an unintended consequence of current law and strengthen IG  offices so that they can better carry out their essential work.
