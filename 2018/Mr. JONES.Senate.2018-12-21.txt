 Madam President, let me also thank my colleagues from  Tennessee and Delaware.   I will tell you I wasn't here when that letter circulated; however,  if you want to do an addendum, you have my permission to add my name to  that letter because it is that important. I appreciate so much your  comments.   I have been here almost 1 year now. What I have seen is, it is often  so easy, in our polarized political climate we have, that when issues  we have faced like today come up, people go to their corners and it is  the proverbial line in the sand and everybody wants to talk at each  other and not to each other.   So I appreciate very much Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer, who  worked with my colleagues Senator Flake and Senator Corker in trying to  make sure a motion to proceed is simply a motion to proceed to talk, to  have those dialogues, so we can go about the business of government as  we leave for the holidays at some point.   I believe what has happened here late this afternoon is an important  step, and it is especially an important step going into the next  Congress to tell folks who are coming in and those of us who are coming  back that we want to make sure we were put here to get something done,  not just retreat to our corners.   I thank everyone who was involved late this afternoon trying to make  sure this agreement was reached. I am anxious for our leaders to  proceed so we can go about the business of running this United States  and that we can go into these holidays with the assurance we will come  back to do things for the American people.   I yield the floor.
