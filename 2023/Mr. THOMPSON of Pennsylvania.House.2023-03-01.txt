 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate National Read Across America Day.   Tomorrow, classrooms across the country will celebrate the Nation's  largest celebration of reading. On this day, we celebrate the joy  reading brings to children and families, caregivers, educators, and  adults alike. Reading unlocks new adventures and new ideas and brings  about a world of imagination.   The day was established by the National Education Association in 1998  to help get kids excited about reading.   Madam Speaker, I want to highlight one celebration in PA-15. Students  at Howard Elementary School in Centre County kicked off this  celebration with the Pennsylvania State Grange.   This celebration started with an assembly to get the kids excited and  will consist of a variety of events focused on reading. Perhaps the  most exciting event taking place is ``Drop Everything and Read Day.''  Throughout the day, a sound will play randomly and students will be  expected to drop whatever they are working on and pick up a book.   Madam Speaker, as a former Howard Elementary School student and now a  senior member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I am always  happy to see our students eager to learn.                            ____________________
