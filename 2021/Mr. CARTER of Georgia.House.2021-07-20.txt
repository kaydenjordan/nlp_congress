 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Mr. Raymond Jones of Saint Simons Island,  Georgia, who passed away on June 21 at the age of 72.  [[Page H3676]]    Ray began his career with the Rich Products Corporation, working for  the SeaPak Shrimp and Seafood division in Saint Simons Island. Over the  next three decades, he would have a positive impact on the seafood  industry and on our community. Ray was a genuine advocate for seafood  sustainability and a trusted voice in meeting with Members of Congress.  Ray served as chairman of the National Fisheries Institute's technical  committee from 1994 to 1996, and was the technical chairman of the  National Shrimp Industry Association from 1998 to 2005.   In 2017, he was recognized as the seafood industry leader for his  decades of commitment to seafood sustainability and quality. Despite  Ray's countless career achievements, his proudest role was as a father  and grandfather.   Madam Speaker, my thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends,  and all who knew him during this most difficult time.                        Recognizing Pastor Bill Ligon     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Pastor Bill Ligon of Brunswick, Georgia, for his 90th birthday.   Pastor Ligon experienced the call of God at 18 years old. Since then,  he founded the Christian Renewal Church in Brunswick, Georgia, and has  served as its pastor for over 40 years. Pastor Ligon has served  throughout the southeast, but the impact of his outreach remains  immeasurable.   He is one of the founders of the Fellowship of Churches and Ministers  International, with churches in eight States and three foreign  countries. Alongside his wife, Pastor Ligon served for 6 years as  Southern Baptist missionaries in Spain where they served churches and  taught the gospel.   Madam Speaker, with his passion to share and teach the gospel, I know  Pastor Ligon will continue his tremendous work at Christian Renewal  Church. He has dedicated his life to spreading the word of God, and I  thank him for his decades of service.                     Recognizing Rear Admiral Eric Jones     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Rear Admiral Eric Jones for his outstanding career and service as  Commander of the Seventh Coast Guard District.   Rear Admiral Jones has dedicated his life to protecting our country.  As District Commander, he is responsible for all Coast Guard operations  throughout the Southeast and the Caribbean Basin, which includes  Georgia's First Congressional District.   Notably, under his command, Coast Guard members responded when a  cargo ship capsized in the Saint Simons Sound. This rescue effort was  heroic and saved all 24 people on the ship.   During his time, Rear Admiral Jones has provided extraordinary  leadership and management to the United States Coast Guard. His service  has been marked by excellence and has received significant recognition,  including four Coast Guard Commendation Medals, the Coast Guard  Achievement Medal, and various service and unit awards.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Rear Admiral Jones on his next duty  assignment and thank him for his years of service to Georgia's First  Congressional District.                     Honoring the Life of Bobby Carpenter     Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Mr. Bobby Carpenter, who passed away on June 25 at the age of 89.   Bobby graduated from Richmond Hill High School in 1948. Following  graduation, he served in the U.S. Navy for 4 years. Once back home,  Bobby served as the postmaster of the Richmond Hill Post Office and  received his official commission from President Lyndon B. Johnson.   Bobby also served as the president of Bryan Neck Cemetery Association  for 50 years, church treasurer for 25 years, and a member of the Bryan  County Board of Education. He enriched the lives of all who knew him  and loved him, and he leaves behind a legacy of kindness, faith, and  love.   Bobby's dedication to improving the lives of others will never be  forgotten. Richmond Hill sorely misses him. My thoughts and prayers are  with Bobby's family, friends, and all who knew him during this most  difficult time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Patricia Wilkinson of Jackson, Mississippi, who  recently passed away at the age of 73.   Pat and her husband, Joe, retired to St. Simons Island in my  district.   I had the pleasure of serving with Joe in the Georgia General  Assembly and the greater pleasure of calling Pat and him friends.   Following graduation from the University of Mississippi, Pat followed  in her older sister's footsteps to become a flight attendant with Delta  Airlines. She spent 50 years as a highly respected senior international  Delta flight attendant.   Outside of work, Pat was an active member of the Sandy Springs  Society and the Woodward Academy Parents Council.   Pat's love for life and travel was contagious. While she loved  flying, nothing could compare to the love she had for her family. Her  family was the center of her world, and she brought joy and  unconditional love to all.   My thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends, and all who  knew her during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
