 Mr. President, 2 years into the Biden administration,  the Democrats' approach to illegal immigration and our Nation's borders  has failed the American people.   Last week, one news organization reported that daily crossings along  our southern border have remained near record highs. Last fiscal year  alone, more than 2.76 million illegal immigrants came across our  southern border, absolutely smashing the previous record-high by more  than a million. That is almost the equivalent of a full 1 percent of  our total national population encountered on our southern border in  just 1 year. The problem actually keeps getting worse. Reported  estimates say that more than 73,000 new ``got-aways'' dodged Border  Patrol and escaped into our country in just this past November alone.   Absurdly, the response to this crisis from President Biden's team is  that everything is fine--everything is fine--and going according to  plan. Secretary Mayorkas said last month, ``What we are doing is  precisely what we announced we would do in April of this year, and we  have indeed been executing on the plan.''   Now, everybody else in the country calls our functionally open  borders an emergency and a crisis, but apparently the Biden  administration calls it mission accomplished. And bear in mind, the  terrible and unacceptable status quo has come with some emergency COVID  measures still in place. All the crisis-level numbers I just ran  through have come with these extra border controls--called title 42-- actually still in effect.   Now, one Federal judge is trying to force the Biden administration to  do what the far left has wanted for months and actually repeal the  policy. So the unacceptable crisis-level status quo may only be the  warmup act compared to coming attractions. One immigration expert told  a reporter, ``It is definitely, at least in the short run, going to  result in many, many more people being released into the United  States.'' Congressman Gonzales, who represents Texas's 23rd District,  says it would be a ``hurricane'' for border communities.   Of course, the Biden administration officials who claim they have a  plan to cope with the removal of title 42 are the same people who  brought us recordbreaking illegal immigration even with it in place. So  make no mistake, a choice between the current border situation with  title 42 and an even worse situation without title 42 is a choice  between a disaster and a catastrophe.   Democrats need to stop shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic and start  looking to the tough, proven, successful policies that allowed the  preceding administration to get a handle on the issue, and they need to  drop the forgiving attitude to illegal immigration that draws more and  more men, women, and children on the dangerous journey to our border  every single day. It is inexcusable that the Biden administration cares  more about getting protested by far-left activists than they do about  providing a basic level of order and security.   Everyone knows what steps would improve the situation. The playbook  from the prior administration is right  [[Page S6950]]  there. All the Democrats need to do is pick it up.    Mr. President, few things ensure honesty in State and  local government as effectively as a tenacious local journalist. Though  the ranks of our Nation's small and mid-sized newspapers have shrunk in  recent years, these dogged reporters still stalk the halls of State  capitol buildings and city halls, ready to pull back the curtain on  government officials and bring harsh sunlight to murky backrooms.   In Kentucky, the Louisville Courier-Journal's Deborah Yetter has been  our consummate local journalist for nearly four decades, breaking news  and exposing government scandals, all for the voters' benefit. Deborah  retired from her role this November, earning praise and accolades from  all around the Commonwealth. Today, I ask my Senate colleagues to join  me in adding my voice to that chorus and congratulating Deborah on her  retirement.   Deborah has been reporting on Kentucky's government since she first  graduated college, starting her career in eastern Kentucky and honing  her skills at Harlan County's Tri-City News. At that weekly, she  focused on conditions in local coal mines, reported on endemic  unemployment and poverty in the area, and covered local officials. Her  work attracted attention from Louisville, where she moved in 1984 to  [[Page S6956]]  work for the Louisville Times. That paper merged with the Courier- Journal in 1987, and Deborah has been with Kentucky's flagship  newspaper ever since.   Early on in her career, Deborah developed a deep well of  understanding of the functions of State and local government, paying  special attention to issues affecting Kentucky's most vulnerable. She  covered abuses in the systems caring for the Commonwealth's children,  elderly, and disabled, offering a voice to communities that often  lacked one of their own. Through her stories, she moved public  officials to improve Kentucky's juvenile detention centers, child  protection system, facilities housing adults with intellectual  disabilities, and mental health services. Often, her work ran up  against obstinate public officials who were loath to release sensitive  information to the public. She took them to court and won.   First as a local official in Jefferson County and then as a Senator  representing Kentuckians statewide, I have had several opportunities to  work with Deborah over the past four decades. In our interactions she  was always tough but fair, a standard she maintained throughout her  career. That integrity won her recognition in Kentucky and beyond,  including two Pulitzer Prizes, the University of Kentucky's James  Madison Award for Service to the First Amendment, and induction into  the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame. When she made her retirement  public, colleagues and advocates from around the Commonwealth offered  praise for her 38 years of hard work. Vulnerable Kentuckians everywhere  are better off because of her reporting on their behalf.   Deborah plans to use her retirement to spend more time with her three  children, who now all live out-of-state, and her new grandchild. She  looks forward to dedicating more hours to volunteering at the YMCA,  singing in the St. James Catholic Church choir, and working with  children at the St. James School. Even after leaving the Courier- Journal, she will continue to fight for good in Kentucky. On behalf of  the entire Senate, I thank Deborah for her service to Kentucky and wish  her well in the next chapter of her life.   Mr. President, the Louisville Courier-Journal paid tribute to Deborah  Yetter's retirement in a recent article. I ask unanimous consent that  the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:            [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Nov. 15, 2022]     Pulitzer-Winning Reporter Deborah Yetter, Protector of Kentucky's                             Children, Retires         Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Deborah Yetter, whose       tenacious reporting on abuse, neglect and children's welfare       spurred greater protections for Kentucky's most vulnerable       residents, has retired after 38 years in the industry.        Yetter's final day at The Courier Journal was Nov. 11.        ``Debby has received many well-deserved honors, awards and       accolades during her almost four decades as a journalist, but       the Courier Journal family will miss her for so much more       than her stellar reporting,'' Executive Editor Mary Irby-      Jones said.        ``She is caring and compassionate, and many young       journalists in our newsroom have benefited from her wisdom,''       Irby-Jones said. ``I have had the privilege of working with       some top-notch journalists, and Debby is among the best.''        Yetter's longtime colleague, retired statehouse reporter       Tom Loftus, said Yetter ``was a rare reporter who, to sum it       up in one sentence, focused on the needy.''        Indeed, Yetter's coverage of Kentucky's social services       gave voice to the most marginalized in society, including       children, the disabled and those with mental illnesses:        Her stories on the appalling conditions in the state's       juvenile justice centers led to a federal civil rights       investigation and sweeping changes in the state system,       including a new emphasis on treatment and rehabilitation       instead of punishment and confinement.        Her series called ``Preying on Seniors'' uncovered       horrendous cases of abuse, neglect and a poor system of state       care, leading to several changes in state law aimed at better       protecting seniors and prosecuting their abusers.        Her stories examining the confidentiality of Kentucky's       child protection system--and her push to get The Courier       Journal to join litigation forcing the state to release       records of its actions in abuse cases--led to a major open-      records victory.        Now vital records about how well the state protects       children in abuse and neglect cases are accessible. These       stories also prompted the state to create an outside       oversight panel to review child deaths from abuse and       neglect.        That panel has since provided critical oversight of cases       that likely would have escaped public notice, including the       case of a 16-year-old boy with autism who in 2014 suffered       two fractured femurs, a near-fatal injury, in a supposedly       safe restraint at a Jefferson County public school.        Late Courier Journal editor David Hawpe called her ``a       shining light in state government reporting.''        ``Her work has had a direct, powerful impact on the lives       of Kentuckians--especially defenseless children who suffer at       the hands of incompetent and irresponsible state       bureaucrats,'' he said in 2017 when Yetter was awarded the       James Madison Award for Service to the First Amendment by the       University of Kentucky.        Yetter, a University of Louisville and Northwestern       University graduate, began her journalism career in Eastern       Kentucky, first as an instructor at Southeast Community       College and later as a freelance reporter for The Courier       Journal and as managing editor of the Tri-City News, a weekly       in Harlan County. During that time, she covered stories       ranging from coal mine strikes to poverty and unemployment       and local politics.        The Louisville native joined The Louisville Times in April       1984, later moving to The Courier Journal in 1987 after it       merged with the Times.        During her more than three decades at the Louisville       newspapers, Yetter covered transportation, county government,       federal courts, health, social services and the state       legislature. She also spent time as an editorial writer.        In 1994, Yetter began a series of investigative stories       about horrid conditions in the state's centers for juvenile       offenders. Through her reporting on a largely unseen and       confidential system, she exposed poorly staffed facilities       where youths were routinely locked in isolation cells, beaten       by other youths and staff and denied adequate medical care       and mental health treatment.        The stories triggered a civil rights investigation by the       U.S. Justice Department in 1995 and led to sweeping reforms       in the state system under a five-year federal consent decree.        In 2009, she produced a three-day series called ``Children       in Crisis'' outlining how years of underfunding, poor       management and excessive confidentiality around child       protection had created a crisis in child welfare in Kentucky.        Jennifer Hancock, president and CEO for Volunteers of       America Mid-States, said Yetter's departure will be felt       throughout the commonwealth.        ``She has a uniquely skillful approach to covering the most       complex child welfare issues of our time,'' Hancock said.        Yetter also spent time reporting on problems in the state's       system for vulnerable adults, including those with       intellectual disabilities. Yetter's coverage included       extensive reporting in 2006 and 2007 on Oakwood, a problem-      ridden residential facility in rural Kentucky marked with       years of abuse and mistreatment of residents.        Following Yetter's reporting, the state replaced the out-      of-state management company running Oakwood with a Kentucky       nonprofit agency experienced in care of people with mental       illnesses and intellectual disabilities.        Yetter was part of The Courier Journal team that earned a       Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the Carrollton bus crash in       1988, when 27 people were killed after a collision with a       drunken driver. In 2020, she was again part of a Pulitzer       effort, this time for staff reporting on former Kentucky Gov.       Matt Bevin's flurry of criminal pardons during his last days       in office.        Yetter in 2015 was awarded the Louisville Chapter of the       National Council of Jewish Women's ``Pathway to Justice''       award for coverage of child abuse and neglect. Yetter also       won numerous other awards for her coverage of children,       elders and people with disabilities or mental illnesses.        She was inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame       in 2022, a recognition that her colleagues stressed was long       overdue.        Yetter's departure ``leaves a tremendous void'' in Kentucky       journalism, said Bennie Ivory, Courier Journal executive       editor from 1997-2013. The depth of Yetter's knowledge about       the commonwealth's social services was ``unmatched,'' he       said.        ``Political leaders knew Debby knew more about children's       welfare than they did, so they couldn't bull her,'' said       Terry Brooks, executive director for Kentucky Youth       Advocates.        Yetter had a special knack for covering ``the peoples''       stories, said Sheila Schuster, a mental health and disability       advocate.        Schuster worked closely with Yetter in 2017 when then-Gov.       Bevin vetoed a bill known as ``Tim's Law.'' The bill, named       for a Lexington man who died after a long battle with mental       illness, was meant to stop the revolving door of jails,       hospitals and homelessness for the mentally ill, Yetter       reported at the time.        Yetter's human-centered coverage of the issue led lawmakers       to override Bevin's veto, Schuster said.        ``She was always, always willing to talk to the people       affected,'' Schuster said. ``She put a face to the problem,       so that people really understood the impact.''        Yetter's tenacity made her work ``very, very important for       public opinion,'' said Jon  [[Page S6957]]       Fleischaker, a First Amendment attorney who represents The       Courier Journal.        ``She's direct,'' he said. ``She goes right to the heart of       it, and she wouldn't take no for an answer.''        Fleischaker represented The Courier Journal in the early       2000s when the paper, along with the Lexington Herald-Leader,       battled the Catholic Diocese of Lexington over its coverup of       clergy child abuse. The diocese tried--and failed--to hold       The Courier Journal in contempt for publishing Yetter's story       on the coverup.        Fleischaker also worked closely with Yetter during former       Gov. Steve Beshear's administration, when the Cabinet for       Health and Family Services sought to withhold records about       severe child abuse in the state. The Courier Journal       ultimately won its cases, with a judge ordering the cabinet       to pay more than $1 million in attorneys fees and penalties,       Fleischaker said.        Yetter's reporting on the contested records exposed       gruesome child fatalities, including those in the state's       care.        Brooks saw Yetter's doggedness in that reporting firsthand,       when one morning he watched her sprint down a government       building hallway to get an interview with then-Cabinet       Secretary, Janie Miller.        Miller eventually resigned.        ``Kentucky's kids have had no clarion voice stronger than       Debby Yetter,'' Brooks said. ``She was as insightful as she       was persistent and often was the `canary in the coal mine,'       identifying issues before they were on anyone's radar.''        ``The loss for Kentucky's kids is unfathomable,'' he added.        Schuster agreed.        ``Like so many, I'm happy for her and sad for the rest of       us.''        Outside of work, Yetter is a longtime member of the YMCA       and served for several years on a member's committee to       review Y programs and services. She also has been a member of       St. James Catholic Church for more than 30 years. She sings       in the choir and has volunteered on parish committees and       projects including one to restore the historic church and       school. She also served on the St. James School committee and       volunteered at the school when her children were enrolled,       including working in the lunch room one day a week.        Yetter said she is looking forward to visiting her three       children, each of whom live out of state, as well as her 1-      year-old grandchild. She said she is ready for a break and to       ``not always be on a deadline.''        ``I love what I do and I think it's important,'' Yetter       said. ``There's never going to be a good time to leave.''                            ____________________
