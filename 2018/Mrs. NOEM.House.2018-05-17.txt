 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the Biggs  amendment as well. This amendment would repeal the bioenergy programs  established in the 2002 farm bill. These programs encourage investment  in small towns.   Not only do they encourage renewable fuels--and to me, that is a  national security issue--but they also  [[Page H4196]]  create jobs and investments that bring these benefits to our rural  communities, our States, and our country. Not only that, but they also  create new demand for many agricultural products.   H.R. 2 already makes reforms. It eliminates mandate funding and  reauthorizes programs that reduce discretionary funding levels. This  amendment is not necessary because, instead of improving successful  programs, it repeals them, eliminating all their successes, while not  saving any taxpayer money.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to vote against this  amendment.
