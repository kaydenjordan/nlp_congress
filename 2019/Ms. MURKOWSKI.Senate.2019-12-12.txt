 Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the ranking  member on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He is really a  friend on not only energy matters but on so many of the other  initiatives we have worked on.   As he mentioned, every now and again, our two States might see things  differently, but we have come to understand where we come from, what we  bring to the table, and figure out how we can work together  collaboratively and then set that collaborative tone for the full  committee as a whole. I appreciate the opportunity to highlight a few  of the accomplishments we as a committee have achieved over this past  year.   We had a holiday lunch at the first of this week with both of our  staffs assembled--had some good food--and I was able to share with all  of the staffs that I felt like we were the committee that was kind of  like ``The Little Engine that Could''--the children's storybook wherein  the tiny little engine is kind of plugging along. We are not typically  the headline-grabbing committee in this Senate, but just like the  little engine, we kind of put our heads down and get to work, and we  achieve a lot.   In our case, even in a divided time, we are seeing good, strong  bipartisan legislation that is helping just about every Member of our  Senate in all areas of the country.   Think about where we started off this year. You will recall that it  was unfortunately in the midst of a government shutdown. But what we  were able to do even at that time was to move through a significant  victory, and that was the passage of our sweeping lands package  containing more than 120 individual measures that reflected the  priorities of dozens of Members in the Senate and the House. We passed  that out of the Senate 92 to 8, the House passed it out 363 to 62, and  the President signed it shortly thereafter. It was sweeping. We  recognized that it provided for economic development for so many small  communities, protected treasured landscapes, addressed a range of  sportsmen's priorities, and permanently reauthorized the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   It took a long time. There were many initiatives we had been working  through for a considerable period of time. But our ability to be able  to pass it shortly after this government shutdown underscored that even  at a time when we are known for our divisions, we can still achieve  bipartisan success.   The committee really took the momentum, and we ran with it--as  Senator Manchin has pointed out, some 51 bills, 52 bills here. Today,  we just moved 19 bills out of the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee markup. We have moved out measures that are focused on energy  efficiency, renewables, energy storage, advanced nuclear energy, carbon  capture, utilization, and storage. We focused on mineral security,  cyber security, and a range of additional technologies that really work  to ensure that energy becomes more affordable as it becomes cleaner.   We have been working very hard on the public lands side of our  jurisdiction as well. One bill you are sure to hear more about in the  first of the year is the Restore Our Parks Act, which will address the  multibillion-dollar deferred maintenance backlog at our national  parks--the crown jewels of our Nation. That bill provides $6.5 billion  over the next 5 years to fix dilapidated trails, buildings, roads,  bridges, monuments, and historic markers.    Working on the parks and the land side, we reported 13 nominees for  key leadership positions at the Department of Energy, Department of the  Interior, and the FERC. Nearly all of them were confirmed, ensuring the  President has a good team to carry out our Nation's energy and resource  policies.   We have also held hearings--about two a week while we have been in  session--to highlight the opportunities and the challenges we face  within our jurisdiction. These range from everything from the need for  new and innovative technologies--as Senator Manchin pointed out--to the  future of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. As he mentioned, we have  held hearings--many hearings now--on climate change, making that a  priority among priorities.   I think it is fair to say we have been very productive as a  committee. We know the work isn't done. It is one thing to report the  measures out of committee; it is another thing to get them enacted into  law. Our eyes are directed right now on these next steps.   Early next year, we hope to bring much of the work we have processed  through the committee, bring it to the Senate floor. We are counting on  our colleagues to join us and to help move these bills to the House and  to the President for his signature. Whether you are interested in  energy innovation, resource security, or access to public lands, this  work should appeal to just about every Member and provide a great  opportunity to advance the security, prosperity, and competitiveness of  our Nation.   I want to share the deep appreciation I have for my ranking member,  Senator Manchin, and his partnership. We have navigated some  complicated stretches, but we have done so by working together to  ensure a good outcome for the committee, for the Senate, and for the  American people. I think you have seen some of that.                          Tribute to Johnny Isakson    Mr. President, we saw some of the good work reflected of a gentleman  we have lauded on the floor now throughout this week and will continue  to laud because he is a most laudable and wonderful human being, and  that is our friend, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, who will  soon be stepping down after a very good and honorable career in the  U.S. Senate and before that.  [[Page S7014]]    It was a pleasure to know we were able to move out of the Energy  Committee this morning. One of the priorities he has been working on is  the Preserving America's Battlefields Act. He is a great historian and  has put a great deal of himself into advancing that important  legislation.   Another markup I was part of this morning was in Health, Education,  Labor and Pensions, where we moved out two significant bills that had  Johnny Isakson's fingerprints all over it. His care, his compassion for  the most vulnerable children who have been abused--he has been a leader  in the CAPTA legislation that moved out of that committee by voice vote  this morning.   He was also instrumental in another measure that moved through the  committee, the Adoption Opportunities Act. It gives you a glimpse of  the range and the breadth of this extraordinary legislator, whether it  is his great effort working for our veterans and his leadership on the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs, his leadership on those matters that he  cares so personally and passionately about in the HELP Committee, or  what we see in the other committees as we have seen in Energy with his  focus on America's history.   Johnny Isakson is not only a great legislator, a laudable man, but he  is also a true friend. He is one who has reminded us all that  relationships matter; that how we speak to one another matters; that  how we treat one another as human beings and friends matters.   I know that as we say our goodbyes to Senator Isakson from this  Chamber, we will long remember not only the contributions he has  provided from a legislative perspective and a policy perspective but as  a person and as a lovely and decent human being.   With that, I yield floor.
