 Madam Speaker, the facts are uncontestable. The evidence  is overwhelming. The President grossly misused the Office of President  and obstructed Congress, and justice requires this impeachment.   I feel compelled to respond to the false narrative that Democrats are  using this process to overturn an election.   I agree that elections are the appropriate venue for public policy  disputes. However, we are not talking about a public policy dispute. We  are talking about a President who subverted national security by  soliciting foreign interference in our elections, the exact thing our  Founding Fathers feared and the exact circumstance for which they  drafted the impeachment clause.    Our democracy, our Constitution, deserves standing up for, not Donald  John Trump.   I will leave my colleagues with this last thought as they decide how  to cast this historic vote: For what shall it profit a man to gain the  whole world only to lose his own soul.
