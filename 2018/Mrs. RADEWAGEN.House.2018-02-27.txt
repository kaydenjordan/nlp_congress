 Mr. Speaker, many decades ago, a missionary named  John Williams made the long and difficult journey in the 1800s to bring  Christianity to the people of the Pacific islands, including American  Samoa.   He and the others in his footsteps in those early years probably  surpassed their fondest hopes. Today, faith and church provide a strong  foundation to a very large percentage of our population. I think he and  Billy Graham would have understood each other very well, though their  ministries are separated by more than a century.   Billy Graham's influence went around the world rapidly and  powerfully, and seemed divinely timed to coincide with the rise of the  communications and travel of the 20th century.   As he lies in honor this week at the U.S. Capitol, it is a new  opportunity for a younger generation to learn more of his exceptional  life and hear his message once more--that God loves each of us, and  when times seem troubled around us, there is someone greater to depend  on.   As Scripture says: ``How shall they hear without a preacher?''   Billy Graham answered that call.   He described himself simply: a preacher of the gospel of Jesus  Christ. That life's purpose defined him, and what a life it was.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Billy Graham.
