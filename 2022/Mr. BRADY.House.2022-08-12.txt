 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I join Chairman Neal in expressing our heartbreak and  sorrow in losing Congresswoman Jackie Walorski, our colleague, as well  as Zachery and Emma. She was so proud of her Team Walorski folks.   The truth of the matter is, Jackie lit up every room she was in with  her passion and her brilliance and her friendship and warmness. There  is no question she could do everything. She was all in on everything  and worked hard to find common ground wherever she could.   Last week was a shocking week and a week to mourn. This week is a  time to celebrate Jackie, her legacy, and her life.   Sadly, this massive Senate bill, drawn in secret, stuffed with  government checks to the wealthy and favored interests, and rushed  through Congress is a hoax on the American people. It fails to reduce  inflation, fails to reduce the budget deficit, and fails to reduce the  world's temperature.   Who in their right mind raises taxes in a recession? The answer is  only President Biden and his supporters in Congress who bungled this  economic recovery think that is a good idea. You remember them. They  told you they would defeat COVID, that inflation was a rich person's  problem, that their $2 trillion spending spree last spring would  strengthen the economy.    Instead, what did their promises deliver? The worst inflation in 40  years, a recession, and a crippling worker shortage that continues to  hammer Main Street businesses.   Today, we have a shrinking economy, shrinking paychecks, and a  shrinking workforce. Families are skipping meals, running up credit  card debt to pay for daily essentials, delaying retirement, and  struggling to afford gas just to drive to work. Yet, Democrats today  insist inflation doesn't even exist. They say it is zero.   The truth is, most Americans have lost confidence in President  Biden's failed handling of the economy. By contrast, the majority of  the jobs in the COVID recovery came under President Trump, and under  Republican leadership, paychecks grew twice as fast as prices. The  economy was surging, not shrinking like it is today, and 600,000 more  Americans were working than today under this unpopular White House.   Why would you trust the same Democrats responsible for this cruel  economy with another of their misguided spending bills?   While other countries are lowering taxes to fight inflation,  Democrats imposed over $350 billion in taxes that land on local  manufacturers that build right here in America. It will kill jobs, slow  the economy, and raise prices even higher.   Small businesses, which hire nearly half of all workers in America,  get hammered with $50 billion in new taxes.   Senior citizens and savers will bear the impact of $74 billion in new  taxes that punish companies from investing in their stock value.   All these taxes will hurt the economy, drive inflation further, and  harm workers' paychecks, according to the independent Tax Foundation.   Democrats promise that no American will ``see a penny'' of tax hikes,  yet Congress' own budget office debunks that claim, confirming the  largest burden of higher taxes will come from middle-class families  starting next year.   President Biden is violating his own pledge not to raise taxes on  middle-class Americans. He is denying that truth.   Yesterday, House Democrats insisted there are no new IRS agents  funded in this bill. Read their lips: No new IRS agents. They say it is  all fearmongering, and they are just hiring replacements.   Unfortunately, the fact is the IRS budget already budgets for those  who are leaving through attrition, and the Treasury Department itself  outlines the next decade of adding 87,000 new IRS agents. That is what  this bill unleashes.   In fact, the Congressional Budget Office reports ``audit rates will  increase for every income level,'' that almost 90 percent of unreported  tax income comes from who? The middle class.   How will Democrats collect $204 billion in more taxes? With thousands  of new agents targeting what I would call Walmart shoppers. You know  them. They are real, hardworking American families. They are my  constituents. They are my neighbors in my district. They are living  paycheck to paycheck, struggling with inflation and higher gas prices.  They will be hit with over 700,000 new audits, thanks to a skyrocketing  surge in IRS agents.   Maybe that is why Democrats blocked any language in the Senate that  protects Walmart shoppers and other value-shopping families against  [[Page H7661]]  these new IRS audits. But, man, this bill, they love the wealthy. If  the Green New Deal and corporate welfare had a baby, it would look like  this. Nearly one-quarter of a trillion dollars in Green New Deal  subsidies, government handouts, go to the wealthy and to the biggest,  most successful businesses in America.   Look at this: A single working mom will pay higher taxes so they can  be sent in a government check to wealthy investors and massive  corporations. A yardman will send his taxes in a government check to  the very well-to-do family whose lawn he is cutting so they can splurge  on an $80,000 luxury electric vehicle.   Incredibly, to fund all these government handouts, every Senate  Democrat and the Vice President chose to impose higher taxes on small  businesses so that millionaires and billionaires would be protected  from higher State and local taxes.   Everyone facing devastating diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, ALS,  and Parkinson's will pay a deadly price.   This crazy bill increases the cost of healthcare and medicines and  kills new lifesaving cures while providing ObamaCare subsidies for the  wealthy and those choosing not to return to work, making the worker  shortage harsher.   Congress' nonpartisan scorekeeper, the Penn Wharton School of  Business, and the University of Chicago all confirm the government  price-fixing scheme could be a death sentence for patients, raising the  costs of new drugs, crushing innovation, and killing hundreds of cures.    Higher taxes, harassing IRS audits on our Walmart shoppers, no relief  from inflation, all as America battles a recession.   Let me ask again: Do you really trust the same President and  Democrats who drove this economy into recession and drove prices sky  high with yet another spending spree?   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record Page 16 of the  Department of the Treasury's tax compliance plan, which shows the  agency intends to hire 87,000 new IRS employees.                          Restoring IRS Resources         The first step in the President's efforts to restore IRS       enforcement capability is a sustained, multi-year commitment       to rebuilding the IRS. This involves spending nearly $80       billion on IRS priorities over the course of the decade       including hiring new specialized enforcement staff,       modernizing antiquated information technology, and investing       in meaningful taxpayer service--including the implementation       of the newly expanded credits aimed at providing support to       American families. Importantly, the additional resources will       go toward enforcement against those with the highest incomes,       and audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for       those earning less than $400,000 in actual income.        The President's proposal includes two components: a       dedicated stream of mandatory funds ($72.5 billion over a       decade) and a program integrity allocation ($6.7 billion over       a decade). These mechanisms provide for a sustained, multi-      year commitment to revitalizing the IRS that will give the       agency the certainty it needs to rebuild.        The IRS proposal includes year-by-year estimates of the       additional resources that will be directed toward the agency       as well as the specific activities that these resources would       support. The design ensures that the IRS is able to absorb       and usefully deploy additional resources over the entire 10-      year horizon and keeps budget growth manageable at around 10       percent per year.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Hern).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a CBO letter,  [[Page H7662]]  which confirms the Affordable Care Act subsidies will boost inflation  and reduce the incentive for people to work.                                                     U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                     Washington, DC, August 4, 2022.      Re Economic Analysis of Budget Reconciliation Legislation       Hon. Lindsey Graham,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator: Yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office       published a cost estimate for H.R. 5376, the Inflation       Reduction Act of 2022, which is the latest version of the       reconciliation legislation in the Senate.\1\ This letter       provides answers to four questions you asked related to that       bill and broader economic conditions.                Is the United States Currently in a Recession?         The U.S. economy shows signs of slowing, but whether the       economy is currently in a recession is difficult to say. It       is possible that, in retrospect, it will become apparent that       the economy moved into recession sometime this year. However,       that is not clear from data that were available at the       beginning of August. Some key metrics indicate a decline in       economic activity as the first half of this year progressed,       whereas others indicate continued growth, though generally at       a slower rate than previously.        Real gross domestic product (that is, GDP adjusted to       remove the effects of inflation) and industrial production       have both declined. In particular, real GDP declined by an       average of 1.25 percent (at an annual rate) in the first two       quarters of 2022. Industrial production grew from January to       April, was essentially unchanged in May, and then declined in       June.        Other key indicators of economic activity have continued to       increase in the first half of 2022, though generally at a       slower rate than they had previously. For instance, real       gross domestic income (GDI) increased at an annual rate of       1.8 percent in the first quarter of 2022 after growing by an       average rate of 6.3 percent in the second half of 2021.\2\       (Second-quarter data for GDI are not yet available.) Real       personal income minus transfer payments to people by federal,       state, and local governments grew at an average annual rate       of 0.5 percent in the first half of 2022 versus 3.1 percent       in the second half of 2021. And real personal consumption       expenditures grew at an average annual rate of 1.4 percent in       the first half of 2022 (with somewhat slower growth in the       second quarter than in the first), compared with 2.2 percent       in the second half of 2021. One reason for the deceleration       in personal consumption expenditures is higher inflation,       which has eroded consumers' purchasing power. Another reason       is that real disposable personal income has declined in the       first half of 2022. Savings accumulated during the       coronavirus pandemic, including from transfer payments, have       continued to support consumption.        The labor market remains tight, with low unemployment and       elevated job vacancies, but both measures have softened in       recent months. Net gains in nonfarm payroll employment       averaged 375,000 jobs per month in the second quarter of 2022       compared with 539,000 jobs, on net, added per month in the       first quarter and 590,000 jobs, on net, added per month in       the second half of 2021. In June 2022, the unemployment rate       was 3.6 percent (unchanged since March and near its       prepandemic low) and there were about 1.8 job vacancies for       every unemployed worker (one of the highest readings in the       near 22-year history of this series though down from its       highest level of 2.0 in March).        How Would Enacting the Bill Affect Inflation in 2022 and 2023?         In calendar year 2022, enacting the bill would have a       negligible effect on inflation, in CBO's assessment. In       calendar year 2023, inflation would probably be between 0.1       percentage point lower and 0.1 percentage point higher under       the bill than it would be under current law, CBO estimates.       That range of likely outcomes reflects uncertainty about how       various provisions of the bill would affect overall demand       and output, the supply of labor, the persistence of       disruptions in the supply of goods and services, and how the       Federal Reserve would respond to offset any increase in       inflationary pressure. Responsiveness to the enhancement of       health insurance subsidies established by the Affordable Care       Act is the most important factor boosting inflationary       pressure, and responsiveness to the new alternative minimum       tax on corporations is the most important factor reducing       inflationary pressure. The range applies to multiple measures       of inflation: the GDP price index, the personal consumption       expenditures price index, and the consumer price index for       all urban consumers.        In its analysis of the inflationary effects of the bill,       CBO used an approach similar to that underlying the agency's       estimates of the short-term effects of legislation enacted in       2021.\3\ The agency augmented its analysis to account for the       effects of supply disruptions and for the amount of tightness       or slack in the economy on the inflationary effects of fiscal       policy.        Key inputs into the analysis of inflation were the effects       of the bill on overall demand for goods and services. In the       short term, changes in fiscal policies affect the economy       primarily by influencing the demand for goods and services by       consumers, businesses, and governments, which leads to       changes in output. Factors increasing overall demand push       inflation up and those decreasing overall demand push       inflation down. To estimate the effects of changes in federal       spending and revenues on overall demand and output, CBO       considered evidence about the effects of similar policies in       the past and used results produced by macroeconomic       models.\4\        CBO expects different provisions of the legislation to       affect overall demand and output differently.\5\ For example,       provisions that directly increase government purchases of       goods and services would add to overall demand on a dollar-      for-dollar basis. Increases in financial support to people,       such as through enhanced health insurance subsidies, would       boost spending more among lower-income people than among       higher-income people, partly because lower-income households       typically consume a higher fraction of their additional       disposable income than higher-income households do. Thus,       financial assistance to lower-income households would boost       the overall demand for goods and services more than financial       assistance to higher-income households would. Changes to       business taxes that affect after-tax profits on past       investments--as opposed to the return on new investments--      would have relatively small effects on overall demand, in       CBO's assessment.        CBO used its estimates of the bill's net effects on the       deficit as the starting point for its analysis of overall       effects on demand (see Table 1). The enhanced health       insurance subsidies and energy-related subsidies were the       largest contributors to increases in the deficit. The new       alternative minimum tax on corporations was the largest       contributor to reductions in the deficit. For each dollar       change in the deficit, the increases in subsidies would       probably have larger effects on overall demand (boosting it)       than the increases in revenues (which would reduce overall       demand). Those factors could contribute to the effects on       output and inflation being positive even when the overall       deficit was reduced.

The estimated budgetary effects are of H.R. 5376, as amended in the   nature of a substitute (ERN22335) and posted on the website of the   Senate Majority Leader on July 27, 2022. Components may not sum to   totals because of rounding. The budgetary effects in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 informed CBO's   analysis of the economic effects in calendar year 2023. The analysis   included the effects on the deficit from higher revenues resulting   from increased funding for the Internal Revenue Service. Under   guidelines agreed to by the legislative and executive branches, those   effects are not included in the total line from CBO's cost estimate   reporting the net effect on the deficit. Thus, the effects shown in   the memorandum are additional. Those revenues constitute a shift in   resources from the private sector to the government that would reduce   demand and thus reduce inflationary pressure.         Enacting the bill would also reduce some businesses'       incentives to invest through changes in the after-tax return       on private investment, pushing down output and inflation.       (See the answer to the fourth question in this letter for       further discussion.) In addition, enacting the bill would       reduce the incentives of some people to work, mainly because       of the enhanced health insurance subsidies, pushing down       output and pushing up inflation.        Enacting the bill would affect economic activity and       inflation beyond 2023. CBO has not evaluated those effects.       What Is the Highest Amount of Income That People Qualifying for              Expanded Health Insurance Subsidies Would Earn?         The answer to your question depends on people's age and       geographic location, and the number of enrollees in the       family. On the basis of nationwide average premiums projected       for 2023 under the bill, CBO estimates the following:        A 64-year-old would receive a premium tax credit if his or       her income did not exceed $163,700 in that year.        A 21-year-old would receive a premium tax credit if his or       her income did not exceed $54,600.        A family of four consisting of individuals ages 50, 50, 21,       and 21 would receive a premium tax credit if their household       income was no greater than $304,100.        A younger family of four, consisting of people ages 24, 24,       5, and 5, would receive a premium tax credit if the       household's income was no more than $192,700.        Premium tax credits are used to lower people's out-of-      pocket monthly premium contributions for health insurance       obtained through the marketplaces established by the       Affordable Care Act. The amount of the credit is calculated       as the difference between the benchmark premium for health       insurance (that is, the premium for the second-lowest-cost       silver plan available in a region) for the individual or       family and a specified maximum contribution, expressed as a       percentage of modified adjusted gross income. Those benchmark       premiums are also a function of age, geographic location, and       the number of enrollees. For example, the premium for a 64-      year-old is three times that for a 21-year-old in most       states. The premium tax credit is  [[Page H7663]]       thus correspondingly larger for older people than for younger       people.        The likelihood that the benchmark premium will exceed a       person's maximum contribution--and that the person will       therefore receive a premium tax credit--declines at higher       income levels. For those whose income is above 400 percent of       the federal poverty guideline, or $54,400 for a single person       in 2023, their maximum contribution would be 8.5 percent of       income through 2025 under the bill.        This analysis is based on nationwide average premiums. For       people living in states with premiums that are above or below       the average, the income at which they would no longer be       eligible for a premium tax credit would be higher or lower.   What Effect Would a New Alternative Minimum Tax on Corporations Have on                        Business Investment and GDP?         Section 10101 of H.R. 5376 would increase taxes on       corporations by imposing a new alternative minimum tax equal       to 15 percent of income reported on financial statements by       certain large corporations--specifically, those whose       adjusted financial statement income exceeds $1 billion. The       staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that       the provision would increase federal revenues by $313.1       billion over the 2023-2031 period (with $96.6 billion of that       amount being generated in fiscal years 2023 and 2024). JCT       has projected that approximately 150 corporations would be       subject to the new tax each year and that just under half of       the revenues would come from the manufacturing sector.\6\        In CBO's assessment, the proposed new corporate minimum tax       would reduce the incentive for those large corporations to       invest, primarily by limiting the tax benefit of accelerated       depreciation and by decreasing the after-tax return on their       new investment. According to the generally accepted       accounting principles that are used for preparing financial       statements, firms must deduct the cost of investments over       the full useful life of the asset. In contrast, various       provisions of the tax code--including ``bonus''       depreciation--allow firms to deduct investment expenses more       quickly, increasing the tax benefit of those deductions and       the expected after-tax return on the investments. By setting       a new minimum tax, section 10101 would limit the tax benefit       of accelerated depreciation for affected corporations and,       all else being equal, reduce their business investment.        The provision would also affect private investment by       increasing federal revenues and, all else being equal, by       reducing the federal deficit and the amount of federal debt.       Less government borrowing would increase the amount of funds       available for private investment and put downward pressure on       interest rates, which would have a positive effect on       business investment, in CBO's view.        The net effect on business investment, and hence on GDP,       would depend on the relative magnitudes of the direct       incentive effect and the indirect effect resulting from the       change in the federal budget deficit. Additionally, the net       effect would depend on overall economic conditions.        Other provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act would also       affect incentives to invest. Thus, the legislation's overall       impact on business investment and GDP would differ from that       of just this provision considered by itself.        I hope that this information is useful to you.            Sincerely,                                                 Phillip L.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the Joint Committee  on Taxation analysis that shows that families earning $75,000 or  $100,000 are four times more likely to have a tax hike under this bill  than a tax cut.   Nonpartisan Tax Scorekeeper: Average Working Family Is More Likely To           Be Worse Off Than Better Off Under Democrats' Tax Plan         Working families will be worse off under Democrats' higher       taxes, according to a new analysis from the nonpartisan Joint       Committee on Taxation. This is another devastating blow for       families after the Congressional Budget Office revealed that       Democrats' supercharged IRS expects to grab $20 billion from       lower- and middle-income earners.                  Working Families at High Risk of Tax Hikes         Democrats have once again tried to hide the real effects of       this bill. New analysis from the nonpartisan Joint Committee       on Taxation (JCT) shows that the average working family is       more likely to be worse-off than better-off under Democrats'       tax plan.        For median-income families earning $50,000-$75,000,       households are 33 percent more likely to have a tax hike than       a tax cut.        It gets worse for every dollar earned--families earning       $75,000-$100,000 are four times more likely to have a tax       hike than a tax cut, and families earning $100,000-$200,000       are more than ten times more likely to have a tax hike than a       tax cut.        The bill does nothing--or makes things worse--for regular       working families. More than 92 percent of households with       incomes under $200,000 get no benefit--or a tax hike--under       Democrats' bill.        What's more, these tax hikes on working families do not       include the bill's superfund or methane taxes on American       energy, which disproportionately harm middle- and lower-      income households through higher prices at the pump and       bigger utility bills.  [[Page H7664]]                       High-Income Households Enjoy Big Benefits         The JCT analysis shows the landscaping company owner and       his workers pay more, while the wealthy homeowner gets checks       from Washington for the solar panels on their roof. That's       because the ``winners'' under Democrat's tax plan are the       earners at the very top. Democrat's reckless spending plan       includes more than $250 billion in Green New Deal subsidies       that benefit the wealthy the most.        The percentage of $1 million-plus households getting a tax       cut (19.4 percent) is twice as high as any other income       group.        The group with the next highest proportion of tax cuts is       those earning $500,000-$1 million.        Over the long term, 72.5 percent of households with income       over $1 million will receive a tax cut.   More Bad News: $10.6 Billion in Tax Hikes on Working Families Next Year         Separate analysis by JCT isolates the effects of Democrats'       tax plan without the Obamacare subsidies that flow to a       limited number of households in an attempt to bribe them into       one-size-fits-all Obamacare plans. In 2023, Democrats would       increase the total tax burden on Americans under $200,000 in       income by $10.6 billion.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Congressional Budget Office, which confirms this bill will actually  increase the cost of new drugs.                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                     Washington, DC, August 4, 2022.      Re Additional Information About Prescription Drug Legislation       Hon. Jason Smith,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman: This letter provides additional       information that you and your colleagues requested about       subtitle I of the reconciliation recommendations of the       Senate Committee on Finance regarding prescription drug       legislation. You asked about how provisions involving       inflation rebates and the negotiation of drug prices would       affect launch prices for new drugs and the introduction of       new generic drugs. You also asked how a provision to       stabilize premiums as a part of the redesign of Medicare's       benefits would affect the federal budget and premiums.     Effect of the Inflation-Rebate and Negotiation Provisions on Launch                                   Prices         The Congressional Budget Office projects that the       inflation-rebate and negotiation provisions would increase       the launch prices for drugs that are not yet on the market       relative to what such prices would be otherwise. That effect       would primarily be driven by the inflation-rebate provisions       (sections 129101 and 129102), which would begin to apply to       prices within 12 months of a given drug's entering the       market. Under those provisions, manufacturers would have an       incentive to launch new drugs at a higher price to offset       slower growth in prices over time. The negotiation provision       (section 129001) would have less of an impact on launch       prices, CBO expects: Although the ceiling for a drug's       negotiated price is based on its price from a prior year,       negotiation could not occur until drugs were on the market       for a number of years--at least 7 for small-molecule drugs       and 11 for biologics.        Higher launch prices would primarily affect spending for       drugs in the Medicaid program, CBO projects, because an       increase in that program's basic rebate brought about by the       higher launch prices would only partly offset those prices.       Higher launch prices would also tend to affect spending for       drugs covered by Part B of the Medicare program because that       program's payments for those drugs are based on the average       sales prices. Over time, slower price growth would attenuate       the effect of higher launch prices.        In the commercial and Medicare Part D segments of the       market, spending would be less affected by higher launch       prices, CBO estimates, because manufacturers would have more       flexibility to manage rebates to maximize their revenues in       those sectors.   Effect of the Negotiation Provision on the Introduction of New Generic                                   Drugs         CBO has not analyzed the effects of the negotiation       provision on the introduction of new generic drugs. In       projecting the effects of the negotiation provision, CBO       estimated the share of spending that would be subject to       negotiation each year and the average reduction in prices       that would stem from the negotiations. But the agency did not       analyze how the provision would affect prices or spending on       specific drugs, nor did it quantify any impact on the       introduction of new generic drugs.                Effects of the Premium-Stabilization Provision         Under the premium-stabilization provision (section 129201),       the federal government would subsidize any growth in       beneficiaries' base premiums for Medicare Part D exceeding 6       percent from one year to the next over the 2024-2029 period.       The provision subsequently would lower the base premium       percentage (the percentage of the average cost of standard       Part D coverage that is used to calculate beneficiaries'       premiums) to ensure that premiums did not grow by more than 6       percent between 2029 and 2030. That subsidy and subsequent       reduction in premiums would increase federal spending by       roughly $40 billion over the 2024-2031 period, CBO estimates.       Beneficiaries' spending on premiums would be lower under the       premium-stabilization provision than it would be without it.        That estimate is an average effect among the possible paths       of premiums that CBO considered when modeling the uncertainty       of future outcomes. Under some of those paths, premiums would       grow by less than 6 percent a year, and the provision would       have no cost; under others, premiums would grow faster, and       the provision would generate costs.        I hope this information is useful to you and your       colleagues. Please contact me if you have further questions.            Sincerely,                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                                                          Director.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), my colleague on the Committee on Ways and  Means.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Congressional  Budget Office report from this morning, while we were on the House  floor, which confirms IRS audits will generate tens of billions of  dollars for middle-class families making less than $400,000.         CBO has received a number of questions regarding our       estimate of an amendment offered by Senator Crapo during the       floor debate on H.R. 5376 last weekend. That amendment,       #5404, would limit the use of additional funds for the       Internal Revenue Service. If the amendment had been adopted       none of the additional funds could have been used to audit       taxpayers with taxable incomes below $400,000.        CBO did not complete a formal cost estimate in advance of       consideration of the amendment but the agency did provide the       following information to the Senate Budget Committee:        CBO estimates that the amendment 5404 would have the       following effects:        No effect on outlays in the one or ten year budget windows;       would reduce outlays in the five year budget window.        No effect on revenues in the one year budget window; would       reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the       provisions of section 10301 in the five and ten year budget       windows.        No effect on outlays after 2031 but would decrease the       ``non-scorable'' revenue resulting from the provisions of       section 10301 after 2031.        CBO has not completed a point estimate of this amendment       but the preliminary assessment indicates that amendment 5404       would reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the       provisions of section 10301 by at least $20 billion over the       FY2022-FY2031 period.        Thanks,                                                   Leigh Angres,                                    Director of Legislative Affairs,                                       Congressional Budget Office.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), my colleague from the Committee on Ways and  Means.                                time  1345     Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following  report from 2020 from a group that tracks government spending, which  details how the IRS is currently armed with 4,600 guns and 5 million  rounds of ammunition. That is not fear-mongering; these are the facts.   IRS Has 4,600 Guns and Five Milion Rounds of Ammo: Will Dem Bill Grow                                  Arsenal?         The IRS has 4,600 guns and five million rounds of       ammunition according to a report from OpenTheBooks published       in 2020. With Democrats on the verge of passing $80 billion       in additional funding to facilitate the hiring of 87,000 new       agents, how much will this arsenal grow?        The Democrats' push to increase the size and power of the       IRS has significant criminal justice and basic due process       ramifications.        An OpenTheBooks report titled The Militarization of U.S.       Executive Agencies shows that, even without the proposed $80       billion increase in funding, the IRS Criminal Investigation       Division (IRS-CI) is already heavily armed at the expense of       the American taxpayer.        The current 4,600-gun stockpile includes:        3,282 pistols        621 shotguns        539 rifles        15 fully automatic firearms        4 revolvers        According to the Government Accountability Office the       ammunition breakdown is as follows:        Pistol and revolver rounds: 3,151,500        Rifle rounds: 1,472,050        Shotgun rounds: 367,750        Fully automatic firearm rounds: 56,000        When OpenTheBooks directly asked the IRS for an accounting       of its gun locker, the agency responded, ``We don't have one       [an inventory], but could create one for you, if important.''        There are seven reasons to be concerned about the IRS       having more power, more money, and more guns:    1. irs fails to ensure armed agents receive required firearms training         In order to carry or use an IRS-owned weapon, agents must:       engage in handgun firing training at least once each quarter,       shoot at least the minimum of 75 percentage points on the       firearms qualifying test using the issued handgun during two       nonconsecutive quarters, participate in biannual firearms       building entry exercises, participate in an annual briefing       on firearms safety and security policies and IRS-CI's       directives and procedures regarding the safe handling and       storage of firearms, and participate in a briefing each       quarter regarding the policy of discharging a firearm at a       moving vehicle.        IRS-CI's National Criminal Investigation Training Academy       (NCITA) is responsible for implementing the formalized       firearms training and qualification program nationwide. This       includes developing the firearm qualification requirements       they are expected to meet and the training special agents       will undergo. Despite these requirements, CI agents have       regularly failed to stay up to date on training or report       incidents, endangering the taxpayers they are supposed to       protect.        According to reports from the Treasury Inspector General       for Tax Administration (TIGTA), the IRS has repeatedly failed       to ensure that procedures relating to firearms are properly       followed:        ``there is no national-level review of firearms training       records to ensure that all special agents meet the       qualification requirements.''        Special agents are required to surrender their weapons when       they fail to participate  [[Page H7667]]       in this training, however this often does not happen.        As noted by the Inspector General:        ``However, there is currently little consequence for       special agents who fail to meet the training requirements       listed on the checklist.''        The Inspector General noted the IRS failed to secure the       firearms of those who did not meet their requirements:        ``controls did not ensure that CI personnel properly       secured firearms when special agents failed to meet the       biannual standard qualification requirement. CI was only able       to provide evidence that firearms were surrendered in nine of       the 27 instances when special agents did not qualify. The       Criminal Investigation Management Information System was only       updated to reflect the custody change in four of those nine       instances.        The Inspector General noted that the IRS lapses torpedo its       ability to effectively try cases:        ``Court decisions in the past have held law enforcement       entities liable because their law enforcement agents did not       have training that reflected the environment that they would       likely encounter, such as training involving moving targets       and low-light conditions. Other court decisions underscored       the importance of properly documenting firearms training. One       decision dismissed the claims against a law enforcement       entity that maintained thorough records that showed the law       enforcement personnel had been trained. Another decision       upheld a jury's conclusion that undocumented police training       did not constitute adequate training.''        The IRS failure to conduct proper internal oversight of its       weapons could have grave consequences for the public. As       noted by the Inspector General:        ``If there is insufficient oversight, special agents in       possession of firearms who are not properly trained and       qualified could endanger other special agents and the       public.''     2. irs agents accidentally fire their weapons more often than they                          intentionally fire them         A TIGTA report found that special agents at the IRS       Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI) accidentally fired       their weapons more often than they intentionally fired them:        ``According to documentation provided by all 26 CI field       offices, the NCITA, and the TIGTA OI, there were a total of       eight firearm discharges classified as intentional use of       force incidents and 11 discharges classified as accidental       during FYs 2009 through 2011.''             3. irs conceals details of accidental gun discharges         The agency's lackadaisical approach to firearm safety has       led to easily preventable accidents. The Inspector General       cryptically references IRS accidental discharges that caused       ``property damage or personal injury'':        ``In three of the four accidental discharges that were not       reported, the accidental discharges may have resulted in       property damage or personal injury.''        The details of these incidents are--for some reason--      redacted in the report:        IRS-CI management is required to be notified when a special       agent discharges their weapon. CI must report all accidental       discharge incidents externally to the TIGTA OI and internally       to the NCITA and the Director of Field Operations. Despite       these directives, CI did not always properly disclose       accidental discharges:        ``we found that four accidental discharges were not       properly reported. This included two that were not reported       to both to the TIGTA OI and the NCITA. one that was not       reported to the TIGTA OI, and one that was not reported       internally to the NCITA.''   4. IRS AGENTS DO NOT ALWAYS UNDERGO REMEDIAL TRAINING AFTER DISCHARGES                          DUE TO AGENT NEGLIGENCE         Compounding their mistakes, agents did not always provide       remedial training when an accidental discharge occurred. Even       when they did undergo training, the standards remained wildly       inconsistent. The Inspector General found that:        ``two of the four use of force coordinators stated that       they may require the special agent to participate in some       type of remedial training, one stated that the special agent       would be counseled, and one stated that there would be no       additional training required.''          5. IRS HAS A HISTORY OF VIOLATING BASIC DUE PROCESS RIGHTS         In a 2017 report, the IRS-CI was shown to have regularly       violated taxpayers' rights and skirted or ignored due process       requirements when investigating taxpayers for allegedly       violating the existing $10,000 currency transaction reporting       requirements        TIGTA found that only 8 percent of investigations uncovered       violations of tax law. In many cases, IRS-CI had not       considered reasonable explanations from those investigated,       property owners were not adequately informed of their rights       nor informed of seizure of their property, and outcomes in       cases lacked consistency, violating the Eighth Amendment to       the Constitution.                 6. IRS HAS APPALLING EVIDENCE STORAGE HABITS         The IRS Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI) was       repeatedly found to leave critical evidence sitting around in       break rooms, hallways and stacked outside cubicles, according       to a report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax       Administration (TIGTA). In addition, the report found that CI       offices did not maintain an Evidence Access Control Log to       record access to areas where evidence is stored:        During our walkthroughs at the CI offices, we observed that       some sites had evidence placed in hallways. stacked outside       cubicles, and in break rooms. In addition, seven of the nine       offices did not keep grand jury material in a separate,       secure area. The grand jury material was intermingled with       non-grand jury evidence and other case file information.        The agency's careless approach to evidence storage has       grave ramifications, as noted by the Inspector General:        In order for a seized item to be admissible as evidence, it       is necessary to prove that the item is in the same condition       as when it was seized. If evidence is not stored properly,       evidence may have been inappropriately disclosed, lost,       tampered with, or stolen. In addition, the chain of custody       could be called into question, which could result in the item       being deemed inadmissible in court.        The report suggests the IRS is an outlier in terms of its       sloppy handling of evidence, compared to other federal law       enforcement agencies:        In addition, we interviewed representatives from two other       Federal law enforcement agencies to gain an understanding of       how they maintained their chain of custody. It was apparent       from these interviews that both Federal agencies have an       extensive chain of custody process. For example, each agency       limits access to the locked evidence room, which is       maintained by an evidence custodian. If evidence needs to be       removed from the room, an agent must gain access through the       evidence custodian and a record of that access is maintained.       This process helps ensure that evidence does not become lost       or misplaced and helps keep the chain of custody from being       broken.        Each IRS-CI special agent has the authority to investigate,       inquire, and receive information. Of the investigative       techniques available to agents, one of the most frequently       used is the authority to conduct searches and issue search       and seizure warrants.        The Federal Government is responsible for properly       maintaining the chain of custody for any seized items. CI       agents must be able to prove it is the same item that was       seized and that the item is in the same condition as when it       was seized in order for that seized item to be admissible as       evidence.        Grand jury-related evidence must be kept separate from       other non-grand jury evidence. Despite these clear       directives, the CI has routinely ignored protocol, violating       the rights of the taxpayers they are supposed to protect.         7. IRS HAS CONDUCTED MANY ARMED RAIDS ON INNOCENT AMERICANS         In the late 1990s, the IRS came under scrutiny for the       harsh tactics it used to enforce the tax code. With tens of       billion in new funding, it is not hard to see how these       abuses could return.        A 1998 article by Washington Post noted many small business       owners were harassed by the IRS, only for the agency to find       no evidence of wrongdoing.        ``An Oklahoma tax-return preparer, a Texas oilman and a       Virginia restaurateur told lawmakers how raiding parties of       armed agents from the IRS Criminal Investigation Division       barged into their homes or offices, frightened their       employees and families--and ultimately came up empty-      handed.''        ``Two of the men said they later found that former       employees had precipitated the raids, and that the IRS had       done little or no checking on their informants' credibility.       The third witness said he never could determine why he was       targeted.''        One man described over a dozen armed IRS officials raiding       his offices, seizing business documents, and harassing       clients and employees:        ``Richard Gardner, whose company prepares 4,500 to 6,000       tax returns each year, said that one morning in 1995, he was       called out of a meeting. He found 15 IRS agents and a half-      dozen U.S. marshals in his lobby, ``all armed and wearing       those jackets that say in bright letters IRS' or U.S.       Marshal' on the back.''        ``They seized his client records, computers, personal       papers and other files, he said, and held them for two years       while the IRS investigation continued. Gardner was able to       buy new computers and continue in business, but the damage to       his business was extensive. He said IRS agents went to       clients and demanded they wear hidden microphones when       meeting with Gardner; they hauled his wife before a grand       jury; and his employees were told they would be able to buy       his business cheaply because he would be out of business       soon.''        These were not isolated cases. A 1998 article by the New       York Times described ``military style raids'' by IRS agents       against taxpayers who were accused of nonviolent behavior        The Senate Finance Committee held a series of IRS oversight       hearings in 1998. Among many witnesses to abuses carried out       by armed IRS agents, a Virginia restaurant owner testified       the following on April 29, 1998:        ``Armed agents, accompanied by drug-sniffing dogs, stormed       my restaurants during breakfast, ordered patrons out of the       restaurant, and began interrogating my employees.        The IRS impounded my records, my cash registers, and my       computers.''  [[Page H7668]]         ``When the raid occurred at my home, the front door was       torn from the hinges, my dogs were impounded, along with my       safe and 12 years of my personal income tax returns and       supporting documents.''        Giving more money, power and guns to an agency with a       terrible firearms safety record and a terrible due process       record is alarming to law-abiding Americans.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following Joint  Committee on Taxation analysis that shows that American manufacturers  are hardest hit by the Democrats' made in America tax--$200 billion-- and they will pay over half of that tax.                                      Congress of the United States,                                     Joint Committee on Taxation,                                    Washington, DC, August 11, 2022.                                 Memorandum       To: Redacted      From: Thomas A. Barthold      Subject: Revenue Estimate        This memorandum is in response to your request for an       estimate of how the burden of the corporate minimum financial       statement income tax as contained in section 10101 of an       amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 5376. ``An       Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Title II of S.       Con. Res. 14'' as passed by the Senate on August 7, 2022,       would fall across different industrial sectors.        Business income tax returns ask taxpayers to report the       industry in which they are primarily engaged, identifying the       industry by the code numbers established under the North       American Industrial Classification System (``NAICS code'').       This is self-reported and the Internal Revenue Service does       not verify the accuracy of the classification stated by the       taxpayer. The NAICS code system allows data to be aggregated       at different levels of general categorization. Two-digit       codes are the broadest categorization. For example, code 31       encompasses all manufacturing. As we project that only       approximately 150 taxpayers annually will be subject to the       proposed book minimum tax, in the accompanying table we       generally report results by two-digit reporting to protect       the privacy of the tax return data on which we base our       analysis.        We estimate the corporate minimum financial statement       income tax as contained in the amendment in the nature of a       substitute to H.R. 5376 as passed by the Senate would have       the following effect on Federal fiscal year budget receipts.

Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following  letter of opposition, which represents America's independent natural  gas and oil production industry, which says this bill will only  exacerbate--make worse--our Nation's energy crisis.                                                    August 11, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: The undersigned       trade associations, representing thousands of businesses       across the United States that collectively employ millions of       Americans, write to express our opposition to the Inflation       Reduction Act (IRA) as passed by the U.S. Senate. Further, we       write to urge you to reconsider policies within the       legislation before proceeding.        The United States has experienced its second consecutive       quarter of negative GDP growth, and American consumers are       facing record high inflation. We share the goal of addressing       climate change, as evidenced in the policies we support and       in the actions that we take every day. However, the       considerable tax increases and new government spending in the       IRA amount to the wrong policies at the wrong time.        We are also facing the most significant global energy       crisis since the 1970's, and U.S. energy security--and that       of our strategic allies abroad--is being put to the test.       Further, U.S. energy costs have increased 40 percent over the       past twelve months, creating a serious strain on American       household incomes.        With these current conditions as the backdrop for this       legislation, there are several specific policies included in       the IRA which are particularly troubling and deserve re-      consideration. We would like to draw your attention to three       such provisions:        1. The IRA imposes a new corporate minimum tax, increasing       taxes on Americans by more than $300 billion over the next 10       years. As President Obama noted in 2009, ``the last thing you       want to do is raise taxes in the middle of a recession.''        2. The IRA imposes an $11.7 billion tax on crude oil and       petroleum products. At a time of record-high energy prices,       Congress should not add additional costs on American energy       companies competing globally.        3. The IRA imposes additional constraints on the ability of       companies to develop and produce the energy that Americans       need to fuel our economy and strengthen our energy security.       This includes increased fees on domestic production and the       establishment of a new $6.3 billion natural gas tax.        Finally, the IRA fails to address permitting reform, which       is desperately needed and is essential to effectively deliver       affordable, reliable energy to consumers in a growing       economy.        To date, neither the House nor the Senate have introduced       comprehensive permitting reform legislation. We urge Congress       to quickly consider and pass permitting reform without delay.        For the above-stated reasons, we express our opposition to       the IRA and request that you reconsider passage of this       legislation.            Sincerely,        American Petroleum Institute; American Exploration and       Production Council; American Fuel & Petrochemical       Manufacturers; Independent Petroleum Association of America;       Energy Workforce & Technology Council; Plumbing-Heating-      Cooling Contractors--National Association; Manufacture       Alabama; The Coalbed Methane Association of Alabama; Arkansas       Independent Producers and Royalty Owners; Arkansas Oil       Marketers Association; California Independent Petroleum       Association; Colorado Oil and Gas Association; West Slope       Colorado Oil & Gas Association; Colorado Wyoming Petroleum       Marketers Association; Associated Industries of Florida;       Florida Independent Petroleum Producers Association; Florida       Natural Gas Association; Florida Petroleum Marketers       Association; Florida Propane Gas Association; Florida State       Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time Chairman Neal  and I have remaining.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record this Penn Wharton  School of Business analysis that debunks the Inflation Reduction Act,  showing how this bill will reduce inflation by less than a tenth of 1  percent in the first 5 years, with zero impact on inflation after that.                            [From Penn Wharton]     Senate-Passed Inflation Reduction Act: Estimates of Budgetary and                           Macroeconomic Effects                                  key points         PWBM estimates that the Senate-Passed Inflation Reduction       Act, as written, would reduce cumulative deficits by $264       billion over the 10-year budget window.        The Act would have no meaningful effect on inflation in the       near term but would reduce inflation by around 0.1 percentage       points by the middle of the first decade. These point       estimates, however, are not statistically different from       zero, indicating a low level of confidence that the       legislation would have any measurable impact on inflation.        Relative to current law, the Act would slightly reduce GDP       in the first decade while slightly increasing GDP by 2050.       These estimates include the impact of debt reduction, carbon       reduction, and tax incentives on investments and working       hours.        Most, but not all, of the tax increases fall on higher       income households. However, future generations, including       higher-income households, gain from the improved economy,       including a reduction in carbon emissions.                                 introduction         On Sunday August 7th, the U.S. Senate passed the Inflation       Reduction Act of 2022 under FY2022 budget reconciliation       instructions. PWBM recently analyzed a previous version of       the bill. We also compared our analysis against that of the       Joint Tax Committee and Congressional Budget Office who use       an older economics baseline from July 2021.        In this brief, PWBM analyzes the budgetary, macroeconomic,       and distributional effects of the final Senate passed       version. In line with the previously released version of the       bill, the Act provides for new spending and tax incentives       related to the adoption of clean energy technology, both at       the industrial and consumer level. It extends a temporary       expansion of Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance       subsidies for an additional two years. To offset these       deficit-increasing initiatives, the bill imposes new taxes on       certain businesses, reduces government outlays on       prescription drugs through pricing reforms. It also provides       for new IRS funding which PWBM estimates would increase       revenue collections above new outlays.            provision descriptions and estimated budgetary effects         The final version of the Act makes several key amendments       to the version we previously analyzed. First, the new       corporate minimum tax no longer restricts the tax benefit of       accelerated depreciation, and private equity firms are       exempted from the tax. Second, the carried interest provision       was removed. Third, new revenue raising provisions (a tax on       stock buybacks and a restriction on pass-through loss       deductions) were added. Fourth, due to Senate rules, drug       price inflation caps for private insurance plans were       removed.        More specifically, the Act proposes the following policy       changes:        Extension of expanded ACA subsidies. Extends the temporary       expansion of Premium Tax Credits through 2025. The expansion,       which offers eligibility to households above 400 percent of       the poverty line, is scheduled to expire at the end of 2022       under current law.        Climate and energy provisions. Includes tax rebates and       credits to lower energy costs for households; tax credits,       research, loans, and grants to increase domestic       manufacturing capacity for wind turbines, solar panels,       batteries, and other essential components of clean energy       production and storage; tax credits to reduce carbon       emissions; programs to reduce the environmental impact of       agriculture; a new fee on methane emissions; and more.        Minimum tax on corporations' book income. Creates a new 15       percent corporate alternative minimum tax based on the       financial statement income of corporations with at least $1       billion in such income. Allows for bonus and accelerated       depreciation deductions when calculating taxable book income.        Tax on share repurchases. Imposes a new 1 percent tax on       corporations' net repurchase of stock.        Extension of excess noncorporate losses limitation. Extends       the limitation on the deduction of pass-through losses       through tax year 2028, which under current law is scheduled       to expire at the end of 2026. The maximum deductible loss,       which is indexed to inflation, is $540,000 for married       taxpayers in 2022.        Prescription drug price reforms. Allows Medicare to       negotiate the price of certain prescription drugs; limits the       price growth of certain drugs paid covered under Medicare to       inflation; repeals the implementation of a ``rebate rule''       scheduled to increase drug-related Medicare outlays beginning       in 2027; redesigns Medicare Part D benefit formula and caps       out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries.        IRS funding. Appropriates approximately $80 billion over       the next decade for IRS enforcement activities including the       hiring and training of new auditors, IT systems       modernization, and taxpayer services.        Table 1 presents PWBM's estimate of conventional budgetary       effects over the 10-year budget window defined in the FY2022       reconciliation instructions. We estimate the Act would reduce       cumulative noninterest deficits by $264 billion from FY2022       through FY2031.                        estimated effects on inflation         We estimate that the Inflation Reduction Act as passed by       the Senate would have a very modest impact on inflation over       the next decade. The Act produces some upward pressure on       prices in 2023 and 2024, but its effects are too small to       meaningfully affect measured the Personal Consumption       Expenditures (PCE) inflation rate as reported by the Bureau       of Economic Analysis. The Act would reduce annual inflation       by around 0.1 percentage points in about five years, once       major deficit-reducing provisions of the legislation are       fully implemented, but the Act would have no measurable       impact on inflation after 2028. All these point estimates are       not statistically different from zero, indicating a low level       of confidence that the legislation would have a measurable       impact on inflation.                         other macroeconomic effects         Government spending rises because of the climate-related       spending and the extension of the ACA subsidies are greater       than the savings from prescription drug pricing reforms.       However, additional tax revenues are greater than the       spending increases, which leads to a decrease in government       debt. Government debt goes down by 4.1 percent in 2040 and 8       percent in 2050, which crowds-in investment in productive       private capital.        The provisions which increase taxes on business activity       lower the after-tax return to investment, which offsets the       positive effects on investment from lower government debt.       Net of these two effects, private productive capital declines       by 0.2 percent in 2031, is unchanged in 2040 and increases by       0.3 percent in 2050. The drop in productive capital in 2031       leads to a 0.1 percent decline in GDP.        Nonetheless, as government debt declines, private capital       increases by 0.3 percent by 2050, and workers become more       productive. Higher worker productivity is reflected in wages       that increase by 0.1 percent in the same year. Moreover, the       increase in private capital combined with the accumulated       productivity increases from the climate and energy effects,       described in a previous brief, leads to an increase in GDP,       which grows 0.1 percent in 2050.              distributional tax effects: conventional estimates         The Inflation Reduction Act contains a wide array of       subsidies, taxes, and pricing reforms, each with varying       impacts on households and businesses. For example, some large       businesses would face higher tax bills; individuals buying       certain health insurance plans would face lower out-of-pocket       costs; some households who evade taxes would be made to pay;       and pharmaceutical companies would earn lower revenues.       Though not responsible for remitting taxes assessed on       business activity, households bear some of the economic       burden of such taxes. Shareholders receive lower after-tax  returns, and workers earn lower wages with fewer productivity-enhancing  investments.         Distributional analysis traditionally focuses on the       effects of revenue-raising tax provisions since attempting to       allocate all spending--including for roads, education,       national defense, some transfer programs, and the bill       inherited by future payers for current deficits--is       challenging and subjective. Put differently, distributional       analysis typically is not intended to be a holistic       incidence. Instead, distributional analysis attempts to       estimate answers the narrower question: for a given set of       spending benefits  [[Page H7671]]       and change in debt, who finances the costs under the       explicitly stated revenue provisions in the bill? In the case       of this Act, the revenue is raised from the corporate minimum       tax as well as the tax on share repurchases.        Conventional distributional analysis measures the long-run       incidence of tax increases imposed at a single point in time.       PWBM assumes that 75 percent of corporate income taxes are       borne by owners of capital with the remainder borne by       labor--magnitudes consistent with empirical research and       scorekeeping convention. We apply this incidence assumption       when analyzing the corporate minimum tax provision. However,       for the stock buyback tax, we assume that shareholders bear       100 percent of the burden because it is assessed on a       discretionary balance sheet transaction rather than on income       from economic production.        We find that all income groups would bear some of the       additional burden of the 2023 revenue-raising business tax       changes. Average burden ranges from $5 for the lowest       quintile, to $55 for the middle quintile, to $61,520 for the       top 0.1 percent of tax units. At lower incomes, the tax       incidence largely reflects lower wages over time relative to       baseline, whereas at high income the tax incidence mostly       reflects more immediate changes in the value of financial       assets.                  distributional effects: dynamic estimates         PWBM's dynamic distribution metric shows how benefits and       costs accrue across generations when accounting for       macroeconomic effects, including the increase in productivity       from lowering carbon emissions relative to baseline. While       this analysis is less granular than conventional       distributional analysis, the dynamic ``equivalent variation''       measure captures important dynamics like lifetime income       trajectories, the ``insurance value'' of means-tested       benefits and changes in wages and returns to capital       investments.        Table 4 reports the equivalent variation for households at       different ages (relative to the year 2022) and incomes. Each       value shown in Table 1 corresponds to the one-time benefit       that the corresponding household receives from the       legislation. For example, the value of -$700 for a household       age 40 in the bottom income quintile indicates that this       household is worse off by $700 under this legislation,       including at age 40 and the remainder of his or her lifetime.       Put differently, this household is indifferent between the       adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act and making a one-time       payment of $700 that avoids the adoption of the Act. However,       a household in the bottom quintile who is born in 20 years       (-20 age in 2022) would be $1,900 better off.        Notice two main effects that vary by both income and       generation:        First, current workers and retirees prefer current law over       the provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. People alive       today bear the burden of business tax increases in the form       of lower investment returns and lower wages in the near term.       However, future generations gain from the adoption of the       Act, including positive gains to capital formation from       reducing the debt as well as the increase in total factor       productivity from reducing carbon emissions relative to       baseline.        Second, current higher-income households bear a       substantially larger share of the tax burden while future       higher-income households also gain the most from the improved       economy. In the long run, the Inflation Reduction Act leads       to lower government debt, higher wages, higher total factor       productivity and higher GDP. Although older workers and       retirees prefer current law, this growth leads to significant       gains for younger households in all income brackets. As lower       government debt crowds in additional productive private       capital, wages increase. In addition, these younger workers       begin to benefit from the accumulating productivity benefits       from climate investments. Therefore, workers in the future       will receive higher wages and income, which is reflected in       larger equivalent variations for younger cohorts of workers.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Madam Speaker, I would note that every Democrat in  Congress, in the House and Senate, strongly opposed providing  prescription drugs for seniors in Medicare part D, and then-Leader  Pelosi at the time said, it would end Medicare as we know it to help  seniors with these lifesaving medicines.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following study from the  University of Chicago which shows the Democrats' drug pricing scheme  and controls could kill up to 342 cures, many of them lifesaving cures,  in the next two decades alone.                  [From University of Chicago, Sept. 2021]  The Evidence Base on the Impact of Price Controls on Medical Innovation                   (By Tomas J. Philipson and Troy Durie)                              Executive Summary         This issue brief reviews the evidence on the impact of       price controls on biopharmaceutical innovation and calibrates       what this evidence implies for recent price control proposals       in the US. A large academic literature estimates the effect       of future drug revenues on R&D spending with a mid-range       effect of a 1 percent reduction in revenue leading to a 1.5       percent reduction in R&D activity. Using the range of such       effects found in the literature we find the proposed price       controls of US bill HR3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, would       lead to a 29 to 60 percent reduction in R&D from 2021 to 2039       which translates into 167 to 342 fewer new drug approvals  [[Page H7672]]       during that period. The mid-range effect of the evidence       implies a 44.6 percent decline in R&D and 254 fewer new drug       approvals. As a benchmark on the large size of the adverse       health effects this implies, we conservatively find the loss       in life from the price controls the next 10 years is 20 times       larger than the loss from COVID-19 to date in the US. We       argue this is a conservatively low estimate of the impact of       such proposals even though it is as much as a ten times       larger reduction in new drugs compared to a recent CBO       analysis.                           Section 1: Introduction         A national debate has emerged again about the effect of       price controls on pharmaceutical innovation. Many proponents       of price controls for pharmaceutical drugs argue that they do       not impact innovation while opponents argue they will lead to       fewer new drugs. This issue brief attempts to provide insight       into the likely effects of recent price control proposals by       analyzing how the debate can be informed by basic economics       and the prevailing empirical evidence.        While the United States has less stringent price       regulations when compared to other nations, the Biden       Administration has recently announced plans to lower drug       prices through policies similar to those outlined in a recent       bill referred to as the Lower Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3)       that passed the House of Representatives in December 2019 and       was reintroduced in April 2021. This proposal would create       price controls for the government's highest expenditure drugs       and then apply price controls to firms conducting private       sector transactions. This issue brief reviews the evidence on       how sensitive innovation is to changes in revenues and       applies the evidence to estimate the effect of proposed price       controls.          Section 2: Evidence Base on Revenue Effects on Innovation         Biopharmaceutical companies routinely project future market       size and profits for their products to determine the rate of       return on investment (ROI) from R&D. A large body of evidence       suggests that these market practices translate into a       predictable positive relationship between realized revenues       and R&D spending in the economy in general and for biomedical       innovation in particular.        A rich academic literature quantifies this relationship       between future revenues and pharmaceutical innovation. For       assessing evidence related to revenue effects on R&D, it is       important to recognize that global profits drive innovation       and that revenues from different countries have different       effects on those global profits because of different profit       margins across countries. Expected earnings, not revenues,       drive R&D investments. Therefore, decreases in US revenue       will have larger effects on global profits than revenue       losses in price controlled markets in Europe due to higher       profit margins in the US. Goldman and Lakdawalla (2018) find       that pharmaceutical profits in the United States accounts for       64 to 78 percent of global profits, similar to an estimate       from the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) (2018).       Consequently, the evidence finds that studies focusing on US       revenue losses show larger R&D effects than those studying       revenue losses in Europe.        In particular, a set of papers looks at the expansion of       the Medicare prescription drug benefit, Medicare Part D,       which provides the most relevant evidence for assessing the       revenue effects of Medicare policy changes. They find that       companies recognized this expansion and increased innovation       in drugs treating diseases prevalent in the elderly       population more so than innovation in non-elderly diseases       (Blume-Kohout and Sood 2013). Quantifying that relationship,       a 1 percent increase in market size due to Medicare Part D       leads to a 2.8 percent increase in new drug approvals.       Another often cited paper finds a 1 percent increase in       potential market size leads to a 4-6 percent increase in the       entry of new drugs (Acemoglu and Linn 2004) in the US. Though       other studies have found lower effects in Europe of the       relationship between potential market size and the number of       new treatments, a clear strong positive relationship exists       (Dubois et al. 2015). Other studies show that a 1 percent       increase in price leads to a 0.22-1.33 percent increase in       innovation. Another extensive literature illustrates how       companies change their investments in lower quality drugs due       to price controls and other regulations that decrease how       much can be charged for high-quality drugs.        We synthesized the evidence base by computing the average       R&D elasticity with respect to revenue estimated from 10       different studies looking at the effect of a price change,       expected market, and overall revenue on R&D. Table 1       illustrates the elasticities used from each paper, and the       average elasticity across these 10 studies is 1.54.        Note: Acemoglu and Linn (2004) find an elasticity range of       4-6 based on if all approved including generics are included       or not. We take the midpoint of this range. Abbott and Vernon       (2005) find a price cut of 40 to 50 percent lowers R&D by 30       to 60 percent. Taking the midpoint of these numbers gives a       45 percent price cut leads to a 45 percent decrease in R&D,       or an elasticity of 1.        To assess the impact on the number of new drugs from       reductions in R&D spending, a common approach is to divide       the reduction in R&D spending by an estimate of the costs of       bringing a drug to market. This is a useful approach and       implies a proportional reduction in new drugs to the       reduction in R&D spending regardless of the particular cost       per drug. In other words, using this methodology, a 10       percent reduction in R&D spending leads to 10 percent fewer       drugs regardless of the cost per drug estimate used. The       elasticity of R&D spending with respect to revenue in this       case therefore also represents the elasticity of new drugs to       revenue.        Despite the evidence, there is some debate among law makers       concerning whether revenue or price controls affect       innovation at all. However, the evidence is consistent with       common market practices of biopharmaceutical innovation--a       positive relationship between investment and earnings. Such       market practices include the use of net present value (NPV)       calculations to determine a new drug's ROI. Biopharmaceutical       companies determine the demand for new drug therapies by       analyzing the prevalence of disease, insurance coverage of       the population affected by the disease, and reimbursement by       payers managing patients' care. The pharmaceutical industry       spent more than $91 billion on R&D in 2020. In obtaining such       R&D funding, companies have relied on venture capital       funding, licensing agreements, or mergers and acquisitions as       well as their own revenue. All rely on ROI assessments to       evaluate R&D investments. Indeed, markets routinely assess       the enterprise value of firms by estimating the present value       of expected cash flows across all business lines and       projects.   section 3: Calibration of the Impact on Innovation of Proposed US Price                                  Controls         This section evaluates what the evidence implies for the       innovation effects of proposed US price controls. We       calibrate that the price controls implemented in the United       States would lead to a 29.2 to 60.0 percent reduction in R&D       from 2021 to 2039. This equates to $952.2 billion to $2.0       trillion in lost R&D spending and 167 to 342 fewer new drug       approvals during this period. This means annual new drug       approvals will be 11.7 to 24.0 percent lower per year from       2021 to 2029 and 45.0 to 92.4 percent lower from 2030 to       2039. We discuss how these findings, as well as findings from       other studies, differ from CBO (2019), which finds only 37       fewer new drug approvals over this time period, which is       550.2 to 1,024 percent lower than our estimates. Our       estimates are conservative as the entire evidence base is       considered and not only the evidence base for the more R&D       sensitive US market.        It should be noted, however, that making comparisons to CBO       estimates is made more difficult due to the highly non-      transparent discussion of their underlying analysis, which       makes third-party replication of their results impossible.       This ``black-box'' nature of analysis is often the case with       government reports and raises larger issues with the       difficulty for private parties and taxpayers--who funded the       analysis--being able to assess their accuracy. In contrast,       we believe the presentation of the evidence discussed above,       and the innovation effects they directly imply, is highly       transparent as it simply documents the findings of the       studies and their implied effects.      3.1 The Proposed US Price Controls        The United States has fewer restrictions on price than       other countries, but the Biden Administration has announced       their goal to lower drug prices through greater price       regulation, as set forth in a recent bill referred to as H.R.       3. This proposal would change the way certain single-source       brand drugs are priced for Medicare beneficiaries by       requiring drug manufacturers to ``negotiate'' drug prices       with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. A       prohibitive excise tax of 65 to 95 percent will be applied to       a company's annual gross sales if they refuse to negotiate,       making the requirement largely equivalent to mandatory price       controls. Drug prices set by the Secretary may not exceed the       prices in specified countries by more than 20 percent and       price increases would be capped at the rate of inflation (CBO       2021).        In addition, these price controls would also be extended to       private transactions by employer-based plans as stated on       August 12, 2021 by President Biden and as implied by the       proposed legislation. Private payers can choose the lower       prices negotiated by the government, which they presumably       will.      3.2 CBO's Estimated Effects and Alternative Estimated Effects           of the Proposed Price Controls        CBO (2019) previously estimated that a drop in future       revenues due to H.R. 3 would lead to 8 fewer drugs from 2020       to 2029, which would then expand to 30 fewer drugs from 2030       to 2039). In August 2021, CBO (2021b) updated its estimated       impact of price negotiations to be 2 fewer drugs in the first       decade (0.5 percent), 23 fewer in the second decade (5       percent), and 34 fewer drugs in the third decade (8 percent).       Since the development process takes about a decade, the long       run effects of the bill will be larger than its short-run       effects. To align these estimates with our time period of       2021-2039, we lower their estimate to 7 fewer drugs from 2021       to 2029 and keep the estimate of 30 fewer drugs from 2030 to       2039.        Consistent with our analysis, other analysts' assessments       of CBO's 2019 analysis of H.R. 3 conclude that CBO (2019)       likely underestimates the impact of H.R. 3. Charles River       Associates (2021) finds the CBO study underestimates the       company revenue impact by assuming companies will be able to       set their price at the high end of the allowed price  [[Page H7673]]       range, and that companies will be able to increase their non-      U.S. price. Both assumptions may not be true due to       uncertainty around behavioral responses in negotiations.       Further, for the loss-of-revenue impact on R&D, CBO       extrapolates price control effects from smaller markets, and       they do not account for the larger impact on targeted disease       groups most impacted by the policy like rare diseases and       oncology. CBO's analysis relies on Dubois et al. (2015) to       estimate the effect of H.R. 3 on R&D, but CRA notes that this       estimated effect is smaller than most of the other       literature, too dependent on specific assumptions, and may       not be as relevant to a policy of H.R. 3's magnitude.        Other analysts' estimates of the impact of the price       controls introduced in H.R. 3 show a considerably larger       impact on global revenues and R&D than assumed by CBO.       Stengel et al. (2020) estimate drug manufacturer revenues       would fall 34 to 44 percent, which would equate to about $1.3       to $1.7 trillion in total lost global revenues from 2020-      2029. Vital Transformation (2021) estimates annual earnings       would fall 56 percent, or on average $102 billion a year,       starting in the year 2024. This fall in earnings when fitted       to past data would have lowered new approved drug therapies       in their sample from 68 new drugs to 7 new drugs, an 89.7       percent decline from 2010 to 2019.      3.3 Effects of the Proposed Price Controls Implied by the           Evidence Base        In light of the reported shortcomings in the CBO (2019)       report, we used the broader evidence base discussed in this       issue brief to assess the effect H.R. 3's proposed price       controls would have on innovation. We create a range of the       estimated drop in global drug manufacturer revenues by taking       the CBO's lower estimate of 19 percent and the midpoint       revenue effect of alternative studies, 39 percent, from       Stengel et al. (2020).        As discussed earlier, a conservatively low estimate of the       elasticity of revenue on either R&D or the introduction of       new drugs is 1.5 based on current evidence. We apply this       elasticity to the 19 to 39 percent decline in revenues to       derive a percentage reduction in R&D. This percentage       reduction is thereafter used to calibrate the reduction in       absolute R&D spending or number of approved drugs which is       applied to the CBO baseline trend in absolute values. In       other words, the reduction in R&D spending and the number of       new drug approvals during 2021 to 2039 is obtained by       determining how much would be lost in each of those measures       with the number of approved drugs being compared to CBOs       baseline trends given the percent reduction in R&D. We create       our own trend for R&D spending by taking a time series from       PhRMA's 2021 Membership Survey showing pharmaceutical R&D       spending from 2000-2019 and calculated the compound annual       growth rate to get a trend for expected R&D spending through       2039. We then applied the impact on R&D to each year and       summed these values to get a total. For new drug approvals,       we use the 30 new drug approvals baseline from CBO (2019) and       applied the impact on R&D for each year and summed.        Table 2 illustrates our main findings. Using the average       elasticity on the 19 to 39 percent drop in global revenues,       innovation through R&D is expected to drop 29 to 60 percent.       Using the middle of our range, this would equate to lost R&D       spending of up to $1.5 trillion. We find that this drop in       spending will lead to 167 to 342 fewer new drug approvals.        Our estimates are therefore 550.2 percent to 1024.0 percent       larger than CBO (2019)'s estimated 37 fewer new drug       approvals, adjusted to our time period. CBO (2019) points out       that lower R&D spending will take time to be reflected in new       drug approvals due to the long development process, so the       reduction in revenue results in 7 fewer new drug approval,       18.9 percent of their total estimate, in the first 9 years       and 30 more in the following decade, 81.l percent of their       total estimate. We assume this breakdown as well, so new drug       approvals will fall by 32 to 65 approvals from 2021 to 2029       and 135 to 277 approvals from 2030 to 2039. These significant       drops in new drug approvals will lead to delays in needed       drug therapies, resulting in worse health outcomes for       patients.        The failure to discover and get new drug approvals leads to       worse health outcomes. CEA (2019) did an early analysis of       H.R. 3 finding 375 million to 100 million life years lost due       to this policy's impact on R&D spending through 2029. For       comparison, using death data through September 22, 2021,       SARS-CoV-2 has directly reduced health outcomes by 7.5       million life years. The 7.5 million life years lost is only       just over 10 percent as large as the midpoint of CEA (2019)'s       estimate due to H.R. 3. We calculate this loss in life years       by applying life expectancy estimates conditional on age from       CDC to the age distribution of deaths from SARS-CoV-2 from       CDC updated through September 22, 2021. Then we multiply the       life expectancy at each age grouping by the number of deaths       and sum to get 7.5 million life years lost. A prior study       shows how every $2,000 spent on pharmaceutical research and       development increases population health by one statistical       life-year (Lichtenberg 2002). When applied to our R&D       spending estimates, this would lead to 159.3 million to 326.9       million life years lost by 2029 which increases to 476.1       million to 977.2 million by 2039. This amounts to the direct       negative health effects of SARS-CoV-2 to be only 3.1 percent       as large as our midpoint estimate by 2029 and 1.0 percent as       large by 2039. Price controls have significant health costs       to the U.S. population.        Our analysis likely underestimates true innovation effects,       which, if considered fully could make our findings even       further away from the CBO estimates. This is because the       average R&D elasticity of 1.5 used included studies of non-      U.S. markets with lower earnings effects than U.S. markets.       Given that the U.S. has higher margins, price controls are       expected to have a larger impact on earnings. Thus, only       using the larger estimated elasticities from U.S. markets,       which would double the elasticity of 1.5, would yield       proportionally larger differences between the evidence base       and the CBO estimates.

Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following  editorial from The Wall Street Journal, which shows this bill will only  reduce global temperatures by, at best, 0.028 degrees Fahrenheit  throughout this century and as little as 0.0009 degrees over the entire  century.                       [From The Wall Street Journal]                        Tilting at Climate Windmills         Nearly all of Washington--Democrats, the press, lobbyists--      is taking a victory lap with Senate passage of the Schumer-      Manchin tax, climate and drug price control bill. The climate       lobby is especially thrilled, claiming a historic victory       that will reduce temperatures, hold back the rising sea, and       save the planet.        Or, maybe not. Our contributor Bjorn Lomborg looked at the       Rhodium Group estimate for CO2 emissions reductions from       Schumer-Manchin policies. He then plugged them into the       United Nations climate model to measure the impact on global       temperature by 2100. He finds the bill will reduce the       estimated global temperature rise at the end of this century       by all of 0.028 degrees Fahrenheit in the optimistic case. In       the pessimistic case, the temperature difference will be       0.0009 degrees Fahrenheit.        In other words, the climate provisions in this ballyhooed       legislation will have no notable impact on the climate.        This isn't surprising. No matter what the U.S. does to       reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, it will be dwarfed by what       the rest of the world does. China, India and Africa aren't       about to stop burning fossil fuels as they develop, and China       is sprinting ahead to build huge new coal capacity despite       its pledge to start reducing emissions after 2030.        Barring a breakthrough in battery or other technology,       carbon emissions will continue to increase. No one knows how       much the Earth's temperature will warm, though even the U.N.       model has modified its estimates from the apocalyptic       predictions of some years ago.        Schumer-Manchin won't reduce inflation, won't reduce the       budget deficit, and it won't reduce the world's temperature.       What it will do is transfer some $369 billion from taxpayers       and drug companies to the pockets of green energy businesses       and investors. It will tighten the hold that politicians have       on the allocation of capital, as they pick winners and losers       with their grants and tax credits. Everyone will get a nice       warm feeling as they pretend they are cooling the climate.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following  article by Americans for Tax Reform, which debunks the Inflation  Reduction Act by describing the top five budget gimmicks in this bill,  showing over $330 billion in fake savings, more than the so-called  deficit reduction in the bill.                5 Gimmicks in Democrats' Reconciliation Bill         Democrats' reconciliation bill, improperly named the       ``Inflation Reduction Act,'' contains numerous gimmicks       designed to deceive voters and circumvent congressional       rules.        This bill uses several budget gimmicks: a short extension       of Obamacare subsidies, a repeal of the ``rebate rule'' that       never has nor never will go into effect, and supersizing the       Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to ``solve'' an overstated tax       gap, This bill attempts to circumvent the Byrd rule by       erroneously calling a mandate ``a tax.'' The bill would also       violate President Biden's tax pledge to not raise taxes on       anyone making less than $400,000 a year.    1. The Obamacare subsidies in this bill are only extended until 2025,           despite expectations that they will be extended again.         In the American Rescue Plan (ARP), President Biden and       congressional Democrats expanded Obamacare subsidies--      specifically the advanced refundable premium tax credit--by       increasing benefits for households at every income level and       expanding them to households earning more than 400 percent of       the federal poverty level. Because these enhanced benefits       are set to expire later this year, Democrats are attempting       to extend them through 2025 in this legislation.        Once these expanded subsidies have been in place for five       years total, it will be extremely difficult to get rid of       them. Given the high likelihood--and expectation--that these       subsidies will be extended once they're set to expire again,       the three-year extension is a clear gimmick.        If the expanded subsidies were extended indefinitely, the       10-year budget deficit reduction falls from $248 billion to       $89 billion, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model.    2. The bill repeals the ``rebate rule,'' despite the fact that it was                          never going into effect.         Under the Trump administration, the HHS released the rebate       rule which sought to lower drug prices by altering payments       from drugmakers to pharmacy benefit managers. The Trump       administration never went through with this rule nor has the       Biden administration taken it back up again (to be clear,       they never will).        Even so, Democrats claim the repeal would reduce the       deficit by $120 billion. Clearly, it would not.        Already, between the likely extension of Obamacare       subsidies and this rebate rule, the bill doesn't actually       reduce the deficit at all.      3. The IRS would be supersized to solve an overstated ``tax gap.''         The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that $80 billion       in additional funding to the IRS would increase tax revenue       by $125 billion. While increasing tax enforcement would       certainly raise more money from unsuspecting small       businesses, the Left has assumed that this can and will be       done through increased enforcement on the wealthy.        In reality, wealthy individuals and large corporations are       almost always tax compliant. The wealthy and large       corporations already have armies of lawyers and accountants       that ensure they legally take advantage of the plethora of       credits and deductions offered by the tax code. Further, the       IRS already audits the largest corporations at high rates. It       doesn't matter how much more the agency receives in funding--      they will not find violations in the law that do not exist.        Thus, the IRS won't find much more revenue from their big       targets.        Additional funding will instead be used for invasive, time-      consuming, and non-fruitful audits of middle-class Americans       and small businesses. The IRS previously announced a goal to       increase small business audits by 50 percent.        As previously reported by CNBC, experts say a fattened-up       IRS would go after small businesses that necessarily depend       on cash transactions.        4. The bill implements price controls through a 95 percent tax,         The bill would give the Health and Human Services Secretary       the authority to ``negotiate'' the price of prescription       drugs on behalf of Medicare. By ``negotiation,'' Democrats       mean drug manufacturers will pay a 95 percent excise tax on       prescription drug profits unless they accept price controls       set by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In       2023, the Secretary would be able to determine the prices of       10 prescription drugs. The determined price would go into       effect in 2026. The number of drugs the HHS Secretary could       set prices for would then increase to 15 in 2028 and 20 in       2029.        That tax itself is forecasted to raise zero revenue.       Neither the JCT analysis nor any independent analyses       estimate that any company would pay this exorbitant tax. A 95       percent ``tax'' on revenue is just a stick to enforce a       mandate for government price controls. This is a way to       circumvent the Byrd rule, which requires that all the       provisions in a reconciliation bill directly change federal       spending or revenue. While a tax is obviously protected under       this rule, it's not clear that mandates of this kind are.      5. The reconciliation bill raises taxes on those making less than             $400,000, violating President Biden's tax pledge.         Throughout the ten-year window, the JCT estimates that       nearly every single income group will see their taxes raised.       Those Americans making less than $200,000 will see their       taxes raised by nearly $17 billion. For those making between       $200,000 and $500,000 (as the JCT doesn't cut off brackets at       $400,000), their taxes would increase by another $14 billion.        Senate Finance Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) rightly       points out that at least half of all new tax revenue raised       by this bill would come from those earning under $400,000.        Clearly, this tax hike violates President Biden's pledge       not to raise one penny of taxes on any American earning less       than $400,000 per year.        If Biden and Harris want to keep their pledge, they must       veto the bill or instruct Democrats to change the bill.     I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Fleischmann).                                time  1415     Madam Speaker, I include the following polling reality  study in the Record, which shows that once Americans learn the details  of the so-called Medicare negotiation, which is price setting, that  their choices and access to lifesaving cures will be limited, public  support for negotiation plummets.       Analysis: Americans Don't Support Surrendering Innovation for                       Democrats' Drug Price Controls         Democrats are selling their socialist drug pricing scheme       as a way to lower prices, but Americans oppose it once they       learn that this kills cures and life-improving treatments.        What they aren't telling you is this: Their drug price       control scheme will kill innovation, mean fewer new       treatments and cures, and a loss of jobs in the biopharma       industry.        Once Americans learn about these consequences they reject       it outright. Furthermore, this isn't a ``negotiation''--      Democrats' proposal has Washington dictate prices under       threat of exorbitantly higher taxes on medical innovators.                                Key Takeaways:       The vast majority of Americans oppose government negotiation           if it results in fewer new medicines being developed in           the future        A 50-state Morning Consult/PhRMA poll shows two thirds of       Americans oppose price controls if they put the government in  [[Page H7676]]       charge and take away power from doctors to prescribe       medicines that best meet the needs of patients.        The Kaiser Family Foundation also finds that Democrats'       price control scheme drops in popularity the moment       respondents see that it could lead to less research and       development of new drugs or limit access to newer       prescription drugs.        A March 2022 Ipsos/PhRMA poll reveals only 14 percent of       Americans support Washington price controls if they limit       their access to newer prescription medicines. Even if it       ``only'' delays access, only 15 percent support the proposal       then.        The same poll shows that seniors are even more skeptical--      10 percent support the price controls when they learn of how       it delays people's access to new medicines.      Numerous studies show the proposal would kill new treatments,           including a University of Chicago study that shows the           number going up to 342        Democrats' price-fixing scheme would kill up to 342 cures,       according to a study by the University of Chicago, yet they       claim it's merely a ``negotiating'' approach that would lower       the price of drugs.        A new study from Vital Transformation finds that if drug       price controls under consideration in the Senate had been       enacted during the last decade, only six of 110 currently       approved therapies would have made it to patients.        Loss of innovation = a death sentence for patients. Looking       at CMS drug utilization data from 2016 to 2020 of the types       of drugs expected to be most impacted by Democrats' price       fixing, even the most conservative estimates of innovation       lost from these policies could have left over 42 million       patients without the medicine they needed.        Surrendering in the fight against cancer: The Council of       State Bio Associations writes that socialist drug price       controls will get in the way of the fight against cancer:       ``In oncology alone, the University of Chicago found that       price controls would reduce overall annual cancer R&D       spending by about $18.1 billion, or 31.8 percent.''        They continue: ``The specter of government price setting       threatens to undermine a sector that has created over 1.8       million jobs across all 50 states and that represents a large       portion of our nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)--      generating an economic output of approximately $2.6 trillion       annually.''        Limiting patients' access to low-cost medicines: Back in       March, medical innovators wrote to Congress that ``The       untested approach in the House-passed Build Back Better Act       (H.R. 5376) does not address these challenges and could in       fact harm future savings from generic and biosimilar       medicines. The Build Back Better Act's approach to direct       negotiations in Medicare and inflation-based penalties, as       passed by the House, would alter the incentive for generic       and biosimilar manufacturers to develop new medicines [. . .]       and is misguided and would limit patients' access to low-cost       medicines.''      The Bipartisan Solution That Works: The Lower Costs, More           Cures Act (H.R. 19) lowers costs for all prescription           drugs        Every provision in H.R. 19 is bipartisan. It will lower       health care costs and ensure America leads in health care       innovation for more cures and treatments.        It gives patients more drug price transparency and ensures       public disclosure of drug costs and discounts.        It increases low-cost options by bringing more generic and       biosimilar competition to the marketplace fast.        It caps seniors' out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $50 per       month.        It allows high deductible health insurance plans to cover       insulin before the deductible kicks in.        A new large-scale survey of 20,000 Americans covering all       50 states and 435 Congressional districts shows a majority of       Americans find health care coverage costs unreasonable and a       priority health care issue for policymakers to address today.       The survey also shows that a majority of voters in every       state and district oppose Medicare ``negotiation'' once they       learn the policy could harm access and innovation.        Here are the key findings from the survey:        A majority of Americans in every state and the District of       Columbia oppose government ``negotiation'' as a way to       address health care costs if it could:        Take away power from doctors to prescribe the medicines       that best meet the needs of their patients, and instead put       the government in charge of those decisions--on average 66%       oppose.        Limit people's access to newer prescription drugs--on       average 64% oppose.        Reduce access to medicines for seniors and people with       disabilities--on average 62% oppose.        Americans concerned with rising health care costs believe       Congress should prioritize reducing the overall cost of       coverage:        30% of Americans, on average, are concerned with out-of-      pocket costs not covered by insurance and 29% are concerned       with the cost of health insurance premiums.        66% of Americans, on average, believe Congress should focus       on reducing the overall cost of health care coverage, (23% of       Americans want them to focus on prescription drug costs, and       13% don't know enough to say).        66% of Americans from all states and Congressional       districts, on average, find their out-of-pocket health care       costs ``unreasonable.''        Americans are clear in their opposition to so-called       Medicare ``negotiation'' policies. They want Congress to       focus on patient-centered solutions that address the real       health care issues they face, like rising out-of-pocket costs       and health insurance premiums, while preserving access,       innovation and choice.

Madam Speaker, on behalf of many diabetes patients, I  include the following article in the Record, which includes a quote  from my fellow Texan, Representative Lloyd Doggett, where he accurately  states that the insulin caps policy included in this bill ``does not  lower the price of insulin by one penny,'' but, rather, shifts costs to  others.   Insulin Copay Cap Passes House Hurdle, But Senate Looks for a Broader                                    Bill                           (By Michael McAuliff)         The chances of passing election-year legislation to help       people afford insulin--which weeks ago seemed mired in       political fighting--are looking brighter as a bipartisan       effort to tackle the issue takes root in the Senate.        That effort is still in the early stages, but it is moving       forward with the support of Senate Majority Leader Chuck       Schumer, who tapped Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Jeanne       Shaheen (D-N.H.) to craft a compromise that members of both       parties could accept. Adding pressure to the Senate's efforts       was a vote by the House on March 31 to pass a different bill       that caps out-of-pocket insulin costs for many patients with       insurance at $35 a month.        Collins said in an interview March 30 that the two senators       had come up with an outline based on a bill they worked on       three years ago that goes beyond capping what diabetes       patients pay and aims to bring down the prices drugmakers       charge.        ``It tackles the broader issue of the high list price for       insulin, and the conflicts of interests that occur in the       chain from manufacturer to the consumer buying it at the       pharmacy counter,'' Collins said.        The idea of reducing patients' out-of-pocket insulin costs       is immensely popular, and more than half of the public sees       it as a ``top priority'' for Congress, according to a KFF       poll out last week.        It had been a key selling point of President Joe Biden's       Build Back Better plan, but when that legislation stalled,       Biden and Schumer gave Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) an open       lane to promote a stand-alone measure identical to the House       bill that caps insulin costs at $35 a month for people with       private insurance and Medicare coverage.        The political climate, however, presented roadblocks. The       odds that a bill sponsored by a Democrat facing a tough       reelection in the fall could get enough Republicans in the       Senate on board seemed slim, and even some Democrats were       nervous about stripping the insulin provisions from a       possible revised version of the Build Back Better bill. So       Schumer embraced a different option from Collins and Shaheen       that would include a cap on out-of-pocket costs and possibly       draw more votes.        Insulin prices have spiked dramatically since the early       2000s, with Americans paying 10 times what people in other       developed countries pay.        Although Collins said details are still being worked out,       her legislation would be based on the pair's earlier bill,       the Insulin Price Reduction Act of 2019, which aimed to roll       insulin costs back to what they were in 2006. It would have       done that by barring rebate payments for insulin to pharmacy       benefit managers--those intermediaries who negotiate price       breaks for insurance companies and determine which drugs the       insurance plans cover.        Collins and other critics of PBMs believe they inflate       prices because they favor higher-priced drugs from which they       can extract a larger rebate and therefore more profit, which       gives drugmakers extra incentive to raise list prices.  [[Page H7677]]         Under that 2019 plan, drug manufacturers who agreed to       return to 2006 costs could then raise prices each year only       at the rate of medical inflation. The senators estimated the       plan would lead to a 75 percent cut in prices from those       listed in 2020.        ``There's a very complex system which essentially       encourages high list prices, because the pharmacy benefit       managers frequently receive a percentage of the list price,''       Collins said. ``So their incentive is to choose one that is       higher-cost. And so we are trying to address that broader       issue, as well as looking at the out-of-pocket costs.''        Warnock's proposal to cap the cost of insulin is silent on       list prices and benefit managers, an omission some Democrats       complained about even as they voted for the similar bill in       the House. They noted that since insurers would likely be       forced to absorb the costs no longer paid by patients, the       companies would likely raise premiums.        ``This bill does not lower the price of insulin by one       penny,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas). ``It just shifts       the burden of paying for the insulin off of the shoulders of       insured insulin users, and shifts it on to the rest of all of       us who are paying insurance premiums.''        Collins also noted that the uninsured would not benefit       from the House cap, which applies to Medicare and insurance       companies but doesn't affect drugmakers' prices.        ``It doesn't help someone who's uninsured,'' Collins said.       ``When you address the high list price, then it's going to       help more people.''        Collins warned that much could change as lawmakers keep       working with various stakeholders on a final bill, including       diabetes advocacy groups, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid       Services, and the Congressional Budget Office. And as caps on       out-of-pocket expenses and list-price changes start       interacting, things get complicated, indeed.        ``We're talking to CBO, which says it's so complex that       they need a new model,'' Collins said.        The politics also remains tricky. Collins and Shaheen never       got their measure close to the Senate floor in 2019 and 2020       when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was majority       leader. They did attract some praise from both sides of the       aisle, and conservative North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin       Cramer was a co-sponsor.        While that opens the door to GOP support, Collins said she       was still only at the stage of circulating among her       colleagues what she called a discussion draft.        Republicans in the House who voted against the $35-cap bill       panned it as a political stunt, saying Democrats should have       advanced ideas that had been worked on with Republicans.        Such objections could not block the bill in the House. But       in the Senate, Democrats command only 50 votes, and it would       take 60 to pass the legislation.        Although GOP members of the upper chamber might also be       opposed to Warnock's bill, one of the House sponsors argued       that having the House advance a dramatic cut in insulin       costs--with the support of only a dozen Republicans--would       raise the stakes for the Senate.        ``If 10 Republicans stand between Americans being able to       get access to insulin or not, that's a good question for 10       Republican [senators] to have to answer when they go back       home,'' Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said ahead of the House       vote. ``So we're gonna pass this bill, and this will put the       pressure on the Senate to act.''        He and his fellow Democratic co-sponsors also signaled       their willingness to take a measure that included the Shaheen       and Collins additions.        ``Any train that's leaving the station that gets folks       affordable insulin--I'm open to any vehicle,'' Kildee said.       ``We think this is a solution that would work. How it gets to       the president's desk, I'm agnostic on that question. Any way       we can get it there.''     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Jordan).    Madam Speaker, on behalf of seniors who rely on generic  drugs, I include in the Record the following letter from generic and  biosimilar manufacturers, which explains the price controls in this  Democrat bill will reduce competition from lower-cost generic and  biosimilar medicines. That means fewer options for patients and  worsening drug shortages.                                        The Biosimilars Council,                                      Washington, DC, July 11, 2022.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,       Washington, DC.        Dear Leader Schumer: The Association for Accessible       Medicines (AAM) and its Biosimilars Council share in the goal       of lowering prescription drug costs for America's patients       and seniors. However, in an effort to target high prices on       brand-name drugs, the proposed prescription drugs reforms--in       particular the Medicare negotiations framework--being       considered as part of a revised reconciliation package will       reduce patient savings from lower-cost generic and biosimilar       medicines. Even though competition from generic and       biosimilar medicines is the only proven solution to       consistently lower the cost of prescription drugs, the       proposed price setting scheme will reduce competition, harm       future savings from generic and biosimilar medicines, and       increase costs for employers and patients with private       insurance. We thus urge all U.S. Senators to oppose the       prescription drug reforms under consideration as part of a       revised Build Back Better reconciliation package.        America's patients rightfully expect Congress to address       the ever-increasing prices of brandname prescription drugs.       High launch prices on new brand biologics, combined with an       increasing trend of anti-competitive patent and rebate ploys       designed to delay or prevent competition from more affordable       biosimilars and generics, are keeping access to medicines out       of reach for too many patients. These dynamics are compounded       by flawed policies that reward health plans and pharmacy       benefit managers (PBMs) for the use of high-cost, high-rebate       brand drugs and that allow plans and PBMs to raise out-of-      pocket costs for generics, even as the prices for those same       generics are falling. As a result, patients, including       Medicare's seniors, are missing out on billions of dollars in       savings from biosimilars and generic drugs each year.       However, the proposed price setting approach fails to       adequately address these challenges, while dampening future       competition and reducing savings from generic and biosimilar       medicines.   Negotiations Framework Increases Uncertainty for Generic and Biosimilar                                 Developers         The proposal increases the risks associated with developing       generic and biosimilars without addressing the fundamental       barriers to competition from lower-cost medicines, such as       abuses of the patent system and brand rebate traps. The       proposed timelines for when the Secretary can initiate the       price setting process will significantly increase the risk to       develop new lower-cost generics and biosimilars. Although the       proposal exempts drugs with generic or biosimilar competition       from the price setting process, the bill only does so through       unrealistic timelines for that competition to enter the       market. For many complex generics and biosimilars, it can       take 8-10 years to develop new, more affordable medicines.       And it can take many more years to conclude patent litigation       and then launch a complex generic or biosimilar medicine. But       the new price setting process would not begin until years       after a developer commits to developing a lower-cost generic       or biosimilar. This means that generic and biosimilar       manufacturers will have no way to know whether a brand-name       drug will be selected for negotiation or what the negotiated       price may be. This dynamic fundamentally changes the ability       of generic and biosimilar manufacturers to plan and make       investment decisions that can be up to and exceed $250       million per drug.        While the revised bill includes a provision that could       allow for a temporary delay of the negotiated price if the       Secretary determines a biosimilar launch was imminent, there       are a number of limitations on the provision make it       difficult to utilize. By way of example, a biosimilar       developer would need to show a ``high likelihood'' of       biosimilar competition by a ``clear and convincing''       evidentiary standard. Moreover, the narrow two-year window to       launch does not appropriately account for how long it takes       developers to challenge brand-name patents. Large patent       estates and time-consuming patent litigation are currently       and will continue to prevent biosimilars from being able to       launch within two years of receiving FDA approval. These       dynamics will likely deter manufacturers from making       investments in biosimilar and generic medicines in some       instances--and will result in less competition and ultimately       higher costs for patients.       Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Savings Exceeds Potential from                           Negotiations Framework         After years of high-risk investment, biosimilar developers       are poised to deliver tremendous savings to the U.S. health       care system, improving access for patients and lowering       prescription drug costs. New  [[Page H7678]]       biosimilars are expected to launch for a range of treatments       for patients with diabetes, arthritis, macular degeneration,       oncology and more. In the next few years, 42 biosimilars are       on track to launch. Gold-standard data firm IQVIA estimates       biosimilar savings of $30 billion annually as a result. In       comparison, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the       negotiations framework saves $18-24 billion per year from       2028 to 2031. Thus, more savings is projected from market-      based competition than from the Build Back Better proposal       and it starts now. In addition, as more complex generics,       biosimilars, and interchangeable biologics become available,       there is the potential for even greater savings to the U.S.       health care system as providers and payers take advantage of       the opportunities to increase access and reduce costs for       patients.    Negotiations Framework Increases Costs on Employers and Patients with                              Private Coverage         Reduced competition from generic and biosimilar medicines       impacts all patients, not only Medicare beneficiaries. The       dampening effect this legislation would have on competition       would cause employers and patients with private insurance to       lose savings these populations have historically enjoyed from       robust generic competition and growing biosimilar       competition. Instead, there may be fewer new, more affordable       generic and biosimilar medicines, leaving the commercial and       employer markets captive to the high cost of brand-name       drugs.        When reviewing a nearly identical proposal in the House-      passed Build Back Better Act, AAM's Biosimilars Council       assessed the potential lost savings to the commercial market       for medicines used to treat asthma (Xolair) and rheumatoid       arthritis (Orencia), as examples. For just two products, lost       savings would be between $4-$7 billion between 2027-2030.       This is lost savings that would otherwise be used to lower       patient out of pocket costs and reduce insurance premiums for       employers and employees.        For these reasons, we must oppose the Medicare negotiations       framework and its impact on patient access to lower-cost       medicines. There are other bipartisan steps to address patent       abuse and brand rebate traps that are already under       discussion in Congress that can meaningfully reduce drugs       costs without harming generic and biosimilar savings. We       strongly encourage Congress to reconsider its approach.            Sincerely,                                                       Dan Leonard,                                                 President and CEO.

I include in the Record the following letter from dozens  of Main Street businesses opposing the Democrats' bill because of the  IRS' targeting of their business under the bill and tax hikes on small  businesses.                                                    August 11, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Leader Schumer, and       Leader McConnell: The undersigned organizations represent       millions of Main Street businesses and employ tens of       millions of workers and we oppose the Senate-passed Inflation       Reduction Act.        Inflation is at 40-year highs, we have had two consecutive       quarters of negative economic growth, and we are witnessing a       shrinking small business sector, yet the Inflation Reduction       Act does nothing to address these immediate issues even as it       increases the burden of the tax code shouldered by America's       small and family-owned businesses.        The Biden Administration claims the savings in the IRA are       ``front-loaded'' and will reduce the deficit in the short-      term, helping to ease inflationary pressures. That is simply       not the case. Recent analysis by the Congressional Budget       Office, Penn-Wharton, and others shows the Inflation       Reduction Act would increase prices in the short term and do       little to bring them down in the long run.        At the same time, the bill would give the IRS an additional       $80 billion in funding, more than half of which would pay for       thousands of additional IRS agents to conduct millions of       additional audits. We support addressing the tax gap and       oppose illegal tax evasion, but as former National Taxpayer       Advocate Nina Olson observed recently, it is wrong and       counterproductive to characterize the entire tax gap as       willful tax evasion. From experience, we know many, if not       most, of these additional audits will be conducted on the       owners of family businesses who have fully complied with the       tax code.        Finally, the Warner Amendment adopted at the last minute       presented the Senate with a clear choice between Wall Street       and Main Street, and the Senate chose Wall Street. The       amendment extends for two years the Section 461(l) cap on       losses a business owner is permitted to claim. This $52       billion tax hike on pass-through businesses was adopted with       almost no consideration, and the revenues it raises were used       to offset the cost of exempting private equity investors from       the fifteen-percent corporate minimum tax. The cap on active       pass-through less deductions is bad policy at any time, but       it is particularly harmful when the economy is weak and an       increasing number of businesses are suffering losses. The       timing of this amendment's adoption could not have been       worse.        The Inflation Reduction Act would fail to reduce price       pressures even as it raises the cost of the tax code to small       and family-owned businesses at a time of economic weakness.       We ask that you reject the IRA's Main Street tax hike when it       is considered by the full House.

Madam Speaker, a year ago, we met to consider another  disastrous version of this bill. Since then, American families and Main  Street businesses have been facing and continue to face historic  inflation and, now, a recession.   This bill is a hoax on the American people. Americans who are  suffering the most in President Biden's cruel economy will soon know  this firsthand. They will know it because inflation will get worse,  according to the Penn Wharton School of Business analysis.   Parents sitting up at night will notice higher taxes, fewer jobs, and  lower wages as they pay for the vast majority of any new revenue  collected under this bill, according to Congress' own nonpartisan  scorekeeper.   A middle-income single mom with two kids who runs her own business  will know it when she comes home from Walmart and finds a letter from  the IRS telling her she is under audit.   Seniors and loved ones with life-threatening illnesses will arrive at  the pharmacy counter and break into a sweat when they see they cannot  afford their medicine.   Families with loved ones newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's, or cancer,  or ALS, and desperately seeking treatment will wonder whether the cure  for their disease will ever come.   The wealthiest and the biggest foreign-owned corporations will do  just  [[Page H7680]]  fine. They are getting hundreds of billions of dollars of government  handouts under this bill. After all, they get the government checks  paid for by the middle-class taxpayers who are getting squeezed.   This is a sad day for struggling American families and Main Street  businesses. This economy is cruel enough, but by voting to turn this  hoax into law, Congress is inflicting one more act of cruelty.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
