 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of my  Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Mrs. Wagner).    Mr. Speaker, I will begin by recognizing the heroic men  and women who serve in the L.A. County Sheriff's Department as well.   This week, our country witnessed a cowardly evil attack on two L.A.  County deputies. As the two county deputies were sitting inside of  their parked car in Compton, California, a thug approached their  vehicle and shot them point-blank. We are grateful that both of them  are expected to survive. We regret that ambush, totally without  justification, and we need to bring them to justice.   I am reminded of what the British moralist C. S. Lewis described in  his book, ``The Abolition of Man,'' where he said of shallow and  heartless people as being ``men without chests.''   Perhaps, now, we are seeing that from the vicious criminals who are  attempting to single out and overthrow our cities and, specifically,  attack our police force.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, in the sweltering heat of Arizona deserts, we have  multiple jurisdictions of police officers who come to the rescue, not  just armed with guns, but they will save those who are fighting through  the desert, fighting through the heat, whether they are here in this  country illegally or not. Whether they are with the Customs and Border  Patrol, whether they are with ICE, whether they are with the county  sheriff's department or our local municipal police departments, they  provide first aid assistance and lifesaving assistance, and I pay  homage to them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman).                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments and his  efforts and service in Congress as he prepares to retire soon. I thank  the gentleman, Mr. Yoho.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany),  who on the other end of the spectrum is fairly new to Congress.    Mr. Speaker, when I reflect on the incident of the weekend  when the two L.A. County deputies were shot and they had to tend to  each other and apply first aid to each other, and they were rushed to  the hospital, the rigid cruelty of the mob that gathered at the  hospital trying to block an ambulance from accessing the emergency  room, accompanied with hateful shouts and taunts, as evidence of the  loss of goodness in our society.   The feckless leaders of some States and cities that have not only  permitted the destruction of property, but the wasting of lives and  livelihoods are without heart, as well. In many cases they have not  only stood by watching the wreckage, they have fomented the rioting,  looting, the murder, and mayhem.                                time  1700    One of the enemies of a free society is one who will appease people  who are intent on destroying the rights of individuals within that  society, those who permit and encourage by inaction criminal conduct.   We saw this when the Portland mayor, Ted Wheeler, was driven from his  own home because the mob had turned on him. He is not alone.   Winston Churchill once noted that an appeaser is someone who feeds  others to the alligators with the hopes that he will be eaten last.  That is what is being lived out in some American cities before our eyes  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud), my  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for being here tonight.  I appreciate his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline), my  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks), my  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Banks) for his words and also for his work on the legislation that I  think will be very important.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar), my  friend and my seatmate from Arizona.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague from  Arizona, Representative Gosar, for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice), my  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Norman), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy), who will be speaking as fast as a Texan can speak.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I include the following items in the Record:   A letter dated September 10, 2020, to the Honorable William P. Barr,  Attorney General; a newspaper article dated September 15, 2020; another  one, dated August 26, 2020; another piece which is undated, which I  will get the date for; and then another series of articles as well.                                   Congress of the United States,                                 Washington, DC, September 10, 2020.      Hon. William P. Barr,      Attorney General,      U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC.        Dear Attorney General Barr: We write to share our deep       concerns regarding the ongoing violence that has gripped       American cities and threatened the rule of law across our       nation. ANTIFA and other left-wing anarchist groups have       unleashed a barrage of totalitarian attacks on our country in       recent months, including accosting a sitting U.S. Senator,       hijacking peaceful rallies, organizing armed riots,       destroying property, burning buildings, stealing livelihoods,       and spreading hate.        It is clear that these individuals are well-funded and       supported by a national network of left-wing activists       committed to perpetrating violence and furthering anarchy in       our streets. As such, we urge you to immediately open an       investigation to identify and prosecute all individuals and       groups responsible for funding and organizing these       terroristic acts that are wreaking havoc on our nation.        As you know, 18 U.S. Sec. 2101 makes it a federal crime       punishable by up to five years in prison to incite a riot;       organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a       riot; commit any act of violence in furtherance of a riot; or       aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in a       riot. Tragically, we are seeing the letter and spirit of the       law being desecrated on a daily basis, as ANTIFA and other       organized groups of anarchists continue to infiltrate       peaceful protests and launch violent attacks against American       citizens. Tragically, these activities recently turned deadly       in Portland, Oregon, as Michael Forest Reinoehl, who       described himself as ``100% ANTIFA'' shot and killed a       supporter of President Trump.        Additionally, the riots in Portland and other major       American cities have revealed a targeted effort to       destabilize our way of life, including deliberately targeting       federal buildings and law enforcement in an effort to       undermine the rule of law. The prolonged nature and       organization of these violent attacks, including the rioters'       use of military grade helmets, gas masks, protective vests,       and illegal fireworks, clearly displays the high level of       coordination and outside funding supporting these anarchist       groups. It is readily apparent that these individuals were       outfitted for war and were clearly part of a planned effort       to infiltrate peaceful protests, provoke violence, and       further subvert our system of government.        Unfortunately, these are not isolated incidents. Well-      organized factions of ANTIFA and other anarchist groups have       taken advantage of peaceful protests to sow division,       threaten free speech, and enflame tensions throughout the       nation for more than 90 days.        The violence occurring in our cities cannot continue. The       DOJ must take action to stop these dangerous attacks. As       such, we urge you to fully investigate the groups responsible       for these attacks on our republic and prosecute all       individuals who are violating federal law by participating       in, inciting, organizing, or funding these destructive riots.       Thank you in advance for your consideration of this urgent       request and your prompt action to protect our nation.            Sincerely,      Ken Buck,      Andy Biggs,      Brian Babin, D.D.S.,      Ted Budd,      Doug Collins,      Bob Gibbs,      Jeff Duncan,      Steve King,        Members of Congress.                                   ____                       [From Fox News, Sept. 15, 2020]  LA County Sheriff Says Protesters Calling for Ambushed Deputies' Death                         is `Almost Worthy of ISIS'                             (By Joshua Nelson)         Protesters showing up at the hospital treating two deputies       who were shot in an ambush and calling for their death is       ``something almost worthy of ISIS,'' said Los Angeles County       Sheriff Alex Villanueva on Tuesday.        ``It's just a new low for the hatred that I don't think       anyone in this nation has ever seen before,'' Villanueva told       ``America's Newsroom.''        ``We just don't expect it on our own shores and we have       been here fighting to save people's lives across the county--      it doesn't matter who you are and it is not something we are       going to expect or tolerate,'' Villanueva said.        Villanueva on Monday challenged NBA star LeBron James to       match and double the reward money, which is currently up to       $200,000, that is being offered for information on the gunman       who ambushed and shot two deputies over the weekend.        ``This challenge is to LeBron James. I want you to match       that and double that reward,'' Villanueva said. ``I know you       care about law enforcement. You expressed a very interesting       statement about your perspective on race relations and on       officer-involved shootings and the impact that it has on the       African American community.''        ``And I appreciated that,'' he continued. ``But likewise,       we need to appreciate that respect for life goes across all       professions.''        The Los Angeles Lakers star has been one of the most vocal       professional athletes to speak on social issues and to       condemn police misconduct. After Jacob Blake was shot       multiple times by officers in Wisconsin last month, James       said Black people in America are ``terrified'' of police       misconduct.        ``I know people get tired of hearing me say it, but we are       scared as Black people in America,'' James said following the       Lakers' Game 4 win over the Portland Trail Blazers last       month. ``Black men, Black women, Black kids, we are       terrified.''        Villanueva on Tuesday said he had yet to hear from LeBron       regarding his challenge, but that the NBA star needs ``to       take some ownership of exactly what he said in terms of       propagating the idea that people are being hunted'' due to       the color of their skin.        ``I think that is just flat out not the case. I think we       need to hold those accountable for breaking the law, be it       law enforcement when we are crossing the line, but, then we       have to acknowledge the bigger problem of violence overall       and this ambush, cowardly ambush, of the two deputies just       doing their own job, doing their business there in Compton,       really illustrates that. That is that the problem we need to       address,'' he said.                                   ____                      [From Fox Business, Aug. 26, 2020]     BLM Brings Economic Stress to Communities It Claims To Represent:                                   Pastor                         (By Bishop Aubrey Shines)         Early in August a news story jumped out to me and not in a       good way my friends. I am still thinking about it.        As Fox Business reported on August 5, a trucking company       will no longer deliver to cities that are defunding police.       The co-  [[Page H4484]]       owner of JKC Trucking, Mike Kucharski, told Fox he was       concerned for the safety of his drivers and their cargo going       to cities where police have had their budgets slashed.        As an African American and a minister, I knew something       like this would happen sooner or later.        My colleagues and I founded Conservative Clergy of Color       because we were afraid something like this would happen if       Black Lives Matter was the only voice in the room.        We wanted to give a voice to African Americans who believe       in real change, not leftist platitudes and want their country       to be better.        My father was able to watch this country become a better       place from the segregation he knew growing up but now I fear       the progress he witnessed is being turned on its head. We've       now seen the first domino fall in the rollback of that       progress.        It's sad we've come to this, but it's the truth. Black       Lives Matter has crippled the police across dozens of cities,       and we're now seeing the economic impact.        These, friends, are the first tangible results from Black       Lives Matter's mad, anti-police crusade. These are the first       far-reaching consequences beyond the violence in cities this       summer that has gone so long it's beginning to feel       lethargic. These are the consequences that BLM's leadership       probably are fully aware of, but that the young misguided       social justice warriors that make up their ranks haven't       stopped to think about.        When you do stop and think about it, why should the owner       put his drivers in danger? Why would he risk the danger in       cities where police have been hamstrung and rioters have free       reign of the streets?        When young children like poor Secoriea Turner in Atlanta       are getting gunned down in the streets, I wouldn't want my       employees going to those cities either.        It's sad we've come to this, but it's the truth. Black       Lives Matter has crippled the police across dozens of cities,       and we're now seeing the economic impact.        Cities that normally receive commerce by way of trucking       companies and shipping outlets are now going to lose a vital       source of income. Depending on the size of the city, the       effect could range from negligible to devastating.        Either way, it's a problem none of these communities should       have faced. But because city leaders and governments either       were bullied into defunding their police or just felt like       being politically correct, grocery stores and retail outlets       are going to have to find other ways to supply their       products.        Now you might be thinking, ``I see your point Bishop, but       won't another trucking company just step up and fill the       void?'' Ideally, you'd be right, but I would pose the       counter-question of how long it will take before other       companies follow JKC's lead if the riots aren't brought to       heel soon.        For that matter, how long will it be before other       industries start making similar choices? How long will it be       before the results BLM's leftist ideology impedes different       businesses from providing income to communities?        What if a company like Staples or Walmart decides to build       new facilities in Portland but then pulls out at the last       second because rioters there are still out of control? And       it's not just mega-retailers; I haven't even touched on small       businesses and entrepreneurs. If I were a young, bright       individual looking to start my own company, I certainly       wouldn't want to do it in a place with kneecapped police and       no guarantee of stability.        The worst part of this debacle is that minority       communities, the very people BLM claims to represent, will       suffer the most.        A weaker police force means less business in a community       and that's less jobs to go around including for minorities.        Minorities in low-income neighborhoods need the work, not       just bloated government welfare programs. These are       minorities who could work in shipping warehouses, malls,       stores, or startups are worse off if none of those industries       decide to do business in their communities.        BLM's ``justice'' has already gotten black children killed       on the streets. Its crusade to replace police authority with       an anarchist mob has made it less safe in low-income       neighborhoods than before George Floyd's tragic death. But       now we're finally seeing the long-term consequences; the       purging of business opportunities that will only drive       minorities further away from prosperity and into the loving       arms of government dependency.                                   ____                       [From Fox News, Sept. 16, 2020]    LA Sheriff Alex Villanueva Challenges LeBron James To Match Reward           Money for Gunman Who Ambushed Two Deputies in Compton                             (By Louis Casiano)         Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva on Monday       challenged NBA star LeBron James to match and double the       reward money being offered for information on the gunman who       ambushed and shot two deputies over the weekend.        Speaking with KABC Radio on the John Phillips Show,       Villanueva said the reward money reached $175,000--a       combination of donations of $100,000 from the county and       $75,000 from two private individuals.        ``This challenge is to LeBron James. I want you to match       that and double that reward,'' Villanueva said. ``I know you       care about law enforcement. You expressed a very interesting       statement about your perspective on race relations and on       officer-involved shootings and the impact that it has on the       African-American community.        ``And I appreciated that,'' he continued. ``But likewise,       we need to appreciate that respect for life goes across all       professions.''

He earlier tweeted his frustrations about police shootings.        ``And y'all wonder why we say what we say about the       Police!! Someone please tell me WTF is this???!!! Exactly       another black man being targeted,'' James wrote. ``This s---       [sic] is so wrong and so sad!! Feel so sorry for him, his       family and OUR PEOPLE!! We want JUSTICE.''        It was not clear if James was aware of Villanueva's       challenge. Messages to the LeBron James Foundation were not       immediately returned.        ``Let's see what he does,'' the sheriff said. ``I'll be       very curious to see what his response is, if any.''                                   ____                       [From Fox News, Sept. 11, 2020]      St. Louis BLM Protesters From McCloskey Confrontation Cited for                                Trespassing                             (By Louis Casiano)         Nine Black Lives Matter protesters who were confronted by       an armed St. Louis couple on their lawn have been issued       citations for trespassing, officials told Fox News.        The June 28 encounter between the demonstrators, and Mark       and Patricia McCloskey made headlines as the country was       gripped by nationwide protests over police brutality. The       couple--both personal injury lawyers--were seen on video and       in photos pointing a handgun and a rifle as demonstrators       moved through their neighborhood.        No shots were fired.        Calls and emails to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police       Department from Fox News were not returned.        The office of City Counselor Julian Bush told Fox News in       an email that the citations were mailed to the nine people       but that Bush has ``not yet determined whether to file       charges.''        The protesters could face up to $500 in fines and up to 90       days in jail. However, Bush told NPR it was rare for anyone       to receive such penalties for a municipal ordinance       violation.        Last week, Black Lives Matter activist Ohun Ashe tweeted       that she received a summons.        ``I was just sent a summons to appear in court for       ``trespassing on private property'' on Portland P1 aka the       street Patricia and Mark McCloskey live on,'' the post read.       ``I had a gun waved in my face by them but trespassing is       what matters?''        Video footage captured the confrontation as 300       demonstrators marched in the street, claiming they were       headed toward the home of St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson. The       McCloskeys aimed their weapons at the marchers and have since       been charged with felony unlawful use of a weapon.        Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, has said he will       almost certainly pardon the McCloskeys if they are convicted.        The incident landed the couple an appearance during the       first night of the Republican National Convention last month,       where they asserted their Second Amendment right to defend       themselves.        ``The radicals are not content just marching in the       streets,'' Mark McCloskey said during a virtual speech.       ``They want to walk the halls of Congress. They want power.       This is Joe Biden's party. These are the people who will be       in charge.''                                   ____                [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 14, 2020]                       Confessions of a New Gun Owner                            (By William McGurn)         On Monday it became official: The police issued me a gun       permit.        Never did I imagine I'd be here. Not because I was anti-      gun. My dad was a career FBI agent, so my siblings and I grew       up with guns.        At the same time, my father was never particularly       interested in guns. To no avail, we would beg him to go t o       shoots to show off his skills. More frequently he would       remind us that many who keep guns in the house are more       likely to shoot a friend or family member than a would-be       robber or rapist. His proudest boast about his own career was       that not once did he have to shoot anybody.        This may help explain why we all grew up supporting the       Second Amendment in principle while not much interested in       the practice. What changed? Certainly the rioters played a       key part. But far more shocking than the rioters themselves       has been the associated spectacle of police and political       authorities across America standing down in the face of night       after night of criminal behavior directed at the lives and       livelihoods of innocent, law-abiding citizens.        Even in suburbia, many are no longer confident our       authorities would or could keep us  [[Page H4485]]       safe. In a small suburb such as mine, what would happen if       even 100 or 200 people bent on violence were to arrive at       once? Could our small police force really handle it? Or would       we be left to fend for ourselves like Mark and Pat McCloskey       in St. Louis, who defended their home and were then treated       as if they were criminals?        A few years back, I asked a former colleague whom I knew to       be pro-Second Amendment philosophically if he owned a gun. He       answered no, and then asked if I had one. I said I wouldn't       know what to write down as my reason for wanting one.        He told me, ``Write down, `Because I don't trust the       government.' ''        That might have worked for the Founding Fathers. But in       today's New Jersey--a state ranked by the Giffords Law       Center's annual Gun Law Scorecard as the nation's most       restrictive after California--the response might be 40 squad       cars on the front lawn by morning. I say this only half in       jest: Do other Americans buying guns for the first time find       it as grating as I do to learn that we need government       permission to exercise a constitutional right?        Equally illuminating has been learning about guns and those       who own them. Over four decades in the news business, I have       often written about the National Rifle Association, usually       about some proposed new gun law. Most recently the NRA has       been in the headlines over a lawsuit filed by New York's       attorney general in which she accuses top leaders of decades-      long corruption and misspending.        But our family's decision to buy a gun has introduced us to       the side of the NRA more Americans see: the education side.       The NRA has courses, online and in person, for almost       everything. The NRA instructor my wife and I engaged, Billy       De Almedia, was firm, professional and patient.        It's not just the instruction that impresses. It's the       sheer Americanness of a private organization established to       support a constitutional right in all its manifestations,       from defending the Second Amendment legally and       philosophically to instilling in newbies such as myself the       respect for guns necessary to keep and use them safely. Not       to mention a taste of the satisfaction that comes from       mastering a new discipline.        Surely if the government were to assume the functions the       NRA provides, the experience would be akin to going to your       local Department of Motor Vehicles. In America, by contrast,       the ethos emphasizes private initiative and responsibility.       In our new interactions with gun owners, gun instructors and       owners of gun ranges, my wife and I have found them       unfailingly eager to help and to answer even the dumbest       questions.        This year a record five million law-abiding Americans, like       us, have become new gun owners. Many don't fit the       stereotype: African-Americans account for the largest       percentage jump in gun ownership, while women are 40% of       first-time buyers. These new buyers join an even larger       demographic: the 43% of American households that already have       a gun.        The record gun sales for 2020 may have implications for       swing states in November as well. In Pennsylvania alone, the       National Shooting Sports Foundation reckons there are 276,648       first-time gun owners this year. To put this in perspective,       in 2016 Donald Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes.        Now, I appreciate how unlikely it is that I will ever reach       for a gun to defend my home or myself. But after watching the       mayhem that's taken over so many city streets I wonder,       probably with plenty of my fellow first-time gun buyers, what       alternative I'd have if ever I had to make that terrible 911       call--and it went unanswered?                                   ____                  [From the Washington Times, July 27, 2020]       Rep. Jerry Nadler Says Antifa violence in Portland a ``Myth''                            (By Jessica Chasmar)         Rep. Jerrold Nadler declared Sunday it's a ``myth'' that       Antifa provocateurs are behind the ongoing violent protests       in Portland, Oregon.        In a now-viral video posted on Twitter, writer-producer       Austen Fletcher caught up with the House Judiciary Judiciary       Committee chairman on his way to his vehicle.        ``I ran into Jerry Nadler in DC and asked him to disavow       the Antifa violence/rioting in Portland. His response?       `THAT'S A MYTH,' '' Mr. Fletcher said in a tweet along with       the video.        ``It is true,'' Mr. Fletcher tells Mr. Nadler in the video.       ``There's violence across the whole country. Do you disavow       the violence from Antifa that's happening in Portland right       now? There's riots--''        ``That's a myth that's being spread only in Washington,       D.C.,'' Mr. Nadler responded.        ``About Antifa in Portland?'' Mr. Fletcher asked.        ``Yes,'' Mr. Nadler replied before a staffer nudged him to       get into the vehicle.        ``Sir, there's videos everywhere online,'' Mr. Fletcher       continued. ``There's fires and riots, they're throwing       fireworks at federal officers. DHS is there. Look online. It       gets crazy, Mr. Nadler.''        The New York Democrat was slammed for his response, which       came as Portland entered its 60th day of riots since the       death of George Floyd.        Portland is the home of Rose City Antifa, the oldest known       so-called anti-fascist group in the country.                                   ____                     [From American News, Sept. 14, 2020]           DHS Leaked Email Confirms Antifa Is an Organized Group                           (By Ian Miles Cheong)         An internal email from the Department of Homeland Security       leaked to CBS Catherine Herridge late Monday detailing that       the violence in Portland was not ``opportunistic,'' but       rather ``organized''--confirming long-suspected details about       the Antifa movement.        The email explains that Antifa is organized and runs       contrary to reports in the mainstream media that Antifa was       not responsible for anti-police violence, but an impromptu       movement spurred on by anti-fascist sentiments held by most       of the American public.        A recent article in the Washington Post by Mark Bray,       author of Antifa: Anti-Fascist Handbook, attempted to dispel       ``myths'' about Antifa, claims that the group is not an       organization, but rather a ``tradition of militant       antifascism.'' The article disputed claims that Antifa       ``masterminds violence at Black Lives Matter protests.''        In printed email documents attained by Herridge, the DHS'       Acting Under Secretary for Intelligence & Analysis Brian       Murphy wrote to his colleagues on July 25 detailing his       findings of Antifa in Portland.        Murphy urged for an immediate change of definitions for the       violent activity in Portland following a review of the       individuals arrested by federal authorities, as well as       intelligence surrounding their affiliations and activities.        ``The individuals are violently attacking the Federal       facilities based on these ideologies,'' he said in regards to       Antifa, which he classed as VAAI or ``VIOLENT ANTIFA       ANARCHISTS INSPIRED.''        ``We can't say any longer that this violent situation is       opportunistic,'' wrote Murphy. ``Additionally, we have       overwhelmingly intelligence regarding the ideologies driving       individuals towards violence and why the violence has       continued.''        ``A core set of Threat actors are organized, show up night       after night, share common TTPs and drawing on like minded       individuals to their cause.''        TTP stands for Tactics, Techniques and Procedures.        ``I recognize we may not be able to attribute every       individual as VAAI however we need to look at the totality of       the intelligence both current and previous and recognize the       motivation for the violence and why people have shown up to       commit violence for about 60 days. And why the individuals       are using social media to encourage the VAAI on the ground to       carry out acts of violence.''        The nightly riots in Portland numbered at sixty days when       the email was composed. Rioting has shifted from Portland to       other cities with some of the same actors, including       Washington DC, Seattle, and Kenosha--violence of which was       spurred largely by pro-Antifa advocates on social media       platforms like Facebook, Twitch, and Twitter.        ``Threat actors who are motivated by Anarchist or ANTIFA       (or a combination of both) ideologies to carry out acts of       violence against State, Local, and Federal authorities and       infrastructure they believe represent authority or represent       political and social ideas they reject,'' Murphy concluded.        Phrases like ``Every city, every town. Burn the precincts       to the ground'' are a common refrain at Black Lives Matter       rallies, and have been chanted during arson attacks on the       Portland Police Bureau, the Mark O. Hatfield federal       courthouse in Portland, and other facilities where Antifa and       Black Lives Matter militants were present.        The intelligence provided by the DHS validates claims by       conservative voices who have long identified Antifa as an       organized movement, and flies in the face of claims that the       group was not intent on committing violence or conducting an       insurgency against the United States government.                                   ____                   [From gatewaypundit.com, Sept. 15, 2020]  Milwaukee Trump Supporter Arrested for Brandishing a Gun at Black Lives              Matter Mob That Was Surrounding His Home (VIDEO)                          (By Cassandra Fairbanks)         A Milwaukee man has reportedly been arrested after pulling       a gun on a mob of Black Lives Matter supporters who were       surrounding his home for several hours. It is currently       unclear who the man is or why the mob was at his house, but       he did have a ``Trump Train'' flag hanging outside.        Members of the mob claimed on social media that their       actions were justified because he is a ``racist'' and had a       confederate flag. The flag was not seen in the videos, but an       American and Trump flag were hanging prominently on the front       of his home.        In livestream footage of the incident, the mob is clearly       seen stepping on to the man's property.        ``They went specifically to his house to protest him for       `being a racist.' The homeowner was arrested, and the crowd       remains outside. They seem to have gone on his property. WTF       Milwaukee?'' Kitty Shackleford, a Twitter user that archives       riot footage, tweeted along with videos.        After the mob was outside his home for more than two hours,       police arrived. As they entered the man's property, the       rioters cheered for police and called for the man's arrest,       yelling about how he had a weapon.        When the man was taken outside, seemingly in cuffs, the       crowd went wild.        The militant leftists were threatening the man saying that       he was going to have big problems if he dared to step       outside.  [[Page H4486]]         As they threatened him, shined lights into his home, and       pranced all over his property, he pointed a shotgun out the       window.        The person who called for the ``protest'' livestreamed the       mob outside the man's home for several hours.        It does not appear that any members of the mob have been       arrested.     Mr. Speaker, as we have recognized here today with our  speakers the importance of law enforcement to maintaining our rights  and the safety of our neighborhoods and communities, I am reminded that  it was just a little over a month ago, late July 2020, when the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the House of Representatives  said about antifa, as the city of Portland was being burned by antifa,  he said it is a myth. It is a myth.   And then what has happened is an internal email from the Department  of Homeland Security revealed Monday that the violence in Portland was  not opportunistic but, rather, organized by the antifa organization.   We have got to see that our Attorney General--I urge him, I urge the  FBI to investigate and the Attorney General to take every action that  the law allows, whether it is civil RICO or prosecution of these  individuals, because, if you want to bring our society back into order,  you take people who are violent, rioting, looting, causing mayhem and  murder, you arrest them. You charge them, you prosecute them, and you  convict them.   We know there are law enforcement who do a great job, but right now,  in many places around this country, it will take a law enforcement  officer 5 or 10 minutes or longer to get to a home or a business that  is under attack by a criminal. When that happens, if they are under  attack, these individuals need to have the right, as they do under the  Second Amendment, to protect themselves. That right must be protected  and maintained.   So I am kind of surprised--I am going to give you a fact here. In  Pennsylvania alone, this year, you have had an increase in new gun  owners by more than a quarter of a million. More than a quarter of a  million people in Pennsylvania own guns today who didn't own them at  the beginning of the year. Why? Because of what is going on in our  streets, whether it is in Pennsylvania, Oregon, or wherever else it may  be.   A mob circles a home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; an individual holds up  a shotgun inside as this mob surrounds his home. What does the mob do,  the antifa folks? They call the police to have this man arrested for  having a gun on the ready to protect himself from that very mob. That  is backwards.                                time  1730    Mr. Speaker, we thank the police. The purpose of the police is to  protect the weak and the rights of all.   When our leaders in places like Portland, Minneapolis, you name it,  castigate the police or celebrities castigate the police, what they are  really saying is: We are content with mob rule. That can't be the case.   We have heard this tonight from my colleagues who have said this so  well. We support the police, and we support the thin blue line that  protects our rights. This rioting and this mayhem must end tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
