 Mr. President, Senator McCain is an American hero. He  is a hero to our conference. He is a hero to our country. Here in the  Senate, he is a friend to almost all of us. Our collective prayers are  with him now. We are thinking of Cindy and the rest of his family as  well, along with his staff and the people of Arizona.   Senator McCain, as we all know, has never shied away from a fight,  and I assure you he isn't going to back down now. I know the Senator  from Arizona will confront this challenge with the same extraordinary  courage that has characterized his entire life, and he should know that  we are all in his corner, every single one of us.   We look forward to seeing our friend again soon, and we hope he will  be back in the very near future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I thank the President for having our  conference over to the White House yesterday. The President and his  administration understand the American people are hurting under  ObamaCare. They have been long engaged in the effort to bring relief.  Nobody could have been more involved in this effort than the President,  the Vice President, and the entire team, with numerous phone calls and  meetings. They have been all in, and I want the President and his  entire team to know how much we appreciate their deep involvement in  this and their commitment to getting an outcome.   Dealing with this issue is what is right for the country. The fight  to move beyond the status quo of ObamaCare was certainly never going to  be easy, but we have come a long way, and I look forward to continuing  our work together to finally bring relief.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, several of my Democratic  colleagues spoke in opposition to the nomination of John Bush to serve  on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. They were particularly concerned  about his activities outside of the courtroom, especially his personal  blog posts. The comments of my friend, the junior Senator from  Minnesota, were representative of their concern.   He reminded us that he has been serving on the Judiciary Committee  for 8 years. He said that by confirming someone to the Federal bench  like Mr. Bush, who has blogged about controversial political and policy  matters, the Senate would be doing something unprecedented.  Specifically, my friend from Minnesota--in angst--said, ``I don't think  we have been here before.''   ``I don't think we have been here before,'' he said. I would  encourage my friend to think a little harder about his tenure on the  Judiciary Committee. Just a few years ago, the Senate considered  President Obama's nomination of Stephen Bough to be a Federal judge in  Missouri. Mr. Bough had been quite an active blogger himself. His  blogging and online commentary were not simply confined to political  satire and sarcasm. His blogging didn't use merely flippant or  intemperate language. His blogging demonstrated a real and palpable  animus toward conservatives and Republicans in general, toward elected  Republicans in particular, and by name--by name. He insulted and  impugned people from his home State, such as Senators, his Governor,  the President of the United States, and a Republican nominee for  President, just to name a few.   Mr. Bough's posts were truly mean-spirited. It wasn't just that he  called Republicans ``knuckleheads''--which he did. That was when he was  feeling especially kind. No, he said specific Republicans were  ``corrupt.'' They had done ``evil things''--``evil things.'' I can go  on and on about his corrosive rhetoric.   He approvingly posted an article describing how San Francisco was  contemplating naming a sewage plant after President Bush as a suitable  legacy for the President and posted another one that said his Governor  was highly ``ignorant.''   His invective was not reserved to members of the political branches.  He said that his State supreme court was the most corrupt in the  history of the State. I am not making this up. He is an officer of the  court, calling the supreme court the most corrupt in the history of his  State.  [[Page S4089]]    For my Democratic colleagues who now profess to care about the  judgment of judicial nominees who blog, I submit that impugning the  integrity of the tribunal that has jurisdiction over their professional  conduct and law license, as Mr. Bough did, is more than a few tweaks  shy of exhibiting sound judgment.   Mr. Bough also implied that President Bush made his Supreme Court  appointments as some sort of quid pro quo. He harshly criticized  sitting Supreme Court Justices by name, and he claimed that the  Republican nominee for President wanted only Federal judges who would  disregard the law and rule in favor of the ``religious right'' and that  he was ``sucking up.''   He made a crude comment about women that I will not repeat.   Now, some of our Democratic colleagues have criticized John Bush  because he said that he would try hard to be impartial as a judge. By  contrast, in one of his blog posts, Stephen Bough flat-out said that  he, himself, ``shouldn't be a judge.'' This is commentary on himself.  But every one of our Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee  at the time, including our friend from Minnesota, obviously disagreed  with his own judgment about himself. They all voted for him, which is  especially curious in hindsight, given the superior weight our  Democratic colleagues now place on blog posts. Only one Member of the  Democratic conference voted against Mr. Bough. These are many of the  same Democrats, of course, who are supposedly aghast--aghast--at the  Bush nomination. Mr. Bough is now Federal District Court Judge Stephen  Bough.   Finally, I would like to set the record straight on the subject of  the slur. Mr. Bush did not use the slur in a blog post, and he did not  use it flippantly. In fact, he said he has never used this term and  would never use it.   Rather, Mr. Bush quoted by name someone else--a prominent author who  had used the slur. Mr. Bush quoted him to show how various authors had  viewed our hometown of Louisville over time--both those who praised it  and those who criticized it. In short, Mr. Bush said that he used it to  show ``the good, the bad, and the ugly.''   So who was the author he quoted verbatim and by name? Why, it was  noted liberal Hunter Thompson. I note that Mr. Thompson's use of the  slur did not prevent liberals, including Democratic officeholders, from  praising him. In fact, not one but two Democratic Presidential  candidates went to his funeral--George McGovern and John Kerry.   The Senate has considered a judicial nominee who did use this slur in  a blog posting, who actually did use the exact same slur, in fact. The  judicial nominee was not quoting any literary or published work, and  this judicial nominee did not use the slur for any critical purpose.  The judicial nominee used it flippantly and cavalierly. Who was the  judicial nominee? It was President Obama's judicial nominee and current  Federal District Court Judge Stephen Bough, who sits on the bench right  now for life, after being confirmed by the votes of our Democratic  colleagues.   I hope I have at least refreshed the memory of my friend from  Minnesota and some of my other Democratic colleagues.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have 9 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority leaders.
