 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1129 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.  [[Page H4726]]                                     General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1129, providing for consideration of  three measures.   First, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 4447, the Clean  Economy Jobs and Innovation Act, under a structured rule. The rule  provides 90 minutes of debate equally divided among and controlled by  the chairs and ranking minority members of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. The rule  self-executes a manager's amendment, makes in order 98 amendments, and  provides en bloc authority and one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 6270, the Uyghur  Forced Labor Disclosure Act of 2020, under a closed rule. The rule  provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services, and  it provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 8319, the  Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act, under a  closed rule. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations and provides one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, the bills contained in this rule are about meeting our  responsibility here at home and living up to our values abroad.   First is H.R. 8319, a continuing resolution to keep our government  funded through December 11. Fortunately, we won't need to call this  bill up because a compromise passed this House last night by a vote of  359-57. That is quite an accomplishment because sometimes we can't even  agree on what to have for lunch here, yet we were able to come together  to keep this government open. That is good news for the American  people.   Second is H.R. 4447, a sweeping energy package that will help our  Nation lead the world once more in clean energy. Investing in renewable  energy like wind and solar won't just help us combat the threat of  climate change; they will help us create jobs here at home that can  never be outsourced.   It is especially important that we are considering this package right  now. There are wildfires raging in places like California, Oregon, and  Washington that are leaving a heartbreaking path of destruction.  Scientists are unequivocal: These fires are just the latest indication  that climate change is real and is happening right now. This is not  some long-off threat that we can leave for our kids or grandkids. This  is happening today.   By addressing it, we won't just protect our environment. We will  create jobs at a time when our country badly needs them. Because of the  coronavirus, our country is facing the worst economy since the Great  Depression. The Labor Department said last week that 12.6 million  Americans are collecting unemployment benefits. One year ago, that  number stood at just 1.7 million.   Renewable energy can and should be part of the equation in rebuilding  this economy because, make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, jobs in things like  solar energy will be created. The only question is whether they are  created here or in other countries like China. I want them made in  America.   Lastly, the Rules Committee considered two bills on Monday to help  defend the human rights of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities who have  suffered horrific human rights abuses at the hands of the Chinese  Government: H.R. 6210, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, and H.R.  6270, the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act.   I am proud to have authored H.R. 6210, which passed the House with an  overwhelming 406-3 vote yesterday. I also strongly support H.R. 6270,  the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act, authored by my colleague,  Representative Jennifer Wexton.   It is disappointing that some Republican Members may oppose the  Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act that requires disclosures about  products made with forced labor from a region where crimes against  humanity and perhaps genocide are being committed by the Chinese  Government.   As many as 1.8 million Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim  minorities have been arbitrarily detained in mass internment camps and  subjected to forced labor, torture, political indoctrination, and other  severe human rights abuses.   We know forced labor is widespread and systematic, and audits are  simply not possible because workers cannot speak freely and honestly  about working conditions given the heavy surveillance and intimidation  by the Chinese Government.   This legislation is essential to protect American investors and  consumers through stronger disclosure requirements alerting them to the  presence of Chinese and international companies whose operations enable  the mass internment and population surveillance of Uyghurs and other  Muslim minorities.   Such involvements represent clear and material risks to shared values  and the corporate reputations of these companies and U.S. investors and  consumers.   It seems the only argument against this bill is that it is similar to  the Democratic Republic of the Congo conflict minerals provision from  years ago, but the comparison simply just doesn't hold water.   Free enterprise, as we know it, doesn't exist in the Xinjiang Uyghur  Autonomous Region. It should not be compared to Africa in terms of the  business climate or access.   The Xinjiang economy is tightly controlled and directed by the  Chinese Government and Communist Party. It is built on a foundation of  forced labor and repression. International observers, the press, and  government officials are restricted from even traveling there.   Just this week, a number of respected supply chain auditing firms say  they will no longer conduct inspections in Xinjiang because of the  hostile environment ruled by fear.   The argument against this legislation is that the DRC conflict  minerals provision was bad because businesses left that region because  they didn't want to or could not disclose their supply chains. Well, it  is long past time for U.S. and international companies to reassess  their supply chains and find alternatives to production in Xinjiang  where forced labor is widespread and embedded in the regional economy.   We don't think Chinese, U.S., and international companies should be  exploiting the Uyghur and other Muslim people in allowing global supply  chains to be contaminated with forced labor.   So I hope on both sides of the aisle, but I say this to my Republican  colleagues, to those who might be considering a ``no'' vote, think long  and hard before voting against the bill that would help reveal the  extent of how the Chinese Government's system of forced labor has  contaminated global supply chains.   I am proud to stand in solidarity with the Uyghur people and, indeed,  all the people living under the rule of the Chinese Government in their  struggle to live freely, practice their religious beliefs freely, and  speak their own language freely.   I urge all of my colleagues to join with us and give this rule and  underlying bills a broad bipartisan vote so we can fulfill our  obligations here at home and around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to diverge from what we are considering today and  recognize some of the people here who help us all navigate how  legislation is considered.   There are staff here that work day in and day out to make this  Chamber function smoothly so that we can get things done on behalf of  the American people. They aren't Democratic or Republican staff. They  serve both sides without fear or favor. That team includes the staff in  the Office of the Parliamentarian.   Tom Wickham has served in that office for the last 25 years. As House  Parliamentarian, he became a master of House procedure. And make no  mistake, having an encyclopedic knowledge of how this place operates is  no small thing, Mr. Speaker.   Tom is now retiring after serving with distinction for many years. I  want to recognize him, and I want to thank him for that service here  today.   Now, I could say a lot about Tom. On a physical level, Tom is usually  the tallest person in the room, and a lot of people fit in this room.  On a human level, Tom always makes time for everyone, from the most  senior Members to the most junior staff. Unless he is in a meeting, the  door to his office right across the hall is literally left open all the  time.   He has perfected the art of dry parliamentary humor. It is incredibly  impressive when someone can make germaneness, promptly motions, and  Deschler's Precedents funny.   Tom is always willing to listen to argument and never too proud to  change his mind or say he was wrong about something in the face of new  information.   To me and my staff, Tom Wickham appears to know everything about the  rules and history of this House. But he is quick to say that he knows  nothing about the Senate whenever we ask a Senate question; although,  we suspect he knows everything about the Senate as well and just  doesn't want to offend his friend, Elizabeth, the Senate  Parliamentarian.   Tom has guided us through some turbulent times. He has advised the  presiding officer during times of heated debate, even yelling at times.  He has been on that rostrum through impeachment proceedings and opening  day sessions, during late nights often followed by all-too-early  mornings.    He has seen it all, and we are lucky to have had him at our side  through it all. He will be missed, but we congratulate him on a well- deserved retirement.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to congratulate Jason Smith for being named  the new House Parliamentarian. Many of us already know Jason pretty  well, having worked with him in his prior role as Deputy  Parliamentarian. His know-how made an impression, since he was named to  this new role after a bipartisan recommendation, and I think that also  is a tribute to his skills.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Cole for working with me  on this. I valued his advice and counsel, as I do so often as we serve  together on the Rules Committee. His wisdom made this process largely  an apolitical one.   I could not ask for a better partner at the Rules Committee than the  gentleman from Oklahoma, Tom Cole. He and I try to put this institution  first, and I know that Jason will, too.   It is clear Jason has the confidence of both sides of the aisle, and  that is no small thing. I look forward to working with him in his new  role.   The truth is we are lucky to have such dedicated staff in the  Parliamentarian's Office, and that includes Anne Gooch, who works with  us day in and day out, whether it is at 7 a.m. or 11 p.m. My staff and  I have her on speed dial. Her work also makes our work possible, and we  are grateful.   So we have a lot of debates on this floor, Mr. Speaker, all to make  progress on behalf of the American people, but it is important during  moments like this that we also recognize people whose work behind the  scenes makes this progress possible.   So, Mr. Speaker, I just want to pay this tribute to these incredible  people, and I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4728]]         Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole) would agree with me that we both learned more from the  Parliamentarian's Office than we ever knew was possible as we engaged  in trying to get a replacement for Mr. Wickham. Our admiration for the  staff there has only increased.   I just want to say one final thing here.   Normally, under normal circumstances, this Chamber would be filled  with Members, which I think we would all have preferred in order to  give you a proper sendoff. Obviously, outside events have made that  impossible, but we want you to know that everybody in this Chamber  appreciates your incredible work. So I ask everybody who is here to  give you a round of applause and say thank you.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1145     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just want to say for the record that if my Republican friends want  to know why there is no agreement on another coronavirus relief package  including PPP, they should call their friend Mitch McConnell because  this House did its job.   We passed the HEROES Act more than 125 days ago to help cash-strapped  State and local governments, to help businesses on the brink, and to  help Americans struggling in the middle of this pandemic.   A lot of people are suffering. Hunger has increased in this country.  Senate Republicans can't even come to an agreement amongst themselves.  They couldn't even get their entire caucus on board, let alone  Democrats.   The HEROES Act is bipartisan, but even that hasn't been enough to get  Mitch McConnell to take it up. Apparently, he couldn't find the time,  Mr. Speaker, but he is moving with lightning speed to confirm a new  Supreme Court Justice.   Are you kidding me? In the middle of a pandemic he can't find the  time to provide a vote on a package to help the American people and  small businesses? Our restaurants are in deep trouble. Those of us who  come from States--like I do in Massachusetts--outdoor dining is going  to cease pretty soon because it is getting cold, and they don't know  how they are going to get through the winter. And we can't even get the  Senate to debate this stuff?   More than 200,000 Americans are dead. The President says, Oh,  everything is going great. 200,000 people are dead. Compare that to  Canada or other countries that actually had a plan to manage this  pandemic. Countless millions have been infected.   The Senate needs to act. And shame on them for not acting.   It should be more than just an assembly line that rubber-stamps  conservative judges. There is legislating to do, and none more  important than dealing with the impacts of this pandemic.   I don't know whether the Senate majority leader has a heart of stone  or what, but it is inexcusable. It is unconscionable. It is  unbelievable that he hasn't acted, and so I urge my Republican  colleagues to pick up the phone and call him and tell him to do  something.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the good news and what is comforting to me is that the  American people get this. They understand where the problem is.   And I would just say to my friends who don't like everything in the  HEROES Act, the way this process is supposed to work is we pass a bill  in the House, the Senate passes a bill, and then we have a conference  committee and we work out the details.   Well, the only negotiating that has been going on is Democrats have  been negotiating with themselves. We have actually lowered the request  in the original HEROES Act--which I personally think is not the right  thing to do, but I get it--to get something done.   There is nothing in here that helps communities who are trying to  deal with the school situation. In some places schools are opening, in  some places they are not but there are all of these new expenses on how  to make the classroom safer.   When my friends say, Oh, we don't want to give any more money to  cities and towns to deal with that, I don't know whether you talk to  your superintendents, or your teachers, or your principals, or parents,  but this is real and they are looking for some help.   I mean, we are in the middle of a pandemic. We haven't seen anything  like this since 1918. It has impacted our entire economy and you would  never know it. You would never know it based on the inaction and the  indifference over in the Senate.   I mean, it just takes my breath away when we have leaders there,  Republican leaders, who won't even come to the negotiating table. And I  just find that appalling.   I will just say one other thing. I urge everybody to vote for the  previous question because let me just tell you something that some  people don't appreciate; if you defeat the previous question, they get  to bring up whatever they want to bring up.   They can bring up this, they can bring up whatever. They basically  take control of the House. And they may say they are going to bring up  this, but who knows what they will bring up. And so this is a bad  procedural maneuver, but it is designed to give them power.   And, again, what I am learning here is that we don't share the same  values on a lot of these things. I find that particularly disconcerting  during a pandemic.   In the past, after 9/11, I was here. George W. Bush was President. I  didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff, but he helped bring this  country together and get us all reading off the same sheet of music in  terms of our response. It is very different now.   So I would urge my colleagues again to vote ``yes'' on the previous  question, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the gentleman from New York,  and I appreciate his efforts at trying to find common ground and trying  to make this place work better. But I do take exception to a statement  he made, that if you vote against this, then you are turning your backs  on small businesses.   Well, I can make that same argument to all of my Republican friends  who voted against the HEROES Act. Not only did they turn their backs on  small businesses, they turned their backs on schools and on people who  right now are going hungry in this country. I can go right down the  list of all the things. They are turning their backs on cities and  towns that are not just blue cities and towns.   Mr. Speaker, this notion that we have to define everything in terms  of red and blue, in terms of whether they get assistance, I find very  disconcerting. I never question a vote in favor of disaster relief if a  red State was hit by a hurricane or an earthquake or a fire. You try to  do the right thing.   So spare us the indignation, because the deal is, we passed something  here 4 months ago, and there has been no action. We all know that we  weren't going to get everything. The Speaker brought it down by $1  trillion, hoping that that would spur a negotiation, and there is  nothing yet. By the way, the Senate can't even get its act together  amongst its own Republicans, never mind with Democrats.   So we need to do something. Hopefully, before we leave here, the  Senate majority leader will pick up the phone and work with the Speaker  and with the White House, and we can get something here.   Quite frankly, all of us, if it is not done, are willing to come back  here on a moment's notice. We have all been told by our majority leader  to be prepared to come back here in a nanosecond if we can get a deal.   But to leave schools behind, to leave hungry people behind, and to  leave countless others who have been impacted by this virus behind,  this is a big deal. It is a big deal. We need to help our small  businesses, and we have to help others as well.   Let's hope rationality will prevail, common sense will prevail, and  we can come together similar to the way we did on the continuing  resolution yesterday.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me remind all of my colleagues this is a procedural  vote, and this is a very common practice of my Republican colleagues on  a regular basis to urge a defeat of the previous question so they can  bring up whatever they want to bring up.    The gentleman just said that we need to move quickly. My question is:  Where have you been? Where have you been?   Four months ago--4 months ago--we passed a bill that would provide  relief to our small businesses and to our cash-strapped communities,  many of them forced to lay off first responders.   Where have you been? Have you picked up the phone and called Mitch  McConnell? Have you lobbied any of your Republican colleagues on the  Senate side? Nothing.   We are about to recess. I think everybody knows that people back home  are not happy with the obstructionism and the Senate doing nothing. So  let's toss out a procedural vote, and we can use that as cover. Talk  about being cynical.  [[Page H4731]]    We had an opportunity. We still have an opportunity to come together  and do something that will help all Americans. Instead, this is the  best we can do, no promises to talk to the Senate, no nothing.   It is just frustrating because people are hurting, and it is not  enough at the last minute to come up with a procedural vote that  doesn't mean anything and all along having been opposed to the HEROES  Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is unclear to me what this President would or would  not sign. I am looking at a headline from CBS News: ``Trump said  coronavirus `affects virtually nobody,' as U.S. surpasses 200,000  deaths.''   Talk about clueless here. We passed the HEROES Act to help our  schools and our healthcare workers. I would like to think that there is  no objection to helping our schools and our healthcare workers. We want  to help our first responders. They are the heroes here.   Why is that such a controversial thing to do?   We wanted to pass the HEROES Act to provide more testing and tracing  so we can contain this virus. We are doing that while the President of  the United States is hosting superspreader events where people without  masks are all bunched together.   We passed the HEROES Act to support families who are struggling to  pay their rent, and we passed the HEROES Act to help small businesses.   It is time for my Republican friends to pick up the phone, call  Senator McConnell, and ask him to sit down and negotiate a deal that  helps the entirety of this country. I don't see why that is so  controversial, yet they won't do it. They won't do it. This is cynical  politics, pure and simple.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I understand why the gentlewoman doesn't  want to talk about the past, because 4 months ago, she--as well as most  Republicans--voted ``no'' on the HEROES Act. They voted to deny help to  small businesses. They voted to deny help to our schools, to our  healthcare workers, to our first responders.   Mr. Speaker, I get it. She and others are going to have to explain to  their constituents why they did that, why they voted against the  interests of their own constituents. So I get it.   But the bottom line is this: If my Republican friends want to help,  pick up the phone and call their friend, Mitch McConnell, and ask him  to get serious about negotiating a compromise here so we can help small  businesses and also help our schools and our first responders and our  healthcare workers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4732]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my friend just mentioned ``the least'' we can do. Well,  this is not the time to do the least of anything. We are faced with a  pandemic, haven't seen the likes of this since 1918. This is a big  deal. It impacts every part of our economy. And they are talking about  ``the least.''   Well, you know what? We have to help our small businesses; we have to  help our schools. We have to protect our first responders and our  healthcare workers. This impacts everybody. And the notion that they  can't muster the political will to pick up the phone and ask the Senate  to negotiate with us is really, really sad, and it is a disservice to  the people of this country.   Mr. Speaker, I get it. Like everything in the HEROES Act--well, that  is what a negotiation is for, you go back and forth, and you trade  things off. I would argue everything in the HEROES Act is necessary and  important.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support the rule. It  includes an important energy bill that will help us deal with the  climate crisis, which is real--no matter what the President says, we  have a climate crisis--and some human rights legislation as well, to  stand up for the human rights of the Uyghurs, and make sure that no  U.S. or international businesses are utilizing forced labor by the  Chinese Government against the Uyghurs.   Mr. Speaker, again, we have a job to do here, and that is to provide  relief during this pandemic. And it really is frustrating that my  Republican friends have done nothing--done nothing--to help get us to a  solution.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge all my colleagues to join with us in  support of the rule and the underlying measure. Please vote ``yes'' on  the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1129         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 7.
