 Madam Speaker, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, I  am using a proxy to vote on my behalf (pursuant to House Resolution 8  and in accordance with regulation C.6.). Regretfully, my proxy was  unable to arrive at the House floor within the allotted time to cast my  vote for H.R. 1620, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of  2021.
