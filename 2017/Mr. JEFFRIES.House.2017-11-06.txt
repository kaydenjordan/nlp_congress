 Mr. Speaker, another day, another tragedy here in  America. These are difficult times in this country, and it seems that  we have spent the last several months careening from one tragedy to the  next: from the congressional baseball shooting to Charlottesville, from  Charlottesville to Las Vegas, from Las Vegas to the terrorist attack in  New York, from the terrorist attack in New York to a mass shooting at a  Baptist Church in south Texas.   Something is wrong here in America, yet all we seem to do is to come  to Congress, have a respectful moment of silence, and then move on as  if everything is okay. It is not okay.   It is time for this ``do-nothing Congress'' to do something, do  anything to help stop the carnage that is taking place in our great  country.                            ____________________
