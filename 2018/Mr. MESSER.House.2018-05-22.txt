 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this historic  bipartisan compromise that rolls back some of the most harmful policies  from the Dodd-Frank Act and will help grow our economy.   The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act  includes bipartisan legislation that I authored to help communities in  Indiana and across the United States save money on roads, bridges, and  schools. It reverses a backward banking rule that gave foreign  countries an advantage over American cities and towns. This will drive  down the cost of borrowing and make it cheaper for cities and towns to  finance local infrastructure projects.   Ultimately, this bill saves taxpayer dollars. That is why it has  passed the House twice. It is supported by numerous advocacy groups,  and my good friend, the State treasurer of Indiana, Kelly Mitchell. I  applaud this bill's inclusion in this banking reform package, and I  urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill.
