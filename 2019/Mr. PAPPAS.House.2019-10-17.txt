 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of individuals across New  Hampshire and the country who are struggling to afford the skyrocketing  cost of prescription drugs.   Across my district, I hear from individuals each and every day about  the significant burden and anxiety caused by the exorbitant costs of  these prescriptions. That is why I introduced H.R. 4661, the Advancing  Enrollment and Reducing Drug Costs Act, along with Representative  Tonko.   This is an important addition to H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act  of 2019, to expand seniors' access to prescription drugs under Medicare  part D. This legislation will automatically enroll individuals in part  D's subsidy program, known as Extra Help, when they have aged out of  Medicaid Expansion.   We must continue to ensure that seniors receive access to this earned  benefit without having to navigate what can be a complicated process.   When seniors arrive at the pharmacy counter, they shouldn't have to  worry whether they can afford the medications they need to live with  health and with dignity. This legislation is a step toward addressing  this injustice, and I urge my colleagues to continue to support efforts  to reduce the cost of prescription drugs in a bipartisan fashion and  pass this legislation.                            ____________________
