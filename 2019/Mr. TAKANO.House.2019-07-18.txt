 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a dear friend whom  I greatly admire, Jane Block.   Jane has dedicated her life to our community, to activism, and to  making our society more just and equal for everyone.   She has been instrumental in leading the women's movement in  Riverside by serving on the committee that led to the founding of UCR's  Women's Resource Center and chairing the Riverside County Commission on  the Status of Women.   Apart from her work to advance women's issues, Jane is president of  the Riverside Land Conservancy and has helped to establish the Box  Springs Mountain Reserve in Moreno Valley, which declared the region as  a park instead of a development area.   Jane's work has not gone unnoticed, and my district is a better place  because of her. It is an honor not only to have her as a member of my  community, but also to call her my friend.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Jane a happy 90th birthday.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  National Employment Law Project in support.                                                     July 16, 2019.        The undersigned organizations enthusiastically support the       Raise the Wage Act of 2019, introduced by Senators Bernie       Sanders (VT) and Patty Murray (WA), Representatives Robert C.       ``Bobby'' Scott (VA), Mark Pocan (WI) and Stephanie Murphy       (FL).        If enacted, this legislation would:        Gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour in       2025;        After 2025, adjust the minimum wage each year to keep pace       with growth in the typical worker's wages;        Phase out the outdated subminimum wage for tipped workers,       which has been frozen at a meager $2.13 since 1991; and,        Sunset the much criticized ability of employers to pay       workers with disabilities a subminimum wage through       certificates issued by DOL.        Phase out the subminimum wage for workers under the age of       20.        At a time when wage stagnation and income inequality pose       serious threats to our families and our economy, the Raise       the Wage Act of 2019 will begin to reverse that cycle and       raise pay broadly across the bottom of the workforce.       According to the Economic Policy Institute, this Act will       deliver long-overdue raises to more than 1 in 4 workers, 90%       of whom are over the age of 20. The average age of workers       who would get a raise is 35, nearly half have some years of       college education. In fact, those who work year-round would       see a raise in the order of $3,000 a year, which is enough to       make a tremendous difference in the life of a preschool       teacher, bank teller, or fastfood worker who today struggles       to get by on around $20,000 per year.        28 percent are working parents with children, and half have       family incomes of less than $40,000 per year. Women make up       nearly 58 percent of the workers who would benefit from a $15       minimum wage, which would be instrumental in helping to close       the gender-wage-gap. Raising the minimum wage to $15 would       also significantly benefit workers of color, with 38 percent       of African American workers and 33 percent of Latinos seeing       a pay increase once this law goes into effect.        These are the frontline workers who make America run--yet       due to the erosion of the real value of the minimum wage over       the last half century, they are struggling even as our       economy enjoys a solid recovery.        The time for the Raise the Wage Act is long overdue, and we       cannot delay in working toward its passage. We call on       Congress to enact this important piece of legislation as       quickly as possible, and for President Trump to sign it when       it comes to his desk.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 582, the  Raise the Wage Act.   There is currently no place in America where a worker making $7.25  per hour can afford a two-bedroom apartment. Millions of families are  struggling to make ends meet. As one of the richest countries in the  world, we should be ashamed.   This bill will give 27 million workers a raise and lift 1.3 million  people out of poverty. Helping low-income workers is long overdue.   Contrary to what my Republican colleagues have been saying, raising  the minimum wage is popular among American workers. That is why voters  in States like California, Arkansas, Arizona, and Missouri have voted  to increase their State minimum wages.   Congress has the opportunity to restore the value of work, lift  families out of poverty, and ensure a fair wage for workers everywhere  in America.   I urge all my colleagues to vote in support of workers and families  by supporting the Raise the Wage Act.
