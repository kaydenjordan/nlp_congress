 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   I want to speak in support of Protecting America's Strategic  Petroleum Reserve from China Act.   Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority is wasting no time in making  good on our commitment to the American people to reverse this reckless  agenda that the Biden administration has followed.   Republicans understand that energy policy is foundational to a  thriving and dynamic national economy, and for too long, we have  watched as Democrats' energy policy was kind of an experiment for their  radical agenda. Unfortunately, they hurt the American people in the  process.   Interestingly, in July 2020, Senator Cornyn and I had a bill to allow  filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve while prices were at historic  lows. It was blocked by the Democrats. They wouldn't even consider it.   Today, we have an opportunity to protect America's resource and  refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so it can be used as it was  originally intended, to protect our people at times of crisis.
