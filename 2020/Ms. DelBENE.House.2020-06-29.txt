 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   The high price of prescription drugs is one of the top issues I hear  about from my constituents. In 2019, I received nearly four times as  many comments about prescription drug costs as the year before. Now,  with the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis, addressing  the issue of drug pricing is more urgent than ever.   The patient stories are numerous and never-ending. I would like to  share just one with my colleagues and the American people to remind us  why this legislation is so necessary.   A constituent of mine, Dana, from Kenmore, Washington, has lived with  type 1 diabetes for 14 years. When Dana was first diagnosed with  diabetes, insulin cost her $50 each month. Today, that same insulin  costs over $600 per month.   That is an 1,100 percent increase for the exact same product, and  there have been virtually no changes to insulin since Dana's diagnosis,  so the price spike is inexplicable.   Madam Speaker, Dana is not only a diabetes patient but also a nurse  practitioner and diabetes educator. She has told me about her patients  who go to Canada, where they can get insulin for just $40 a month. But  with the border closed because of the pandemic, for many, that option  is shut off to them.   Dana has also shared stories of her own patients who can't afford  their medications and ration their insulin, which we know can lead to  poor health, vision loss, kidney failure, and even death.  [[Page H2627]]    Madam Speaker, I strongly support the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Enhancement Act, which will strengthen and improve upon  the ACA and finally give the Health and Human Services Secretary the  power to negotiate a fair price for insulin, which will dramatically  help patients, like Dana, and all the patients that Dana serves in my  district.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
