 Madam President, we have been stuck for some time now on  having an appropriations bill that meets the disasters that have  occurred recently in Missouri and, before that, in the Carolinas and  Georgia, and other places. I want to continue to work hard to get that  done, but I want to talk a little bit about the effects of what has  happened in the State of Missouri as part of what has happened with  floods this spring.   We have seen catastrophic and, in some cases, historic flooding both  on the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers over the last couple of  months. Along the Missouri, there was this unusual thing, and I  actually never heard the term before, a ``bomb cyclone.'' It is a wind  event that also produced lots of rain in Nebraska in the Northern  Plains on frozen ground. All of that water had no place to go except  run off, and it was the equivalent of 8 inches of rain in a place from  which we usually don't get water. There had been significant rain over  the last few days of March. That created another flood. On the  Mississippi, we have seen significant rains there. While they haven't  set a record, they have certainly consistently ranked the Mississippi  crests among the seventh highest flood levels that river has ever been  from some of the locks. There are locks north of St. Louis. You can  navigate the river without locks south of St. Louis, but in the area  from the Canton Lock and Dam to the Winfield Lock and Dam on the  Mississippi, there are significant problems waiting to happen over the  next few weeks.   After the rains occurred in Northwest Missouri and in Iowa and  Nebraska, in our State and Kansas, much of the water is still there.  The floods have stayed up so high for so long that it is difficult to  really evaluate the damage that has been done. Unlike a tornado, which  we have some familiarity with, where you can go in quickly and evaluate  what happened, you can't do that nearly as quickly with a flood.   We do know there has been at least $25 million in damages to public  infrastructure and costs of emergency measures experienced statewide.  There have been 215 road closures statewide, with 46 roads that  continue to be closed as late as the third week in April. Interstate  29, north of St. Joseph, has been closed since March and is expected to  stay closed until probably June.   This is obviously a very disruptive set of circumstances for people  who would normally use those roads and bridges all the time. One of the  major class 1 roadways has been damaged. That roadway was just raised  in 2011 to deal with the flood in 2011. An ethanol plant was knocked  offline. Electric substations have been damaged. Grains stored in bins  from last year's harvest have been destroyed. Livestock have been lost.  Many farmers will not be able to get crops in the ground this year  because it will be too wet once the water goes down--until it is too  late to successfully plant the crops. So thousands of acres and  hundreds of farms just simply will not be able to do what they do  because of the flood.   The scale and scope of these events has clearly overwhelmed local  governments, overwhelmed county governments, and stretched the State  government in a significant way. Most effectively, and most  importantly, it has impacted families and individuals. If your home is  underwater, if it takes 2 more hours to get to school, if you have no  chance of planting your crop or if you are in a business that relates  to the family who is going to plant the crop, if you have nobody buying  the seed or paying the repairs for their equipment, paying for the  gasoline--the things you do to stay in business--that has all kinds of  impact as well.   The Governor of Missouri has requested a Presidential disaster  declaration. I am certainly for that, and every  [[Page S2554]]  Member of the Missouri delegation signed the letter asking the  President to grant that declaration. The assistance that would be  impacted by this would be vital. It is important. We need that kind of  assistance now.   I am going to continue to work--and I hope all our colleagues  continue to work--to make this year's disasters and last fall's  disasters eligible for the funds we appropriate for disaster coverage.   During the flood, a lot has been said about the Corps of Engineer's  management of the Missouri River, and what, if anything, they could  have done that might have prevented the flood this time. I think  probably not. This is such an unusual flood that the locks on the  Missouri were north of where the flood occurred. There was a dam that  broke that would not normally have broken, and that would normally not  even be part of the Missouri River management system.   The Corps has been out there trying to help figure out how to recover  rather than figure out what caused this particular flood. In fact, the  Corps and the permanent staff in places like the Kansas City office of  the Corps understand the Missouri River better than anybody, in my  view, and are helpful when they can be.   That doesn't mean the Corps, in a greater sense, isn't responsible  for what has become the new normal on the Missouri River. We have had  recurrent historic flooding on the river now for 15 years. Ever since  the Corps asked for a new management plan in 2004 and got the new  management plan, it just simply doesn't work.   At least 6 of the top 10 river crests in recorded history have  occurred in the last 15 years. Floods in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011--you  see the pattern here--2013, and 2019. The only reason we didn't have  dramatic floods every year was we had a couple of drought years in 2009  and 2012.   This all goes back to that 2004 management plan. What changed in  2004? In 2004, the Corps started to implement the Missouri River  Recovery Program in response to a Biological Opinion--``opinion'' may  be the key word here--Biological Opinion from the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, which took the position that the existing management  of the river was impacting one species of fish and two species of  birds.   The ultimate result was prioritizing the management of the entire  river to benefit that fish and those birds. It was above flood control.  It was above navigation. It didn't consider what was detrimental to  families, to farms, or the local infrastructure and was not necessary.  Saving wildlife is a worthy goal, but for that goal to truly be worthy,  it has to also include how it impacts families, how it impacts people,  and how it impacts the economy.   We had management plans on the Mississippi River as well, but the  wildlife management plans didn't become the plan that substituted for  all other plans.   The Corps' management plan brought about changes to the lower river.  There are six locks and there are six dams, rather, and reservoirs  above the Lower Missouri that starts roughly in the place where Kansas,  Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri all come together. What happened was they  began to destabilize the banks, constructing pallid sturgeon chutes  that impacted how the water ran into the river. They no longer dredged  the river like they had before. Just to understand why that matters, a  9-foot channel of the river carries a lot more water than a 6- or 7- foot channel of the river. If you are channeling the river so you can  still navigate the river, they had interception rearing complexes, none  of which appears to have made much of a difference, except they made it  hard to control the river at flood stage.   Modifying or eliminating the river control systems eliminate the  normal things in a river, such as revetments, wing dikes, and chevrons  that control the river and send the water in the direction it needs to  be for flood protection, and that just didn't happen.   Fish and Wildlife and the Corps of Engineers actually now know that  some of the actions they were carrying out caused direct negative  impacts on the river and didn't do any good. There is a high level of  certainty that when you notch a dike in the river--which means you cut  a hole in a structure that is designed to channel the water--that when  you do that, bad things happen. That is why that structure was put  there in the first place for a reason.   One of the most disappointing parts of what has happened is a  relatively low level of certainty that any of these things do any good.  In fact, the Corps and the Fish and Wildlife people have already  abandoned the pursuit of what they constructed, pallid sturgeon chutes,  which they thought would encourage the pallid sturgeon to multiply. By  the way, this is a fish we happen to multiply ourselves at the Neosho  National Fish Hatchery, which I believe is the oldest fish hatchery in  the United States. The U.S. hatchery system is in Neosho. Pallid  sturgeon is one of the things they do. They didn't work, but they did  encourage more flood risk.   I would have one suggestion for the Corps: If you know an action will  increase flood control and you know it will harm people and harm  property and you don't know whether it will help save a species, don't  do it. There has to be a way you figure out first whether this is going  to work, and then you might evaluate if it is so important that we are  going to impact people and property.   What we had is a big experiment that turned out to be the wrong thing  to do to start with. It didn't serve the purpose, and it did harm the  river and people who live on the river. Flood control and navigation  needs to be, once again, elevated to the top two priorities of managing  the river. I look forward to working with my colleagues to figure out  how to do this in a better way.    There is no question that the Mississippi River is about to be more  important than it has been in 100 years. There is also no reason that  the Missouri River, as an avenue of commerce and as an avenue that  people can get near and enjoy from a tourist's and traveler's  perspective, can't be there, and there is no reason it can't continue  to be managed in a way that benefits families, that benefits us  economically, and that doesn't repeat year after year after year the  flooding that did not occur under the original management plan.   We need to look at that plan. We need to have a management plan that  meets the commonsense standard. The current plan does not, and we have  had now 15 years to prove that the current plan does not meet it. I am  going to be working hard with both the Corps, the Department of the  Interior, and Fish and Wildlife to see if we can't have a plan that  meets that commonsense standard.

Members of the Joint  Committee on the Library elected Senator Roy Blunt as chair and  Representative Zoe Lofgren as vice chair.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 2, of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the committee rules be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               Joint Committee on the Library--116th Congress                      TITLE I--MEETINGS OF THE COMMITTEE         1. Regular meetings may be called by the Chair, with the       concurrence of the Vice Chair, as may be deemed necessary or       pursuant to the provision of paragraph 3 of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules of the Senate.        2. Meetings of the committee, including meetings to conduct       hearings, shall be open to the public, except that a meeting       or series of meetings by the committee on the same subject       for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be closed       to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into closed       session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated in       subparagraphs (A) through (F) would require the meeting to be       closed followed immediately by a recorded vote in open       session by a majority of the members of the committee when it       is determined that the matters to be discussed or the       testimony to be taken at such meeting or meetings--        (A) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in       the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct       of the foreign relations of the United States;        (B) will relate solely to matters of the committee staff       personnel or internal staff management or procedures;        (C) will tend to charge an individual with a crime or       misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing       of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to       public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly       unwarranted invasion of privacy of an individual;        (D) will disclose the identity of any informer or law       enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating       to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense       that is required to be kept secret in the interest of       effective law enforcement;        (E) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets       or financial or commercial information pertaining       specifically to a given person if--        (1) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept       confidential by Government officers and employees; or        (2) the information has been obtained by the Government on       a confidential basis, other than through an application by       such person for a specific Government financial or other       benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to       prevent undue injury to the benefit, and is required to be       kept secret in order to prevent undue injury to the       competitive position of such person; or        (F) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential       under the provisions of law or Government regulation.       (Paragraph 5(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the       Senate.)        3. Written notices of committee meetings will normally be       sent by the committee's staff director to all members at       least 3 days in advance. In addition, the committee staff       will email or telephone reminders of committee meetings to       all members of the committee or to the appropriate staff       assistants in their offices.        4. A copy of the committee's intended agenda enumerating       separate items of committee business will normally be sent to       all members of the committee by the staff director at least 1       day in advance of all meetings. This does not preclude any       member of the committee from raising appropriate non-agenda       topics.        5. Any witness who is to appear before the committee in any       hearing shall file with the clerk of the committee at least 3       business days before the date of his or her appearance, a       written statement of his or her proposed testimony and an       executive summary thereof, in such form as the Chair may       direct, unless the Chair waived such a requirement for good       cause.                              TITLE II--QUORUMS         1. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(1) of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules, 4 members of the committee shall constitute a       quorum.        2. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(2) of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules, 2 members of the committee shall constitute a       quorum for the purpose of taking testimony; provided,       however, once a quorum is established, any one member can       continue to take such testimony.        3. Under no circumstance may proxies be considered for the       establishment of a quorum.                              TITLE III--VOTING         1. Voting in the committee on any issue will normally be by       voice vote.        2. If a third of the members present so demand, a recorded       vote will be taken on any question by roll call.  [[Page S2564]]             3. The results of the roll call votes taken in any meeting       upon a measure, or any amendment thereto, shall be stated in       the committee report on that measure unless previously       announced by the committee, and such report or announcement       shall include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor and the       votes cast in opposition to each measure and amendment by       each member of the committee. (Paragraph 7(b) and (c) of rule       XXVI of the Standing Rules.)        4. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and       matters before the committee. However, the vote of the       committee to report a measure or matters shall require the       concurrence of a majority of the members of the committee who       are physically present at the time of the vote.
