 Mr. Speaker, we have another issue I think that this  body ought to take up and that the news media ought to be looking  into--and that is another cost of the huge number of illegal immigrants  entering this country.   It has been brought to my attention by property developers that we  already have a shortage of over 4 million rental units or residential  units in the country. When we let in another 2 million people a year,  what do you think happens?   It further causes a shortage of rental units and sometimes single- family units in this country, which results in what?   The law of supply and demand is driving up rents because of all the  people coming in the country. We know already--a huge, new expense for  schools as we have to educate illegals. We know about President Biden's  vow to pay for free healthcare for illegals, which he is fulfilling.   But for the individual looking for rental units, is their rent going  up $100, $200, or $300 as we continue to have this shortage.   It is time the press got on this issue. It is time that the Congress  got on this issue, and let people know--particularly in the southern  United States--if your rents are going up, it is because of all these  people that are being allowed in the country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as has been mentioned, prior to 1973,  there would be what I would consider a consensus in this country that  it would be horrific to prematurely kill a child in the womb.   At the time, as a practical matter, there were only two or three  States in which abortion was legal, and there were times in this  country before then in which every State considered abortion illegal.   We know what happened after Roe v. Wade. Over the next 50 years, over  73 million lives were cut short, people who would have had long lives  and accomplished who knows how much. You can imagine how America would  have changed if those people had actually lived.   Recently, Roe v. Wade was overturned, and there was a lot of elation  because of that. However, since that time, I think six States have had  referendums.   While it was widely believed that abortion should be illegal in 1973,  despite the fact that we had ultrasounds at that time, despite the fact  that again and again in workplaces we pass around pictures with the  ultrasounds showing children at 3, 4, or 5 months old, American opinion  was a disappointment. Even in conservative States like Michigan,  Kansas, Montana, and Kentucky, the public voted pro-abortion.   What can we make of this? Because we have had the ultrasound in  between Roe v. Wade and now, we have to say that, unfortunately, the  people who should have been educating the public have failed to do  their duty. The churches in the last 50 years allowed this shift of  opinion to happen.   By the way, it should have been easy to explain why abortion was  horrific because of the huge increase in ultrasounds. Instead, we are  joining a handful of countries--Vietnam, North Korea, Red China--out  there saying abortion should be legal in some States through birth. Is  this how we repay our maker for this wonderful country that we have?   I call upon America to call upon the churches to educate the public  on what is right and wrong, that every one of these children is a gift  from God, and that it is time for America to wake up.   I do believe right now we have, as with so many other issues, a  problem with the clergy in the country, but I hope Americans can ask  their clergymen where they are when these decisions are being made all  around the country and where they are when these referendums are coming  before the people. We need more help from the mute clergy.
