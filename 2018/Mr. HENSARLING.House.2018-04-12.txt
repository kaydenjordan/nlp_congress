 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  also thank him for his friendship, and I thank him for his leadership  in fiscal sanity.   Along with Chairman Goodlatte, I will be leaving Congress at the end  of this year. Serving in Congress has been the greatest privilege of my  life, but I leave with one great regret, and that regret is my  inability to convince my colleagues of the peril of ignoring the debt  trajectory this Nation is on. We cannot continue to spend money we do  not have.   Mr. Speaker, my iPad is awash--awash--of reports about how our  spending trajectory is unsustainable. CBO, OMB, private foundations,  they all conclude the same thing: the picture of national bankruptcy is  ugly.   It wasn't that many years ago that we saw it in Greece. We saw soup  kitchens, padlocked factories, hospitals that could no longer turn on  the lights, college-educated people forced into subsistence  agriculture.   Mr. Speaker, I don't think America is going to be Greece. I wish I  knew it for a fact. But here is what I do know: if we don't quit  spending money we don't have, we will become a second-rate economic  power, a second-rate military power, and, frankly, a second-rate  authority, moral authority, as we become the first generation in  America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of  living. That simply is not unintelligent; that is immoral.   Can we have that stain on our record for generations to come?   Mr. Speaker, frankly, I wish we were debating a spending limit  amendment today, which is my preference; but at least the balanced  budget amendment is a fair fight so that we at least do not mortgage  our children's future, our grandchildren's future.   Again, there is a moral imperative. We know what Churchill once said  about us, and that is:         Americans can usually be counted on to do the right thing       once they have exhausted every other possibility.    It is a humorous comment for a situation that is not humorous. We  cannot wait. This is the most foreseeable crisis in America's future.   Today we can make history. Today we can ensure that we show fidelity  to our Founding Fathers and to future generations and, for once, going  forward, ensure that it is enshrined in our most sacred document that  we balance the budget and do not mortgage our children's future.
