 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, under the Clean Water Act, Congress  gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate any  air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new  motor vehicle engines which may be reasonably anticipated to endanger  public health or welfare.   To avoid any ambiguity, Congress further defined the term ``motor  vehicle'' as a ``self-propelled vehicle designed for transporting  persons or property on a street or highway.''   Until recently, regulators understood, as any reasonable person  would, that the term ``self-propelled vehicle'' only applies to  vehicles that can move on a roadway under their own power, such as  cars, pickup trucks, semi trucks, SUVs, or vans. Never was a trailer,  whether a utility trailer pulled by a pickup truck, a boat trailer  pulled by a car, or a cargo trailer pulled by a semi considered a self- propelled vehicle, and, therefore, these were never under the  regulatory authority of the EPA.   However, in 2016, without any authority of Congress, the EPA extended  its regulatory authority and included cargo trailers in the rules for  greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency standards for on-road,  heavy-duty vehicles and engines. This rule will require cargo trailers  to add components that, in some cases, have shown to improve  aerodynamics, resulting in some improvement in fuel efficiency.  However, this blanket policy, which has resulted from regulatory  overreach, is not only costly to consumers, but, in some cases, is  counterproductive to the Agency's own mission of promoting clear, clean  air policies and practices.   The additional weight of these aerodynamic components that are being  mandated by the EPA will cause carriers to significantly limit the  amount of cargo a single trailer can carry and still stay within DOT  weight restrictions. Therefore, carriers have to put more trucks on the  highway to carry the same amount of goods. Obviously, more trucks mean  more carbon emissions without any measurable improved efficiency.   If the EPA is able to enforce this regulation, it will not only be  counterproductive to the environment, but also very costly to American  consumers.                                time  1700    The trucking industry has made significant strides in recent years to  improve fuel efficiency and reduce air pollution, without the  government mandates.   This amendment simply prevents the EPA from using any funds in this  act to regulate trailers under the greenhouse gas rule. Congress never  extended to the EPA the authority to regulate trailers under the Clean  Air Act, because trailers are not and have never been considered self- propelled vehicles.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this commonsense amendment,  so we can put an end to this blatant regulatory overreach.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  [[Page H6507]]  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith), and I thank him for his  hard work on this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to join the  gentleman from Virginia and myself in support of what is a commonsense  upholding of our constitutional authority as the legislative branch,  and I encourage a ``yea'' vote on this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.
