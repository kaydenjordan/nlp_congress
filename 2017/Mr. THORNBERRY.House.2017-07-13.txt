 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I have tremendous respect for the gentleman from  Massachusetts. He is exactly right, the Department of Defense Medical  Research Program is already spending money on tick-borne diseases. I  believe it is about $5 million this year. It was about $5 million last  year. And as I understand the gentleman's amendment, he would expand  the number of diseases that they can research.   I rise to claim the time in opposition, however, to express concern  about the direction of this program.   Mr. Chairman, I have a chart that indicates the tremendous growth of  dollars going into this congressionally directed medical research  program. It has increased tremendously in recent years, and I would  like to take just a few moments to read some of the diseases that it is  researching: ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, autism, bone marrow failure,  breast cancer, leukemia, muscular dystrophy, epilepsies, food  allergies, lung cancer, multiple sclerosis. There is a couple here that  I can't pronounce, so I won't read. Osteoporosis, ovarian cancer,  Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, Peer-Reviewed Orthopaedic, prostate  cancer, spinal cord injuries, of course, tick-borne disease, tubular  sclerosis, and the list goes on.   And let me just say I certainly support Chairman Tom Cole's attempts  to increase funding for NIH and other sorts of medical research through  the NIH. What I am concerned about is that, increasingly, DOD dollars  are being spent to research diseases that have a tangential, at best,  connection with the Department of Defense and our military. And what  happens is it is taking dollars away from the sorts of injuries and  diseases that our military does confront. This is a trend that is  getting worse each year.   So I don't necessarily oppose the gentleman's amendment. As he points  out, there is research going on here, but it is a trend I do think we  have to be cautious about.   And for that reason, I want to at least raise a warning flag about  the trend to add to the amount of money and the number of diseases  which we are looking to the Department of Defense to help research  diseases which are not related, necessarily, to key functions of the  Department of Defense.   So I appreciate the gentleman letting me express that concern, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Perry) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military  activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction,  to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from  Oklahoma and his consistent and strong leadership on this issue. I,  like him, believe that it is time to have a new AUMF, given the change  of circumstances and the evolution of the threats which we face. This  is the third administration that has had to take the 2001 AUMF and  stretch its meaning to encompass all sorts of groups in all sorts of  countries in all sorts of circumstances.   I think, from a legal standpoint, we need to update the AUMF so that  we are consistent with the intent of the Constitution. The even more  important point is the point that the gentleman from Oklahoma made, and  that is that the men and women who are out there risking their lives  deserve to know that they have the full backing of the country that  comes from an AUMF that Congress has passed.   I do want to take exception with one point that is sometimes made.  This House has voted twice to update the 2001 AUMF. It voted in 2011  and in 2012 to update that AUMF to include associated forces. It  happened to be part of the NDAA, even though the Armed Services  Committee is not the committee of jurisdiction. The Foreign Affairs  Committee worked with us, and we passed it twice in the House. It did  not survive contact with the Senate, and although there was some  detention language that came from it, but there had been efforts in  this House to update this language.   But I think the gentleman's approach is exactly right as for the  strategy, the budget that goes with it, and the legal framework we are  to follow, including the AUMF. So I do think it is a methodical,  deliberate process that will take us closer to doing what we ought to  do, and that does include updating this Authorization for Use of  Military Force against terrorist groups as that terrorist threat  evolves.   I commend the gentleman for his amendment and I support it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith), who is the distinguished ranking member of the  Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 440, I  offer amendments en bloc.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendments en bloc.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math in       addition to maintenance and manufacturing (collectively       referred to in this section as ``STEM(MM)'') make up a       significant portion of the workforce of the Department of       Defense.        (2) These jobs exist within the organic industrial base,       research, development, and engineering centers, life-cycle       management commands, and logistics centers of the Department.        (3) Vital to the continued support of the mission of all of       the military services, the Department needs to maintain its       STEM(MM) workforce.        (4) It is known that the demographics of personnel of the       Department indicate that many of the STEM(MM) personnel of       the Department will be eligible to retire in the next few       years.        (5) Decisive action is needed to replace STEM(MM) personnel       as they retire to ensure that the military does not further       suffer a skill and knowledge gap and thus a serious readiness       gap.        (b) Assessments and Plan of Action.--The Secretary of       Defense, in conjunction with the Secretary of each military       department, shall --        (1) perform an assessment of the STEM(MM) workforce for       organizations within the Department of Defense, including the       numbers and types of positions and the expectations for       losses due to retirements and voluntary departures;        (2) identify the types and quantities of STEM(MM) jobs       needed to support future mission work;        (3) determine the shortfall between lost STEM(MM) personnel       and future requirements;        (4) analyze and explain the appropriateness and impact of       using reimbursable and working capital fund dollars for new       STEM(MM) hires;        (5) identify a plan of action to address the STEM(MM) jobs       gap, including hiring strategies and timelines for       replacement of STEM(MM) employees; and        (6) deliver to Congress, not later than December 31, 2018,       a report specifying such plan of action.               amendment no. 23 Offered by Mr. Castro of Texas         At the end of subtitle B of title II, add the following new       section:       SEC. 2__.

ESTABLISHMENT OF SEPARATION OATH FOR MEMBERS OF THE                     ARMED FORCES.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The United States Armed Forces is the largest, all-      volunteer military force in the world, yet less than one       percent of the American population serves in the Armed       Forces.  [[Page H5822]]         (2) Each branch of the Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force,       Marine Corps, Coast Guard) instills in its members a sense of       duty and obligation to the United States, their branch of       service, and their comrades-in-arms.        (3) The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that       approximately 20 veterans of the Armed Forces commit suicide       each day and a veteran's risk of suicide is 21 percent higher       compared to an adult who has not served in the Armed Forces.        (4) The Department of Veterans Affairs is aggressively       undertaking measures to prevent these tragic outcomes, yet       suicide rates among veterans remain unacceptably high.        (5) Upon enlistment or appointment in the Armed Forces, a       new member is obligated to take an oath of office or oath of       enlistment.        (6) Most members of the Armed Forces view this oath not as       an imposition, but as a promise that they are bound to       fulfill.        (b) Establishment of Separation Oath.--Section 502 of title       10, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c) and,       in such subsection, by striking ``The oath'' and inserting       ``An oath established by this section''; and        (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following new       subsection (b):        ``(b) Separation Oath.--Prior to retirement or other       separation from the armed forces, other than separation       pursuant to the sentence of a court-martial, a member of an       armed force may take the following oath:        `` `I, _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _, recognizing that my oath to       support and defend the Constitution of the United States       against all enemies, foreign and domestic, has involved me       and my fellow members in experiences that few persons, other       than our peers, can understand, do solemnly swear (or affirm)       to continue to be the keeper of my brothers- and sisters-in-      arms and protector of the United States and the Constitution;       to preserve the values I have learned; to maintain my body       and my mind; and to not bring harm to myself without speaking       to my fellow veterans first. I take this oath freely and       without purpose of evasion, so help me God.' ''.        (c) Clerical Amendments.--        (1) Section heading.--The heading of section 502 of title       10, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:       ``Sec. 502. Enlistment oath and separation oath: who may         administer''.         (2) Table of sections.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 31 of title 10, United States Code, is       amended by striking the item relating to section 502 and       inserting the following new item:  ``502.
