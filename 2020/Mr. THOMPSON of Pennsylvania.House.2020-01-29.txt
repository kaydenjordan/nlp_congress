 Mr. Speaker, today, at long last, the  United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, USMCA, will officially  become law. USMCA is a major win not only for American farmers,  ranchers, manufacturers, and business owners, but for each and every  American who depends on these industries.   Thanks to the leadership of the Trump administration, we are  delivering real results for the men and women who are the backbone of  the American economy. Freer markets, fairer trade, and increased  opportunity are on the horizon as USMCA is signed today and  implemented.   The numbers are staggering: more than $68 billion in new economic  activity, approximately 176,000 new jobs, and an increase of more than  $2 billion a year in agriculture exports. It is no wonder that USMCA  passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and the  Senate.   USMCA brings particularly good news for the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania. In 2018 alone, Pennsylvania exported approximately $15  billion in goods to Canada and Mexico, and USMCA continues to open  doors for our producers.   As Pennsylvania's number one industry, agriculture is vital to the  health of both the economy and our residents, as our farmers provide  the food, the fiber, the energy, the building materials, and all that  we depend upon. With increased market opportunities, the future of the  Keystone State is brighter than ever.   That being said, it is impossible to talk about the impact USMCA will  have on Pennsylvania without talking about dairy. For far too long, our  Nation's dairy producers have been subject to Canada's unfair class 6  and class 7 ultrafiltered pricing programs, limiting our export  potential both into Canada and, quite frankly, into Third World  countries as Canada floods them with dairy components of whey and  lactose, proteins and powdered milk. Thanks to USMCA, this is a thing  of the past.   A 21st century economy requires 21st century trade policy, and with  USMCA, we are sending a crystal-clear message to our trade partners  around the globe: America is open for business.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, yesterday marked the  anniversary of the Challenger space shuttle explosion.   Mr. Speaker, 34 years ago, President Ronald Reagan addressed the  Nation from the Oval Office, mourning with the entire country but  paying special attention to the Nation's young people, telling them:  ``The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the  brave.''   Today, those young people have become the men and women who have  taken up the mantle of space exploration, who probe the outer limits of  our solar system and even join NASA to explore space for themselves.  President Reagan's words are as true for these men and women as they  were for the Challenger crew.   As we look back on the tragedy of the Challenger, we must also look  ahead. Let us recommit ourselves to space exploration by empowering the  men and women who study it. We can honor our past by making space  exploration a part of our future.                            ____________________
