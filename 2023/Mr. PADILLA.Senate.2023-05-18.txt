 Mr. President, I rise today as chair of the Environment  and Public Works Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water, and Wildlife to  express my strong disapproval of Republican efforts to undermine the  integrity and authority of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.   Now, around the world, scientists tell us that 1 million species face  extinction, including 40 percent of animals in the United States. This  is nothing short of a biodiversity crisis, one that will have dire  impacts on the ecosystems around us and the clean air and clean water  that we need to survive.   Yet, last week, for the second and the third time in just 2 weeks,  Republicans passed a Congressional Review Act resolution to constrain  the Fish and Wildlife Service and their ability to protect our planet.   Three times now we have had to stop all other business of the Senate  and devote valuable floor time that we could have used to pass  legislation to confirm or promote military leaders and  [[Page S1731]]  otherwise do the people's business. Instead, we had to stop to debate  the merits of protecting threatened and endangered species from  extinction. That is not a joke--for the folks watching at home--and  this is not an exaggeration either.   Let's review. It was a half a century ago that Congress acknowledged  the reality of habitat destruction and the threats to America's unique  biodiversity. And, yes, Congress gave the Fish and Wildlife Service the  power to administer a process for designating and protecting newly  endangered species. Congress intentionally and purposefully handed the  power over to experts in habitat loss and wildlife biologists--who are  actually educated and trained--to determine which species are most at  risk and what we need to do to protect them.   It is no different than how we regulate prescription drugs, for  example. We rely on the FDA and their experts and their scientists to  protect the American people rather than trying to individually  legislate every single medication. Imagine trying to legislate every  single medication in this body.   So the real effect of these CRAs is to set a precedent for personal  grievances and for the folks who deny the science and prefer gridlock  to prevail. Passage of these CRAs is the equivalent of saying that,  whenever a powerful industry or a lone Member of Congress dislikes a  rule that scientists at the Fish and Wildlife Service issue in the  future, they are entitled to a vote to second-guess and overturn the  actual experts.   I may be wrong, but I am not aware of any wildlife biologists  currently serving in this Senate. At a time when more and more wildlife  species are at risk of extinction, we can't constrain the ability of  the Fish and Wildlife Service from following the science and issuing  rules to protect them or, in the case of the critical habitat  designation CRA, my colleagues are blatantly ignoring the realities of  climate change and limiting our Nation's ability to react and respond  in the years ahead.   I suggest that, rather than grinding Congress to a halt, those of us  who voted to follow the process that Congress itself created is the  responsible way to allow the scientists and experts to do their job.  Rather than ignore the science of the climate crisis, I voted to live  up to the responsibilities that we have as stewards of this great land.   And while this last week Senate Republicans got their way, I am proud  to have a President in the White House who takes seriously our sacred  responsibility to our planet and who refuses to overrule the experts  and the scientists. But I also know that this is not the end of the  CRAs and that our Republican colleagues will attempt to overrule the  Fish and Wildlife Service and choose to put their personal grievances  over progress in Congress.   So when that day comes again--because there will be future attempts-- I will proudly, once again, stand with the experts and vote no.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Supercomputing  for Safer Chemicals Act or the SUPERSAFE Act. Through the use of  supercomputing and artificial intelligence, we have an opportunity to  transform our scientific understanding of the detrimental effects  associated with certain industrial chemical uses and to shift American  commerce towards safer and more sustainable products and manufacturing.   The legislation would establish a SUPERSAFE Consortium to be led by  the Environmental Protection Agency in consultation with the heads of  relevant Federal Agencies, the National Labs, academic and other  research institutions, State agencies, and other entities as determined  by the EPA. The purpose of the SUPERSAFE Consortium is to identify  exposures to toxic substance and chemicals that are safer to use in  commerce.   Specifically, the SUPERSAFE Consortium established by this bill would  use supercomputing, machine learning, and other similar capabilities to  establish rapid approaches for large-scale identification of toxic  substances and the development of safer alternatives to toxic  substances by developing and validating computational toxicology  methods; address the need to identify safe chemicals for use in  consumer and industrial products and in their manufacture to support  the move away from toxic substances and toward safe-by-design  alternatives; and make recommendations on how the information produced  can be applied in risk assessments and other characterizations for use  by the Environmental Protection Agency and other Agencies in regulatory  decisions and by industry in identifying toxic and safer chemicals.   Importantly, establishing a SUPERSAFE Consortium would encourage  interagency collaboration and leverage the best scientific ideas  through inclusion of State agencies and public and academic research  institutions.   Currently, tens of thousands of untested chemicals can be used in  commercial products, resulting in consumer, community, and worker  exposures to potentially toxic chemicals. Too often, there is  insufficient scientific data for evaluating health effects or  identifying safer chemicals, and existing approaches to generating this  data are slow, costly, and rely on animal testing.   We are well poised to address this problem and discover safer  chemicals by establishing a SUPERSAFE Consortium to use supercomputing,  machine learning, and other similar capabilities. These technologies  can be developed and applied to rapidly provide information to evaluate  chemical safety to identify safe chemicals that avoid the chronic  diseases and environmental harm caused by toxic chemicals.   Unfortunately, too many Americans are exposed to toxic chemicals such  as PFAS and lead. Congress has stepped up and provided billions to  remediate toxic exposures, including via the bipartisan infrastructure  law, to address PFAS and lead pollution. Establishing a SUPERSAFE  Consortium in Federal law could help avoid the widespread pollution  that our communities face so we can address potential pollution  challenges before they become widespread.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this bill as  quickly as possible.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Rosen):   S. 1705. A bill to amend the Student Support and Academic Enrichment  Grant program to promote career awareness in accounting as part of a  well-rounded STEM educational experience; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.
