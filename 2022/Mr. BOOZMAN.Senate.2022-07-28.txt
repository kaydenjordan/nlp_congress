 Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Mr. Chairman  and Ranking Member Capito, for your leadership in that this area.   As has been said and should be said many times more, we appreciate  the great work of our staffs in getting this done.   The other thing that is so important is the answers to our problems  need to come from the ground up. Through the Recycling Caucus and  hearings, and the list goes on and on, this is where those answers were  generated--from the people who are out fighting the battles.   We talk a lot about the lack of bipartisanship and things. This is a  great example of people working together for the common good up here.   It is great for the environment in the sense that recycling is not  just gathering. We don't want to have a situation continuing, like we  do now, where so much of that that is gathered actually winds up in the  landfill eventually.   Conservation is the low-hanging fruit. You know, it makes all the  sense in the world to reuse things. It creates a situation where we  lessen the dependence on landfills, things like that. And then, again,  in this age of globalization and things, we really do need to use the  resources that we have and then continue to use the resources as we go  forward.   So we are talking about jobs. We are talking about the environment.  And, for that reason, I very much support and appreciate, as I said,  the leadership of the chairman and the ranking member for their great  effort in pushing this forward.   And, with that, I yield the floor to Senator Cardin--Mr. Chairman.   I yield the floor.
