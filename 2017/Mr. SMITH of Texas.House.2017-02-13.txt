 Mr. Speaker, here is President Trump's report  card after less than a month in office:   The President wants to stop terrorist attacks by conducting  background checks on refugees from countries that are considered  security threats.   The President wants to prevent criminal immigrants from being  released into our neighborhoods where they continue to prey on innocent  Americans.   The President wants to lower the cost of health care and let  individuals choose their own insurance plans.   The President wants to reduce our $500 billion trade deficit and  export goods and services, not jobs.   The President wants to eliminate unnecessary regulations which are a  drag on the economy.   Mr. Speaker, the President's critics oppose all these actions. Only  the people are on the President's side.                            ____________________
