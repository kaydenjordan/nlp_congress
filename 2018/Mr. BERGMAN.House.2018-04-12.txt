 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a balanced  budget amendment to our Constitution.   H.J. Res. 2 proposes an amendment to the Constitution prohibiting  Congress from spending more money than it takes in every year.   At a time when our national debt is over $20 trillion and our yearly  deficits run in the hundreds of billions of dollars, now, now, now is  the time for action.   I came to Congress to make sure that we are leaving a better world  for our kids and for our grandkids, for all our kids and all our  grandkids, and to do so means controlling Federal spending.   Our national debt is one of the greatest security threats, and it is  time to show our constituents and the rest of the world that we are  serious about getting our budget under control.   We can't ignore this problem anymore, and the only way we are going  to accomplish anything is if we all feel as though we have real skin in  the game.   Every individual and business in Michigan's First District has to  live within their financial means. There is absolutely no reason that  the Federal Government should be an exception to that rule. This  constitutional amendment would require Congress do just that: live  within our means.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, this much overdue  legislation.
