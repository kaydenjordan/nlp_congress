 Mr. Speaker, the healthcare proposal proposed by  President Trump and Speaker Ryan raises premiums and deductibles. It  imposes an age tax on older Americans, making their health care  unaffordable. It throws millions--24 million--Americans off of their  insurance. It shifts the cost of health care to the States, and it  covers less and less people.                                time  1015    It raises people's fears and insecurities about what this will do if  they get sick. It ends maternity care. It is quite outrageous when it  tells you that you can't go for emergency services any longer. It would  allow insurance companies to, once again, reimpose lifetime limits and  annual caps. It allows insurance companies to charge women 48 percent  more for the same insurance that any man would pay for.   So why would you be for this? Why? Who benefits? Who benefits?   We are going to provide 400 of the richest families in this Nation  with a $7 million tax cut every year. Those are not my words. Take a  look at what Families USA says. Take a look at what the Center on  Budget and Policy Priorities says about that.   Working people and older Americans are going to pay for a tax cut for  the richest people in this Nation. Older Americans are going to be hit  the hardest. Not only are they going to get an age tax, but they are  going to shift $170 billion out of the Medicare trust fund--a lifeline  for older Americans.   Do you know what? It makes me believe that this is the case: What  does the GOP stand for? Get Old People.   That is what this bill does. That is what people are going to vote  ``yes'' for today. Let me just say this: We have an obligation. We have  an obligation to the people of this country to vote ``no'' today on  this misrepresented bill.
