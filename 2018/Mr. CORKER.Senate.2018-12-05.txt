 Mr. President, it is an honor to be here with Pastor  Louie Giglio, from Atlanta, who pastors the Passion Church there.   I think everyone in this body knows Congress led on an issue to end  modern slavery around the world. That was something that passed this  body a couple of years ago. The appropriators have funded it. We are  well on our way leading the world today in trying to end modern  slavery, where today we have 27 million people around the world in  slavery--more than at any time in the world's history. I can honestly  say the genesis of that, the seed for that, the beginning of that,  started at Passion Church, where he led an effort to make sure people  are aware of this scourge on mankind. I am grateful to him. Millions of  people around the world will be grateful to him and his congregation. I  am honored to know him and be his friend, and I thank him for his  leadership in that regard but also beginning our day in this way. Thank  you so much.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
