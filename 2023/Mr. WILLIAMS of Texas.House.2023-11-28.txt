 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4666) to require the Inspector General of the Small  Business Administration to submit a quarterly report on fraud relating  to certain COVID-19 loans, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4666         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPORT ON FRAUD RELATING TO CERTAIN COVID-19                     LOANS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 60 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, and every 3 months thereafter, the       Inspector General of the Small Business Administration shall       submit to the Committee on Small Business of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Small Business and       Entrepreneurship of the Senate a report on the number of       borrowers engaged in fraud with respect to a covered loan.        (b) Elements.--The report required under subsection (a)       shall include, with respect to the period covered by such       report--        (1) the number and total dollar amount of all covered loans       made;        (2) the number of new cases of fraud and suspected fraud;        (3) the number of fraud cases resolved; and        (4) the types of fraud cases described in paragraphs (2)       and (3).        (c) Covered Loan Defined.--In this section, the term       ``covered loan'' means--        (1) a loan made under paragraphs (36) or (37) of section       7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)); or        (2) a loan made under section 7(b) of such Act (15 U.S.C.       636(b)) in response to COVID-19 during the covered period (as       defined in section 1110(a) of the CARES Act (15 U.S.C.       9009)).        (d) Termination.--This Act and the requirements of this Act       shall terminate on the date that is two years after the date       of the enactment of this Act.       SEC. 2. COMPLIANCE WITH CUTGO.         No additional amounts are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, I say I am anxious for this to happen. I think we  are going to show America that we have some bipartisan legislation that  we can pass from both sides of the aisle. I am thankful that we have  some good legislation, and we will see that that may happen, too.   I rise today in support of H.R. 4666 introduced by my friend from  Florida (Mr. Bean). For any small business owner, once a problem is  identified, they need to get periodic updates until the problem is  fixed. The Small Business Administration's pandemic lending programs  should be held to the same standard.   The PPP and the EIDL Fraud Report Act of 2023 requires the Inspector  General of the SBA to submit quarterly reports to Congress that keep  Congress updated on the ongoing fraud investigations in the Paycheck  Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loans.  [[Page H5910]]    It is estimated that $200 billion in potentially fraudulent COVID-19  EIDL and PPP loans were disbursed by the SBA. This massive loss of  taxpayer dollars is unacceptable. The American people need to know what  the status is of recouping these stolen funds as the SBA's Office of  the Inspector General works through their investigations.   The report will provide Congress the most recent vital information on  the number of both new fraud cases opened, the type of fraud suspected,  and the number of investigations resolved to date.   Tracking the progress of the OIG's actions will be vital for Congress  as we look to piece together the complete picture of how much fraud  truly flowed through the SBA and how many of these funds were able to  be recovered on the back end. This information will be vital to  evaluate the role the SBA should play in future emergencies.   I urge full support from my colleagues on this commonsense bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from the great State of Florida (Mr. Bean).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, with an estimated $200 billion  outstanding in potentially fraudulent COVID-19 EIDL and PPP loans,  there has never been a more critical time for legislation like H.R.  4666.   I thank Representative Bean for his work on this bill, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join our committee in  demanding answers to where this money is and how to rightfully return  it to the American taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4667) to require the Administrator of the Small  Business Administration to issue guidance and rules for lenders and the  Small Business Administration on handling amounts of Paycheck  Protection Loans returned by borrowers, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4667         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Returning Erroneous COVID       Loans Addressing Illegal and Misappropriated Taxpayer Funds       Act'' or the ``RECLAIM Taxpayer Funds Act''.       SEC. 2.

(b) Guidance Requirements.--The guidance required by       subsection (a) shall include--        (1) detailed guidance for borrowers on how to return to the       lender that made a PPP loan to the borrower the unused       amounts of such PPP loan;        (2) detailed guidance for lenders regarding the       responsibilities of lenders, including that a lender must--        (A) accept the return of any unused amounts of any PPP loan       from a borrower or any other source (including law       enforcement) if the lender made such PPP loan;        (B) document the reason for the return of such unused       amounts, the identification number of the PPP loan, the name       of the borrower of the PPP loan, and the name of the person       returning such unused amounts if different than the borrower;        (C) remit such unused amounts to the Administration;        (D) make the guidance described in paragraph (1) available       to borrowers described in such paragraph; and        (E) if the lender made a PPP loan, periodically certify       that the lender has reported and returned to the       Administration all unused amounts of PPP loans returned to       the lender;        (3) detailed guidance for financial institutions holding       funds from a PPP loan on the procedure for returning such       funds to the Administration if the financial institution       suspects the borrower may be committing fraud with respect to       the PPP loan or any other issue for which the financial       institution should return the funds the Administration; and        (4) detailed guidance for borrowers and lenders of PPP       loans, financial institutions described in paragraph (3), and       other relevant individuals and entities on complying with the       requirement to report to the Office of the Inspector General       for the Small Business Administration any information       indicating the occurrence of fraud with respect to a PPP       loan.       SEC. 3. RETURNS HANDLING PROCESS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Small       Business Administration shall issue guidance establishing a       process for the Small Business Administration to track       amounts of PPP loans returned to mitigate the risk of       financial loss to the Federal Government.        (b) Returns Handling Process Requirements.--The process       established under subsection (a) shall require--        (1) the Administration to accept returns of unused amounts       of PPP loans; and        (2) the Administrator to deposit in the general fund of the       Treasury the unused amounts of PPP loans returned to the       Administration.

COMPLIANCE WITH CUTGO.         No additional amounts are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I rise today in full support of H.R. 4667, better known as the  RECLAIM Taxpayer Funds Act, introduced by Representative Salazar of the  great State of Florida. During the COVID-19 pandemic, banks and credit  unions stepped up to administer the Paycheck Protection Program, or  PPP.  [[Page H5912]]  They were able to disburse over $800 billion to small businesses in  need.   I have said that what these financial institutions did in the early  days of the pandemic was a reminder of the car manufacturers in World  War II. They dedicated all their efforts to help support our Nation in  its time of need.   Unfortunately, as we have seen in all the pandemic lending programs,  some opportunistic criminals took advantage of these aid efforts.  Fraudsters were able to steal an estimated $84 billion in these PPP  funds.   While the SBA OIG continues to investigate many of these cases,  lenders themselves have become aware of some of those stolen dollars  sitting at their institutions. However, the OIG and some of these  lenders have said there isn't any clarity on what they need to do to  turn over these ill-gotten funds back to the government.   This bill fixes this problem. It requires the SBA to post guidance to  lenders on how to return fraudulent PPP funds. The SBA would also be  required to work with the Department of Treasury to see that these  funds are returned promptly to the taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to take a  commonsense step forward in returning stolen PPP funds to the  taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Salazar).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the COVID-19  pandemic broke the SBA, and as a result, American taxpayers and our  Nation's  [[Page H5913]]  small businesses have had to foot the bill for the hundreds of billions  of dollars in stolen funds.   I thank Representative Salazar for introducing H.R. 4667 as it  creates a much-needed accountability and transparency with the SBA as  we work to retrieve the taxpayer dollars wrongfully lost.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  us in our fight to reclaim these stolen funds and unanimously support  H.R. 4667.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4668) to amend the Small Business Act to require  the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman to  publish guidance documents for certain rules, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4668         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Providing Opportunities to       Show Transparency via Information Technology Act of 2023'' or       the ``POST IT Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. INCLUSION OF GUIDANCE ON OMBUDSMAN WEBSITE.         (a) Website Requirement.--Section 30 of the Small Business       Act (15 U.S.C. 657) is amended--        (1) in subsection (e)--        (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (B) in paragraph (2), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(3) to the extent practicable, hyperlinks for such       guidance that is designed to set forth policy on a statutory,       regulatory, or technical issue, or an interpretation of such       issue, for any rule for which an agency produces a small       entity compliance guide.''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(g) Protection of Confidential Information.--Subsection       (e) does not require the public availability of information       that is exempt from public disclosure under section 552(b) of       title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the `Freedom       of Information Act').''.        (b) Applicability.--Paragraph (3) of section 30(e) of the       Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657), as added by this section,       shall apply with respect to guidance on, or interpretation       of, a rule for which an agency produces a small entity       compliance guide described under section 212(a)(1) of the       Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (5       U.S.C. 601 note) on or after the date of the enactment of       this Act.       SEC. 3. COMPLIANCE WITH CUTGO.         No additional amounts are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act or the amendments made by this Act.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in full support of H.R. 4668, also known as the POST IT Act,  introduced by Representative Molinaro of the great State of New York.   Small business owners face some of the biggest challenges in  understanding how to comply with Federal regulations. Oftentimes, small  businesses are hiring compliance officers, which are a drag on their  bottom lines, rather than focusing on their core business model and  looking for growth opportunities.   This legislation would make it easier for small businesses to track  the ever-changing agency guidelines on how to comply with any given  regulation. The POST IT Act requires agencies to post their guidance,  and all subsequent changes on how to comply, in a centralized location  on the SBA's Office of the National Ombudsman's website.   Businesses should not have to search through many different websites  to try to find all the latest information on how to comply with any  given requirement. If an agency updates a regulation or puts out more  information, it should be easily accessible for any business to look  up.   I hope this bill is just the first step in much-needed regulation  modernization efforts in the committee. We have seen far too many new  requirements coming from government agencies that are hurting our  Nation's job creators. As businesses continue to deal with high  interest rates and elevated inflation, we should not be adding  additional costs in the form of new regulations.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Molinaro for leading this bill, and  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Molinaro).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   H.R. 4668 is a step in the right direction to lessening the  regulatory burden placed on our Nation's small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Molinaro for his work on this  crucial piece of legislation, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to join us in creating a regulatory environment that allows  Main Street America to thrive.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4670) to amend the Small Business Act to require  reporting on additional information with respect to small business  concerns owned and controlled by women, qualified HUBZone small  business concerns, and small business concerns owned and controlled by  veterans, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4670         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 5. COMPLIANCE WITH CUTGO.         No additional amounts are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act or the amendments made by this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I support H.R. 4670, the Small Business Contracting Transparency Act,  introduced by Congressman Stauber from the great State of Minnesota.   The U.S. Government is one of the largest customers in the world.  They contract out purchases of things as simple as office supplies to  complicated rockets that go into space. Each year, the government sets  a contracting goal that they look to hit so that small businesses can  help service the various needs of the Federal Government.   To be considered a small business in contracting, there are certain  verification procedures to ensure that a small business does, in fact,  qualify. It would be problematic if larger corporations were posing as  small businesses in order to compete for some of the small business  set-aside contracts.   For some of these small business categories, the businessowner simply  gets to self-certify that they are who they say the business  represents. For others, the Small Business Administration or third- party entities do a more rigorous certification process.   Since there isn't a uniform process to verify the small businesses  are who they claim to be, it calls into question the accuracy of the  contracting data that we receive. The Small Business Contracting  Transparency Act brings much-needed insight into these certification  activities and whether the SBA is meeting its requirements.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Congressman Stauber for introducing this bill,  and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5916]]                                     time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4670 provides a necessary  check on the SBA as it brings much needed insight into certification  activities verifying small business contractors and provides further  transparency.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Stauber and Houlahan for leading  this bill. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a  page out of our playbook and put politics aside to unanimously pass  H.R. 4670.   I also thank the Democrats I missed earlier for their participation,  specifically Representatives Mfume, McGarvey, and Scholten.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5427) to prohibit individuals convicted of  defrauding the Government from receiving any assistance from the Small  Business Administration, and for other purposes.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On November 28, 2023, on page H5917, in the first column, the  following appeared: ance from the Small Business Administration,  and for other purposes, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 5427. This  legislation prohibits any individuals convicted of defrauding the  government's COVID-19 lending programs from ever receiving future  financial assistance from the SBA.   When the COVID-19 pandemic hit America, the SBA took on an outsized  role in helping small businesses. They partnered with banks and credit  unions to set up the Paycheck Protection Program that ultimately got  over $800 billion to Main Street to keep businesses from laying off  employees. Additionally, the SBA ran the Economic Injury Disaster Loan  program, better known as the COVID EIDL program, that gave out close to  $480 billion in low interest loans.   While both of these programs were successful in keeping businesses  afloat during the pandemic, we have seen some very troubling data come  out in recent months.                                time  1700    SBA's Office of Inspector General has estimated over $200 billion of  these relief funds were given to fraudulent actors. This means that  roughly 20 percent of all the money that was supposed to help  businesses went to the wrong people, and, unfortunately, we have seen  some estimates show that this 20 percent figure might be on the low  end.   The committee is working to find creative ways to get this money back  to the taxpayers, but in the meantime, we also cannot let those who  committed these crimes off easy. That is where my legislation comes in.  This bill prevents anyone who was convicted of defrauding the SBA's  lending programs from receiving any future financial assistance from  the agency. If someone saw the pandemic as an opportunity to enrich  themselves, then they should never be given the opportunity to utilize  any of these financial programs again.   These criminals took money away from businesses across the country  that were in desperate need of assistance. This bill provides an  additional layer of security for government programs so people who have  taken advantage of past programs cannot commit a similar crime in the  future.   A lot will need to be done to correct all of the issues within the  SBA that allowed these unacceptable levels of fraud to occur, but as  those internal issues are corrected, this bill will help rebuild  confidence in the agency.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from the great State of Missouri (Mr. Alford).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5427 is simple. It needs to  be passed.   I also want to thank my colleague from Maryland (Mr. Mfume) for all  his support working on this bill. I thank him for his support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4480) to require the Administrator of the Small  Business Administration to report on the veterans interagency task  force, to require the Comptroller General of the United States to  report on access to credit for small business concerns owned and  controlled by covered individuals, and for other purposes, as amended.

SEC. 4. COMPLIANCE WITH CUTGO.         No additional amounts are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act or the amendments made by this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of H.R.  4480, also known as the SERV Act, introduced by Representatives Davids  of Kansas and Alford of Missouri.   Our Nation's veterans have an incredible impact on our small business  community. The skills veterans gained in the military make them leaders  uniquely positioned to start and grow successful businesses.  Unfortunately, veterans often face barriers when starting or growing  their businesses which can feel insurmountable. In May, the Committee  on Small Business heard directly from veterans on how access to capital  as well as awareness of available resources are major barriers to them.   The SERV Act seeks to identify these barriers and directs the  Interagency Task Force on Veterans Small Business Development to create  an action plan to improve outreach to veterans informing them of  available resources to address their unique needs. If we are spending  taxpayer dollars to help these individuals, then we must ensure they  are making the greatest impact possible.   Mr. Speaker, I, once again, thank the sponsors of this legislation, I  urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Alford).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4480 is a step in the right  direction. It is about our veterans, and what is more important than  our veterans. Congressman Alford and Congresswoman Davids have it  right. It needs to be passed. We need to pass it tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Velazquez for her support, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
