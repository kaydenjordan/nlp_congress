 Thank you, Mr. President. As we approach the final vote on  [[Page S5786]]  the fiscal year 2018 national defense authorization bill, I would like  to make a few closing comments.   When we began considering this bill last week, Senator McCain and I  were interested in returning to regular order and having debate and  votes on any amendment that needed a vote. We actually started off very  well.   While I disagreed with Senator Paul's amendment to sunset the current  authorization for the use of military force, I am pleased we were able  to follow regular order on his amendment and have a debate. It is my  hope that we can use this as a step to restore regular order going  forward and work together, along with Senator Paul, in drafting a new  AUMF that more precisely addresses the threats we face and resolves the  issue, which is very critical, that Senator Paul has raised; that is,  updating the AUMF.   After the Paul amendment, however, we were unable to come to an  agreement on further votes. As a result, several issues that are  important to both sides were not fully considered. On the Democratic  side, Senators Baldwin, Stabenow, and Donnelly had very important  amendments that would have ensured important protection for American  workers and that our servicemembers receive high-quality, domestically  produced equipment.   In addition, Senator Durbin had an important amendment that supports  the world-class medical research DOD conducts and has a profound impact  on the health of our servicemembers and citizens alike. Senator Warren  would have liked a discussion on the INF Treaty, and Senator Gillibrand  was interested in a full debate on protections for military personnel  who are transgender.   As I indicated, I also know there are Members on the other side of  the aisle who also had important issues they wanted to debate. I regret  we were not able to have those debates and votes.   I am pleased, however, that we are able to include several dozen  agreed-upon amendments in this bill from both Democrats and Republicans  which will strengthen the legislation. In the end, this bill represents  a strong bipartisan effort to provide the military with the resources  they need and the support they deserve.   Moving forward, more work needs to be done. It is clear we need to  find a sustainable, equitable path forward that will end sequestration  and provide the additional resources needed for our current readiness  shortfalls. I look forward to working together to continue to address  the needs of the Department and our servicemembers.   I would like to close by thanking Senator McCain in my remarks about  the NDAA for his leadership in guiding this bill through our committee  markup process and the floor. I believe this bill truly exemplifies  Senator McCain's unrivaled dedication to the men and women of our Armed  Forces. His firm hand and unwavering resolve for a bipartisan approach  were invaluable in achieving a bill that reflects the priorities of  many Members on both sides of the aisle.   Additionally, I would like to thank the committee staff who worked  tirelessly over many weeks to make this bill a reality. I thank the  majority staff director, Chris Brose, and his staff for their hard work  and commitment to a bipartisan process. I would also like to thank my  staff for their expertise and dedication to creating the best bill  possible--Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon Clark, Jonathan Epstein,  Jorie Feldman, Jon Green, Creighton Greene, Ozge Guzelsu, Gary Leeling,  Kirk McConnell, Maggie McNamara, Bill Monahan, Mike Noblet, John Quirk,  Arun Seraphin, and Elizabeth King. Finally, I would like to thank the  floor staff, without whom none of this could be accomplished.   I must say, having completed a truly bipartisan process using regular  order, I am disappointed to hear that my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle would like to bring back the partisan efforts to repeal  the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with preexisting  conditions and decimate Medicare as we know it.   We have already spent so much time this year having this fight--time  we could have spent working on a bipartisan basis to improve our health  care system and lower costs. We voted decisively in July to reject the  partisan bill. With these votes, Senators on both sides of the aisle  decided we would return to regular order and work toward bipartisan  health care solutions that could get at least 60 votes in this body.   As I have highlighted, this kind of bipartisan approach is why we  have been successful in bringing the NDAA to the floor each year, and  Senators Alexander and Murray have been doing just that with respect to  the HELP Committee. They have had four hearings over the last two  weeks, with witnesses from both parties, from Governors to health  insurance commissioners, to leaders in the industry. I have great  confidence in my colleagues and their ability to craft a bipartisan  bill to improve the ACA that a majority of Senators could support. This  is a bipartisan, inclusive process, and I should note, it is undertaken  by one of the two committees that have jurisdiction for health care.   So for my Republican colleagues to now decide, after this critical  work is already underway, that we are going to scratch those efforts  and return instead to a partisan process, in which not even Republican  Senators have had the opportunity to fully review the bill, make  changes or even get analysis of the bill, I think that process is  wrong. Let's not be fooled by the new effort. The legislation would  have the same effects as the other versions of TrumpCare we saw  rejected.   We have heard the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee will hold a hearing on the latest version of TrumpCare. This  is not the right process. It is not representative of the legislative  process.   I would urge my colleagues to reject this approach and, rather,  follow the example I think we have tried to set in NDAA--a bipartisan,  regular process, in which amendments are offered by both sides, in  which debate is undertaken, in which we come to a conclusion based on  60 votes and move forward to improve the country, particularly to  protect the men and women in the armed services.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators  Klobuchar, Brown, King, Franken, and Whitehouse in introducing the  Weekend Voting Act. This bill makes voting in Federal elections easier  and more accessible through one simple change: moving Election Day from  Tuesday to the following Saturday and Sunday in November of an election  year.   We know from surveys and common sense that Tuesday voting stands in  the way of greater voter participation. In 1845, Congress set Tuesday  as Election Day because it was the easiest day for farmers--then  travelling by horse and buggy--to make it to the polls in the course of  their regular Tuesday trips to bring goods to market. Tuesday voting  has no such benefit for farmers, or anyone else, in the 21st Century.  It does, however, force many Americans to choose between their workday  and family responsibilities, and participation in our democratic  process.   According to the Pew Research Center, voter turnout in the United  States regularly lags behind other developed countries, many of which  hold elections on one or more days during the weekend. According to  U.S. Census data, the most consistent reason Americans give for not  voting is that they are too busy to get away from their daily lives to  make it to the polls.   The Weekend Voting Act would give Americans the ability to vote  during times that make better sense for them. Rather than on a Tuesday,  polls would stay open during the first Saturday and Sunday after the  first Friday in November of an election year. States would retain full  autonomy to continue to offer alternatives to Election Day voting, such  as early voting or voting by mail, and States are encouraged to give  special consideration to accommodate weekend religious practices.   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Weekend Voting Act  so that more Americans can take part in our democratic process by  voting at times that work for them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators  Klobuchar, Brown, King, Franken, and Whitehouse in introducing the  Weekend Voting Act.
