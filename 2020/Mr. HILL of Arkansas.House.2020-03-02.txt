 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5931, the Improving FHA  Support for Small Dollar Mortgages Act.   Studies suggest that borrowers of small dollar mortgages, those  amounts under $70,000, may be disproportionately denied when compared  to loans of higher amounts, even when the credit profiles of the  borrowers are similar.   Specifically, the Urban Institute reports that, in 2015, roughly 25  percent of homes purchased for $70,000 or less were financed with a  mortgage compared to 80 percent of houses worth between $70,000 and  $150,000.   If there is such a disproportionate amount of denials, this could be  an issue for families in my district and many others who are trying to  buy a first home, particularly in our rural communities across our  country.   H.R. 5931 is a bipartisan bill sponsored by Representative Clay of  Missouri and Representative Stivers of Ohio and was reported to the  House by the House Financial Services Committee last week. This bill  seeks to better understand what is happening in small dollar mortgage  lending.   This bill asks the fundamental question: Are there borrowers who  otherwise qualify for a mortgage who are being left out of the market  as an unintended consequence of FHA's own rules and regulations?   After all, the FHA mission is to serve creditworthy borrowers without  bias, no matter what the loan size is. If FHA can identify how its own  regulations are hurting borrowers' access to credit and remedy the  problem without affecting the health of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance  Fund, then they should do so.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friends, Mr. Clay and Mr.  Stivers, for bringing this issue to our attention and for their work on  this bill. I would like to take the opportunity to thank my friend from  Guam for managing this bill this afternoon.   H.R. 5931 is a positive example of Congress identifying a problem and  working together to understand the causes and to identify a reasonable  solution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5931, as I say, is a good  example of both sides in this House working together for a worthy  purpose. I support the bill. I urge all my colleagues to support it,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5003.   I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean) for introducing  this legislation.   Our servicemembers put their lives on the line for us every day. The  last thing we want is that, when they are serving, they are to be  distracted.   H.R. 5003 prohibits debt collectors from using threats against the  servicemember's rank or security clearance or threats of prosecution  under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Not only are such practices  unfair, they increase the risk of harm to the servicemember's military  readiness.   During the committee markup of H.R. 5003, Republicans expressed  concerns that there were too many unanswered questions about how this  bill could impact military readiness.   The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers) offered an amendment to direct  the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a study on the  impact of this bill and what its impact is on the timeliness with which  servicemembers are informed about debts and collection, as well as on  military readiness and national security.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the bill's sponsor and Chair Waters in accepting  Mr. Stivers' constructive addition.                                time  1715    This bill is a commonsense approach to ensure that Congress considers  the connection between national security and the protection of  servicemembers from unfair practices.   Mr. Speaker, it is very important today that we thank the Department  of  [[Page H1429]]  Defense and the House Armed Services Committee for their support and  analysis in making this a quality measure for us to consider.   All Americans deserve to be treated with dignity and respect when  faced with repaying a debt. This is especially true for our  servicemembers who fight for our freedoms every day.   This bill will provide important safeguards, and I urge my colleagues  to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I think that was an excellent description of why this bill is needed.  We honor the 1 percent of Americans that go out, put on the uniform,  and serve the other 99 percent of Americans, those who work for our  freedoms every day around the world, 24/7. This is one of the least  things we can do to make servicemembers' lives and the lives of those  military families at the margin better.   I thank my friends for bringing this bill. I appreciate its sponsor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the legislation, H.R. 5932,  which I introduced recently, and I was fortunate to have the Speaker's  assistance on this, my friend from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver, in designing  this legislation.   It is just one issue that relates to a complex set of issues around  China's access to the World Bank and China's engagement in the world as  a creditor.   But H.R. 5932, Ensuring Chinese Debt Transparency Act, would require  the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. executive director  at each of the international financial institutions that it is U.S.  policy to ensure greater transparency in Chinese Government lending to  countries that are also beneficiaries of those international financial  institutions.   Specifically, this bill would require the Secretary to report  annually to Congress on the progress in advancing this policy, and  secondly, lending to foreign countries by entities owned or controlled  by the Chinese Government.   As we know, the international financial institutions include the  International Monetary Fund, the IMF, the World Bank, and the regional  development banks. The IMF lends to foreign countries in order to  resolve balance-of-payments crises, while the development banks finance  projects with the long-term aim of alleviating poverty.   With the growth of China's global presence, there is concern that the  developing nations that borrow from Beijing will become overburdened,  forcing them to be rescued by the IMF or complicating the development  banks' ability to properly underwrite loans for new projects.   Specifically, the Belt and Road Initiative is of significant concern.  The Chinese Belt and Road Initiative is a global development strategy  adopted by the Chinese Government in 2013. It involves infrastructure  development and investments in nearly 70 countries and international  organizations in Asia, Europe, and in Africa.   To date, according to Morgan Stanley's estimates, the Belt and Road  Initiative has committed more than $200 billion with estimates that  China may invest up to $1.3 trillion by 2027. Other estimates have the  current number closer to $400 billion. Either number dwarfs the post- World War II Marshall Plan, which, measured in today's dollars, would  be $130 billion.   However, unlike the Marshall Plan, Belt and Road Initiative financing  can make underwriting assistance difficult or even unworkable for  developing countries as the initiative has opaque financing terms.  China simply doesn't report on this lending in any systematic way, and  there is no evidence that China is adopting international transparency  standards from the multilateral development banks or engages in best  practices to prevent debt traps, corruption, or poor construction  outcomes.   China needs to be held accountable to ensure that it is not taking  advantage of vulnerable economies in these countries. In my view, the  World Bank and the IMF must know the terms and conditions of opaque  Chinese lending, what those entail, when they are considering a  sovereign loan to a country that goes to the World Bank or the IMF for  assistance.   On a trip to the Republic of Congo back in 2017, I witnessed this  firsthand when I saw the burdens and impact of Chinese lending on that  oil-based economy. Now, the Republic of Congo finds itself in the hands  of the IMF in negotiating with them for a payments loan.   This legislation will contribute to that overall accountability by  seeking to secure greater transparency consistent with the principles  of the Paris Club, a group of global creditors, including the United  States, who find workable solutions for nations currently in debt.   In theory, many of the underlying policies in this legislation should  already be practiced; however, due to political insensitivities,  inertia, and other concerns, that doesn't always happen. This  legislation will underscore the United States' leadership and help  develop a global multilateral effort to ensure more scrutiny for China.  As China becomes a major creditor nation, it should be held to a high  standard.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   In conclusion, I would say that this is the way to build a  partnership between the multilateral countries of the world that  support the World Bank and the IMF and have China have more scrutiny on  their opaque terms and conditions, which in turn should allow better  outcomes for our developing nations around the world, less chance of  falling into a debt trap.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I  thank my friend from Missouri for his assistance and my friend from  Guam for managing the bill. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4351. This bipartisan legislation would  require localities to analyze the artificial barriers that local zoning  requirements create that hinder the production of affordable housing.   Republicans agree with our friends across the aisle that the cost of  local zoning rules and regulations at all levels of government often  contribute to the high cost of housing. In fact, according to the  National Association of Home Builders and the National Multifamily  Housing Council, up to 30 percent of the cost of building each unit of  housing can be attributed to these barriers.   The impact of local zoning and regulatory barriers is particularly  apparent in high-cost areas, particularly on the East and West Coasts  of this land, where zoning and regulatory costs can be upward of 50  percent of a total project's cost before it even breaks ground.   Mr. Daryl Carter, founder, chairman, and CEO of Avanath Capital  Management, outlined some of these zoning barriers on behalf of the  National Multifamily Housing Council when he testified before the  Financial Services Committee in April 2019. Examples include onerous  and extended entitlement requirements, excessive impact and linkage  fees, business license taxes, assessment and inspection fees, outdated  minimum parking requirements, and lengthy environmental site  assessments.   These costs prevent sufficient numbers of new housing units from  being built to satisfy demand, driving up housing prices and making  housing even more unaffordable.   It is important to reiterate that this bill doesn't punish  communities or insert the Federal Government into any local zoning  matters. All it does is requests localities that receive Federal  community development funds to report on the policies that they have in  place.   This legislation is a good first step in assisting Congress to better  understand these local barriers to constructing new affordable housing.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1432]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to add my thanks to Congressman Heck and  Congressman Hollingsworth for their leadership on this. It really draws  attention to this issue. It is an issue that comes up before our  committee so frequently, how we lower that cost of housing.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Washington also emphasizing  first-time home buyers and that starter home buyer. It is so important.   I am blessed in greater Little Rock to live in a place that is still  pretty affordable, by national standards, to get that first home and  get started in the right way.   But I think, to look at it on a national basis, I really thank my  friend from Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I have to say, though, he is such a young and dynamic  person, I have never thought of him as a boomer. This Congress will be  a weaker place, a less happy place, because Denny Heck has decided to  step down and return to hearth and home and another way after this  Congress. I want to say here before his friends and our colleagues what  a privilege it has been to serve with him for the past 5 years.   I thank him for the leadership on this bill. I thank my friend from  Guam for managing this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
