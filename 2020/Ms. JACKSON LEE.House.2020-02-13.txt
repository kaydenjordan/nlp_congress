 Madam Speaker, I thank all of the women of America.  I thank the sponsor of this bill. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee and the ranking member for being on the floor. I thank him.   I ask the question: Does anybody see the sense of women not being in  the most powerful document of laws and power of the American people?   Let us be reminded of the words of Abigail Adams: ``I long to hear  that you have declared an independency. And, by the way, in the new  code of laws''--which she is saying to her husband--``which I suppose  it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the  ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors.  Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands.''   I rise enthusiastically to support H.J. Res. 79 and to say to my  colleagues there is no constitutional prohibition for passing this.   We are grandly involved because this is the 1972 passage by the State  of Texas of the equal rights amendment. And here, in 1977, Betty  Friedan and Bella Abzug were in Houston at the 1977 National Women's  Conference that our predecessor, Barbara Jordan, was at.   Let us pass H.J. Res. 79, because, as Abigail Adams said, let's  remember the ladies.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary  and an original cosponsor, I rise in strong and enthusiastic support of  H.J. Res. 79, which eliminates the ratification deadline for the Equal  Rights Amendment and will lead to the long overdue adding of the ERA as  the 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution.   Madam Speaker, I am reminded of the imperative powerfully expressed  on March 31, 1776 in Braintree, Massachusetts in a letter from Abigail  Adams, the future First Lady, to her husband John Adams:         I long to hear that you have declared an independency--and       by the way in the new Code of Laws which I suppose it will be       necessary for you to make I desire you would Remember the       Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your       ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of       the Husbands.    The resolution before us will help enshrine for all time the belief,  promise, and commitment that all men, and women, are created equal and  endowed with by the Creator with the same inalienable rights to life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   We are making real this promise thanks to the bipartisan resolution  introduced by Congresswoman Spiers of California.   The Constitution does not prohibit the action we are taking; in fact,  it permits it since ratification deadlines are not even mentioned, much  less imposed by the Constitution. This resolution reinforces that, the  previous deadline is no bar to passing the ERA.   Under Article V of the Constitution, the Equal Rights Amendment  ``shall be valid to all intents and purposes whenever ratified by the  legislatures of three-fourths of the several states.''   A resolution identical to H.J. Res. 79 has been introduced in the  United States Senate, which I call upon the Senate to take up and pass  forthwith.   Madam Speaker, it is useful to review how we arrived at this moment  in history.   Beginning in the late 1960s, the National Organization for Women  (NOW) devised and began implementing a strategy of pushing for equal  rights through a combination of impact litigation and advocacy for the  Equal Rights Amendment.   I remember this particularly well because in November 1977, the first  National Women's Conference was held in Houston, Texas and attended my  congressional predecessor, the Honorable Barbara Jordan.   The National Women's Conference was inspired by a 1975 United  Nations-sponsored event from two years prior which led President Gerald  Ford to establish a national commission to investigate women's issues.   Congress later voted to provide $5 million to fund the organization  of regional conferences and to hold a national gathering at the  conclusion, the result of these efforts was the National Women's  Conference meant to unite all women and give them an opportunity to  voice their hopes for the future of the government.   I remember that Phyllis Schlafly of the conservative Eagle Forum  organized and came to Houston to lead backlash demonstration protesting  the ERA and the women's movement, claiming that the ERA would force  women to give up their right to be supported by their husbands, and  subject them to the military. draft and deployment to Vietnam.   That was the launch of the conservative counter-offensive to derail  ratification of the ERA and the beginning of the schism that has seen  equality between the sexes and expanding the economic, privacy, and  political rights of women subject to increasing partisan debate and  action that is continues to the present day.   In 1970, Congresswoman Martha Griffiths of Michigan filed a discharge  petition in the House to bring the ERA to the floor, after the  Judiciary Committee consistently refused to act on it.   The discharge petition was adopted, and the ERA passed the House by a  wide margin.   The Senate Judiciary Committee also held several days of hearings in  1970 on its version of the ERA but it failed to gain enough votes that  year.   On October 12, 1971, the House voted by 354-24 to approve a version  of the ERA that stated:   Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United  States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each house  concurring therein), that the following article is proposed as an  amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be  valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when  ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States  within seven years of its submission by the Congress:   Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or  abridged by the United States or any State on account of sex.   Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by  appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.   Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date  of ratification.   On March 22, 1972, the Senate passed the ERA by a vote of 84-8.   The following month, Madam Speaker, I graduated from college in the  first undergraduate class of women to attend Yale University in  September 1969.   I was a member of the group of 250 upper-class women who transferred  to Yale University, a number that eventually led to 1,500 women being  admitted over the years, in addition to the 4,000 male students.   Between September 12-14, 1969 undergraduate women students arrived on  campus and at that time, 48 of 817 FAS faculty were women and only two  had tenure.   I am proud to be a part of the history of Yale University and had the  opportunity to speak about my experience at the 50th Anniversary last  year.   The presence of women at Yale, which had been an all-male institution  was a sign of the change that was sweeping the nation.   I first arrived at Yale with the anticipation and anxiety of any  college student arriving on campus for the first time.   This was an extraordinary milestone--both for Yale and for us young  women.   But being a ``first'' is not all that people may assume that it is.   In the centennial year of the 19th Amendment, on January 15, 2020,  the Virginia General Assembly became the 38th state to vote to ratify  the Equal Rights Amendment, the magic number needed to become enshrined  in the Constitution.   Because of the ERA, women are finally included in our Constitution,  making them equal to men under law.   A vote to eliminate the ratification deadline for the ERA is a vote  for equality; a vote against the measure is a vote to preserve the  legacy of sex discrimination.   Women will not continue to be second-class citizens in their own  country.   The absence of the ERA has meant that women can be paid less for  their work, violated with impunity, and discriminated against simply  for being women.   Women made up more than 6 in 10 seniors who lived in poverty last  year, with the poverty rate for senior women at 11 percent.   The average Social Security benefit for women 65 and older is about  $14,270 per year, compared to about $18,375 for men 65 and older.   In the 116th Congress, women hold just 23.6 percent of seats in the  U.S. Congress.   In 2019, just 33 Fortune 500 CEOs are women, a new record.   While women-owned businesses account for 42 percent of all firms,  women-owned business account for just 8 percent of the total private  sector workforce and 4.3 percent of total revenue.   Some legal scholars note the location of the deadline in the preamble  is important, because the ERA's deadline was not part of the text that  the states voted on when they ratified the amendment.   Other scholars argue that the deadline itself is unconstitutional  because Article V of the  [[Page H1134]]  Constitution does not include mention of deadlines.   A close reading and clear understanding of the Constitution leads  inescapably to the conclusion that when the Framers considered a time  period to be of the essence, they specified the time period clearly in  the document itself.   Moreover, in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939), the Supreme  Court rejected the idea that Article V contains an implied limitation  period for ratifications.   Madam Speaker, as a country founded on principles of liberty, justice  and equality, and a global leader in formulating international human  rights standards, the United States need to pass the ERA to meet basic  standards for women who are denied equal access to legal rights and  protections.   Too many women in the United States inexplicably lag behind  international human rights standards and it is a myth that women in the  United States already enjoy all of the expected standards of rights and  protections afforded under America.   The reality is, women in the United States experience continued  discrimination and daunting disparities that prevent them from fully  participating as equal members of society.   For example, women have risen to some of the highest levels of  legislative and executive representation over the years, yet with 20%  of Congressional Members and an average of 24.9% of state legislatures,  but the United States ranks #72 in the global market of women  represented in public and political positions.   While the number of women justices has significantly increased, women  litigants' access to justice is severely limited.   Although women vote in higher percentages than men, women's access to  voting is under attack in many states where increased voter ID  requirements and voter purges pose unprecedented barriers.   Although women constitute nearly half of the US labor force, at a  participation rate of 57%, equal economic opportunity is severely  lacking given deficient or nonexistent mandatory standards for  workplace accommodations for pregnant women, post-natal mothers and  persons with care responsibilities.   What also remains a shameful truth in America, is the gender wage gap  which has remained at or near 21% over the past decade.   And women with higher levels of education experience the largest  earning gaps, as do minority women regardless of educational  attainment.   The percentage of women in poverty has increased over the past  decade, from 12.1% to 14.5%, with a higher rate of poverty than men and  women are exposed to higher rates of homelessness and violence without  adequate protections in place in shelters and housing support options.   Women in detention facilities throughout the country also experience  increasingly high rates of over-incarceration, sexual violence,  shackling while pregnant, solitary confinement, lack of alternative  custodial sentencing for women with dependent children, and  insufficient access to health care and re-entry programs.   Migrant women traveling to the U.S., many victims of trafficking and  violence, including sexual violence, are kept in detention centers with  children for prolonged periods of time.   The U.N. has reported that women, particularly black and LBTQ women,  in the U.S. experience police brutality and increased incidents of  homicide by police.   Even though women own over one-third of commercial businesses in the  United States, primarily in small and medium sized businesses, these  businesses face greater barriers in obtaining low cost capital from  sources such as the SBA--which awards less than 5% of federal contracts  to women-owned business.   Finally, one of the most alarming deficiencies for women in America  is the inability to access basic health care and the imposition of  devastating barriers to reproductive health and rights.   Too many women are suffering dire and deadly consequences.   Between 1990 and 2013, the maternal mortality rate for women in the  U.S. has increased by 136%.   Black women are nearly 4 times more likely to die in childbirth, and  states with high poverty rates have a 77% higher maternal mortality  rate.   The United States deserves to much better.   It is unacceptable that women in America are facing a health care  crisis so dire that the global community is denouncing it as a human  rights violation.   Sadly, the direction States are taking will only further dismantle  women's access to affordable and trustworthy reproductive healthcare.   While clinics are shutting down at drastic rates throughout the  country, devastating restrictions and barriers imposed throughout Texas  strike at the core of this abomination.   A Texas statute known as HB2 (House Bill 2), was enacted several  years ago under false claims to promote women's health, when in fact it  only set in motion dangerous restrictions on women's access to  reproductive health care.   In addition to constant attacks on funding for reproductive health  care clinics, abortion providers in Texas were forced to undergo  impossible million-dollar renovations and upgrades.   Denying hundreds of thousands of women health care services in Texas,  nearly half of all reproductive health care clinics were forced to shut  down, and now only 10 remain in the second largest state in the  country.   No woman in America should be denied the dignity of being ability to  make choices about her body and healthcare.   Access to safe, legal and unhindered healthcare must be realized by  all women.   These simple facts can no longer be denied, and hypocrisy can no  longer be tolerated.   A woman's personal autonomy over her own body and her right to choose  whether to bear or beget a child is a constitutionally protected  fundamental right.   More than 40 years ago in the landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, 410  U.S. 113, (1973), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that the right to  privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment extends to a  woman's decision to have an abortion.   We cannot ignore the obvious hypocrisy of imbalanced protection and  access to fundamentally protected rights for women in America when it  is easier to purchase and lawfully possess a firearm--even for a person  on the terrorist watchlist--than it is for a woman to exercise her  constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy.   Madam Speaker, this is not fair, and it is not right.   And with the ERA added to the Constitution, it will also not be  lawful.   Madam Speaker, Congress had the authority to extend the deadline and  it chose to do in 1979; a fortiori, it has the power to eliminate the  deadline today.   And that is the right, just, and moral thing to do.   I urge all Members to stand on the right side of history and join me  in voting to pass H.J. Res. 79 so that the Equal Rights Amendment can  take its rightful place as the 28th Amendment to the Constitution of  the United States.
