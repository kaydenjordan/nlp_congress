 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further  proceedings.    Mr. President, yesterday Chairman Shelby, Ranking  Member Leahy, and their House counterparts continued finalizing their  legislative proposal to fund the government. Their negotiated solution  would wrap up this year's appropriations and avoid another partial  government shutdown.   As our colleagues hammer out the final details, I would like to thank  them again for their cooperative, bipartisan efforts that have brought  us to this point. The agreement reached on Monday was achieved because  the conference committee set aside far-left poison pills and utterly  absurd demands. None of these radical nonstarters was allowed to  torpedo the process.   Notwithstanding weeks of over-the-top rhetoric from Speaker Pelosi,  the agreement did not cave to the far-left demand that no more than a  single dollar go toward new barriers on the southern border--no,  indeed, it provides well over a billion such dollars. The negotiators  also prevented last-minute efforts to hamstring the U.S. Immigrations  and Customs Enforcement with an unprecedented statutory limit on their  ability to detain criminal aliens in the interior of our country.   Instead, here is what their agreement does provide. It provides  another significant downpayment on the President's plan to secure our  Nation's borders with new physical barriers and keep American  communities safe. It provides nearly $1.4 billion for new barriers in  the Border Patrol's highest priority areas--enough to build nearly  twice as many miles as were funded last year. It gives ICE the capacity  and the flexibility to continue responding to surges in illegal  immigration. It continues to provide the President with appropriate  reprogramming authority, so he can direct additional funding toward  urgent homeland security priorities should circumstances require. Of  course, in addition to all this, the legislation will wrap up all our  outstanding regular appropriations bills and get the entire Federal  Government funded the right way.   It goes without saying that neither side is getting everything it  wants. That is the way it goes in divided government. If the text of  the bill reflects the principles agreed to on Monday, it won't be a  perfect deal, but it will be a good deal.   I hope that our colleagues will complete the process of turning these  principles into legislation soon and final text that can become law  before this Friday's deadline.   We can't let any unrelated, cynical, partisan plays get in the way of  finishing this important process. I understand, for example, that  Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats are apparently objecting, believe it  or not, to a modest extension of the Violence Against Women Act. They  want this authority to expire on Friday.   Republicans believe that we should follow standard procedure and  extend  [[Page S1286]]  this important legislation through the end of the fiscal year, which is  about 7 months. There are new chairmen in this Congress of both the  Senate and House Judiciary Committees, and a modest extension of this  authority would allow them to work on a longer term reauthorization of  this important law. In addition, a modest extension of this law is  consistent with how this matter has been handled in the past. Every  time a continuing resolution was necessary in the past Congress,  Republicans made sure it included an extension of VAWA.   I don't know what cynical ploy my Democratic colleagues may be trying  to pull here, but surely no political maneuvering should be worth  letting the Violence Against Women Act lapse this Friday, 2 days from  now. It is time to get this done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as I alluded to earlier this week, I  have a feeling this conference is just getting started discussing  Speaker Pelosi's signature bill, H.R. 1. I, for one, am eager to  continue shining the spotlight on the Democrat Politician Protection  Act and asking why, exactly, Washington Democrats are so intent on  assigning themselves a whole lot more power over what American citizens  can say about politics, how we can say it, and how we cast our ballots.   Remember, among the many fairly blatant power plays built into this  legislation is a naked attempt to turn our neutral Federal Election  Commission into a partisan weapon. The FEC is a body that, since  Watergate and for obvious reasons, has had an even-numbered membership  and equal division between the two parties. Enforcement and penalty  require both parties to agree, or at least one Commissioner from one  party has to agree with three Commissioners of the other party. This is  meant to ensure that complaints are evaluated on their substance, not  for purely political considerations.   I guess Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues are tired of playing fair  and trying to persuade the old-fashioned way because the Democrat  Politician Protection Act would take the FEC down to a five-member body  and give sitting Presidents--listen to this one--it would give sitting  Presidents the power to appoint the Chairperson. They would turn the  FEC into a nakedly partisan body and give the sitting President the  power to appoint the Chairperson--where his or her party would have a  3-to-2 advantage--who holds the keys to determine whom to investigate  and what enforcement to pursue.   The evenness of the FEC is a vital way to ensuring that Americans'  political speech and campaigns for public office are regulated fairly  and evenhandedly. Of course, that needs to be done on a bipartisan  basis, but the Democrats want to throw that right out the window and  carve out a partisan majority on this crucial Commission.   This proposal is outrageous enough on its face, but just wait until  you hear about all the new things the Democrat Politician Protection  Act would let this newly partisan FEC actually do.   First, they turn it over to the party of the President, so they have  a clear majority to go after the minority. But let's see what they can  do. There are incredibly vague new standards that seem tailor-made to  give this partisan FEC the maximum latitude to penalize or silence  certain speech. You begin to get the picture. Of course, this partisan  FEC is going to want to silence the voices of its opponents.   Let me give a few examples.   The newly partisan FEC would be handed the ability to determine what  kind of speech is ``campaign-related''--growing its jurisdiction and  widening its bureaucratic wingspan over more of the public discourse,  including issues of the day and not just elections.   Private citizens, for example, would be required to make the  government aware of times they spend even small amounts of money in  engaging in First Amendment activities. Private citizens have to notify  the government if they are going to engage in spending small amounts of  money on First Amendment activities--on expressing themselves--or they  will face penalties. More speech would fall into this category whereby  Americans would have to dutifully notify Federal bureaucrats that they  are speaking their minds or else pay a fine. To put it another way, it  is free speech as long as you fill out government forms and mail a  couple of carbon copies to Washington.   In other cases, the Democrats want to impose stunningly vague, broad,  and potentially unconstitutional restrictions on the abilities of all  kinds of advocacy groups--on all sides of the political spectrum--to  exercise their constitutional right to speak out about elected  politicians and their positions on substantive issues.   Let's go over that again because I know this is a technical subject.   Under the guise of cracking down on ``super PAC coordination,'' the  Democrats want to give a partisan FEC new powers to prohibit advocacy  groups from weighing in on politicians' job performances and the issues  of the day under a broad set of new conditions. Washington Democrats  want individual American citizens, civic groups, trade associations,  labor unions, and nonprofits to face more restrictions, more hurdles,  and more potential penalties for daring to have opinions about the  political races that decide who goes to Washington in the first place.   Call me old-fashioned, but I remember when both political parties  were more interested in trying to win debates than in trying to shut  down debates. This will be an FEC designed to stifle free speech and  tilt the playing field in the direction of the President's party. I  remember when constitutionally minded leaders on both sides of the  aisle would have recoiled at efforts to chill or even to prohibit a  private citizen's ability to speak.   Let's not forget, in every one of these cases, when these fuzzy, new  lines and vague rules need enforcing, who has the final say? Why, it is  the newly partisan Federal Election Commission that determines who gets  to speak and who doesn't. My Democratic colleagues are trying to muddy  the rule book and mount a hostile takeover of the referees all at the  same time.   Let me just close with this. Back in 1974, as the creation of the FEC  was debated here in this Chamber, California Democratic Senator Alan  Cranston gave this warning: ``The FEC has such a potential for abuse in  our democratic society that the President should not be given power  over the Commission.''   Wise words.   Back then, a California Democrat was warning against a partisan  takeover of the American electoral system. It is the distinguished  Member of the House from San Francisco, Speaker Pelosi, who is now,  today, cheerleading for that very change.   The Democratic Party has changed its views on this subject a lot in  the last 45 years, but the purpose of the FEC has not changed one bit,  and neither has the importance of the First Amendment.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was  ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S.J. Res. 8         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) the October 2018 report entitled ``Special Report on       Global Warming of 1.5 C'' by the Intergovernmental Panel on       Climate Change and the November 2018 Fourth National Climate       Assessment report found that--        (A) human activity is the dominant cause of observed       climate change over the past century;        (B) a changing climate is causing sea levels to rise and an       increase in wildfires, severe storms, droughts, and other       extreme weather events that threaten human life, healthy       communities, and critical infrastructure;        (C) global warming at or above 2 degrees Celsius beyond       pre-industrialized levels will cause--        (i) mass migration from the regions most affected by       climate change;        (ii) more than $500,000,000,000 in lost annual economic       output in the United States by the year 2100;        (iii) wildfires that, by 2050, will annually burn at least       twice as much forest area in the western United States than       was typically burned by wildfires in the years preceding       2019;        (iv) a loss of more than 99 percent of all coral reefs on       Earth;        (v) more than 350,000,000 more people to be exposed       globally to deadly heat stress by 2050; and        (vi) a risk of damage to $1,000,000,000,000 of public       infrastructure and coastal real estate in the United States;       and        (D) global temperatures must be kept below 1.5 degrees       Celsius above pre-industrialized levels to avoid the most       severe impacts of a changing climate, which will require--        (i) global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from       human sources of 40 to 60 percent from 2010 levels by 2030;       and        (ii) net-zero global emissions by 2050;        (2) because the United States has historically been       responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas       emissions, having emitted 20 percent of global greenhouse gas       emissions through 2014, and has a high technological       capacity, the United States must take a leading role in       reducing emissions through economic transformation;        (3) the United States is currently experiencing several       related crises, with--        (A) life expectancy declining while basic needs, such as       clean air, clean water, healthy food, and adequate health       care, housing, transportation, and education, are       inaccessible to a significant portion of the United States       population;        (B) a 4-decade trend of wage stagnation,       deindustrialization, and anti-labor policies that has led       to--        (i) hourly wages overall stagnating since the 1970s despite       increased worker productivity;        (ii) the third-worst level of socioeconomic mobility in the       developed world before the Great Recession;        (iii) the erosion of the earning and bargaining power of       workers in the United States; and        (iv) inadequate resources for public sector workers to       confront the challenges of climate change at local, State,       and Federal levels; and        (C) the greatest income inequality since the 1920s, with--        (i) the top 1 percent of earners accruing 91 percent of       gains in the first few years of economic recovery after the       Great Recession;        (ii) a large racial wealth divide amounting to a difference       of 20 times more wealth between the average White family and       the average Black family; and        (iii) a gender earnings gap that results in women earning       approximately 80 percent as much as men, at the median;        (4) climate change, pollution, and environmental       destruction have exacerbated systemic racial, regional,       social, environmental, and economic injustices (referred to       in this section as ``systemic injustices'') by       disproportionately affecting indigenous peoples, communities       of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities,       depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers,       women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities,       and youth (referred to in this section as ``frontline and       vulnerable communities'');        (5) climate change constitutes a direct threat to the       national security of the United States--        (A) by impacting the economic, environmental, and social       stability of countries and communities around the world; and        (B) by acting as a threat multiplier;        (6) the Federal Government-led mobilizations during World       War II and the New Deal created the greatest middle class       that the United States has ever seen, but many members of       frontline and vulnerable communities were excluded from many       of the economic and societal benefits of those mobilizations;       and        (7) a new national, social, industrial, and economic       mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the       New Deal era is a historic opportunity--        (A) to create millions of good, high-wage jobs in the       United States;  [[Page S1328]]         (B) to provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and       economic security for all people of the United States; and        (C) to counteract systemic injustices.       SEC. 2. GREEN NEW DEAL POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States that--        (1) it is the duty of the Federal Government to create a       Green New Deal--        (A) to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a       fair and just transition for all communities and workers;        (B) to create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure       prosperity and economic security for all people of the United       States;        (C) to invest in the infrastructure and industry of the       United States to sustainably meet the challenges of the 21st       century;        (D) to secure for all people of the United States for       generations to come--        (i) clean air and water;        (ii) climate and community resiliency;        (iii) healthy food;        (iv) access to nature; and        (v) a sustainable environment; and        (E) to promote justice and equity by stopping current,       preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of       indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant       communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural       communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the       elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth       (referred to in this section as ``frontline and vulnerable       communities'');        (2) the goals described in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of       paragraph (1) (referred to in this section as the ``Green New       Deal goals'') should be accomplished through a 10-year       national mobilization (referred to in this section as the       ``Green New Deal mobilization'') that will require the       following goals and projects--        (A) building resiliency against climate change-related       disasters, such as extreme weather, including by leveraging       funding and providing investments for community-defined       projects and strategies;        (B) repairing and upgrading the infrastructure in the       United States, including--        (i) by eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions       as much as technologically feasible;        (ii) by guaranteeing universal access to clean water;        (iii) by reducing the risks posed by climate impacts; and        (iv) by ensuring that any infrastructure bill considered by       Congress addresses climate change;        (C) meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United       States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy       sources, including--        (i) by dramatically expanding and upgrading renewable power       sources; and        (ii) by deploying new capacity;        (D) building or upgrading to energy-efficient, distributed,       and ``smart'' power grids, and ensuring affordable access to       electricity;        (E) upgrading all existing buildings in the United States       and building new buildings to achieve maximum energy       efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort,       and durability, including through electrification;        (F) spurring massive growth in clean manufacturing in the       United States and removing pollution and greenhouse gas       emissions from manufacturing and industry as much as is       technologically feasible, including by expanding renewable       energy manufacturing and investing in existing manufacturing       and industry;        (G) working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in       the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas       emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is       technologically feasible, including--        (i) by supporting family farming;        (ii) by investing in sustainable farming and land use       practices that increase soil health; and        (iii) by building a more sustainable food system that       ensures universal access to healthy food;        (H) overhauling transportation systems in the United States       to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the       transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible,       including through investment in--        (i) zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing;        (ii) clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and        (iii) high-speed rail;        (I) mitigating and managing the long-term adverse health,       economic, and other effects of pollution and climate change,       including by providing funding for community-defined projects       and strategies;        (J) removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and       reducing pollution by restoring natural ecosystems through       proven low-tech solutions that increase soil carbon storage,       such as land preservation and afforestation;        (K) restoring and protecting threatened, endangered, and       fragile ecosystems through locally appropriate and science-      based projects that enhance biodiversity and support climate       resiliency;        (L) cleaning up existing hazardous waste and abandoned       sites, ensuring economic development and sustainability on       those sites;        (M) identifying other emission and pollution sources and       creating solutions to remove them; and        (N) promoting the international exchange of technology,       expertise, products, funding, and services, with the aim of       making the United States the international leader on climate       action, and to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal;        (3) a Green New Deal must be developed through transparent       and inclusive consultation, collaboration, and partnership       with frontline and vulnerable communities, labor unions,       worker cooperatives, civil society groups, academia, and       businesses; and        (4) to achieve the Green New Deal goals and mobilization, a       Green New Deal will require the following goals and       projects--        (A) providing and leveraging, in a way that ensures that       the public receives appropriate ownership stakes and returns       on investment, adequate capital (including through community       grants, public banks, and other public financing), technical       expertise, supporting policies, and other forms of assistance       to communities, organizations, Federal, State, and local       government agencies, and businesses working on the Green New       Deal mobilization;        (B) ensuring that the Federal Government takes into account       the complete environmental and social costs and impacts of       emissions through--        (i) existing laws;        (ii) new policies and programs; and        (iii) ensuring that frontline and vulnerable communities       shall not be adversely affected;        (C) providing resources, training, and high-quality       education, including higher education, to all people of the       United States, with a focus on frontline and vulnerable       communities, so that all people of the United States may be       full and equal participants in the Green New Deal       mobilization;        (D) making public investments in the research and       development of new clean and renewable energy technologies       and industries;        (E) directing investments to spur economic development,       deepen and diversify industry and business in local and       regional economies, and build wealth and community ownership,       while prioritizing high-quality job creation and economic,       social, and environmental benefits in frontline and       vulnerable communities, and deindustrialized communities,       that may otherwise struggle with the transition away from       greenhouse gas intensive industries;

and        (B) by acting as a threat multiplier;        (6) the Federal Government-led mobilizations during World       War II and the New Deal created the greatest middle class       that the United States has ever seen, but many members of       frontline and vulnerable communities were excluded from many       of the economic and societal benefits of those mobilizations;       and        (7) a new national, social, industrial, and economic       mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the       New Deal era is a historic opportunity--        (A) to create millions of good, high-wage jobs in the       United States;  [[Page S1328]]         (B) to provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and       economic security for all people of the United States; and        (C) to counteract systemic injustices.
