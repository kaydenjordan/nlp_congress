 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3178,  the Medicare Part B Improvement Act.   I am pleased that the bill before us today includes legislation that  I introduced with my good friend Pat Tiberi from Ohio, the Medicare  Part B Home Infusion Services Temporary Transitional Payment Act.   Listening to Mr. Tiberi and Mr. Neal, I believe what they say should  resonate across the Hill. This can't be one and done. Bipartisanship is  something that should be contagious, particularly as we are talking  about a healthcare event which is important and may mean life or death  to many of our citizens.    Home infusion is an essential treatment option for individuals  suffering from many, many debilitating diseases like cancer, congestive  heart failure, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The 21st  Century Cures Act, which became law last year, correctly adjusted  payments for home infusion drugs and would establish a new home  infusion nursing benefit within Medicare beginning in 2021.   However, we have heard concerns that the payment adjustment going  into effect before the nursing benefit is implemented could jeopardize  access to home infusion in the interim. The bill that Congressman  Tiberi from Ohio and I introduced would address that concern by  creating a temporary nursing benefit until the new permanent benefit  can be implemented.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3178.
