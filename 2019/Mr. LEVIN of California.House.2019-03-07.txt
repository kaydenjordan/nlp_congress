 Mr. Speaker, as the Congress Member for  California's 49th District, it is my distinct honor to represent over  700,000 Californians from North County San Diego and south Orange  County.   I have met countless constituents across the district who do  incredible work to make our community stronger, and I am proud to serve  them in Congress.   With so many outstanding constituents, I thought it would be  appropriate to start a new Constituent of the Month program to  recognize individuals who have gone above and beyond to help their  neighbors, give back to their community, and make our country stronger.   For our first constituent of the month, I am thrilled to recognize  Mr. Shelby Jacobs of Oceanside, a retired aerospace engineer who worked  for 40 years on NASA's Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.   Mr. Jacobs served in a number of roles, including project manager of  the  [[Page H2511]]  Apollo-Soyuz orbiter and designed a breakthrough camera used to capture  iconic images of a rocket separation on Apollo 6 in 1968.   As an African American in an industry with few people of color at the  time, Mr. Jacobs faced significant difficulties, including unequal pay  and, often, unfair treatment.   Now Mr. Jacobs serves as the role model he never had for himself,  showing young people of color what they can achieve in the face of  racism, discrimination, and inequality of opportunity, and calling for  action to address injustices that still exist today.   He told the San Diego Union Tribune: ``It's important to be a  pioneer, but I want people to understand that while we appreciate the  progress, things need to be done to address the inequality. That's  something that was there when I started and it's still happening today  right up to the very top level of our government.''   Mr. Jacobs' story has helped highlight other ``Hidden Figures'' who  have gone without recognition, particularly people of color and women,  for their extraordinary contributions to our country.   I have no doubt that Mr. Jacobs' efforts to touch the lives of young  people and address inequality has had a profound impact on our  community and will continue to do so.   Shelby Jacobs is an inspiration to me and so many others, and I am  proud to call him our first Constituent of the Month.                            ____________________
