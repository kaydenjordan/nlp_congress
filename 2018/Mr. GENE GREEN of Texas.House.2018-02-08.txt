 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on the  morning of Thursday, February 8, 2018, due to personal circumstances.  If I had been able to vote, I would have voted as folows:   On passage of H.R. 1153, the Mortgage Choice Act, I would have voted  ``nay.''   On the approval of the Journal, I would have voted ``nay.''                             personal explanation
