 Mr. President, first, I heard the remarks of the Senator  from Illinois. It is a hope that we can change the way the Senate  operates and do more amendments and do more debating on the floor. We  haven't seen much give from some of our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle, but hopefully that could and will happen.   Now, about remarks here, every day, it seems, for the past week or  so, I have come to the floor ready to talk about the merits of  bipartisan legislation we have been drafting, not wanting to be  critical at all. Then I listen to the Republican leader. The leader's  remarks just about every day this week as he has opened the Senate have  been so nastily partisan and in so many ways false that I have no  choice but to correct the record as the Democratic leader.   The Republican leader's accusation that the blame for this bill's  delay lies totally on one side is just ridiculous. It is ``Alice in  Wonderland'' thinking. It defies all the facts as to what we have seen.  Then his comparison--that the agreement we are voting on today and the  most recent Republican offer are so similar--is absurd. The two bills  are nothing alike, and I had to point that out several times.   I have a chart here.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this chart printed in  the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   BIPARTISAN EMERGENCY COVID RELIEF LEGISLATION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES ON                      McCONNELL'S INADEQUATE PROPOSAL ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  New Bipartisan        December 1 GOP             Item                Relief Agreement          Proposal ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Unemployment Insurance......         $300 per week    $0 enhanced UI and                                    enhanced UI and    program extensions                                      other program    end on January 31,                                 extensions through                  2021                                     March 14, 2021 Direct Payments.............

How about direct payments? This bill has $600 per individual, $1,200  per married couple, $600 child dependent. Many of us didn't think that  was enough, but it is in the bill. Do you know how much was in the  Republican leader's proposal? Zero.   Unemployment insurance. This bill that we are voting on has $300 per  week of enhanced UI and other program extensions through March 14. What  does the Republican leader's bill have? Zero enhanced UI. Program  extensions end January 31.   This bill has $13 billion in SNAP; the Republican leader's bill,  zero.   This bill has $25 billion in rental assistance; the Republican  leader's bill, zero.   This bill has $45 billion in transportation for airlines and mass  transit and buses and airports and highways. What does the Republican  leader's bill have? Zero.   This bill has, very importantly, money for community development  financial institutions and minority institutions, $12 billion. What  does the Republican leader's bill have? Zero.   SBA grants, $20 billion this year; Republican leader's bill, zero.   Debt payments and enhancements for SBA. This bill, $5.5 billion;  Republican bill, zero.   SAMHSA funding for mental health and substance use disorder. This  bill, $4.25 billion; Republican leader's bill, zero.   NIH COVID research, $1.25 billion; Republican bill, zero.   Broadband so homes can get broadband. This bill, $7 billion;  Republican leader's bill, zero.   The list could go on. There is a complete difference between the two  bills.   We all know as well that the Republican leader, who blames Democrats  for delay, said for several months that the Senate should be on pause.  As Democrats were demanding more action, the Republican leader was  unmoved. The Republican leader's answer was that 20 Republican Senators  wanted to do nothing more at all. When he finally proposed legislation,  it was completely partisan, insufficient, and littered with poison  pills.   I forgot to add one thing that was in the leader's bill but not in  this bill--the broad corporate liability immunity provision, which the  Senator from Illinois tried to straighten out. Another huge  difference--a poison pill.   So when the leader finally proposed legislation because of public  pressure to do something, it was partisan--no Democratic input, zero-- insufficient, much too little in so many areas, as I mentioned, and  littered with poison pills designed to ensure the bill would fail. Most  notably was a provision to give corporations, no matter how egregious  their behavior, sweeping immunity from legal accountability. Leader  McConnell said on the floor that for Republicans, corporate immunity  was a red line.   And he blames the Democrats, as he did again today, for why this bill  is being debated now? It is just turning truth on its head. It is like  ``Alice in Wonderland.''   Even in the recent negotiations, the Republican majority made an  eleventh hour demand that had nothing to do with helping people during  this pandemic but, rather, sabotaged the incoming Biden  administration's recovery effort and restricted the Federal Reserve's  ability to save jobs and right the economy in a time of crisis.   Thankfully, the agreement we reached contains neither the leader's  corporate immunity provision nor Senator Toomey's last-minute provision  to handicap the Fed's authority to stabilize the economy in a crisis.  And it will do a whole lot of good, besides, some of the programs I  mentioned.   Look, after months of tense and difficult negotiations, we have this  agreement. It is not as large as Democrats want. It is certainly larger  than what many Republicans want. That is the nature of compromise. It  does us no good to end the year with the kind of bitter, partisan  fighting that has defined too much of the year. In a new session and  under a new administration, we can and should do better because our job  is far from over.   The bill today is a good bill. Today is a good day, but it is  certainly not the end of the story. It cannot be the end of the story.  Anyone who thinks this bill is enough doesn't know what is going on in  America. Anyone who thinks this bill is enough hasn't heard the  desperation in the voices of their constituents, has not looked into  the eyes of a small business owner on the brink of ruin.   By all rights, there should be direct assistance in this bill for  State and local governments. The checks should  [[Page S7891]]  be larger. While this agreement includes a new and larger forgivable  PPP loan for restaurants, we need to do much more for restaurants. We  have bipartisan legislation to deliver the relief that is truly needed,  the RESTAURANTS Act, which, regrettably, did not make it into this  legislation. We must do all we can to save restaurants, and I will not  stop fighting until we pass the RESTAURANTS Act into law. This bill  cannot and will not be the final word on congressional relief from the  coronavirus pandemic. This is an emergency survival package.   When we come back in January, our No. 1 job will be to fill in the  gaps left by the bill and then get the economy moving with strong  Federal input. Still, the significance of this package should not be  underestimated. It will be the second largest bill--the second largest  Federal input--in the history of our country. It will be the second  largest amount of Federal dollars going to the people ever. The times  demand it. Even some of our conservative Republican friends will vote  for it, and it is good we have it. For much of the year, it looked  unlikely that it would ever get done, and our success today, our  ability to pass this bill today, should give us confidence we can do  more. We can end the year on a rare note of optimism.   Now, Queen Elizabeth, every year, gives a talk to her subjects about  the status of the monarchy and the British royal family. In a very  challenging year, she called the year annus horribilis--a horrible  year. Unlike in 1992, which was the year Elizabeth referred to the  problems with Charles and Diana, this year has been an annus horribilis  not just for Great Britain and the royal family, which she was talking  about, but an annus horribilis for the entire world.   The global COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than 70 million people  across the globe. Another 500 million have gone, likely, undiagnosed.  There are 1.6 million people who have died, 20 percent of whom have  been Americans, more than 315,000--more than the entire population of  Pittsburgh or St. Louis, more than all of the American combat deaths in  World War II. The September 11 attacks to my fair city shaped much of  the first decade of this century. In 2020, our dear country has  suffered the equivalent of a 9/11 attack every day for 106 days in a  row.   We have lost so much. We have missed holidays and reunions,  retirements and graduations, bar mitzvahs and confirmations, weddings  and funerals. Trapped in our homes, our companions were isolation and  loneliness and the faint glow of tiny screens. The image of seeing  people on the screen, watching their loved ones pass away when they  couldn't be with them, will stay with us forever. Doctors had to stack  iPads in waiting rooms for end-of-life conversations--how tragic, how  awful. There were cars lined up, bumper to bumper, for food assistance.  Grandchildren, wrapped in protective gear, waved goodbye to  grandparents from across the silence of a hospital room.   It has been a horrible year--annus horribilis. Yet here, at the very  end, finally, there is hope--not just one, not just two, but three  strong beacons of hope. One, soon many Americans will have the vaccine.  Two, Joe Biden will become President. He has the experience and the  empathy to handle the COVID crisis and will replace a man who has shown  no capacity or even interest in doing so. And, three, we are on the  verge of passing another historic, bipartisan relief bill to deliver  emergency assistance during a time of national emergency. So there are  three beacons of hope: the vaccine, a new administration, and a bill  that will help in an emergency.   Very soon, our country will close the book on the most chaotic  President in recent history. Joe Biden, an experienced leader and a  person of fundamental human decency, will become the 46th President of  the United States. Kamala Harris, my good friend and hard-working  colleague, will become the first woman, the first Black person, and the  first Asian American to ascend to the Vice Presidency of the United  States. Together, they will return competency and compassion to our  government after 4 long years of division and demonization, which far  too many people have tolerated and gone along with.   Even though this disease has not been vanquished yet, there is light  at the end of the tunnel in the form of a vaccine. Everyone should  appreciate how miraculous that truly is. It usually takes between 5 and  10 years to develop a new vaccine--5 to 10 years. It took American  doctors, biochemists, and medical researchers less than 10 months to  produce not one but two viable vaccines for the coronavirus. The  discovery of a vaccine in a single calendar year is the crowning  scientific achievement of the 21st century--the medical Manhattan  Project of our times. It is a reminder that, when we work together and  persevere and sacrifice for one another, nothing--nothing--is beyond  our capacity as a nation.   The same resilience and innovation and fortitude that saw our country  through its darkest hours has emerged once again. COVID-19 has changed  our country, but it has not changed our character. America is the  night-shift nurse fashioning protective equipment from shoelaces and  sheets of vinyl. America is a restaurant owner who sent meals to  frontline workers for free. America is the home-stitched mask sent to  friends and families. It is the metallic clang of pots and pans that  celebrates essential workers. America is the grocery store clerk and  the busdriver and the plasma donor and the lab technician, late at  night, poring over the results of a clinical trial. It is the Brooklyn  doctor, 62, on the verge of retirement, who, for 2 straight weeks,  worked day shifts at the ICU and night shifts at the nearby hospital  before finally succumbing to the disease himself.   Last week, the first American--a nurse in Queens--was vaccinated  against COVID-19. Many millions will soon follow. Eventually, our  businesses will reopen, our economy will reopen, and life will reopen.  We will travel and worship and send our kids to school and see our  friends and be together again. It won't be tomorrow or next week or  even next month, but it will happen, not because we merely waited long  enough, not because we were patient, but because we persevered.   Our job right now is to help the country get from this stormy present  to that hopeful future, to survive this dark winter until spring thaws  the ice. Our job is to do what is necessary--pass this bill, pass  another stronger bill next year--whatever it takes to hold our country  together until we eradicate the awful scourge of this disease.   At the end of this annus horribilis--this horrible year--let us give  the American people another reason to hope   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, so much of the Senate's work happens  behind the scenes and out of the spotlight. Over the past few weeks,  there are scores of Senate staffers--probably more than scores;  hundreds, I would say--who have spent many late nights and some  sleepless ones putting this emergency relief and omnibus bill together,  so I wanted to come back to the floor today and acknowledge all of the  hard-working Senate Democratic staff.   To create a law, there are staffs from committees and Senators'  offices who are truly experts. They make sure what we Senators want to  achieve is written properly. They have years--some, decades--of  experience in their  [[Page S7903]]  subject area. They are libraries of information of how programs work.  They are also creative thinkers and masters of accomplishing what  Senators might think is easy--turning a few lines of our direction into  legislative text--under tremendous time pressure and, lately, during  the pandemic.   These are the names of some of the Senate's unsung heroes to whom we  all owe an amazing debt of gratitude:   From the Committee on Appropriations: Charles ``Chuck'' Kieffer,  Chanda Betourney, Hannah Chauvin, Dianne Nellor, Jean Toal Eisen, Erik  Raven, Doug Clapp, Ellen Murray, Scott Nance, Rachael Taylor, Alex  Keenan, Jessica Berry, Michelle Dominguez, Tim Rieser, and Dabney Hegg.

From the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship: Sean  Moore, Ron Storhaug, Kevin Wheeler, Jacob Press, and Therese Meers.   From the Committee on Rules and Administration: Dusty Brandenburg and  Lindsey Kerr.   So to all of those great people and many more--and I apologize if  there are some we have left out--thank you, thank you, thank you, to  everyone on the committees.   I also want, for a moment, to thank my staff. Everyone believes they  have the best staff on the Hill. I am certainly no exception. I would  never ever, ever be able to do what I do without them. I know over the  past several days many of them have tested the limits of exhaustion,  hardly sleeping at all, but I want them to know that all their energy,  ingenuity, and brilliance will have made the lives of their fellow  citizens better in New York and across the country.   I have told them that they can look back at any age and know they  have kept businesses going, kept people employed, kept people fed, kept  people from getting sick, and even kept people from dying, kept people  alive. That is the great work my staff and the other staffs have done.   So to my staff, whom I am so deeply, deeply grateful to, thank you,  thank you. Thank you to my chief, Mike Lynch; my deputy chief, Erin  Sager Vaughn; my policy director, Gerry Petrella, and my legislative  director and his wife, Meghan Taira; my State director, Martin Brennan;  deputy State director, Steve Mann; Steve Barton; Mike Ianelli; and all  the regional directors from across the State.   The executive team in my office is a tremendous asset to me and to  the Democratic caucus: Michelle Mittler, Megan Murphy Vlasto, Emily  Sweda, Raisa Shah, and Sophia Coutavas.   The press team supports both me and the entire Democratic caucus day  in and day out: Justin Goodman, Alex Nguyen, Monica Lee, Ken Meyer,  Angelo Roefaro, Allison Biasotti, Paige Tepke, Alice Nam, and everyone  at the Senate Democratic Media Center.   Jasmine Harris, Oriana Pina, and Dan Yoken and his amazing team of  researchers: Andrew Ogden, Leela Najafi, and Hanna Talley.   The whole team is supported by the great budding talent of our press  assistants: Alexandra Robinson, Alexa Sledge, and Cyre Velez.   Cietta Kiandoli, Sol Ortega, and Julietta Lopez do fantastic  engagement with many groups of people affected by the legislation we  pass.   Josh Molofsky and Tony Rivera are my speechwriters and every day  bring poetry and organization to my thoughts.   A special, special thanks to the Schumer ``Legislative Team.'' These  staffers are so incredibly hard-working and are always striving to find  the best solution for our country and New York: Anna Taylor and Marisa  Hawley; Jon Cardinal, Leeann Sinpatanasakul, and Rob Hickman; Mike  Kuiken, Reza Zomorrodian, and Yazeed Abdelhaq; Matt Fuentes, Dili  Sundaramoorthy, and Juan Negrete; Christina Henderson, who just won for  city council in Washington, DC, and is leaving us; Ramon Carranza;  Catalina Tam; Lane Bodian and Rodney Kazibwe; Veronica Watters; Zack  Rosenblum, Ryan Eagan and Jasmin Aleman; Adrian Deveny, Tim Ryder; Sean  Byrne, Annie Daly and Vandan Patel; Reggie Babin, Lucy Panza, Mark  Patterson, Didier Barjon; Helena Contes; Charlie Ellsworth, Kai Vogel;  Jim Secreto, Patricio Gonzalez, and Josh Gutmaker.   And, of course, I have to thank the brilliant floor staff led by Gary  Myrick. What a blessing.   A special thank-you from me and the caucus and the entire staff to  Tricia Engle, Dan Tinsley, Brad Watt, Stephanie Paone, Liza Patterson,  Nate Oursler, and Rachel Jackson.   Thank you and also farewell to Reema Dodin, Senator Durbin's  tremendous floor staffer who for years has looked after the caucus and  the floor. She is heading to the White House to help the President- elect, and we couldn't be happier and prouder to have a Senate denizen  at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.   There are so many more incredible staffers who deserve recognition  and thanks for making this institution come to life. My entire staff  helped with the efforts this year, and as I conclude today, they are  still helping. I would like to include all of their names in the  Record.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the following names   There being no objection; the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Yazeed Abdelhaq; Kathleen Achibair; Jasmin Aleman; Garrett       Armwood; Reggie Babin; Robert Banez; Didier Barjon; Steve       Barton; Sharon Battle; Jackie Benavides; Allison Biasotti;       Tinae Bluitt; Lane Bodian; Quinn Bowman; Martin Brennan;       Caroline Burns; Sean Byrne; Jon Cardinal; Ramon Carranza;       Joyce.Chang Prepis.

It is a lot of names.   I yield the floor.    I thank my friends from Oregon and Virginia for their  hard work on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I agree with them that  oversight by the full Senate Intelligence Committee on these and other  intelligence matters is at the core of the Senate's constitutional  responsibilities. I, too, agree that the language should not be  interpreted to limit that full committee oversight. I also strongly  agree with the Senators' views on the critical importance of protecting  whistleblowers. The abuses of the outgoing administration have  illustrated the urgent need for these legislative protections.  [[Page S7926]]    Mr. Barrasso. Mr. President, Senator Carper, ranking member of the  Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senator John Kennedy, and I,  as chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, are the  principal Senate authors of section 103 in Division S of the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021--the American Innovation and  Manufacturing, ``AIM'', Act of 2020, hereinafter ``section 103''. This  bipartisan legislation will phase down the production and consumption  of hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs, which are potent greenhouse gases that  contribute to climate change. As authors, we submit these comments to  provide the Senate with additional information regarding the  development of section 103.   Section 103 establishes a new, national program administered by the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to phase down the production  and consumption of certain HFC substances. Section 103 vests EPA with  authority to phase down the production and consumption of these  substances in a comprehensive manner. It is designed to provide  regulatory certainty. Specifically, section 103 requires EPA to  implement an 85 percent phase down of the production and consumption of  regulated HFC substances, so those levels reach approximately 15  percent of their 2011-2013 average annual levels by 2036. Importantly,  this section includes provisions to safeguard consumers and American  manufacturers from cost increases during the phase down while still  adhering to the phase down timetable in subsection (e)(2)(C).   The text of section 103 reflects bipartisan, necessary improvements  to the original, introduced text in the Senate. On March 4, 2020,  Senator Kennedy filed amendment No. 1504 to S. 2657, which was  identical to stand-alone legislation, S. 2754, the American Innovation  and Manufacturing Act of 2019. Ranking Member Carper of the U.S. Senate  Committee on Environment and Public Works Committee, EPW, cosponsored  amendment No. 1504 and S. 2754. EPW Chairman Barrasso opposed amendment  No. 1504 and S. 2754 as introduced, hereinafter ``introduced  legislation''.   On March 25, 2020, Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper began  an electronic information-gathering process on S. 2754 by EPW to  solicit the views of stakeholders. This process allowed EPW to hear  safely from many stakeholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The  extensive information-gathering process generated filings from a range  of industries, States, interest groups, and individuals.   We relied on the valuable information gained through that process to  improve the introduced legislation and to reach collective agreement on  amended text. This agreement was filed as amendment No. 2655 to S. 2657  on September 10, 2020. Section 103 closely resembles the text of  amendment No. 2655.   Our agreed-upon changes to the introduced legislation have focused in  a few key areas identified by Chairman Barrasso. The first key area is  ``essential uses'' of regulated HFC substances. The introduced  legislation offered immediate relief for some special circumstances,  including feedstocks and process agents. For example, in a provision  that has been present in all versions of the legislation, subsection  (e)(4)(A) assures there are no regulatory requirements for ``a  regulated substance that is used and entirely consumed (except for  trace quantities) in the manufacture of another chemical.'' Where trace  quantities of an HFC regulated substance, including impurities or  unreacted feedstock chemical, remain through transformation of a  regulated HFC substance into another product, that activity is covered  by the exemption as soon as the Act is enacted into law.   The introduced legislation did not provide immediate protection for  essential uses. Subsection (e)(4)(B) now provides that relief for  essential uses. Congress has identified six essential uses in  subsection (e)(4)(B)(iv) that are designated by law as essential uses  upon enactment: No. 1, propellant in metered dose inhalers; No. 2,  defense sprays; No. 3, structural composite preformed polyurethane foam  for marine use and trailer use; No. 4, the etching of semiconductor  material or wafers and the cleaning of chemical vapor deposition  chambers within the semi-conductor manufacturing sector; No. 5,  mission-critical military end uses, such as armored vehicle engine and  shipboard fire suppression systems and systems used in deployable and  expeditionary applications; and No. 6, onboard aerospace fire  suppression.   In implementing this legislation, EPA must allocate, by rule, the  full quantity of allowances needed by each of these six congressionally  designated uses for at least 5 years. This rulemaking only determines  the quantities of mandatory allowances that are allocated to each of  the six uses above.   Under subsection (e)(4)(B)(i)-(iii), EPA may, by rule, designate  other uses as essential uses and allocate any such use a quantity of  allowances, provided certain criteria are met and subject to the  applicable phasedown timelines and regulations for the production and  consumption of HFCs under (e)(2)-(3). The Administrator is required to  review each essential use application every 5 years and shall continue  to make available essential use allowances if the Administrator  determines, subject to notice and opportunity for public comment, that  statutory criteria are met under subsection (e)(4)(B)(v).   The second key area of change from the introduced legislation is  express preemption of certain State and local laws, reflected in  subsection (k)(2). With respect to an exclusive use for which a  mandatory allocation of allowances is provided under subsection  (e)(4)(B)(iv)(I), subsection (k)(2)(A) preempts any enforcement of a  statute or administrative action by a State or political subdivision of  a State for 5 years from the date of enactment. Preemption is  potentially extendable for up to--but not more than--10 years, as  provided in subsection (k)(2)(B).   The third key area of change from the introduced legislation is the  protection of consumers and businesses from cost increases. Of  particular note, under subsection (f)(2)(B), EPA cannot accelerate the  15-year regulatory timeline faster than HFC consumption levels that the  market is already achieving. However, EPA must ensure any level set  under this subsection is at least as stringent as the production and  consumption levels of regulated substances required under subsection  (e)(2)(C) for a given year, as provided in subsection (f)(6). Language  to protect consumers and businesses, particularly residential and small  business consumers, has also been added to regulatory provisions  throughout the bill, including essential uses (subsection (e)(4)-(5)),  accelerated schedule (subsection (f)), and technology transitions  (subsection (i)).   Together we support section 103. We thank our House colleagues for  working together with us to improve further our Senate agreement  reached in September 2020. Through negotiations with leaders of the  U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, we  agreed to additional changes to improve legislative clarity, including  language to help protect affordability for residential and small  business consumers while also protecting the environment.
