 Madam Speaker, as you know, the Holocaust ended  in 1945, but tragically, the hatred behind it has not.   We are all horrified by the surge in violent anti-Semitism taking  place across America. Today we are seeing the full force of Jewish  contempt on our college and university campuses, and it has never been  more hateful. Students are being harassed, threatened, and violently  targeted just for being Jewish in 2023.   It is unthinkable that students are unable to walk between classes to  their dorms or the dining hall, but it is the reality for Jewish  students on campuses today.   The history of the Holocaust warns us what can happen when hatred is  met by silence. We cannot stand by while Jewish students feel  threatened. It is more than just a discussion. It is a call to action.   Madam Speaker, today I stand before you to condemn these dangerous  acts of anti-Semitism. That is why I urge everybody to support  Representative Owens' resolution to condemn support for terrorist  organizations on campuses across the Nation. Anti-Semitism is not  activism. It is hatred pure and simple, and it has no place in America  today.
