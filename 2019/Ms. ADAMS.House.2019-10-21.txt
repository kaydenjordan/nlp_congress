 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin  Islands and also the gentlewoman from Nevada, Chairwoman Bass, and all  who participated in organizing this event.   I rise to join other Members tonight to honor the life and career of  one of this body's most effective lawmakers, one of the most tireless  champions of the underprivileged, and a close and dear friend to us  all, representative Elijah Cummings.   The 12th District of North Carolina extends condolences to his wife,  his family, his extended family, and to the members of his district.   Elijah was one of our best examples of what it means to be a public  servant. In Baltimore, he was not only his community's Member of  Congress, but he was its voice, a recognizable and fervent product of  the community that he represented.   When West Baltimore was hurting after the death of Freddie Gray, it  was Representative Cummings who spoke the words of a grieving  community.   When the President of the United States insulted his city, it was  Representative Cummings who stood up and offered to show the President  what Baltimore is really about.   This was the type of man and Member that Elijah Cummings was, an  advocate for what was right.   He was an advocate for our youth, and he took a sincere interest in  their success. I remain personally grateful to him for the support that  he gave to my youngest grandson as he explored entrance and application  to Howard University.   Elijah Cummings was always an advocate for what was right, or, as Dr.  King would call it, he was indeed a drum major for justice. He earned  the respect of men, women, and little children, and he made this world  much better than he found it.
