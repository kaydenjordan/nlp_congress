 Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today to  congratulate Charleston's very own Ranky Tanky for winning a Grammy for  Best Regional Roots Music Album.   Ranky Tanky was formed in 2016, made their Lowcountry debut in April  2017, and have since issued two albums and toured the world. Despite  touring the world and going around the U.S. and playing, they have  never forgotten their hometown of Charleston and their Lowcountry  roots.   The Gullah culture is a vital part of the Lowcountry and our history.  It is in the food we eat and the music we love. Ranky Tanky has shared  Gullah tradition with the entire world, and for that, we owe them a  debt of gratitude.   Congrats to Quentin, Kevin, Quiana, Clay, and Charlton. I am sure  that this journey feels like it has been a fairytale, but I assure them  that they are just getting started.                            ____________________
