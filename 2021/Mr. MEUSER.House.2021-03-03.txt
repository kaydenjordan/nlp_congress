 Mr. Speaker, our Nation faces serious challenges,  including an ongoing pandemic, vaccine distribution hurdles, continued  lockdowns from out-of-touch Governors, prolonged closures of our  schools, and one-in-four small businesses face the risk of permanent  closure.   At a time when the American people are concerned with election  integrity, a top priority of our Democrat leadership is to federalize  election laws, removing the authority of State legislatures expressed  in Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution.   H.R. 1, the bill before us today, would allow for taxpayer-funded  campaigns through a government match on political contributions at a 6- to-1 ratio. So a $200 contribution would be matched by the taxpayer to  the tune of $1,200.   H.R. 1 would also hinder the rights of States to determine their  registration voting practices, including mandating automatic voter  registration.   The suggestion being made by my Democrat friends and colleagues that  opposition to this legislation is somehow a form of voter suppression  is ridiculous. I and my colleagues would never consider engaging in a  course of  [[Page H1026]]  action that suppresses a citizen's legitimate right to vote.   This is a partisan power grab that threatens election integrity.  ``One citizen, one vote'' is my solemn resolve. I oppose this amendment  and the underlying bill.
