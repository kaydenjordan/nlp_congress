 Mr. Speaker, I was there along with him, and I just  wanted to emphasize the statement--I don't think I will ever forget-- from an angel mom who said: Congressman Norman, a wall won't stop  everyone. No wall will stop no one.   And put that picture up right there. What we found on the border  was--particularly where the wall ended where Mr. Gohmert showed the  rope was.    Mr. Speaker, right. All along were bottles of water. We  walked up on a sleeping bag. We walked up on all types of----    Mr. Speaker, exactly. That is where it stopped. You know,  and in talking with these agents, who are drastically understaffed,  they can't do--they can't chase down everybody that comes.   I will tell you, every agent we talked with had no hesitation to run  after one person or run after a group of 10 or more. And my question to  him was: How do you handle that type? That is how dedicated they are.  That is how diligent they are. They are sacrificing their safety.   The other thing I would point out that you and I saw to show you how  deceptive these drug runners are, they use carpet; they have stitched  together a carpet-type that wraps their feet so that you can't tell  where they go. You can't track them. And that is all along. You can see  where they are going, but you can't see the actual footprint that they  are leaving.   The other thing that stuck out to me that I thought was just amazing  were to talk to the ranchers. That one rancher had had four home  invasions. Now, think about it. How would you like to wake up, as he  did, in the middle of the night, with a person dressed in black staring  at his wife? How would you like, what the sheriff told us--I am not  going to name his name--when his home--a bounty was put on his head. He  woke up, because he had surveillance, to see four people coming in to  kill him.                                time  2030    How would you like to see the rape trees that you and I saw?  Children's underwear, clothing, it really is a humanitarian crisis. It  is a crisis, as Congressman Griffith mentioned, the drugs in this  country, the photo you showed where the ropes were, 60 percent of the  heroin comes in there, 40 to 60 percent.   So anybody, once you go down there--and what was sad is when they  said we were some of the few who had. Our nine were some of the few who  have ever visited the border.   When you put a face with a situation like we saw with the ranchers,  like we saw with the Border Patrol agents, like we saw with the Angel  Moms--and the Angel Mom is the one who made the comment about the wall:   A wall's not going to stop everyone. No wall stops no one.   Her husband or her son was killed.   The other Angel Mom we talked to, an illegal alien came in a store.  The illegal asked for cigarettes. He gave it. While he was counting  change, he shot him in the face. These are the type of real-life  stories.   Anybody who says that this thing isn't real, go down to the border.  You look at what we saw and I think you will change your mind. And I  think that now, if we don't do it now, it will never happen.    I did, Congressman Gohmert. And to see what they sell,  bullets for the drug-runners to carry out.    The bullets were packaged in a small plastic bag.    I have never seen bullets sold like that, and this is  what we are dealing with. This is what we are dealing with.    The rations, the Army MREs.    MREs, which was food that would last for weeks.   And I guess the other thing is these are professionals. They are  armed. The rations that they carry out, they are planning to stay there  for a long time, until they get the drugs over, and then they come  back.   It is our duty--we are not doing our duty to not stop this or make  the effort to stop it.   So, Congressman, I want to thank you for showing the pictures. What  makes it real is to go down there and see it. And there is no way you  can make the case that this is not a crisis, this is not a safety  issue, this is not a--we are in it for the sovereignty of the country.    Mr. Speaker, specifically about the drones, we were  talking to one of the agents, and he said: Tell me one drone that has  ever run down an illegal alien and put him in handcuffs? Drones don't  do that.   Electronic devices alert you. Like the illegals that we saw at the  end of the day who were near us, the cameras picked it up. But you have  to have a body, somebody like these brave agents, to go catch them.  That is what they do.   But it is just words, as far as I can tell, to anybody who ever  witnesses this.   To hear the ranchers, we asked about vacations, with all of the  crime. When you see their truck chained in the carport, as we saw,  because somebody tried to steal it, we asked how they take a vacation.  He said: Well, we have to stagger it.   These are older people. They were 70 and up. At this stage of their  life, for them to have to worry about their life, worry about their  property being destroyed? How many waterlines did we see that were cut?  How many fires did he point to on the mountaintops that were set fire?   So these people are trying to make an honest living. Ranchers are  some of the most honest, hardworking people I know. It is in their DNA.  For them to have to worry about their safety, about their life, as was  described when one of the ranchers went up to the person who was  hobbling and he got shot and killed, you know, to hear----    Mr. Speaker, that was his sister, who could talk about  him.   So that is why there is urgency to this thing. And, you know, go down  there. Like Congressman Griffith mentioned, this is just a start. The  $5.7 billion, it is a start to really get the job done and add enough  fence to help these agents. If you do it for nothing else, help these  agents so that at least it is quarantined where they come in.   I compare it to a football game. I think I mentioned I had a friend  of mine who is deathly opposed to the wall. I knew he went to the  Clemson-Alabama game, and I knew he had tickets. I said: Did you have a  problem?   He said: With what?   I said: Getting into the game.   He said: Oh, no. I had a ticket.   I said: Did you go in at one place?   He said: Yeah, I went in at one place. We were in line, not for long.   I said: You couldn't just walk in?   Then he got it. He said: That is different.   I said: Well, wait a minute. If you go to a football game and have it  walled off where you had to go to a point of entry, you tell me how  that is different than what we are talking about on this wall.   He said, and this astounded me: Well, it wasn't a concrete wall.   I said: Okay. It was a combination of metal. It was a combination of  posts, concrete. It was a barrier. How would you feel if people had  just walked in there and taken your seat and hadn't paid for it? What  is the difference?   He couldn't tell me. He could not tell me, because he couldn't.  [[Page H994]]    That is what we are talking about here, but we are talking about  human lives.   Back on that story about the husband who watched the rape, what they  did to him is stabbed him. They stabbed him in the side as to make a  point that he was to bring the drug money back and watch his wife get  raped over a 3-day period.   So if anybody can watch that and see these people, I mean, really.    Three days in a row.    Mr. Speaker, it is the right thing to do. Now is the  time. I applaud the gentleman for having these pictures. This brings it  to life.
