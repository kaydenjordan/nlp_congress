 Mr. Speaker, a ``big lie'' is a political  propaganda technique made famous by Germany's National Socialist German  Workers' Party. But more on that later.   For more than 2 years, Socialist Democrats and their fake news media  allies, CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, Washington Post, and countless  others, have perpetrated the biggest political lie, con, scam, and  fraud in American history.   Attorney General Barr's executive summary of Mueller's report has  publicly confirmed what many of us have known for a long time. The  accusations of collusion between President Trump and Russia in the 2016  elections are nothing but a big lie.   The Mueller investigation was massive. It ``employed 19 lawyers who  were assisted by a team of approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence  forensic accountants, and other professional staff. The special counsel  issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants,  obtained more than 230 orders for communication records . . . and  interviewed approximately 500 witnesses.''   After tens of millions of wasted American tax dollars, the finding is  succinct: ``The report does not recommend any further indictments, nor  did the special counsel obtain any sealed indictments that have yet to  be made public. . . .''   The investigation ``did not establish that members of the Trump  campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian Government in its  election interference activities.''   The Mueller report vindicates President Trump and his 2016 campaign  from the Socialists' baseless, reckless, and false big lie charges of  Russian election collusion.   Equally important, there is a converse to President Trump's  vindication.   Mueller's report confirms that Socialist Democrats and their fake  news media allies made up nonexistent allegations and engaged in the  most sordid of fake news, big lie propaganda, scam, fraud, and smear  campaign in American history.   Socialist Democrats and their fake news media allies were shameless,  shameless in their big lie scam that has inspired hatred against  President Trump and violence against Americans who support America's  foundational principles.   If Socialists and the fake news media had any honor, they would  cleanse their souls and atone for their sins by uttering mea culpas and  apologizing to the American people for the fraud and scam committed.   More likely, however, they will double down and propagate even more  big lies, because doubling down is essential to big lie theory. In that  vein, I quote from another Socialist who mastered big lie propaganda to  a maximum and deadly effect.   ``In the big lie, there is always a certain force of credibility;  because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted  in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or  voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they  more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they  themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed  to resort to large-scale falsehoods.   ``It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal  untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the  impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts  which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they  will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be  some other explanation.''   Who is this big lie master? That quote was in 1925 by a member of  Germany's National Socialist German Workers' Party. That is right,  Germany's Socialist Party, more commonly known as the Nazis. The author  was Socialist Adolph Hitler in his book, ``Mein Kampf''.   Mr. Speaker, America can either learn from history or be doomed to  repeat it.   When it comes to big lie political propaganda in America, as the  Mueller  [[Page H2766]]  report confirms, America's Socialists and their fake news media allies  are experts and have no peers.   Regardless, America must reject their big lies or succumb to the  danger that lurks and horrific damage that results.                            ____________________
