 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                     Mineworker Pensions and Health Care     Mr. President, 70 years ago United Mine Workers president  John L. Lewis, a lifelong Republican, sat down with the Democratic  Secretary of the Interior, Julius Krug. They struck a deal to end a  national strike. They promised health and pension benefits for miners  in exchange for a lifetime of hard work. It is a promise that the  Federal Government has kept ever since.   For 70 years, no matter the President, no matter the party in control  of the Senate, we have kept that promise. That changed, unfortunately,  in December. This body left for vacation. It left tens of thousands of  mine workers to face an uncertain future, not knowing if the pensions  and health care they had earned for themselves--and in many cases for  their widows--over a lifetime of hard work would be there for them in  the future. This is shameful.  [[Page S45]]    Senator Portman, my Republican colleague from Ohio, and I and Senator  Manchin and Senator Capito, a Democrat and a Republican from West  Virginia, and Senator Casey--a number of us--said: We should not leave  Washington to go home to our families until we take care of mine worker  families.   Congress has the power to stop these cuts and to live up to this  pledge. We had a bipartisan solution that would have passed if it had  been brought to the floor. But instead, Congress broke its promise to  these miners and their families. Congress stole the health care they  had earned by passing a continuing resolution that failed to address  the pension problem, and it stole the funds that were still left in  their health care plan to pay for a 4-month fix--4 months, 4 months.  Who can make health care decisions when you don't know if you will have  health care coverage 4 months from now?   These working people don't deserve to live with this kind of  uncertainty. I have heard my colleagues, particularly on the Republican  side of the aisle, always talk about predictability. Government should  never inject more uncertainty into the lives of individuals, never  should inject uncertainty into the lives of business people as they  make investment decisions.   But that is what we have done with these mine workers. We have made  their lives less certain, less predictable, and their health care so  unpredictable. This is the health care these workers fought for, the  health care they sacrificed raises for. Keep in mind that at the  bargaining table, workers will be willing to accept less wages today in  exchange for health care and pensions in the future. That is what  collective bargaining is often about. That is what is so important.   This is health care they sacrificed raises for. It was the health  care we promised them. My colleagues know their stories of hard work  and sacrifice. We know these stories because over the past year, these  miners traveled here by the busload. They rode long distances. They  gathered in the heat and in the cold for hours outside this building to  make their voices heard.   They worked decades in the mines--hard back-breaking work. But that  work had dignity. It was dangerous work--work where some of them were  killed on the job, work where many of them developed health problems  later. Many of them died younger than people who dress like we do and  have jobs like this. Their widows have been denied these pensions and  health care. They clocked in every day, these workers. They knew the  conditions they faced. Many of them now suffer from black lung or other  illnesses. They accepted a lifetime of hard labor because they valued  their jobs, they valued their work, and they believed that good-paying  union jobs were their tickets to the middle class.   These miners believed in the covenant we used to have in this country  that promised if you work hard your whole life, if you put in the  hours, if you save a little and do your part, you will be able to help  your children go to college. They believed that would give their kids a  chance at a better life perhaps than they had. They believed that if  they upheld their end of the deal, if they put in the work to power our  country by mining coal used for a generation of electricity, their  government would do the same. In December, Congress told them they were  wrong. I don't accept that. These workers sacrificed their lungs and  their backs to keep our lights on. It is shameful that Congress,  despite all intents and purposes, has stolen what they earned. These  miners should have spent Christmas with their grandkids, not worrying  about whether they could afford their medicine.    We aren't giving up. We had a bipartisan solution in December. We  will keep fighting until mine workers across Ohio and this country have  the full health care and retirement security that we promised them.  They kept faith with us and powered our country. It is time to keep  faith with the workers in our industrial heartland and to right this  wrong.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
