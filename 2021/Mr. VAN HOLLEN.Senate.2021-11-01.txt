 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I think all Senators can agree that we  would not be able to deliver results for the people in our States and  for our country if it were not for our extraordinary staff, who work  with us each and every day. They are there with us in the trenches,  fighting for the constituents we pledge to serve, and defending the  Constitution of the United States.   It is for that reason that I am confident my colleagues will agree  with me when I say congressional staff is more than just a collection  of individuals; it is a family. And it is that truth that makes my  presence on the Senate floor this evening all the more difficult,  because my office, our family, has lost a beloved member.   John Amara F. Walters, a legislative aide in my office, passed away  on the morning of October 2, at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in  Washington, DC. He died in the arms of his beloved mother, Kimberley,  who joins us this evening in the gallery. John was 29 years old.   On behalf of myself, our office, and the people of Maryland, I want  to take a little time not only to express our profound grief at the  loss of a dear friend and amazing human being, but also to tell a  little bit of John's story to this Senate and to the Nation, and to pay  tribute to his life, to honor all that he gave us, and to celebrate all  that he gave to the world.   John Amara F. Walters was born on Friday, February 9, 1992, in  Adrian, MI, to John A.M. Walters and Kimberley H. Davis Walters. He  came from a long line of patriots and leaders, including his  grandfather, who defended the United States in World War II as a  Tuskegee Airman.   And John caught the political bug early. At age 6--yes, you all heard  that right, aged 6 years old--John started working on local political  campaigns. In his early years, he participated in three Presidential  elections and traveled across Michigan and the country to serve  communities in need. In high school, he interned for the late great  Michigan Senator, Carl Levin. John was also a committed member of the  Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute's Pathways to Freedom program.   He excelled inside the classroom--first graduating from Adrian High  School in 2010, and then going on to study at the District of  Columbia's own Howard University, where he earned his BA in psychology  in 2015 magna cum laude. I should add he was a loyal Howard alum and  proud Bison and a favorite son of the university's.   The last time I met face-to-face--in the pre-COVID days--with the  president of Howard University, Wayne Frederick, John was with me, and  I told Dr. Frederick how proud we were of John's exemplary work, and  Dr. Frederick was proud too.   John did all of this at a young age and more, and he achieved these  things despite having a lifelong battle with sickle cell anemia--an  illness that often struck him with fatigue and pain. But that didn't  stop John. He refused to be defined by his illness, and he refused to  allow sickle cell to prevent him from pursuing his dreams with passion  and decency and dedication. It is a disease that took him from us far  too soon, but it never took away his spirit or his zest for life and  his commitment to making a positive change.   I will always remember John for the twinkle in his eye, his  enthusiasm for everything he did, his absolute brilliance, and his  commitment to helping others. Everyone in our office--and I mean  everyone--loved John.   After he passed away, we held a staff Zoom call with his mother, both  to grieve together and to remember John; and in that gathering, we  witnessed a torrent of love and affection for all John did and what he  meant to us. There were lots of tears, but also many moments of  beautiful laughter, as we recounted many fun stories about John.   He gave us many things, but perhaps one of his greatest gifts was his  empathy. In the world of politics and Capitol Hill, there is plenty of  ambition. And John was ambitious. But empathy is often in short supply.  Not in John.    Empathy is that quality where someone seeks to see the world through  the eyes of another, of understanding what somebody else is  experiencing by trying to walk in that person's shoes and live the  world as they live it. John did not just hear the words spoken by  others; he listened; he absorbed them; he dared to be vulnerable.   And what always struck me about John was his capacity to focus on the  struggles experienced by others at the same time he was carrying on his  own fight against sickle cell. Perhaps his own personal struggle made  him far more attuned to the hardships faced by others; but whatever its  source, John's capacity to care inspired us all, as did his ability to  persist and carry on in the face of adversity. John embodied the very  best of us.   John first joined my office as an intern right out of college, when I  was  [[Page S7534]]  still serving in the House of Representatives. After graduating from  Howard, he could have chosen many different paths. He chose public  service. From John's first moments on our team, it was clear that he  was not only sharp and eager to work, but that he cared deeply about  his fellow colleagues and that he was completely dedicated to our  mission of serving the people of Maryland and the country.   When I was elected to the Senate, I was thrilled to have John move to  this side of the Capitol with me. He leapt at every opportunity to  advance our mission--growing from organizing and drafting letters to  constituents, to taking constituent meetings, to eventually thinking of  and writing legislation. He was a vibrant force on Capitol Hill both in  our office and outside of it, and was an active member of the Senate  Black Legislative Staff Caucus.   When our Senate office first divided up issues among our legislative  correspondents, John chose to take responsibility for some of the  hottest button issues, like criminal justice reform and public safety,  that demanded an open ear and a welcoming heart. He worked on gun  issues and spoke to constituents who had experienced personal tragedies  from gun violence, and he always brought their feelings to his work on  legislation to strengthen our gun laws. When the previous  administration was trying to dismantle parts of the civil service, John  met with and helped Federal employees who feared they might lose their  jobs at any moment. In a million different ways, John proved that  empathy has a home in public service and can even direct the course of  policy changes.   When we decided to hold a hearing on the hardships that Postal  Service delays were imposing on Americans, John remembered a meeting he  had held months earlier with a group from the National Federation of  the Blind, where they discussed the real challenges they were  experiencing because of the long delays in the delivery of their  essential materials. John was moved by their stories at the time, and  he lifted their voices. At his suggestion, we invited a member of that  group to testify, and their moving and powerful testimony is now  leading the changes that will help every American. That was John-- listening and then bringing people's voices into the public square to  change lives for the better.   John brought empathy to his work and to the office, but he also  brought great joy. His desk was a must-stop place for members of our  team throughout the day. People would stop by to share his company, to  hear his loud and infectious laugh, to talk about the latest news of  the day, or--I have been told--to joke about the craziest couple on  ``90 Day Fiance,'' which, on the enthusiastic recommendation of John  and a few others, built quite a following in our office among current  and past staff. I was not sure what to think about all that when I  learned about it.   John brought joy with his wry wit and keen sense of the absurd-- always taking his work seriously, but never taking himself too  seriously. He had a critical skill on Capitol Hill--the ability to  track down House and Senate receptions with the very best food, and  then alert his colleagues to the spoils. If someone couldn't get away  from the office, he would bring back snacks to share, pulling treats  out of his pockets like a magician.   He was a true member of our office family and always a team player,  always willing to advance our causes on behalf of our constituents. And  in coming to know his family, I can see where those qualities began.  You could see that he was supported by his beloved mother, Kimberley  Davis, in the way he supported our team--always ready to help out and  pitch in for the mission. You could see that he was helped and mentored  by his uncles and aunts in the way he helped and mentored the new  members of our office whom he worked with.   Today, in the gallery, in addition to John's mother, Kimberley, we  are joined by his uncle John and John's wife, Carol; and Christian  Gibbs, who was like an uncle to John.   You could see how much John was loved by those closest to him by how  much he loved and embraced others, and he, in turn, was loved and  respected by our entire Capitol Hill family. He was an example to all  of us of a person who put everyone else's challenges ahead of his own.   Our office wants to hold John Amara Walters up as a model to other  young people who walk through our doors. As I mentioned, John began his  service with us when he was an intern, and we have decided to establish  a permanent paid internship position in John's name and memory, and  that position will always go to a student from Maryland who is  attending Howard University.   In that way, we know that the young leaders of the future will learn  about John's spirit and his legacy and learn to carry forward his torch  of empathy and positive change.   John wanted to help others. He wanted to leave the world better than  he found it. He did that and much more. While his life was far too  short in years, it was long in the joy and the love he shared and in  the lives he changed for the better.   Thank you, John. We love you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
