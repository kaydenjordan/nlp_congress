 Madam Speaker, I am proud to lead on H.R. 4470,  Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act  of 2023.   The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, or CFATS, program  identifies and regulates high-risk chemical facilities to ensure they  are protected from terrorist attacks. This program must be reauthorized  by July 27 to ensure these standards of protection against cyber and  physical risks remain in place.   On July 20, the Committee on Homeland Security voted unanimously on a  bipartisan basis to reauthorize CFATS. I encourage my colleagues to  support this bill.   CFATS is a regulatory program that is broadly supported by industry.  This 2-year extension will ensure continuity and security while  enabling the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee  to work with regulated entities to identify any needed enhancements and  changes.   I thank Chairman Green for moving this bill expeditiously through  committee, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this  legislation.
