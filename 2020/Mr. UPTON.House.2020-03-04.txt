 Madam Speaker, this legislation is how this place is  supposed to work--real substance, forget the politics.   We have an emergency. We really do. And I thank the leadership on  both sides of the aisle for bringing this bill to the floor so quickly.   The bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus met for an hour just yesterday  at the White House to promise to work together, not only with the  administration, but with Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate.  Many of us, the last couple of weeks, have met with the HHS Secretary,  CDC, FDA, NIH, as well as with our health leaders in our States.   This money is not only going to help our health officials on the  front lines; it is going to help our families in virtually every  community. It is also going to help develop the vaccine and the  therapeutics to save perhaps tens of thousands of lives.   The 21st Century Cures legislation that most of us supported 3 years  ago has laid the foundation to expedite the cures for so many  illnesses, including this one. This is a moment in time when we need to  step up for the safety of our families, our communities, and our  Nation.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this money that  is so desperately needed and get it to the President as quickly as we  can.
