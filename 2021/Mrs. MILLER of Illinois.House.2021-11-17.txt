 Madam Speaker, our Nation's cattle ranchers  are going bankrupt and yet, the price of beef remains expensive and  continues to rise.   The price disparities between live cattle prices and wholesale beef  rise in tandem with historic levels of consolidation in the meat  packing sector and minimal levels of competition in the marketplace.   My colleagues and I, along with cattle producers nationwide, are  asking for action to strengthen the integrity of the cattle market and  are requesting an update on the Department of Justice's investigation  into the four largest meatpackers in the United States. We must  determine if any manipulation, collusion, or other illegal activity may  be occurring in order to ensure market transparency.   It is vital for the continuation of the American beef industry that  market manipulation is identified. We must stand with our farmers and  ranchers for fair, competitive, and free market business practices.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the only thing President  Biden, Speaker Pelosi, and the Democrats in Congress will be building  back better is China's economy. Truly, they are building Beijing back  better.   A new report released today shows that China has officially surpassed  the U.S. as the richest nation in the world because Congress gave China  most favored nation status under the Clinton administration. They have  definitely tipped the scales for Chinese manufacturing.   D.C. politicians themselves have been enriched off of China, while  the American middle class suffers. Now Democrats are pushing the Green  New Deal policies that will make the middle class suffer even more with  higher gas prices and home heating bills this winter.   Biden's policies enrich China because they manufacture solar panels,  lithium batteries, and windmills, and taxpayers are going to be forced  to subsidize this.   China mines these minerals for batteries and solar panels with child  labor and slave labor. When asked about the slave labor behind the  Green New Deal, John Kerry said it was ``not my lane.'' That is  despicable.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Keller  for yielding. It has been great starting the day today in prayer for  our country and now finishing with this Special Order.   The Fifth Circuit blocking OSHA's COVID mandate is a huge win for the  American people, but Biden and the far left aren't going to give up  this power grab without a fight.   This vaccine mandate would destroy what is left of our economy and  make Americans less safe.   We are forcing people to quit their jobs with unconstitutional  mandates from an out-of-control Federal Government.   This mandate is causing the American people to be less safe by making  firefighters, police officers, Border Patrol, and nurses to choose  between the jab or their job.   If U.S. military members are discharged, China and our adversaries  stand to be the beneficiaries.   Natural immunity is completely ignored because natural immunity  doesn't have a lobbyist here in D.C.   We cannot sit idly by while the government works to centralize the  personal health information of Americans. Americans have the God-given  right to the pursuit of happiness, and we will not bow to king Biden  and his unconstitutional edicts.
