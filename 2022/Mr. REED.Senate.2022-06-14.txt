 Madam President, I rise today in support of the Sergeant  First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promises to Address  Comprehensive Toxics Act, also known as the Honoring our PACT Act.   Our Nation asks a great deal of our servicemembers and their  families. We ask them to be ready to fight and to win against a wide  range of security challenges across the globe. Our Armed Forces know  and understand the threats they may face on the battlefield.  Unfortunately, servicemembers also face threats that aren't as  apparent--exposure to toxic materials. These exposures can result in  rare and sometimes fatal medical conditions.   From exposure to Agent Orange to radiation from nuclear tests,  veterans have carried an extra burden because of their service. It has  too often been a struggle to recognize and address those impacts.   Now, a new generation is dealing with the long-term effects of toxic  exposure. Indeed, during their service, up to 3\1/2\ million veterans  have been exposed to toxic burn pits. As the name implies, burn pits  are pits where all forms of waste, including toxic waste, are disposed  of by burning. Our servicemembers lived and worked in close proximity  to these burn pits, often without knowing the potential consequences to  their long-term health or any way to avoid it.   Since 2009, the Department of Defense has recognized the harm burn  [[Page S2927]]  pits can cause. The health consequences are so serious that in the  fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, within that  legislation, we included a provision that says that the only way the  Department of Defense can now use a burn pit overseas is if the  Secretary of Defense personally issues a waiver. It is an authority  that cannot be delegated to anyone else in the Department.   The bill we have before us today would really honor our obligation to  care for other veterans by acknowledging the injuries and illnesses  they sustain in serving our country and providing them with treatment.   The bill would expand eligibility for VA healthcare for the 3\1/2\  million veterans who were exposed to burn pits. It would also eliminate  the burden of proof for veterans for 23 conditions presumed to be  caused by toxic exposure. It will create a new framework for the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs to evaluate the science around burn pits  and establish other presumptive conditions associated with toxic  exposure. It will also provide significant resources for the VA to  carry out the expansion of benefits in this bill, including provisions  on staffing, retention, pay, and leasing of new VA facilities.   Every generation of Americans has had men and women who were willing  to serve our country in uniform. As chairman of the Armed Services  Committee, I have had the honor of traveling across the globe to meet  with our deployed servicemembers, including numerous trips to  Afghanistan and Iraq.   Our servicemembers and our veterans truly represent what is best in  our country. We honor and venerate their heroism in combat, but too  often in the past, we have overlooked and dismissed the long-term  health effects of their service.   This is changing.   With this bill, we will do the right thing for our toxic-exposed and  combat veterans and their families. We can ensure that they have access  to the care and services they deserve and have earned.   I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this important  piece of legislation.   Before I yield the floor, I must recognize the extraordinary work of  Senator Jon Tester and Senator Jerry Moran, the chair and ranking  member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. This was an extraordinary  effort. It was bipartisan. It was motivated by the recognition on both  sides of the aisle of the service and sacrifice of thousands and  thousands of men and women. But we would not be here today without the  undaunted and unflagging dedication of Jon Tester and Jerry. I salute  both of them.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 14 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.
