 Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring  Ulysses S. Grant, Civil War general and 18th President of the United  States, who was born in Point Pleasant, OH, 200 years ago this week.   In honor of the bicentennial of Grant's birthday, which took place  yesterday on April 27, 2022, I joined Senator Blunt of Missouri to  introduce a concurrent resolution in the Senate. This resolution honors  Grant for his efforts and leadership in defending the union of the  United States of America, recognizes his military victories, and  affirms him as one of the most influential military commanders in our  Nation's history. I spoke about President Grant's accomplishments  briefly on the floor yesterday, but want to take this opportunity to  elaborate on my remarks.   Ulysses S. Grant was a proud Ohioan, born in Point Pleasant, OH, to  Jesse Grant and Hannah Simpson Grant on April 27, 1822. I know a number  of celebrations were held in Ohio to honor the 200th anniversary.  Grant's family soon moved to Georgetown, OH, in Brown County. Grant  spent the remainder of his youth in the house his parents built in  Georgetown. Both his birthplace and boyhood home are preserved as  historic sites that draw visitors to Ohio communities today. In 1839,  Grant left Ohio to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point,  graduating in 1843.   Grant was instrumental to the Union victory in the Civil War, leading  Union forces to critical early victories in the  [[Page S2216]]  West at Fort Donelson, Shiloh, Vicksburg, and Chattanooga. After  President Lincoln appointed him Lieutenant-General of the Army in 1864,  he commanded all Union armies until the conclusion of the war. At  Appomattox, Grant prescribed terms of surrender intended to set the  stage for postwar reconciliation.   Grant's legacy extends beyond his role in the Civil War. Grant was  elected the 18th President of the United States in 1868 and was  decisively elected to a second term in 1872, the only two-term  President between Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson. As President, he  oversaw the orderly readmittance of States following the Civil War,  completing the restoration of the Union by 1871.   An ardent supporter of Reconstruction, President Grant championed the  ratification of the 15th Amendment to prohibit discrimination in voting  rights on the basis of ``race, color, or previous condition of  servitude.'' In 1870, he oversaw the creation of the Department of  Justice, essential to the prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan and  enforcement of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S.  Constitution, the ``Reconstruction Amendments.''   Grant was an advocate for civil rights, endorsing and then signing  the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to outlaw racial segregation in public  accommodations, schools, transportation, and juries, nearly a century  before such protections would be effectively enforced.   And although President Theodore Roosevelt is most often associated  with our National Parks, it was President Grant who designated  Yellowstone as the first National Park in 1872.   After his presidency, Grant traveled the world and wrote his memoirs.  ``The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant'' became a bestseller and  garnered lasting critical acclaim, praised by Mark Twain for its  ``clarity of statement, directness, simplicity, unpretentiousness,  manifest truthfulness, fairness and justice toward friend and foe  alike, soldierly candor and frankness, and soldierly avoidance of  flowery speech.''   As I said yesterday on the Senate floor, history has not always been  kind to Grant. But as we commemorate his 200th birthday, his legacy is  being reevaluated and his far-reaching impact more fully appreciated.  Frederick Douglass eulogized Grant as ``a man too broad for prejudice,  too humane to despise the humblest, too great to be small at any  point.'' I urge my colleagues to join Senator Blunt and I in honoring  one of Ohio's finest, Ulysses S. Grant, for these remarkable qualities,  for his role in preserving the Union of the United States as a general  in the Civil War, and for his defense of Reconstruction and Civil  Rights as President.                            ____________________
