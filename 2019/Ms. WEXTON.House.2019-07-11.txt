 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.   My amendment, No. 401, would examine the feasibility of piloting a  workforce transition program for Active-Duty servicemen and -women who  are currently in counterintelligence roles to give them the opportunity  to obtain additional security clearance credentials upon their  separation from service.   A problem that many servicemembers in counterintelligence face upon  separation from the military is that they are unable to transition  their security clearances to be eligible to start work immediately for,  or in support of, a Federal intelligence agency.   The wait time to transition a security clearance can take over a  year, and many of these individuals are forced to consider taking a  lower paying job while they wait for the process to move forward, or we  lose these individuals entirely when they take jobs in the private  sector outside the intelligence community.   These are members serving in roles that are in critical needs areas  for our intelligence areas, such as cyberspace operations, cyber  electronic warfare, and military intelligence.   Because of these difficulties, our intelligence agencies are losing  out on a highly qualified and diverse talent pool whose skills and  training have already been paid for by the Federal Government.   Madam Chair, my amendment would help ensure that those veterans who  have service in our military's intelligence fields, can continue to use  their abilities to protect our Nation well beyond their military  service.
