 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  Representative Duncan's amendment to strike from the bill section 436,  which prohibits the issuance of an import permit for a sport-hunted  trophy of an elephant or lion taken in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, or Zambia.   Simply put, this import prohibition would harm the economic  development of African countries and put the wildlife and habitat in  those countries at risk.   This is exactly what the Zambian Foreign Minister told me when I met  with him:   Regulated, sustainable hunting can be used for economic development  just like any other natural resource. And in the vast majority of  instances, hunting revenue and game fees are the greatest and most  accessible asset for rural people.   By creating a market for regulated hunting of these animals, African  countries promote conservation and undermine incentives for illegal  poaching.   A U.S. import ban undermines those markets in African countries,  which perpetuates unsustainable poaching, underground markets, poverty,  and economic underdevelopment.   The individuals who seek to prevent African countries from  responsibly using their natural resources are the same who strive to  end the production of agriculture in States like North Dakota.   They impart a flawed moral view on others without understanding the  economic and cultural ramifications that harm the communities that  produce these resources. It is paternalistic and, quite frankly, it is  condescending and, in fact, counterproductive to a robust conservation  of the magnificent animals and the habitat in which those animals live.   Hunters and sportsmen are truly the world's best conservationists,  and the resources we deploy go toward anti-poaching programs; defend  against destruction of vital habitat; and incentivize local communities  to come together to protect their wildlife.   I urge the adoption of the Duncan amendment, which will promote  sustainable hunting markets with African countries.
