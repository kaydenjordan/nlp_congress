 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague  Congressman Good, and I appreciate the words of wisdom of my colleague  Ralph Norman.   Mr. Speaker, let me begin with an uplifting statement. God is still  on the throne, and we, his humble children, have a responsibility to be  worthy of his love and grace and the anointing of what it is to be an  American citizen.   Every generation of Americans has risen to face the challenge and  threat that our Nation has endured now 240 years.   In our generation, one of the most insidious threats that we face is  the degree of debt that we have allowed, in my generation, our Nation  to assume. We now face a $33 trillion debt. That is $33,000 billion.   Mr. Speaker, if this body were to balance the budget--which is our  goal, by the way. It is why we are here tonight addressing this Chamber  and the Nation that we love, standing shoulder to shoulder with each  other so that our words are forever inscribed on the historical record  of our country, that some stood to fight for the future of our  Republic, to restore fiscal sanity to this body.   Were this body to produce a balanced budget and we were to run a $1  billion surplus, Mr. Speaker, it would require 33,000 years to address  a $33 trillion debt with a $1 billion surplus, and 1 billion is 1,000  million.   Every American has imagined, well, what would I do if I had a million  dollars? I would pay off my house, settle my debts, take care of my  family, build mother-in-law a house. I would set aside some money for  my children and my grandchildren. I would bring generational growth to  my family if I won the lottery and had a million dollars.   In this town, we throw around trillions like it is nothing. Every  dollar that we spend in deficit every year is put upon our  grandchildren. Is this reflective of anointed value that our  [[Page H4294]]  Lord has bestowed upon us as American citizens?   As we stand beneath the glory, Mr. Speaker, of one flag, we are  ultimately one people. The challenge of this generation and this body  and this majority party, this Republican Party, an honor that I wield  not upon my lapel but within my heart of what it is to be a  conservative constitutionalist Republican American citizen, I stand in  the body that is responsible to correct course that our Nation has  taken up.   Mr. Speaker, it was 1980 before America had accumulated $1 trillion  of debt. Since then, we have added $32 trillion of debt.   It took 200 years to accumulate $1 trillion of debt, and now we have  $33 trillion. It is unsustainable, so we are demanding a correction of  course because our Nation is headed precipitously to a fiscal cliff  beyond which we may never recover as a Nation.                                time  2015    We love our country enough that we are willing to stand and fight for  the future of our Republic. If it makes some of my colleagues  uncomfortable, oh, well.   If you are willing to participate in the change of spending  trajectory that this generation is required to produce, then stand with  us. If not, if you don't quite have the courage, at least get out of  our way. If you oppose us, prepare for a fight.   We love our country enough to stand in this Chamber and make some  noise about the debt that we have accumulated and the deficit spending  that we continue to add.   Perhaps my colleague, Congressman Good, has a comment to share with  the Speaker regarding the difference between our national debt and our  annual deficit and how quickly we are adding to our debt at a rate that  has never been seen in our history.    Mr. Speaker, our Nation can still succeed,  reflective of the will of the people that we have sworn to serve. What  we require in order to deliver is not an imagined, unreachable goal or  an unreasonable demand. What we require of our Republican colleagues is  that they embrace the core principles upon which the Republican Party  has been built. Just stand upon the core principles that they claim to  possess and help us save our country from bankruptcy.   We have the power of the purse. May I say with respect to my  colleagues in the Senate, the Founders knew what they were doing when  they created a bicameral Congress. If they wanted a unicameral  Congress, they would have had one. That was stated last night at our  Freedom Caucus meeting, words of wisdom spoken.   We are the House of Representatives. We are the voice of we, the  people. We control the Nation's wealth or squander it. We have reached  a point that is untenable to continue.   We ask our brothers and sisters, the most conservative rank of our  conference, the Freedom Caucus, all of whom we respect, we ask the  Speaker, whom we elected, to stand with the conservative voice that is  itself reflective of the voice of the people we have sworn to serve,  let us change the trajectory of spending across our 12 appropriations  bills which are filled with  [[Page H4295]]  conservative policy that is transformative for our Nation if we can  pass those bills. Let us join and stand as one and pass those bills  reflective of our agreement at 2022 spending levels, and in some cases  pre-COVID 2019 spending levels.   None of us here, Mr. Speaker, would stand and say that the Federal  Government was too small in 2019 or didn't spend enough money in 2022.  All we ask is a reasonable adjustment to the trajectory of spending.  This is why we are speaking to you tonight, Mr. Speaker, and we ask  that our voices be heard respectfully by our colleagues. Let us save  our Republic.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Norman and  Congressman Good.
