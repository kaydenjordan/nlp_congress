 Mr. Speaker, I represent one of the hardest hit  communities in the hardest hit city in this country, Queens, New York-- 13 dead in a night in Elmhurst Hospital alone. Our community's reality  is this country's future if we don't do anything.   Hospital workers do not have protective equipment. We don't have the  necessary ventilators. But we have to go into this vote eyes wide open.   What did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate  bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful.   The greed of that fight is wrong for crumbs for our families. And the  option that we have is to either let them suffer with nothing or to  allow this greed and billions of dollars, which will be leveraged into  trillions of dollars to contribute to the largest income inequality gap  in our future.   There should be shame about what was fought for in this bill and the  choices that we have to make.
