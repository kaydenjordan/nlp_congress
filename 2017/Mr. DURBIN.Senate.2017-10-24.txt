The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to  reconsider is considered made and laid upon the table with respect to  the prior vote.   The Senator from Idaho.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this vote really gives the U.S. Senate a  choice. On one side, we have the biggest banks in America, financial  institutions, which are arguing that you as a consumer, as someone who  uses their banks, should be basically signing an arbitration clause  that denies you the freedom to go to court. On the other side, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has argued these financial  institutions are misusing this power, denying people access to courts,  and it should come to an end. That is the choice.   I think I know who is going to win. I am not sure if the party on the  other side of the aisle would have called this issue if they didn't  already have it lined up for the financial institutions. I know many on  the other side, maybe most, hate the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau like the devil hates holy water. The notion that this agency is  going to stand up for consumers across America is something they find  repugnant, something they would like to end tomorrow. I say thank  goodness they are there.   There ought to be one agency in the Federal Government, at least just  one, that speaks up for the little guy when it comes to these  transactions. Think about the 3\1/2\ million people defrauded by Wells  Fargo. These were people who had their identities stolen, had their  Social Security numbers purloined for opening credit card and bank  accounts that they never asked for--3\1/2\ million of them.   Let me tell you the story of one of them. It is a pretty interesting  story. Her name is Tracy Kilgore. She is from New Mexico. She was not  even a customer of Wells Fargo Bank, but she went in because she was  the treasurer of a local chapter of the Daughters of the American  Revolution. She went to the Wells Fargo branch one day in 2011 to have  the names on the organization's existing account changed. A few weeks  later, she received a rejection letter for a Wells Fargo credit card  that she had never applied for.   It turns out the bank teller at Wells Fargo had taken the information  she had given and submitted a credit card application on her behalf  without her knowing it. The application was rejected and hurt Ms.  Kilgore's credit score for a credit card she never asked for. Ms.  Kilgore is fighting for her right to hold Wells Fargo accountable in  court and to join with millions like her who have been victims of Wells  Fargo's misconduct.   The Republicans tonight are saying they feel sorry for Wells Fargo.  They really do. To think that this company manufactured and created  3\1/2\ million phony credit card and bank accounts at the expense of  customers like Tracy Kilgore doesn't seem to move them at all. Instead,  they want to stand by Wells Fargo, which put in that credit card  application an arbitration clause which said: Tracy Kilgore, you can't  go to court. You can't have your day in court. You have given it up.  You signed it away to Wells Fargo.   Would Tracy go to court anyway? Let's say she had to file a new  credit report and it cost her $100. Is she likely to file a lawsuit  against Wells Fargo? Probably not. Multiply that times 3\1/2\ million  people who were defrauded by this bank, and you understand how a class  action suit can finally hold Wells Fargo's feet to the fire, hold them  accountable for literally cheating this woman and millions just like  her.   The Republicans are arguing tonight that we ought to feel sorry for  Wells Fargo. I don't. I don't feel sorry for them. I feel sorry for  Tracy Kilgore, who, because of the arbitration clause, lost her  opportunity to go to court and ask for simple justice from a judge or  jury.   How about Equifax? If you think 3\1/2\ million people defrauded by  Wells Fargo is a pretty awful situation, here is one dramatically  worse. One hundred forty-five million--let me see. Right off the top of  my head, that is about half of the people in this country. One hundred  forty-five million Americans--five and one-half million who live in my  State, that is almost half of our State population--had their personal  data exposed in a massive Equifax data breach. In other words, if you  had filed in the distant past, and there was a credit report on you,  Equifax had all the information about you and your family, your banks,  your Social Security numbers, and all the rest of it, Equifax ended up  with a massive breach. Somebody hacked into their computer and stole  your personal identity information, to the tune of 145 million  Americans.   Equifax really felt bad about this. Here is what they said. Equifax,  in response to this data breach, initially offered a free credit  monitoring service for any customer who signed up, out of the 145  million. In other words, we will monitor to see if somebody stole your  identity, they are misusing it, and hurting your credit status, but  they added something: as long as the customer signed a forced  arbitration  [[Page S6745]]  clause in fine print that prohibited them from joining a class action.  Equifax wants to help you, even though they initially hurt you, as long  as you will guarantee that you will never hold them accountable in  court. How about that for a deal?   That is what the Republicans are defending tonight, exactly what I  just described. They feel sorry for Equifax. They feel sorry for Wells  Fargo. They want to make sure these banks and these credit companies  really have a friend in the U.S. Senate.   We don't know if Equifax, which now claims it will no longer impose  this forced arbitration on victims, will stand by that if they are ever  challenged in court. We ought to ask ourselves why major groups across  the United States standing up for just ordinary Americans find this  Republican strategy on the floor tonight so reprehensible.   Listen to the groups that oppose this effort: the American Legion,  the Consumer Federation of America, the NAACP, the United Automobile  Workers, and many other consumer groups. They are saying: Why won't  somebody in Washington speak up for the average American who is being  defrauded by these banks, defrauded by these credit agencies? Why won't  somebody in the Senate stand up for the agency that finally said enough  and finally said that these financial institutions have had their way  long enough?   Many of these financial institutions are hiding behind your local  hometown banks. You know the ones I am talking about. I have them in my  hometown of Springfield, IL. They are saying that this is all about  your local community banks and your credit unions. We don't want to  hurt them.   Here are the facts. Ninety percent of your community banks and credit  unions do not have these arbitration clauses in their agreements. Do  you know who does? The big banks. Sixty percent of the big Wall Street  banks have these clauses, and they are the ones who are really behind  this fight, the Wells Fargo and the other ones who want to maintain  this ability to stop consumers from going to court to protect  themselves when they have been defrauded by banks and credit and  financial institutions.   This is a classic illustration of power in Washington. Is there any  power in the hands of consumers and ordinary Americans? We will find  out in the vote tonight. I am afraid it wouldn't be called on the other  side of the aisle unless they figured the banks were going to win,  again. It is unfortunate. We ought to live in a society where consumers  have a fighting chance, and the system is not rigged against them. An  arbitration clause is a way to rig a contract so a consumer is going to  lose twice: lose when the bank takes advantage of them and lose when  they try to go to court and they are stopped by the arbitration clause.   Consumers in this country have a battle on every single day to make a  living and to get by. This is an effort to take away one of your  freedoms to go to court with a group of people who have been aggrieved  just like you, have your day in court, win or lose. The Republicans  want to take that away and so do the banks. I hope they don't prevail.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
