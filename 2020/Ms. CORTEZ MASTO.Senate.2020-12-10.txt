 Mr. President, today I am honored to  recognize former Reno mayor and justice of the peace for the Reno  Justice Court, Pete Sferrazza, who retired in October of this year.   Mr. Sferrazza has a long history of public service to the great State  of Nevada. He served as Reno's mayor from 1981 until 1995, an  unprecedented length of service, and served as a judge on the Reno  Justice Court from 2008 until his retirement earlier this year. In the  intervening years, Mr. Sferrazza served as county commissioner for  Washoe County, from 1998 to 2007.   During his time as mayor and throughout his life of public service,  Mr. Sferrazza focused on advancing labor rights and economic  prosperity, while promoting the beauty of the Reno community. As mayor,  he led the establishment of the City of Reno Arts Commission, as well  as the creation of Reno's Victim Advocate Program, which has served as  a model for the rest of the State. Mr. Sferrazza was also responsible  for helping to preserve the Mt. Rose Wilderness and supporting the  iconic Truckee River Walk.   In a time of seemingly stark political divide, Mr. Sferrazza is a  shining example of what an elected official can and should be. As  county commissioner, he approved a number of expansions of Reno's  downtown and helped to consolidate various local emergency services,  increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Finally, during his time on  the Reno Justice Court, Mr. Sferrazza was elected by his colleagues as  president of the American Judges Association, the largest judges'  association in the United States. His willingness and desire to help  everyone in his community have been crucial to the city's development,  especially as the city continues to grow into the 21st century.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Pete Sferrazza as  he retires after decades of serving the city of Reno, Washoe County,  and the State of Nevada in so many ways. His time in public office has  made the Reno-Sparks community stronger and more inclusive for  everyone, and I want to thank him for his service and lifelong  commitment to leaving the Truckee Meadows a better place than he found  it.                            ____________________
