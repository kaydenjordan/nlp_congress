 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1112) to require a report on the military coup in Burma, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1112         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Democracy in Burma       Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On March 14, 2005, the House of Representatives agreed       to H. Res. 135, which established the House Democracy       Assistance Commission (later changed to the House Democracy       Partnership, hereafter referred to as ``HDP'') to work       directly with parliaments around the world to support the       development of effective, independent, and responsive       legislative institutions.        (2) HDP approved a legislative strengthening partnership       with Burma in 2016 and organized the first congressional       delegation to meet with the new civilian-led government, led       by State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, and civil society       leaders in May 2016.        (3) On February 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of State       assessed that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma's       ruling party, and President Win Myint, the duly elected head       of government, were deposed in a military coup on February 1,       2021.        (4) As part of the military coup, the Burmese military       declared martial law, suspended the civilian-led government,       and detained newly elected Members of Parliament  [[Page H1561]]       in the capitol, Naypyidaw, thereby usurping the role of the       democratically elected government and parliament.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) due to the Burmese military's seizure of government       through the detention of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi,       President Win Myint, and other government leaders, Burma is       not represented by a democratically-elected government;        (2) the inability of newly elected Members of Parliament to       begin their official mandate due to the Burmese military's       actions directly threatens the democratic trajectory of       Burma's Parliament, and thereby the country;        (3) the will and determination of those duly-elected       Members of Parliament who are taking it upon themselves to       continue serving as representatives of the people through       alternative methods of communicating and convening should be       lauded; and        (4) by preventing the Parliament from completing its work,       the Burmese military has rendered impossible and effectively       nullified the international collaborative relationships that       have supported and strengthened the institution, including       the Burmese parliament's partnership with HDP.       SEC. 4. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES REGARDING BURMA'S                     DEMOCRACY.         It is the policy of the United States to--        (1) condemn the military coup in Burma, to urge the       unconditional release of detained democratically-elected       leaders and civil society members, and to support a return to       Burma's democratic transition;        (2) instruct, as appropriate, representatives of the United       States Government to use the voice, vote, and influence of       the United States at the United Nations to hold accountable       those responsible for the military coup in Burma; and        (3) engage with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations       (ASEAN) and ASEAN member states to promote a return to       Burma's democratic transition and democratic values       throughout Southeast Asia, and support the centrality of       ASEAN within the regional architecture of the Indo-Pacific.       SEC. 5. REPORT.         Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the       Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate a report on the military coup in       Burma, including a description of efforts to implement the       policy specified in section 4.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1112, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to start by thanking Mr. Connolly for this  important bill before us today.   The Protect Democracy in Burma Act of 2021 is a timely measure that  ensures the United States is not silent when a military coup supplants  democracy. It also directs strong U.S. engagement with our partners at  the U.N. and ASEAN because we are always stronger when we are united.   In 2015, decades of brutal military rule gave way to what many hoped  would be a new era of reform and democratization in Burma. That hope  was short-lived, and the Tatmadaw began to show its true colors as it  engaged in a genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority.   Now, a little more than 5 years after the democratic opening that it  helped usher in, the military has halted Burma's democratic experiment.   By all accounts, Burma's November 2020 parliamentary elections were  credible, and claims of widespread fraud have been debunked by  election-monitoring authorities. The United States condemns, in the  strongest possible terms, the actions of the Burmese military and its  violent crackdown and killing of protesters. But we cannot stand alone.                                time  1545    To be most effective, the United States must work with our partners  in the region in condemning the Tatmadaw's brutal actions in supporting  democracy and respect for the election outcome.   Madam Speaker, that is exactly what this bill sets out to do. It  makes clear where the U.S. stands. It promotes multilateral cooperation  as we work to hold the Burmese military accountable and call for a  return to Burma's democratic transition. It also ensures reporting to  Congress so that we can properly review U.S. policy.   Madam Speaker, this is a very important bill that sends a message to  the people of Burma and to the entire world, and I urge my colleagues  to support this measure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), an esteemed member of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs and author of this important bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price), the distinguished chairman of the House  Democracy Partnership.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the esteemed  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, again, I want to thank Mr. Connolly for introducing  this legislation, and I want to thank Ranking Member McCaul and my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle for making sure that we have  a singular voice going forward.   The world cannot turn a blind eye to the violence perpetrated by the  Burmese military. With this important measure, the United States sends  a clear signal that we stand with the people of Burma in their  longstanding pursuit for democracy, and a strong message to the Burmese  military, or to anyone, for that matter, who fail to uphold the will of  the people.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 134) condemning the military coup that took  place on February 1, 2021, in Burma and the Burmese military detention  of civilian leaders, calling for the release of all those detained and  for those elected to serve in Parliament to resume their duties, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 134         Whereas the military of Burma (hereinafter referred to as       the ``Tatmadaw'') held power in Burma between 1962 and 2011;        Whereas provisions in the 2008 Constitution of Burma,       written by the Tatmadaw, allocate 25 percent of parliamentary       seats to the Tatmadaw, conferring powers on the Tatmadaw that       have been used to suppress basic rights, including freedoms       of expression, assembly, and association;        Whereas, in 2010, Burma conducted its first election, which       was neither free nor fair, under the new Constitution, and       which was boycotted by the National League for Democracy       (NLD);        Whereas Burma conducted elections in November 2015, in       which the NLD came to power;        Whereas Burma's November 8, 2020, elections resulted in the       NLD securing enough seats in Parliament to form the next       government, notwithstanding the disenfranchisement of more       than 1,500,000 voters, mostly from ethnic minority       communities in Kachin, Karen, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, and Chin       states;        Whereas the Tatmadaw conducted a coup against the civilian       government on February 1, 2021, hours before Parliament was       to convene in a new session;        Whereas the Tatmadaw claimed they had evidence of       parliamentary election fraud perpetrated by the NLD and       Burma's Union Election Commission, an allegation that       contradicted the judgment of several independent election       monitoring organizations that the electoral process and       outcome were credible despite minor irregularities;        Whereas the Tatmadaw has detained unlawfully State       Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi,  [[Page H1564]]       President Win Myint, and other leaders of the NLD, as well as       prodemocracy activists from the 88 Generation and other civil       society leaders;        Whereas the Tatmadaw has charged State Counselor Aung San       Suu Kyi with importing walkie-talkies illegally and President       Win Myint with violating prohibitions on gatherings during       the COVID-19 pandemic;        Whereas the Tatmadaw has declared a state of emergency       until new elections are held in one year;        Whereas the Tatmadaw has restricted freedom of movement,       telecommunications, and the media, limiting access to       information to and from Burma during a political and public       health crisis;        Whereas, on January 31, 2021, the Secretary-General of the       United Nations spokesperson released the following       condemnation of the coup, which reads, in part, ``The       Secretary-General strongly condemns the detention of State       Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, President U Win Myint and       other political leaders on the eve of the opening session of       Myanmar's new Parliament. He expresses his grave concern       regarding the declaration of the transfer of all legislative,       executive and judicial powers to the military. These       developments represent a serious blow to democratic reforms       in Myanmar.'';        Whereas, on February 1, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden,       Jr., condemned the coup in a statement that read, in part,       ``The military's seizure of power in Burma, the detention of       Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian officials, and the       declaration of a national state of emergency are a direct       assault on the country's transition to democracy and the rule       of law.'';        Whereas protests opposing the coup have swept Burma;        Whereas the House of Representatives passed H. Res. 1091 on       December 13, 2018, expressing the sense of the House of       Representatives that the atrocities committed against the       Rohingya by the Tatmadaw and security forces beginning in       August 2017 constituted crimes against humanity and genocide;       and        Whereas the United States has sanctioned Tatmadaw officials       previously, including Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing, for       the atrocities committed against the Rohingya, and the       International Court of Justice is investigating the       Tatmadaw's conduct: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the military coup that took place on February       1, 2021;        (2) stands with the people of Burma in their ambition for       sustainable peace, a genuine democracy, and the realization       of human rights for all, including for ethnic minorities       whose human rights have been violated repeatedly and who have       been disenfranchised historically;        (3) condemns any attacks on civilians and supports the use       of all diplomatic and development tools to ensure that       civilians are safe during conflict;        (4) calls on the Tatmadaw to--        (A) release all those currently detained arbitrarily as a       result of the February 1st coup;        (B) restore all forms of communications, including internet       services;        (C) remove all impediments to free travel that have been       imposed as a result of the coup, apart from legitimate travel       restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic;        (D) return to power all members of the civilian government;        (E) allow for freedom of expression, including the right to       protest, press freedom, and freedom of movement;        (F) allow unfettered reporting from local, national, and       international media; and        (G) refrain from mass evictions; and        (5) calls on the President of the United States and the       Secretary of State to--        (A) encourage both the return to power of all members of       the civilian government and, subsequently, constitutional       reforms to address the power conferred to the Tatmadaw in       Parliament and the disenfranchisement of ethnic minorities in       Burma;        (B) reinstate sanctions and impose new restrictions aimed       at the Tatmadaw and those responsible for the February 1st       coup;        (C) work with the international partners and multilateral       institutions, including the United Nations Security Council,       to condemn the coup and enact multilateral, targeted       sanctions on the military, military-owned businesses,       including the Myanmar Economic Corporation and Myanmar       Economic Holdings Limited, and others connected to the coup,       including an international arms embargo;        (D) coordinate with international partners and allies,       especially those with economic investments in Burma, with       respect to planned economic consequences for the coup and       ensuring those consequences are tailored to avoid impacting       Burmese civilians;        (E) ensure that targeted sanctions allow all necessary       exemptions to permit the delivery of humanitarian assistance       to civilians in need;        (F) ensure that United States-based social media companies,       including Facebook, not allow their platforms to be used as       vehicles for disinformation campaigns or advocating violence       against the Burmese people;        (G) implement restrictions on diplomatic, economic, and       security relations with Burma until a full restoration of       civilian-controlled Parliament, and release of those detained       in connection with the coup; and        (H) direct the United States Permanent Representative to       the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of       the United States to bring about greater international       cooperation to pursue justice and accountability in Burma.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 134.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative Levin for sponsoring  this resolution, which condemns the military coup that occurred in  Burma on February 1, 2021.   It has been more than 45 days since the Burmese military, also known  as the Tatmadaw, arrested several democratically-elected members of  government, including the President Win Myint, and the State Counselor,  Aung San Suu Kyi, and declared a year-long state of emergency, and  nullified the results of Burma's November 8, 2020, elections.   Despite Tatmadaw claims of election fraud, several independent  election monitoring organizations found that the electoral process and  outcome were credible, even despite minor irregularities.   Since the coup took place, we have seen thousands of protesters take  to the streets to make sure that their voices were heard; voices in  opposition to the coup and in support of democracy. And as those  protests continued, we have seen security forces increasingly use  violence in an attempt to quell the demonstrations.   The U.N. estimates that 149 people have been killed since the coup  occurred on February 1. Fifty-seven people were killed this past  weekend alone.   It is imperative that democracies around the world speak out in  condemnation of this coup and the arrest of democratically-elected  government officials. It is vital that we speak in support of  democracy, of all of those members of civil society who have been  arrested, and those in Burma who are protesting for the restoration of  democracy. And it is important that we make it clear to the Tatmadaw,  including through additional targeted sanctions that leverage sources  of income for the military, that these actions are absolutely  unacceptable.   We are sadly, in this body, all too familiar with the rippling  effects of attempts to undo democratic elections. We have an obligation  to speak up and speak out wherever democracy is threatened.   Madam Speaker, this is a very important resolution. I support it and  urge my colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), a  [[Page H1565]]  valued member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and author of  this important resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that the Burmese military respect the  will of the Burmese people and, one, return power to those  democratically elected; and, two, release civilian leaders taken into  custody.   Daily protests against the military coup continue to occur in towns  and cities throughout Burma, and the security forces are using  increasing brutality to crack down against those demonstrating.   We must make it clear that the United States is watching and that we  support the restoration of democracy.   Again, I want to thank Mr. Levin, the ranking member, and my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle for coming together so that the  Burmese people know that the Congress of the United States of America  stands together in their fight for democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
