 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank my friend, the gentleman from Colorado, for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of  H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act.   Mr. Speaker, law enforcement and first responders play an important  role in the safety and security of our communities. I know about that  because of the reason that, when I was a lawyer, I had the privilege of  representing a firefighters association and a police officers  association.   I have represented police officers in court, and I have been in  situations where I have interfaced with them as a lawyer in other  circumstances. They are an invaluable resource represented by the hard  work of dedicated men and women across our Nation.   Most importantly, our admiration for police officers is not a  partisan issue. We universally agree that those officers who diligently  work to protect our communities warrant our praise as we honor them on  this National Police Week.                                time  1245    They are our friends, our neighbors, our family, and they are even  our colleagues. I am honored to serve in this institution with a number  of persons who, in their other activities, were either police officers  or police chiefs that served in that capacity in law enforcement.   We have a new Member here from my State, my good friend,  Representative Val Demings, a career law enforcement officer herself-- 27 years she served--serving as Orlando's first female chief of police.  I have just a footnote to add to that. Val's husband is the sheriff of  Orange County.   It is because of this admiration and bipartisan support that, in some  respects, I was dismayed to see that, as we celebrate National Police  Week, my Republican colleagues decided now was the time to bring this,  in my view, unnecessary messaging bill to the floor simply to score  political points.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 115 would add the murder, attempted murder, or  targeting of a law enforcement official, first responder, or  firefighter as an aggravating factor when determining if a death  sentence is warranted for a defendant convicted of murder in Federal  court.   The problem, Mr. Speaker, is this bill is unnecessary. It is, in  short, really good messaging, but bad policy. Under current law, there  is already an exhaustive list of 16 statutory aggravating factors for  homicide for a jury or court to consider.   Having been involved in the justice system for a protracted time in  my career, I am trying to think of a time that a police officer was  killed and a person was tried and convicted; and I ask my colleagues to  answer that question, that anybody that was convicted for killing a  police officer didn't get the death penalty. I know in my State, in  every instance that that occurred--and they were too numerous, and I  regret that they occurred at all--all of those people got the death  penalty.   We also remember that Federal prosecutors can and do seek the death  penalty in the killing of law enforcement or first responders, as our  friends from Massachusetts are well aware after a death sentence was  handed down in the case involving the Boston Marathon bomber. And that  was in Massachusetts, a nondeath penalty State.   Mr. Speaker, on this front, the system is working. Federal  prosecutors already have the tools to seek the death penalty in cases  where a first responder or law enforcement official was murdered.  What's more, they are using these tools.   Given this duplicity, it is a shame that we are here today debating  the need for a seventeenth new aggravating factor to keep members of  the law enforcement community safe when we could be considering  measures that would actually keep them and their communities they  protect far safer.   Let's be clear. This legislation does nothing to keep law enforcement  officers and first responders safe. By its own purported purpose, this  bill addresses the tragic scenario in which the officer has already  been killed. We need to be working together to create legislation that  has a real impact on keeping our communities and police safer, as  opposed to slapping a catchy name on an unnecessary bill and pretend we  are doing something.   If my Republican colleagues were serious about advancing protections  for law enforcement during National Police Week, we would be discussing  providing them with the tools, the resources, and the training to  engage in beneficial community policing initiatives. Our law  enforcement officers and the communities they police deserve more than  messaging. They deserve real action.   I ask one more question. Ask police officers what their attitude is  about assault weapons. I think you would find that, if we passed an  assault weapons measure, we would be pleasing police officers a great  deal more than messaging to them our concern for their safety.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and then I will yield to a speaker to speak for the previous question.   Mr. Speaker, it may sound like we are getting ready to change the  subject; and, to a relative degree, we are.   We are in very interesting and troubling times in this Nation, and we  have some concerns that need to be addressed. One of the things that is  allowed to the minority is an opportunity to present a previous  question.   In this particular instance, we are deeply concerned by last night's  revelations that, earlier this year, President Trump may have attempted  to obstruct justice when he asked then-FBI Director James Comey to end  the Bureau's investigation of former National Security Advisor Flynn's  ties to Russia. This news came only days after the President  acknowledged that he later fired Director Comey over the Bureau's  investigation into the links between the Trump campaign and Russia, and  only a day after we learned the President shared highly classified  intelligence with Russian officials last week.    I served for 8 years on the Intelligence Committee in this Congress,  and the kind of information that the President shared with the  Russians--even as an Intelligence member, I saw secret, I saw top  secret, I saw high secret, but I did not see code word information, the  highest that is only shared with a few people in the congressional  body--that is what was allowed to be transmitted.   It is time that the Republican-controlled Congress does its job and  acts to defend our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer  an amendment to the rule to bring up a bipartisan bill, H.R. 356, which  would create a nonpartisan commission to investigate Russian  interference in our 2016 election. This marks the seventh time we tried  to bring this bill to the House floor. On the previous six occasions,  the Republican majority regrettably refused the House to even debate  this important legislation.   As more and more facts have come to light, I hope my colleagues will  finally put country ahead of party and get serious about this  investigation. My goodness, the allegation here is that people impacted  our fundamental premise of our existence: our elections. We need to  create this commission with legislation rather than just tweeting about  the need for facts.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California, (Mr. Swalwell), a member of the Intelligence  Committee of the House, to discuss our proposal.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Before recognizing the gentleman from  California, Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in  personalities toward the President.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary  inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, I have heard that often. Will the Speaker  direct me to what I said that was anything more than what is a fact  here. Can the Chair tell me what I said that was dealing with the  personality of the President.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may have, perhaps not in  words, but perhaps gave some indication of illegal activities by the  President.    I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, would the Chair be so kind as to advise my  good friend and I what amount of time remains?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 14\1/2\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Colorado has 24\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend that I anticipate  one more speaker, but at this time I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am sure that my friends across the aisle have their hearts in the  right place, but we need to be clear that these messaging bills do  little to nothing to protect our police officers.   If we truly wanted to help our brave officers and first responders,  we would pass sensible gun reform legislation. We would take guns out  of the hands of the mentally ill and domestic abusers; not make it  easier for them to acquire such weapons as my friends across the aisle  have done on so many occasions.   If we truly wanted to protect our officers and first responders, we  would work diligently to provide them with the best mental health and  wellness programs money can buy rather than leaving them to mend unseen  wounds on their own.   If my friends across the aisle truly wanted to help this country's  law enforcement officers, they would champion funding for community  policing initiatives because I think we all know that a community that  trusts its police officers, and police officers who trust their  community, will live a far safer and richer life.   I might add, my colleague Debbie Wasserman Schultz and I, along with  law enforcement officials in south Florida, have been about the  business of trying to make that a reality, and funding for those  programs is particularly important to all of our communities.   Mr. Speaker, we all applaud and thank our law enforcement officers  and first responders for the brave and invaluable work that they do,  day in and day out, in our communities.   But we cannot bury our heads in the sand any longer and believe that,  by simply passing messaging bills, we are actually making our  communities safer for our officers or the citizens for whom they swear  an oath to protect.   We have heard outstanding comments from our friends and our  colleagues who came to speak today. All of them spoke of heartfelt  circumstances regarding fallen officers.  [[Page H4242]]  And toward that end, there is absolutely nothing that I disagree with  that has been said.   I just simply ask that we take into consideration how we can best  help and keep safe law enforcement officers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of the adoption of the resolution.
