 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the weekend, our friend the  distinguished Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, announced that he  wouldn't seek reelection. It is no secret that Senator Enzi and I  approach legislation from two very different standpoints, but I have  always found him to be thoughtful and decent--qualities that have made  him a good Senator and a respected voice for the people of Wyoming.   When Senator Enzi was elected, he was this Chamber's only accountant  by trade. Perhaps it is destiny, then, that he will end his tenure at  the top of the Budget Committee. Despite his prominent perch and  decades in Washington's corridors of power, Senator Enzi still retains  the accountant's distaste for the flashy. He eschewed the limelight and  the television cameras--something the two of us have in common. If  Senator Enzi will forgive me that joke, I would like to wish him and  his family the best in all his future endeavors--that is, of course,  after he concludes his final year and a half in Washington as one of  Wyoming's longest serving Senators.
