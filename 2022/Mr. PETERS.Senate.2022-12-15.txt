 Madam President, I rise today to honor a public servant  who has made a significant impact protecting the health of Michiganders  and people across the country from environmental hazards and related  health concerns. Dr. Patrick Breysse will be retiring from the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention--CDC--and the Agency for Toxic  Substances and Disease Registry--ATSDR--after serving 36 years both in  government and as a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of  Public Health. Dr. Breysse's expertise in environmental exposure  assessment and epidemiology has resulted in preventing disease, saving  lives, and improving the health of communities.   Dr. Breysse joined CDC in December 2014 to lead the Agency's efforts  to investigate the relationship between environmental factors and  health. Under Dr. Breysse, CDC and ATSDR took significant steps to  address lead exposure, improve safe drinking water, reduce exposure to  hazardous substances, and play a critical role in CDC's emergency  preparedness and response to natural disasters. His recent priorities  include addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances--PFAS-- contamination in drinking water and the health effects of poor air  quality, extreme heat, flooding, and other weather-related hazards. He  also led the public health response to the Flint water crisis in my  home State of Michigan and remains focused on preventing lead exposures  from public drinking water and working to make our environments lead- free. Dr. Breysse has worked closely with State, local, Territorial,  and Tribal partners and been a true advocate for the health of our  communities.   Dr. Breysse has also been a leader in bringing attention to the  health concerns related to PFAS chemicals, testifying before Congress,  briefing staff and Members, and initiating a ground-breaking health  study at ATSDR to fill research gaps and examine the relationship  between these chemicals and human health. He led the charge to better  understand the contamination of PFAS in our water supply and the  numerous potentially associated health effects. His vision and  foresight helped lead to changes in standards, improvements in guidance  for health professionals, and attention to this issue across the  Nation.   Dr. Breysse is leaving behind a rich legacy of improving the quality  of science and practice related to environmental health within CDC and  ATSDR. I am thankful for Dr. Pat Breysse and his commitment to the  health of our communities and for the countless public servants like  him who dedicate their lives to protecting others.                            ____________________
