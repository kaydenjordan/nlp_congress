 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the en bloc amendment  that includes my amendment to reestablish the Commission on Wartime  Contracting.   As the chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security, I can say  with great confidence that the Commission on Wartime Contracting has  been a solid and a reliable partner in congressional oversight of  military spending.   From 2008 to 2011, the Commission on Wartime Contracting held 25  hearings and issued 8 reports on critical oversight on issues including  contingency contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan and embassy security in  those countries.   The bottom line is that the Commission on Wartime Contracting found  tens of billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse, and recommended  ways to improve our overseas contingency contracting process.   Despite the Commission's mandate having ended in 2011, today we  continue to expend billions of reconstruction dollars overseas with  little assurance that taxpayers or our sons and daughters in uniform  are getting the full benefit of those expenditures. In fact, in many  cases, we know that they are not. As the Special Inspector General for  Afghanistan Reconstruction recently noted, many of our projects there  are of questionable value or are at serious risk of failure and require  continued, sustained oversight.   Reauthorization of the Commission on Wartime Contracting will provide  additional oversight to help us avoid the wasteful mistakes of the  past.   In closing, I thank Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Thornberry, and  the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn) for supporting my  amendment.                                time  1945
