 Madam Speaker, federal employees should not be harmed by  Congress's inability to do its work and fund  [[Page H502]]  the government. And while I supported S. 24 for this reason, I have  serious concerns about the legislation's funding structure.   Though federal employees are generally paid through discretionary  accounts, as written and passed, the Government Employee Fair Treatment  Act of 2019 does not require salaries for furloughed and excepted staff  to be funded with annual appropriations during a shutdown. This opens  the door for the creation of new entitlement spending. I do not believe  this was the legislation's intent, and in the future, I will work with  my colleagues to provide for these salaries through their appropriate  discretionary accounts.   I have consistently expressed concerns about the growth of autopilot  mandatory spending and its impact on our nation's debts and deficits.  Rather than perpetuating this problem, we should resolve ourselves to  fixing the budget and appropriations process to ensure that Congress  fulfills its duty and government shutdowns and pay for federal  employees are taken off the table.
