 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green) for  their dedication to the Tice family.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to an issue of critical  importance for our country. Our fellow American, Austin Tice, is in his  eighth year of captivity in Syria, where we believe he was unjustly  detained and is reported to be held by the Syrian Government or its  affiliates.   Austin was risking his health and safety as a freelance reporter,  endeavoring to shed light on the suffering of the Syrian people for the  world to see. His reporting has appeared in The Washington Post,  McClatchy, and other news outlets.   As a fellow graduate of Georgetown's School of Foreign Service,  Austin was also a former Marine Corps captain who served tours in Iraq  and Afghanistan. Austin was no stranger to risk.   Regardless, he knew the importance of the work he was undertaking.  His dedication to service represents the very best our country has to  offer.   There is every reason for us to believe that Austin is still alive,  and I have joined with my colleagues to call on our administration to  use the full resources of the United States Government to bring Austin  home.   I had the privilege of meeting Austin's parents, Marc and Debra, a  couple of months ago. I am awestruck by their hope, their perseverance,  and their commitment to seeing their son returned home once and for  all.   I am comforted that there is strong bipartisan support behind this  effort. I know we can get this done if we work together.   I again thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia. I  appreciate so much her organizing this Special Order and a coalition of  bipartisan legislators to keep focus on this very important issue. We  won't stop until we bring Austin Tice home.
