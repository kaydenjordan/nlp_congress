 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would require that Ex-Im  provide an annual report to the United States Congress on the agency's  activity in economically disadvantaged areas and efforts that they are  taking to support those areas.   Government must be about people first, so when we talk about economic  opportunity, Mr. Chair, we must ensure that we are using every tool  possible to uplift communities that are struggling like my district.                                time  1615    After the Great Recession of 2008, the country experienced an  economic recovery from 2011 to 2015, but already vulnerable communities  missed out on most of that growth and opportunity. There is no question  that some communities suffer more and take longer to recover, and  sometimes it takes decades longer, but it shouldn't be this way.   There is evidence that adequate reporting and proper investment may  be able to speed that pace of recovery for these kinds of communities.   According to the Economic Innovation Group, 52.3 million people, or  17 percent of the American population, experienced an average 6 percent  drop in the number of adults working and a 6.3 percent average drop in  the number of business establishments.   Specifically, Mr. Chair, workers and their families living in  especially hard-hit communities face challenges such as unemployment  that often arises from mass layoffs associated with declines in  specific industries and businesses.   For communities like mine, 13 districts strong, the impact on  employment and income can be extremely persistent.   Currently, Detroit is one of the five cities with the greatest number  of people in distressed ZIP codes and it ranks number ten as the most  distressed city in the United States of the country's 100 largest  cities. Wayne County, Michigan, which I represent, ranks second in the  Nation for inequality with job creation.   Addressing the economic and social costs associated with persistent  localized economic distresses requires adequate reporting, as it is  essential to addressing the causes and the costs of long-term economic  distress for workers, their families, and the communities.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to help  ensure that we have the tools to uplift every community across the  country like mine.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think it is really important, and I am glad  the ranking member did mention the opportunity zones. One of the key  controversies around opportunity zones right now is that out of the  hundreds of opportunity zone census tracks that were chosen, five did  not qualify under the poverty guidelines requirements for opportunity  zones.   Reporting like this creates transparency and accountability, Mr.  Chair, and that is why it is critically important that we don't make  the mistake again to support these kinds of tax breaks and loans and  opportunities through the Federal Government without any accountability  and follow-through with the United States Congress annually. That is  why it is critically important.   We are talking about five communities that should not have gotten the  opportunity zone designation, including two in the city of Detroit that  were promoted by billionaire Dan Gilbert. It should never have been  designated. They didn't qualify, Mr. Chair.   That is why it is important that we have these kinds of amendments  and requirements that the United States Congress can then proceed to  create transparency.   I fully support, obviously, opportunities for development in  communities that deserve it, especially representing the third poorest  congressional district in the country. However, we cannot allow those  political donors, like the billionaire Dan Gilbert, to pick and choose  where those opportunity zones are designated.   However, we are talking about Ex-Im today, and let's do this right by  supporting this kind of annual reporting to make sure that we are  helping economically disadvantaged communities like ours to be able to,  again, have accountability for the American people.   Again, I rise in support, as I hope my colleagues support me in  rising in support of this amendment, again, to make sure that we do our  due diligence as Members of Congress in making sure there are no other  kind of scandalous controversies that we see now with the opportunity  zones in our country.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, I completely agree that that is the  process. However, it is our responsibility, since we are the ones who  created the bipartisan support of opportunity zones. However, it  doesn't make it exempt from corruption, Mr. Chair, and that is exactly  what is happening.   So then-Governor Snyder may have given his friend an advantage by not  complying with the opportunity zone requirement that it be a poverty- stricken census track, that it is within those guidelines. That did not  happen.   So it is our due diligence, because we allowed the pathway for  opportunity zones, to have accountability. And this amendment basically  allows us to check in, Mr. Chair, and make sure that they are following  those guidelines, and that is exactly what didn't happen with the  opportunity zones. Just because they were bipartisan does not mean they  were exempt from corruption, it is exempt from accountability.   Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will  join me in having transparency and accountability. It is our  responsibility. They are our tax dollars. They are our programs that we  have to, again, hold accountable for those that take advantage by using  the system and tainting the process.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
