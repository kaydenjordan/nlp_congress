 Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the President put the  ``hel'' and the ``sink'' back in ``Helsinki'' because our Republic is  sinking under the weight of his radical actions in capitulating to  Vladimir Putin in the eyes of the world.   Now, some of my colleagues have called this appeasement. I want to  correct that. Appeasement is a misguided policy where you give  concessions in order to try to make peace and stability with a  dangerous, aggressive foreign power.   This was not appeasement. This was simple surrender. The President  wasn't trying to make peace with a hostile power. He was trying to  capitulate and have us go over to the other side of the hostile power.   The President has sided with authoritarianism, with every kleptocrat,  dictator, despot, and tyrant on the planet Earth today.   We the people of the United States and we in Congress have a  responsibility now to defend American constitutional democracy. We must  invest in our elections and fortify our elections so we can begin to  restore the principles we have lost under the terrible leadership of  Donald Trump.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to make in order the  Quigley amendment to restore funds indispensable to prevent Russian  interference in American elections in 2018.    Mr. Speaker, I want to ask Mr. McGovern a question so we  can get some clarity on where we are right now.   As I understand it, one position is that the State election systems  are fine, they don't need any infusion of Federal help. And then there  is another position, which you are advancing, which is that we need to  put in hundreds of millions of dollars in order to secure the elections  to prevent a repeat of the cyber sabotage and the cyber invasion that  we experienced in 2016. And yet we are not getting a chance to vote on  that. Is that right?    I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.    Well, why can we not vote on that? The American people  are demanding that we defend our elections against foreign attack. Why  can we not even vote on that in the House of Representatives?    I just saw dozens of our colleagues ask unanimous consent  that they reconsider that position so the American people can have a  hearing on whether or not we are going to have real elections in 2018.  Have you been able to discuss it with the other side about whether they  would be willing to entertain another unanimous consent motion so we  can actually have a debate on this?    I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this, but  this is a point of national emergency right now. This is our democracy,  this is our Constitution that is at stake. And as I understand it,  every State of the Union wants election infusion funding coming from  the Federal Government and needs it in order to fortify against cyber  attack.   In my State, in Maryland, we just were able to determine that a  private vendor that is one of the lead contractors in our election  system has Russian ties and is being controlled by someone very close  to Vladimir Putin. So we need an infusion of Federal help to fortify  our election.   So please continue and do whatever you can with the Republicans just  to allow us a vote on the floor.
