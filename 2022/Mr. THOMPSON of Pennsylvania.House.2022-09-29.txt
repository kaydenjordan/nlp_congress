 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Straub Brewery in St. Marys, Pennsylvania. Straub Brewery is  celebrating 150 years of homemade brews.   Founded in 1872 by Peter Straub, a German immigrant, they have been  brewing beverages independently for more than five generations. This  achievement represents the passion and dedication of a single family  who successfully managed, expanded, and often protected a way of life  that the brewery represented.   Their history is an extensive one, spanning generations, starting  from immigrant roots, surviving Prohibition, and now Straub is a staple  in the community and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   For generations, Straub Brewery has continued to preserve and  safeguard those qualities that make the brewery unique. Straub's  longevity can be attributed to the craft, skills, and professionalism  of the men and women who keep the brewery running.   To celebrate 150 years, Straub is hosting various Oktoberfest events,  and they have brewed a special 150th anniversary pilsner.   Mr. Speaker, if you ever find yourself in St. Marys, Pennsylvania, I  encourage you to check out Straub Brewery and enjoy a cold one from  their eternal tap, which has been flowing since 1872.   Cheers to Straub Brewery, William Brock, and the entire Straub family  on this monumental anniversary.                            ____________________
