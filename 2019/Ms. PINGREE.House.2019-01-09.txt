 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 8, the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, a commonsense bill to mandate  background checks before the sale of a firearm.   During my first term in Congress, I served with my friend and former  Congresswoman Gabby Giffords on the Armed Services Committee. Mr.  Speaker, 8 years ago this week, during a public meeting with her  constituents, a gunman shot her and 18 others, tragically killing 6.   Since that dark day in 2011, mass shootings have become commonplace,  occurring in our schools, houses of worship, movie theaters,  nightclubs, grocery stores, a newsroom, a concert, nearly every place  imaginable that should be safe.   Although 97 percent of Americans support background checks, many  Members of Congress simply pass along thoughts and prayers in the face  of these tragedies instead of taking action.   Enough. The Nation's gun violence epidemic must be addressed by the  116th Congress.   I am in awe of Gabby's resilience and advocacy for overdue gun safety  reforms like H.R. 8, which will ensure  [[Page H300]]  that firearms do not end up in the hands of those who cannot pass a  simple background check.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.                            ____________________
