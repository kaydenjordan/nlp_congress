 Madam Speaker, there is a humanitarian crisis at the  southern border that should shock the conscience of every single  American.   These are migrant children being subjected to cruel and unusual  punishment by our government. This is not Iran. This is not North  Korea. This is not Venezuela. This is the United States of America.   Shame on us.   There are children who are without food. They are without medicine.  They are without water. They are without soap. They are without  diapers. They are without toothpaste.   Shame on us.   These are not alien children. They are God's children. This  administration should stop using them as political pawns for some sick,  xenophobic game.   Madam Speaker, vote ``yes,'' and let's begin the process of ending  this humanitarian crisis now.
