 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Dana Strickland on 25 years with the University of Georgia, College of  Pharmacy, and to congratulate him for retiring on March 29.   The College's executive director of external affairs, Mr. Strickland,  has been critical to the school's success--which is also my own alma  mater--over the past two decades.   Increasing the endowment by a considerable amount, the College was  able to build new buildings, support research by the faculty, and  provide the best possible education to its students under Mr.  Strickland's leadership.   The importance of these improvements cannot be overstated with the  changing nature of pharmacists today who are on the front lines of the  opioid epidemic and the rising cost of prescription drugs.   Thank you for your dedication to the University of Georgia, the  pharmaceutical profession, and congratulations on your well-deserved  retirement.   Mr. Strickland truly embodies what it means to be a PharmDawg.  Although he will be difficult to replace, I have the utmost confidence  in Dr. Michael Bartlett, who will be filling the role in the meantime.               Remembering the Life of William ``Ryan'' Sailors     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of William ``Ryan'' Sailors, who passed away March 30 at the age of 22.   Throughout his life, Mr. Sailors had a special gift to brighten the  days of everyone around him.   When he was younger, doctors thought that his life expectancy would  only be to adolescence. Mr. Sailors not only surpassed that milestone,  but also made the most of every single day he was on this Earth.   He refused to let his special needs get in his way, being  infectiously positive and becoming famous for his trademark ``thumbs  up'' to anyone passing by.   Some of Mr. Sailors' favorite activities included attending church  each week at Wesley Monumental, eating snacks on the beach, and  supervising vacuuming and cleaning around the house.   His life should be a reminder to all of us that we should try to make  this world a happier place each and every day.   Mr. Sailors' family will be in my thoughts and prayers during this  difficult time.                       Happy Birthday, Charlie Waldrop     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Charlie Waldrop on his 100th birthday, April 27, 2019. Throughout his  life, Mr. Waldrop has loved to serve others.   Serving our country during World War II, he fought in both France and  Germany, and was discharged on his wife's birthday in 1946.   He served patients in Coastal Georgia for over 40 years, working as a  pharmacist, and eventually opening his own pharmacy.   His notoriety and success in the profession enabled him to become the  First District President of the Georgia Pharmaceutical Association, but  his service doesn't stop there. He also worked as a deacon in his  church and leads a Boy Scout troop.   I am proud to call Mr. Waldrop a Savannahian as he has become an icon  in our town since he first moved there in 1927.   Mr. Waldrop, happy birthday, and thank you for everything you did to  influence my career.   Thank you for your service to our Nation, to our community, and our  profession.                 Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield Wins Gold     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield community for being named the 2019  Army Community of Excellence gold winner this past March.   This year is a record seventh time that these communities in the  First Congressional District of Georgia have won the gold award, and  last year, they won the bronze.   I want to thank everyone at Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield for  their commitment to the readiness of the soldiers, their constant  efforts to make  [[Page H3134]]  improvements, exceptional teamwork, and their partnership with the  surrounding civilian community.   I am proud to have these installations in Georgia, and in turn, these  installations make me even more proud of our military in the United  States.   Thank you for your service. Congratulations on your award.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Dunn for the work that he has done, as  well as my other colleagues, Representative Austin Scott,  Representative Sanford Bishop, and Representative Martha Roby. All of  these fine legislators have worked diligently on this, and I thank them  for their efforts, as well as others.   Madam Speaker, I have the honor and the privilege of representing the  First Congressional District of Georgia. The First Congressional  District of Georgia includes the entire coast of Georgia, over 100  miles of coastline. We have a lot to be thankful for, a lot to be proud  of. We have two major seaports and four military installations, Moody  Air Force Base, Kings Bay Naval Base, Fort Stewart, and Hunter Army  Airfield. We have the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. We have  two Coast Guard stations, one in Savannah and one in Brunswick.   We have so much to be thankful for, but we also have a very strong  agriculture community, particularly in the western portion of our  district. It is very, very important.   Madam Speaker, much of the State of Georgia is in need right now, and  they can't wait any longer.   In the First Congressional District of Georgia over the past few  years, we have had hurricanes. We had Hurricane Matthew, Hurricane  Irma, and Hurricane Michael. We have had fires. We had the West Mims  Fire. We have had freezes and harsh freezing conditions that impacted  our agriculture community.   These disasters have been detrimental to agriculture in Georgia. By  the way, agriculture in Georgia is our largest industry. That is very  important and very important for the First District.   In fact, just to be specific, blueberries, which are the leading  fruit now in the State of Georgia, blueberries alone make up a $1  billion industry. That is ``billion'' with a B, a $1 billion industry.  Those farmers are the backbones of their communities.   Blueberry farmers, in some areas, their crops make up 30 percent of  the portfolios of banks. That is significant to these communities, and  we simply cannot allow these farmers to continue going without this  assistance.   The banks are waiting for many of these farmers to repay their loans.  It is putting them in jeopardy of not being able to farm next year and  putting entire rural economies at risk. When you put 30 percent of your  portfolio at risk, you are putting your community at risk.   Congressional inaction on this is absolutely unacceptable.   The Senate's failure to pass disaster aid last week was one of the  worst moments that I have experienced in Washington since I have come  to Congress.   These people need assistance, Madam Speaker. They need assistance. We  need to help them. The American farmer feeds the world. Georgia farmers  are an integral part of this. Blueberries are an important crop in our  district. Agriculture is the number one industry in Georgia.   It is time for us to respond to this. This is what we are to do as  Members of Congress. We cannot simply ignore this. It will not go away.   We need these farmers. They need our help, and we need to respond.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support disaster aid.
