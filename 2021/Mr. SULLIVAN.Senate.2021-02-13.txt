 Mr. President.   The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. Mr. Sullivan.    Just a point of inquiry. There is a little confusion  here. Was that a vote on one witness or many witnesses?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Debate is not allowed during the vote. I  advise the Senator from Alaska--    It is not debate. It is a point of inquiry on what we  just voted on.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is not--I am advised that is not  allowed during the vote.
