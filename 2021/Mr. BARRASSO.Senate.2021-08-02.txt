 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to address  the amendment on which we will be voting in the next 15 or 20 minutes.  It is the Barrasso amendment to No. 2137. It has to do with building  codes in the bill that is on the floor tonight for our discussion and  debate, the bipartisan infrastructure bill.   There is money in this bill that is being debated today for building  codes, and this amendment is quite simple. It is a consumer protection  amendment, and it just says no money--no money in this bill--can be  used to bar natural gas hookups to your home. You can't block  commercial use, residential use, and new constructions. So no money in  the bill can be used to restrict or prohibit the direct use of natural  gas in residential and commercial buildings in support of it--space  heating, water heating or cooking, and for other purposes. And you  can't also use money to compel the adoption of modern building energy  codes. Those are local decisions that are made.   Why I come to the floor to speak specifically about that is that  people all around the country are very concerned about what is in this  bill and how it is going to affect them at home and how they live and  their pocketbooks. No matter where you are from, people are saying: How  is this going to impact me?   People who are living under the times of this massive inflation that  they are hitting--they are paying more for groceries, they are paying  more for gasoline, and now they are looking at, if they come out with  building codes that block natural gas hookups, what is that going to do  to the cost of energy to heat their home, to cook, and all of those  sorts of things?   And for people who are not necessarily tuned into this who may be  Members of this body but who don't think about how so many of the  decisions here impact hard-working American families, I come to a story  that was in this morning's Wall Street Journal. The headline is  ``Natural-Gas Phaseouts Are Facing Resistance.'' And there is a reason  they are facing resistance. They are facing resistance because people  do not want to have to pay more money for energy to heat their homes,  to cook, and all of those things.   And the article points out that Massachusetts is emerging as a key  battleground in this U.S. fight over whether to phase out natural gas  for home cooking and heating, with fears of unknown costs. That is what  people are concerned about--unknown costs and unfamiliar technologies  fueling much of the opposition as the country is being encouraged to go  all electric.   So what we are seeing is that more towns around Boston are debating  measures to block or limit the use of gas in new construction, and they  talk about climate change as a reason for that. Well, builders and  realtors will tell you that construction costs go up and the cost of  heating and cooking go up if you are not allowed to use natural gas in  the construction. As a matter of fact, a study by a subsidiary of the  National Association of Home Builders, published this year, estimated  that building all-electric homes in the colder climates of Denver, CO,  the Rocky Mountain West, and Minneapolis--as part of their study, they  say it may cost at least $11,000 more to build those than it would if  you could allow them to be built for the use of gas.   So they are saying: Wait a second. Before you drive up the cost of  buying a new home, before you drive up the cost of cooking and heating  your home, let's let people make some decisions for themselves. They  don't need Washington telling us what we need to do and what we can do.   Major cities right now, including San Francisco, Seattle, Denver, and  New York, have enacted or proposed measures to ban or discourage the  use of natural gas in new homes and in buildings. This is 2 years after  Berkeley, one of the most liberal bastions of the country, passed the  first such prohibition in the United States.   And, as you can imagine, when these things are coming out of  California, a State with the highest electricity costs in the country,  a State with ongoing blackouts because of their lack of energy  effectiveness and efficiency and all of the mandates related to energy  and sky-high prices, the efforts have sparked a backlash--no surprise-- prompting some States to make gas bans illegal.   So I am coming to the floor with this amendment to point out that, as  we are working on bipartisan legislation and there is money in the bill  for building codes, no money can be used to prohibit natural gas  hookups to homes, commercial construction, residential, and new  construction, because consumers have to have a say in this.   It shouldn't be government saying: We know better than you do. We  will spend your money. We will make decisions about how you get to  spend your hard-earned money.   And it is coming from the State of Wyoming where a significant  production of natural gas is affordable, reliable, available, and  people want to use it. They want to use it because they know the value  to them and their families and their way of life. They don't want  Washington coming in and saying: No, you can't do it because we know  better than you do.   And I hear a lot about that at home in Wyoming--people saying to  Washington: You don't know better than we do. We don't need you telling  us.   The bill doesn't say that it is going to tell them. We just want to  make sure that by adopting this amendment, the building codes do not  bar the use of natural gas hookups to your home.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I yield back all time.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2180     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, at the 109th Wyoming State Fair, Senator  Lummis and I will have the pleasure of introducing Keith and Linda  Hamilton as 2021 inductees to the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame.   Growing up as the fourth generation on the Hamilton Ranch, Keith's  agricultural involvement holds deep roots in working to advance  agricultural leadership and conserve natural resources important to the  western lifestyle. In 1975, Keith joined the Wyoming Farm Bureau and  began taking on leadership positions in 1981 as the Big Horn County  Farm Bureau vice president. In 1988, Keith joined the Wyoming Farm  Bureau Federation board of directors and represented Big Horn, Fremont,  Hot Springs, Park, and Washakie Counties as the northwest district  director until 2010.   In addition to serving the agricultural community through the Wyoming  Farm Bureau, Keith has been very active in serving on public lands  boards, wildlife working groups, and livestock organizations. Keith has  given his time to the Big Horn Basin Sage Grouse Working Group, the Big  Horn County Predator Management Board, and is the past chairman of the  Wyoming State Grazing Board. Through his work, the wildlife of Wyoming  is left more abundant for future generations.   As Mark Anderson, current chairman of the Wyoming State Grazing Board  observed, ``Keith is currently our valued representative on the Wyoming  Board of Directors to the National Public Lands Council and he is the  type of person I would like to have as a neighbor.''   The Hamilton Ranch and Keith would not be as successful as it is  today were it not for his wife, Linda. Linda has a servant's heart and  has dedicated her time and efforts to many events and organizations  within the Hyattville community. She served as a founding member of  Wyoming Agriculture in the Classroom as well as on their board of  directors. She has also served on the board of directors for Northwest  College alumni, the Hyattville Methodist Church, and the Wyoming  Association of Conservation District. Linda held the important role as  a spokesperson for conservation districts in both State government and  the legislature. Linda leads with a selfless volunteerism, a community- based spirit, and an outstanding work ethic.   In addition to their involvement in civic activities, Keith and Linda  Hamilton's love and dedication for agriculture show both in their  dedication to organizations, as well as in the improvement of  operations on their ranch. The Hamilton Ranch was recognized as the  1998 Environmental Stewardship Award winner, as well as a Wyoming  Centennial Ranch in 2015. Both of these reflect the nature of Keith and  Linda as leaders in agriculture.   The Hamiltons were one of four operations to initially enroll in the  Wyoming Stewardship Program in 1982. This program opened the door for  the Hamiltons to work closely with agencies such as Wyoming Game and  Fish Department, Wyoming Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Land  Management, U.S. Forest Service, and Natural Resources Conservation  Service on improving ranch operations. The Hamilton Ranch continues  their involvement with these agencies today, leading the way for  agricultural innovation and collaboration in Wyoming.   Keith and Linda are longtime members of the Wyoming Wool Growers  Association, Wyoming Stock Growers Association, and past members of the  Mountain States Lamb Co-op.   With the Hamilton family's unwavering commitment to our State, it is  with great honor to induct them into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of  Fame. Keith and Linda Hamilton represent the best of Wyoming courage,  optimism, and the Western Code. They have represented Wyoming's  interests with dedication and distinction for many years. My wife,  Bobbi, joins me in congratulating Keith and Linda Hamilton as 2021  inductees into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame.                            ____________________
