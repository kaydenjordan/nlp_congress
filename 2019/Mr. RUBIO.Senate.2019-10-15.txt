 Madam President, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my privilege to  recognize a unique Florida small business for its valuable  contributions to the local economy and its dedicated efforts towards  sustainability and dignified work. Today, it is my distinct pleasure to  name Mother Kombucha of St. Petersburg, FL as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   In 2014, Tonya Donati, a former occupational therapist, became  Florida's first licensed kombucha brewer after noticing there were not  many locally sourced options. Tonya and her business partner, Joshua  Rumschlag, began brewing kombucha, a beverage of fermented, sweetened  tea, in Tonya's small test kitchen to sell at local farmers markets.  Eventually, Tonya and her husband, Victor Donati, secured a Small  Business Administration 7(a) loan to move into a larger space, which  enabled them to manufacture kombucha full time. Through hard work and a  strategic vision, Mother Kombucha has grown from a 2-person operation  into a full-scale business that now employs nearly 20 people and  packages around 7,500 bottles a day. Over the last 5 years, Mother  Kombucha has opened more than 600 accounts across Florida, and their  products can be found in Publix, Whole Foods, and Winn-Dixie. Though  the kombucha industry has expanded in recent years, Mother Kombucha's  niche position provides a competitive edge in the expanding market.   Mother Kombucha sets itself apart in this industry as a brand  committed to making a positive social and environmental impact. As a  woman-owned and operated company, Tonya's business is an inspiration  for other women entrepreneurs. It has been certified by the Women's  Business Enterprise National Council, one of the leading advocates for  women business owners in the United States. Several of Mother  Kombucha's flavors are based on a single-source green tea from a  company that helps to raise women out of poverty in Bangladesh. Mother  Kombucha makes community involvement a priority. In addition to  providing competitive salaries to its employees, the company hosts an  annual Mother's Day fundraiser to benefit women and children affected  by domestic violence. Mother Kombucha has incorporated solar panels  into each of their facilities, operates a robust recycling program, and  is working to achieve B-Corp status. This certification is awarded to  companies who uphold the highest environmental and labor standards,  while also giving back to their respective communities.   Tonya has worked hard to expand her business throughout Florida, and  her efforts have not gone unnoticed. Notably, Mother Kombucha was  honored by GrowFlorida as one of Florida's 50 Companies to Watch in  2019. Tonya's love of kombucha, her hard work, and commitment to her  community make this business an integral part of Florida's economic  framework. This National Women's Small Business Month, it is my honor  to congratulate the entire Mother Kombucha team for being named Senate  Small Business of the Week. I look forward to watching their continued  growth and success.                            ____________________
