 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the WRDA bill is an important bipartisan  piece of legislation that provides for improvements to our Nation's  water resources infrastructure, including ports and inland waterways,  locks, dams, flood protection, and ecosystem restoration.   Mr. Chairman, I want to applaud my good friend, Chairman Shuster, for  his leadership on moving forward with yet another WRDA bill through the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee; and I am so proud to serve  on that committee under his leadership.   But seldom in Congress do things actually end up being like they were  promised; and I can tell you, under the leadership of this chairman,  not only are we voting on yet another WRDA bill, but we are doing it in  a transparent, policy-focused manner. And it is this return to regular  order that the chairman has truly encouraged so many of his members,  not only on the committee, but off the committee.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment adds one provision to this important bill:  It directs the Secretary of the Army to prioritize the operation and  maintenance of existing infrastructure and improve their reliability.  The last thing the taxpayers want to do is spend needlessly money on  expensive new infrastructure if the existing roadways, highways,  bridges, ports, airports, water and sewer systems are aging and in  disrepair.   We have heard all of this before from a number of our stakeholders  and, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, if America  fails to invest in its existing ailing infrastructure by 2025, the U.S.  economy can be  [[Page H4822]]  expected to lose almost $4 trillion in Gross Domestic Product,  resulting in a loss of some 2.5 million jobs.   Therefore, as we look at this legislation, it is critically important  that we repair, rebuild, and modernize the infrastructure we have.   I urge support of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
