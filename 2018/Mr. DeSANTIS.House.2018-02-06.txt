 Mr. Speaker, when news broke that there had been a  series of secret sexual harassment payments paid for on behalf of  Members of Congress by tax dollars, I think a lot of Americans, even by  the low standards that they have for this body, were shocked to hear  that. And it was almost as if the rules were set up to incentivize bad  behavior by a Member because Members could harass people and they  wouldn't be personally liable for it, and they could keep it all  secret.   This had to change, and I applaud Chairman Harper for leading on this  bill. And I am happy that the provisions of my bill have been adopted  in this because I think it is important. Taxpayers should not bail  Members of Congress out for misconduct, and this bill fixes that and  makes them personally liable.   We also need a full accounting of any payments that are being made  with tax dollars. This bill does that. We have to protect identities of  victims.   I think we are making a step in the right direction. I think this  starts to foster a culture of respect on Capitol Hill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I thank  Chairman Harper for his efforts.
