 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate will soon be taking up my  resolution recognizing this month of May as National Foster Care Month.   For over 20 years, National Foster Care Month has been recognized as  a time to raise awareness about the challenges that young people in  foster care experience and to celebrate their resilience in the face of  these obstacles.   There are over 438,000 children in foster care nationwide. In Iowa  alone, over 4,000 kids entered foster care in 2016. Due to the opioid  crisis, there are more children entering foster care than many child  welfare agencies are equipped to handle. In 2016, over 92,000 kids  entered foster care due to parental drug abuse.   I salute all of those who dedicate their time and their resources to  helping these young people. This induces social workers, advocates, and  alumni of the foster care system, who inform lawmakers and the public  and, more importantly, who fight to secure better outcomes for these  young people in care. Of course, this also includes foster parents, who  open their homes and their hearts to children in need.   Without foster parents, children unable to remain with their  biological parents would have nowhere to go. Unfortunately, this is  becoming a reality for children across the country, as many States are  experiencing a critical shortage of foster parents. In my home State of  Iowa, many counties are facing a shortage of foster care homes, causing  young people to be housed in shelters instead of with families.   The solution is not simply recruiting more people to serve as foster  parents. Between 30 and 50 percent of licensed foster parents choose to  stop being foster parents after only 1 year of doing that. That is why  this year our resolution also designates the single day of May 31 as  ``Foster Parent Appreciation Day.'' It is my hope that communities,  child welfare agencies, and other organizations will use this day to  recognize the sacrifices foster parents make. Those who do not choose  to continue being foster parents often report that their reason is a  lack of support and training. At a time when foster parents are needed  more than ever, it is important for communities and child welfare  agencies to support foster parents and ensure that they are trained to  help the kids entrusted to them.   Through my work on the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, I have had the  opportunity to hear firsthand what children in foster care need. I  would advise Senators to take advantage of listening to that group of  people we call foster youth. They need love, they need permanency, and  they need stability and support.   In short, all they need is a family. They often express to me: ``I  would like to have a mom and a dad.'' That is why I am pleased that  Congress recently passed the Family First Prevention Services Act. This  legislation works to keep more families together by allowing Federal  reimbursement for services to families before children are put in  foster care, not afterward. These services include substance abuse  treatment and in-home parenting skill programs. When it is truly in a  child's best interest to be removed from their parents, this bill  ensures that more kids will be placed with supportive families instead  of in group homes.   Of course, there is still work to be done. Far too many children  still experience the trauma of neglect and abuse, and far too many  youth in foster care age out without meaningful connection to a caring  adult.   Moving forward, Congress must continue to listen to the voices of  foster youth, foster parents, and other advocates by working to find  better solutions and secure better outcomes for youth in foster care.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to address an issue that was  brought up by the minority leader on the floor this morning. I want to  respond to the false statements made by the very misinformed minority  leader this morning--and I mean really misinformed.   He criticized the Judiciary Committee's release this morning of about  2,500 pages of information about the infamous Trump Tower meeting with  a Russian lawyer and Donald Trump, Jr.   First, he mischaracterized the release as solely a Republican move.  That is false. In fact, that is absolutely false. This release was done  with the support of the ranking minority member. On January 25 of this  year, at the committee meeting where I announced my desire to release  the transcripts, the ranking member publicly supported the decision. I  have three quotes. She said, ``I am delighted.'' She said she had ``no  disagreement.'' She said, ``I am very grateful for your decision to  proceed.''   Second, he accused me of deciding not to interview two participants  in the meeting. That is false. In fact, it is absolutely false. I would  like to have interviewed both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kushner. An  interview of Mr. Manafort was scheduled a day before he was raided.  We--meaning Senator Feinstein and this Senator--had subpoenaed Mr.  Manafort for a committee hearing set for July 26, 2017. Mr. Manafort  instead offered to appear voluntarily for a staff interview the day  before the hearing, and the ranking member asked me to withdraw the  subpoena. Then the FBI raided his home, and Mr. Manafort indicated he  would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights and then consequently declined  to answer the committee's questions. However, we did review the  transcript of his earlier interview with the Intelligence Committee.   The ranking member refused to participate in a voluntary interview  when we had the chance. She said Democrats on the committee objected  that the scope would be focused on the Trump Tower meeting. For all I  know, the minority leader's office objected as well, but political  leadership should not be dictating bipartisan committee oversight.   As for Mr. Kushner, he refused to participate in a voluntary  interview after the ranking member unilaterally and  [[Page S2716]]  prematurely released another witness transcript. There was no  consultation with me at all by the minority on that point. That is the  opposite of how this Senator handled this morning's transcript release.   Mr. Kushner's attorney demanded promises of confidentiality that we  could not provide. Transparency is too important to keep all this  information under wraps. We could keep it all secret for many more  months while we fight over trying to force people to testify against  their will. But we decided to put out the voluntary testimony now for  the sake of transparency, and the ranking member, as I said two or  three times, supported that decision.   Third, the minority leader claimed that the release of this  information was motivated by the Republicans' desire to ``let the  President and his lawyers interfere with the Mueller probe and get a  peek at any potential evidence.'' That is false. In fact, it is  absolutely false.   Again, the Democrats on the committee did not object to the release,  and the ranking member affirmatively supported it. She and her staff  were fully consulted and worked cooperatively with us in preparing the  release. So the claim that there was some secret plan to help one side  or the other in the Mueller probe is absurd. My only motivation was the  same as that of the ranking member--transparency for the American  people on this controversy. Let the people read it for themselves and  draw their own conclusions.   Fourth, the minority leader claimed that ``Republicans are rushing to  declare their investigation complete.'' That is false. In fact, it is  absolutely false. The minority leader should not try to put words in my  mouth. I didn't say that. Anyone who knows me knows that oversight is  never done and should never be done. It is our core constitutional  duty.   Now as to the Trump Tower meeting, Congress has learned as much as we  are likely to learn, unless some new information comes to light. That  might happen. We have to be ready for it if it does. Other committees,  the press, and the special counsel are all over this as well. So there  is no lack of scrutiny. But there is a lack of transparency, and these  2,500 pages or so do more to give the public a picture of what happened  than anyone else has done.   I would just ask my friend the minority leader: What have you done to  answer the questions our constituents may have had about the Trump  Tower meeting? What good-faith efforts have you undertaken to give the  American people transparency about the investigation relating not just  to the Trump Presidency but Presidential contenders in 2016? Have you  done anything to support or assist Republicans in getting to the bottom  of questions that concern them and their constituents back home? The  answer is, nothing. In fact, the answer is, absolutely nothing-- absolutely nothing but speculation and frenzy. It is nothing but pure  political frustration for losing the Presidential election in 2016. It  also fundamentally misunderstands the role of congressional oversight  and congressional investigations. We don't prosecute crimes. We can't  indict suspected criminals. Our job is to act as a check on the  executive branch.   Do you know who has not come to sit for long, transcribed interviews  before the Judiciary Committee staff? Well, the answer to that is  current or former Department of Justice and FBI officials--not a single  one. Our job is to oversee the Justice Department and to oversee the  FBI, but Judiciary Committee Democrats have not been supportive or  interested in questioning those officials.   The minority leader seems to believe that it is our job to waste  taxpayers' dollars retreading the special counsel's investigation or  duplicating the Intelligence Committee's work so he can bludgeon his  political opponents. Well, that is not my job. I am going to focus on  our constitutional duty to act as a check on the executive branch. I am  going to keep digging and keep fighting for answers from the Justice  Department and from the FBI.   We will be having a hearing on the controversies in 2016 that  undermined Americans' faith in the objectivity of these vital  institutions. I have great faith in the inspector general appointed by  President Obama and the nonpartisan office he leads. As soon as the  inspector general's report is out, we will learn a lot more about what  happened before and during the election from an independent and  objective source, and we will follow up.   The minority leader was right about one thing--when he said: ``There  is much left to investigate. Many witnesses still to be heard.'' I  agree. This is not over.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
