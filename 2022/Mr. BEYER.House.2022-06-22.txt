 Mr. Speaker, the pandemic magnified suicide risk, anxiety,  and depression with two out of five adults reporting symptoms of  anxiety and depression. The Kaiser Family Foundation released a report  this morning that found that suicide death rates rose by 12 percent  from 2010 to 2020--with rates rising fastest among people of color,  younger people, and our good citizens in rural areas.   Help can't come fast enough.   I thank the Rules Committee for allowing the Katko-Napolitano-Beyer  amendment to be included in the first en bloc today. This reauthorizes  and ensures sufficient funding and provides oversight of the National  Suicide Prevention Lifeline.   As the House and Senate finalize any mental health package to be  signed into law, I want to flag my bill with Adam Kinzinger--the  Campaign to Prevent Suicide--which was passed by the committee and the  House last year. It would help educate the American public both on the  new 988 suicide lifeline number and also change the culture from one in  crisis and avoidance to one that connects to resources.   SAMHSA has stated that the campaign is crucial to the success of 988.  We can save an untold number of lives. 988 can be among the most  important bipartisan success we have ever had.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Pallone, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and the  committee staff for their commitment to tackling mental health. It is  2022, and we know far, far more than ever before in human history. It  is time to put our healing knowledge to work.
