 Colleagues, today we are about to vote on a resolution  that will correct a long-held injustice--one that has been on the books  for decades; one that has caused significant pain to military spouses  who have given so  [[Page S5693]]  much for our country. It is an elimination of the military widow's tax.  It has been voted on in this body for over 18 years and has never  gotten across the finish line. Now is the time. This is our time to  make sure that we tell our veterans that we are supportive but we show  it with our actions, not just with our words. I urge everyone to please  vote to instruct the conferees to eliminate the military widow's tax.   I yield the floor.
