 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2024  Homeland Security Appropriations bill that will help to secure our  border.   Since President Biden took office, there have been over 6 million  illegal immigrant encounters at our southern border, and because of  President Biden's open-border policies, we have seen countless illegal  immigrants, including known people on the terror watch list, violent  gang members and sex offenders released into the homeland. With this  bill, we are finally doing what President Biden won't. We are securing  our border.   My colleagues and I have been to the border, something the President  hasn't bothered to do. We have spoken with law enforcement on the front  lines. These brave men and women told us directly that this  administration has undercut them at every turn and that they needed  more resources to deter illegal immigration rather than incentivize it.    While their pleas seem to have fallen on deaf ears at the White  House, we here as House Republicans have heard them loud and clear. In  this bill, we deliver for them and for every State that, as a result of  these policies, has become a border State.   We are restoring border security technology funding to its highest  level. We are funding the 22,000 Border Patrol agents that CBP  requested, and we are finally restarting border wall construction  instead of letting those materials that taxpayers paid for rust away on  the side of the road.   We are fully funding ICE detention capacity as a deterrent, and we  are providing funding to deport illegal immigrants. Our southern border  is a lawless free-for-all under the Biden administration, undermining  the safety and security of Iowans and every American.   This bill delivers on our promise to secure the border and keep  America safe, so let's shut down our border, and let's keep our  government open and move this bill forward.
