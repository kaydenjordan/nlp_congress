 Mr. Speaker, the House today will vote on an important  piece of Federal legislation regarding self-driving vehicles that many  on this body on both sides of the aisle have worked on.   This legislation promises to make roads safer by reducing traffic- related fatalities and unlock new economic opportunities and jobs in  the U.S. It is also vital in our efforts to promote innovation.   Industry is driving the development of self-driving vehicles, but in  certain situations, companies building and testing the car of the  future may need some flexibility or certainty.   With this legislation, I hope the research, development, and testing  that is unleashed will stimulate additional knowledge and innovation  for passenger motor safety.   We, as the government, need to make sure that safety is first and  foremost in our consideration. Passing this legislation will help get  lifesaving technology to the public, perhaps preventing deaths in the  not-so-near future.   I strongly support this bipartisan legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
