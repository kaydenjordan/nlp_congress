 Madam Speaker, Canada and Mexico are two of the  Commonwealth's largest trading partners. In 2018 alone, Virginia  exported $4.3 billion worth of goods to our northern and southern  neighbors.   Last month, in Chesterfield County, I sat down with local businesses,  business leaders, and members of the Chamber of Commerce to talk about  how the USMCA could strengthen export opportunities and spur economic  growth for businesses in our area. Cattlemen and dairies, farmers, and  producers across my central Virginia district care deeply about the  certainty and stability afforded by a trade deal. Amid ongoing USMCA  discussions, my constituents want and need the long-term certainty of a  trade deal between our three countries.   I thank the congressional working group for its productive efforts to  arrive at a deal that meets the needs of our farmers, producers, small  businesses, medium-sized businesses, and American workers.   We need House negotiators and the administration to come to a final  agreement. We need to get this done and deliver trade stability for our  constituents back home in my central Virginia district and across the  country.                            ____________________
