 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I guess for the second day in a  row, this House voted for massive tax cuts for people at the very top  and left behind a lot of working Americans. In fact, it gave permanent  tax cuts to corporations and only temporary help for some American  families. They said that the marketplace and corporations needed  certainty. That is why those tax cuts were permanent.   Now, we have a continuing resolution for 28 days of funding after 11  months of not doing anything about it.   What about the certainty for veterans that they are going to get the  healthcare that they deserve?   It is not a priority.   What about the certainty for children who depend on CHIP?   It is not a priority.   What about the certainty for those families who are struggling with a  family member fighting opioid abuse?   All the promises ring hollow because they are not a priority.  Corporations are the top priority. With this tax bill, and now the  continuing resolution, the American people, who struggle every single  day, are just not a priority. After 11 months of complete Republican  control and false promises, American families get left behind again. It  is a shame.  [[Page H10348]]                                ____________________
