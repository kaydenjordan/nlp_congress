 Mr. Speaker, today the House approved H.R. 2440, the Full  Utilization of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Act of 2019. Nearly  every segment of our Nation's infrastructure is in disrepair due to  chronic underfunding, including our Nation's water infrastructure, a  true lifeblood of our economy.   This year, as he did last year, President Trump proposed drastic cuts  to the Army Corps of Engineers' budget. Unbelievable. But our  Appropriations Committee rejected his proposals and those cuts. Today I  stand with my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee to call for greater investment in our water infrastructure.   For our part, the House passed the FY20 Energy and Water  Appropriations bill that included $1.6 billion from the harbor  maintenance trust fund, an increase of $147 million above fiscal year  2019 and $732 million above President Trump's paltry and unrealistic  budget request.   Big, medium, and small ports across our country are efficient  economic engines that anchor jobs and progress. They are hubs of  production for communities everywhere. And, yes, they rely on  leadership from this Congress to fund their maintenance.   I congratulate Representative DeFazio for his hard work in writing  H.R. 2440 and hope we continue the momentum to utilize the Harbor  Maintenance Trust Fund Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Port of  Cleveland.                                              Port of Cleveland,                                                   October 28, 2019.      Hon. Marcy Kaptur,      Congresswoman, 9th District of Ohio,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Kaptur: The Port of Cleveland is pleased       to know that an important bill will be considered on the       House floor on Monday, October 28. The bill, H.R. 2440, the       Full Utilization of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, has       bipartisan support on the Transportation and Infrastructure       Committee and I urge your support for the measure.        As you know, the Port of Cleveland and others in our state       depend on the Corps of Engineers' civil works program. Our       port relies on the maintenance dredging work each and every       year. Around $8 million is needed every year to keep the       Cuyahoga River Federal shipping channel, the port's       breakwater and related infrastructure in a condition that       enables the safe navigation of ships and mariners. Major       American industry and U.S. exports rely on maintenance       dredging that occurs twice each year.        Since 1986, when Congress created the Harbor Maintenance       Tax (HMT) and Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF), most       cargo in American ports is charged an ad valorem tax for the       purpose of covering Federal channel maintenance-related costs       in U.S. seaports. In the first years, the tax revenue was       fully spent on Federal channel maintenance but soon revenues       increased and a surplus was allowed to accumulate in the       trust fund, even as many shipping channels in the country       were not fully maintained to their design depths and widths.       Overtime, the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund balance has been       allowed to grow to over $9 billion while Congress has       continued to under-spend on the infrastructure that is our       national navigation system.        In more recent years, the House and Senate became more       alert to the inadequately maintained American ports and the       existence of the HMT and HMTF. Targets for maintenance       spending were approved in WRDA 2014 and appropriations have       increased. We ports have appreciated that improvement, but       the fact is that the unused HMT revenue continues to       accumulate while maintenance dredging in many parts of the       country, including on the Great Lakes, is insufficient. The       graph below, prepared in 2016, provides a snapshot of       spending versus tax revenue. (In the years since, the trend       is much the same with a projected HMTF balance (per FY 2020       budget) of as much as $10.4 billion.                                                        20 YEARS OF THE HARBOR MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND                                                                   [Dollars in millions] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                   1998     1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007                         HMTF Cash Flow:                          Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BOY Balance...................................................    1,106    1,246    1,556    1,621    1,777    1,850    2,001    2,299    2,695    3,234 Receipts & Interest...........................................      651      607      767      816      730      737      946    1,102    1,337    1,427 Outlays.......................................................     -511     -297     -702     -660     -657     -586     -648     -706     -798     -910                                                                ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EOY Balance...................................................    1,246    1,556    1,621    1,777    1,850    2,001    2,299    2,695    3,234    3,751 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   2008     2009     2010     2011     2012     2013                                              2017                 HMTF Cash Flow:                  Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual   Actual  2014 Actual  2015 Actual   2016 Est.

That the unspent balance has been allowed to accumulate and       sit in the Federal Treasury as ballast against budget       deficits is especially disturbing at a time when Congress and       the White House have rightly talked about the importance of       tending to the county's essential infrastructure. In the case       of port channels, the money exists. That is an important       consideration. No new revenue stream is required.        As a final note, and for clarity sake, this issue is       unrelated to the funding of the inland waterway system. There       vessels, including as tug and towboats, are charged an excise       tax on fuel expenses. That revenue is accounted for in the       Inland Waterways Trust Fund and is spent on construction work       such as lock and dam improvements. It is noteworthy that       unlike the case with the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, the       Inland Waterways Trust Fund resources are fully spent on that       system's navigation projects.        Please vote for the Full Utilization of the Harbor       Maintenance Trust Fund legislation.            Sincerely,                                               William D. Friedman,      President & Chief Executive Officer.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence for  inviting us to come to the floor this evening to share our sorrow with  the Conyers family and the people of Greater Detroit that Congressman  Conyers represented here so forcefully throughout his entire career.   I would like to extend sympathy to his wife, Monica, and to his sons,  John and Carl, that he used to come walk through Congress, even when  they were small. He would take them on the train from one side of the  Capitol to the other. I can still see him doing that.   As others have mentioned, he served from 1965 to 2017. So, from the  civil rights movement at its apex, that fervor came into this Chamber,  and John served over half a century in furtherance of America's  betterment.   He was the 44th dean of the House. He became its most senior member  and, certainly, the longest serving African American in the history of  the United States of America.   I think most Members would agree, he truly was a drum major for  justice and also a drum major for jobs and fair wages for all workers.   His service was anchored by those parallel visions, and I can still  remember coming as a new Member to Congress. There were three men who  were serving at that time: John; another John, John Dingell; and a man  named William Ford.   The three of them together, in my mind, actually formed the northern  apex of the civil rights and labor rights movement in this country, and  America was bettered by all of their services. They worked in tandem.   They had been forged by the same set of experiences and came to us  from what we in the Midwest call Motown, Motor City. That is a place  that is unlike any other in the United States of America.   It has a rich history. It has a history of struggle. It produced  famous singing groups like The Supremes, contemporaneous with John's  adulthood, the Detroit Tigers, and lots of jazz. John loved jazz.   If you think about what he represented, Detroit is not really a tea  and crumpets city. My apologies to all those who enjoy tea and  crumpets. It is really a heavy-duty town, a very pluralistic community  where the fight for organized labor was rooted and, something that we  know well in our region, the strike at a place called River Rouge that  began the work in our country to value labor through contract--not just  happenstance, but by an actual contract.   And John Conyers was a part of the development of the law that  allowed for the dignity of labor, but it was born out of the struggle  in Detroit, a very rough-and-tumble world.   One of his early jobs was with the United Auto Workers, in which our  family has had members for many generations now, and he and I shared  that affinity.                                time  2045    He was not an arrogant man, but he was rooted, again, in the fight  for justice during the best years of his life.   When he arranged for the funeral in Detroit of Rosa Parks--and the  history of the Montgomery Bus Boycott is written, I don't think a lot  of people really know that he actually had hired Rosa Parks in his  office from 1965 to 1988. I can recall, in 2005, attending the funeral  of Rosa Parks--what a central role John Conyers played in that  magnificent ceremony. But through it was the continuing education of  the people of the United States of America as to what the civil rights  struggle, and our struggle as a people, has actually been comprised of,  a constant struggle.   I have to say, on the humorous side, he loved cars that drove fast. I  happened to be in one of those cars one time, 90 miles an hour on I-75.  I don't know how we ever didn't get a ticket.   But he was always moving forward. I would guess we shared thousands-- I started adding it up today--thousands of airplane flights between  Washington and Michigan, as we went to our respective hometowns. And I  always found him to be very cordial, very friendly, full of good humor.   He was a perpetual anchor for us on moving American forward, a  leading strategist in that endeavor.   So I hope it is of some comfort to his loved ones and to the people  that he represented that his being and his indefatigable spirit are now  freed from Earth's binds; and that his soul may rise high and shower  our precious world with peace and justice from sea to shining sea.   With heavy heart, golden memories, and abiding gratitude may I extend  deepest sympathies on the passing of Congressman John Conyers of  Detroit, Michigan to his family, his loving wife Monica, sons John and  Carl, his  [[Page H8534]]  constituents and colleagues who honor his life of service to our  nation.   An accomplished lawyer and passionate civil rights and labor leader,  Rep. Conyers rose through the ranks of Congress to become Chair of the  powerful House Judiciary Committee. In 2015, he because Dean of the  U.S. House of Representatives. His contributions to advancing the cause  minority and labor rights as intertwined is legendary. He was a  founding member of the Black Caucus, along with Rep. Bill Clay of  Missouri and Rep. Louis Stokes of Ohio now 54 members strong. When Rep.  Conyers arrived in Congress, and helped create The Congressional Black  Caucus, there were only 13 African American Members. He authored and  passed legislation creating the Martin Luther King holiday in 1983, and  by 2000--17 years later--all 50 states had adopted it.   John Conyers served as a perpetual anchor in the North for the  burgeoning Civil Rights movement of the 1960's and became a leading  strategist. His deep commitment accompanied by an affable nature drew  people to his cause. A lover of jazz and the arts, Rep. Conyers never  lost his joy of living despite the serious obstacles he confronted.  Along with his Michigan barrister colleagues Rep. William Ford and Rep.  John Dingell, the three formed a triumvirate that defined the value set  and meaning of ``Democrat'' from the industrial, pluralistic cities of  middle America.   May it be of comfort to his loved ones that his being and  indefatigable spirit are now freed from earth's binds, May his soul  rise high and shower our precious world with peace, and justice from  sea to shining sea.
