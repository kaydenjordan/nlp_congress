 Madam President, on Tuesday afternoon, our country  suffered another shooting--this time in Highlands Ranch, CO. It was the  second shooting of the week following a weekend where at least 19  people were shot in Baltimore, 16 in St. Louis, and 28 in Chicago.   My grandson is less than a year old. He turned over in his crib last  night--great accomplishment. But on a serious note, I don't want him to  live in a world where this is the norm. I don't want him to see this on  TV every other week. I don't want him to come home after school to tell  his parents about learning to hide under a desk with the lights off. I  don't want him to grow up in a country where children and adolescents  are more than 20 times more likely to be killed with guns than their  peers in other high-income countries.   I want him--little Noah and every other child in America--to live in  a world where America's gun violence epidemic is a thing of the past.  It may seem a naive thought in a cynical time, but I believe we can get  there. We can take steps right now to make these incidents less likely.  Nothing will prevent them, but there are lots of things we can do to  make them a lot less frequent. A few months ago, the House did just  that. The House passed legislation to close the loopholes in Federal  background checks--something that more than 90 percent of all Americans  support.   No one here pretends that we can prevent every incident, but we have  a choice to face between moving in the right direction in a significant  way and doing nothing. That is why I am so disappointed once again that  Leader McConnell and the Republican majority have turned this Chamber  into a  [[Page S2753]]  legislative graveyard where even the most bipartisan, broadly supported  legislation like background checks can't even get a vote or a  discussion. Here we are at the end of another week in the Senate. This  week, we have done nothing but process nominations. It is not because  there is nothing else to do. There are over 100 bills--many  noncontroversial and many bipartisan--that have passed the House and  are awaiting Senate action, but Leader McConnell has turned the Senate  into a legislative graveyard.   When the American people demand action, Leader McConnell does  nothing. When the American people demand action, the Senate Republicans  are in obeisance to this strategy of a graveyard, even when in their  hearts they may know doing that is not right and they would like to  debate the issues, whatever their views.   Leader McConnell promised to preside over an open Senate, with  vigorous debate and amendment votes and the ability to vote on issues  of the day. He promised that, and he said no matter which party offered  the ideas. Leader McConnell is breaking those promises when he consigns  bill after bill--every one of them needed by America, needed by the  middle class, needed by working people--every one of them to a  legislative graveyard. So there are no debates, no amendments, no  progress, no hope for the American people as the Senate continues to be  in such a legislative graveyard.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1412         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
