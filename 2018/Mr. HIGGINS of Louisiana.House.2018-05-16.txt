 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  American farmer.   Mr. Speaker, will this body recognize the heritage and culture, the  sacrifice of American farmers, who for generations have provided for  our country and our world.   I rise today in support of one of America's most important  agricultural commodities that supports an industry which produces $20  billion of domestic economic activity annually: sugar.   I have the honor of representing southwest Louisiana, where sugar  contributes $3.5 billion to our State economy annually and employs over  16,000 hardworking Louisiana citizens.   Mr. Speaker, these men and women have come into their lives embracing  the heritage and hard work of their mothers, their fathers, their  grandmothers, their grandfathers. For generations, by the toil of their  labor and the sweat of their brow, they have tilled the soil and raised  sugar.   The United States has historically been a reliable supplier of high- quality,  [[Page H3986]]  low-cost sugar that is used by consumers domestically and  internationally. In fact, Americans on average spend over 20 percent  less for sugar than consumers in other nations, and manufacturers pay  roughly the same price for American sugar that they did in the 1980s.   American sugar growers last year produced 32,000 tons of sugar,  13,800 tons of which came from south Louisiana.   While sugar prices have remained flat for the past three decades, the  cost of farming has not, as equipment, fuel, and fertilizer costs have  all risen between 90 percent to 200 percent in that same timeframe.                                time  1045    We must protect the future of American sugar and American sugar  farmers, American sugar farm families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support American farmers and  pass H.R. 2, the Agricultural and Nutrition Act of 2018, as amended, by  the House Committee on Agriculture.                            ____________________
