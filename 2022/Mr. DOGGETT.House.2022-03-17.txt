 Madam Speaker, the day after Russia invaded Ukraine, I  introduced the centerpiece of today's legislation with Congressman  Blumenauer. It denied Russia preferential trade treatment and would  expel it from the World Trade Organization.   At that time, 3 weeks ago, there was hope that economic sanctions  like this might limit the extent of Putin's brutal aggression. Now we  have seen that economic sanctions are having no immediate impact to  limit the slaughter from Putin's war of annihilation against Ukraine.   Uniting the world to isolate Russia has weakened the ruble,  certainly, but it has not stopped Putin from reducing so much of  Ukraine to rubble.   While I favor excluding every possible Russian import, this bill will  grant President Biden appropriate authority to raise tariffs  significantly on any Russian import that is permitted, and the same for  Belarus.   This is largely the same bill on which I sought action last week  until President Biden requested a delay.                                time  1415    Surprisingly, this bill does not include the ban on Russian energy  imports that this House approved overwhelmingly last week on the bill  that we considered then. I hope that ban will be restored in further  work on the legislation.   Though important to finally approve this bill as another way to  isolate Russia, we should recognize there is no substitute for getting  Ukrainians all of the weaponry that they have requested, including jet  fighters, to stop the mass murder we observe daily.   The financial pain imposed won't immediately ease the pain of  Ukrainian families. They are paying in blood while we pay in dollars,  but it is one way for us to hold Putin accountable and to act in  solidarity with them.   To those who ask that we adopt further sanctions or more weapons only  if Russia does something more, I say what more barbaric butchery need  we see before doing everything we possibly can, short of sending troops  into Ukraine. The time to do everything is now, the time to provide for  Ukrainian refugees to enter our country is now.
