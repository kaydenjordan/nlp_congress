 Mr. Chair, when I voted for the Brady Law in  1993--which took effect on February 28, 1994--it was to keep firearms  out of the hands of dangerous persons including felons and abusers.   Twenty-five years later--and 300 million background checks that have  blocked 3 million purchases to dangerous individuals--few if any today  seriously suggest that the Brady law should be repealed.   I support the Second Amendment. Universal background checks  prescribed in H.R. 8 are an attempt to ensure that firearms are  procured, owned and used by responsible, law abiding citizens.   According to the Brady Campaign, about 1 in 5 guns now sold in  America are done so without a background check. That's a significant  loophole.   According to the CDC, there was a record 39,773 deaths from firearms  in 2017--higher than in any other year--23,854 were self-inflicted and  14,542 were homicides.   To mitigate gun violence in America, H.R. 8 expands Brady background  checks to transactions by private sellers not currently covered by the  law.   Multiple school shootings have led to robust, comprehensive action at  every level to make classrooms safer. I have visited many schools in my  district--and I have found that while the threat is being taken  seriously, no one policy, program or initiative can ensure the level of  protection our students need and deserve.   Mr. Chair, no constitutional right is absolute including the Second  Amendment. The First Amendment's freedom of speech, for example, has  reasonable limits including the promulgation of slander and libel law.   To preserve public order, we accept reasonable restrictions on the  freedom to assemble. Even freedom of religion isn't without some modest  boundaries.   In like manner, universal background checks don't erode Second  Amendment rights but do help ensure much needed protection from gun  violence for everyone.
