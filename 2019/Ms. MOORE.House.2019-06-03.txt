 Mr. Speaker, here we are, yet again, to extend block  grants to States for the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Act  through September 30, 2019, this time in the form of H.R. 2940. I  support that initiative.   However, with the reform of ``welfare as we knew it'' pre-1996,  instead of helping people out of poverty, as the narrative goes, we  have created a permanent underclass of primarily women workers who have  been denied education, denied training, and denied childcare while  being required to work at below-subsistence levels or, worse, forced to  engage in work activities with absolutely no compensation, which is  violative of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished  slavery and uncompensated work.    Mr. Speaker, our so-called welfare reform can more accurately be  described as ``welfare deform,'' given the flagrant flaws that amount  to government-sanctioned child abuse--for example, the requirement to  work without guaranteed, safe, and affordable childcare, and the  imposition of time limits during countercyclical episodes, like the one  we saw during the Great Recession.   Mr. Speaker, I have drafted a bill called the RISE Out of Poverty Act  that would do more than just extend TANF. It would reform it by  stipulating that reducing child poverty and securing childcare while  the parent is at work would be the primary purpose of TANF.   We would lift people out of poverty. The block grants would be spent  on programs that would alleviate poverty, not on projects like filling  the holes in a government's budget.   While I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2940, I also encourage us,  Mr. Speaker, to roll up our sleeves and get to work and craft an  overhaul of this program that would fix the shortcomings that exist in  the TANF program we now have.
