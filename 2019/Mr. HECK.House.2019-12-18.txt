 Madam Speaker, this week, Americans are busy finishing up  their Christmas shopping mostly for their children, or if they are  lucky enough to have them, their grandchildren. And high school and  college students are taking final exams and sweating out the results.   That got me to thinking about those who follow and what our  obligation is to them, and that got me to thinking about those who came  before and how they might have seen their obligation to us, people like  my grandfather, who our family believes literally was born on the boat  on the way over here from Germany, or my father, who fought in World  War II against the very people that his grandfather had left.   We are all here today, all of us, because someone before us  sacrificed so that they could journey here and build a new life in this  unique land. We are here today because those immigrants and their  children were dedicated not just to the land of America, but to the  idea: freedom and opportunity secured by self-government, choosing our  own leaders in free and fair elections, and the rule of law under the  Constitution.  [[Page H12186]]     This idea of America is in peril, brought about so by this  President, who sought to cheat in an election, a President who puts  himself above the law and attacks the bedrock constitutional precept of  checks and balances.   Yet, the question is, can America survive this behavior? What ideal  will we hand down to those who follow us? And, finally, what is our  obligation to those who would follow?   It is simply this: to do our duty, to defend the Constitution and the  values underpinning it by voting ``yes'' on the Articles of  Impeachment.
