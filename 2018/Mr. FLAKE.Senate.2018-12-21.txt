 Mr. President, I thank the two leaders of this agreement,  the Senator from Tennessee, the Senator from Alabama--Mr. Jones--and  others who have worked to ensure that the next vote we will have in  this Chamber will be on an agreement as Senator Corker said--not a test  vote, not a cloture vote.   What I wanted to do with not proceeding is to demonstrate that not  all Republicans would be for the House bill either. There is no path  forward for the House bill. The only path forward is to a bill that has  an agreement between the President and both Houses of Congress. The  next time we vote, it will be on the agreement. It will not be another  test vote.   I yield the floor.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Tennessee.
