 Mr. Speaker, as Congress works to reauthorize the farm  bill, I rise today to deliver the 17th installment of my farm bill  impact series, where I am highlighting various aspects of the  legislation that deserve Congress' awareness and support.   The farm bill won't ever be effective, though, if the stepped-up  basis is eliminated and if producers get saddled with unjust capital  gains taxes.   Sadly, that is exactly what President Biden's budget proposal does.  It works to eliminate the stepped-up basis and impose capital gains  taxes on assets that have been held in family trust or ownership for  over 90 years. This is the farm killer tax.   Here is why the stepped-up basis is so important. Let's say you are a  young person working on your family farm, and you are slowly taking on  responsibility and risk. You work for your parents until the time comes  for you to take over the land, equipment, and livestock. When that  happens, the Federal Government should not jump in and impose taxes on  the unrealized gains of these inherited assets.   This principle is called the stepped-up basis and has a long  precedent in the tax code with tons of bipartisan support.   The President's budget, however, works to eliminate this, which would  destroy family farms overnight. The day-to-day trials of operating a  successful farm, ranch, or small business are challenging enough  without worrying about paying devastating capital gains taxes, and now  the Biden administration wants to impose new taxes on these people.   Unbelievably, it gets even worse when dismantling the stepped-up  basis. President Biden's budget proposal also includes the farm killer  tax. In President Biden's budget proposal, there is a plan to impose  capital gains taxes on farms that have been in the family for over 90  years.   Think about that. In 1940, the average cost of Kansas farmland was  $50 an acre. Now, irrigated land is as much as $4,000 per acre.   Imagine the capital gains tax implications on that history of  ownership. This proposal would propose hundreds of thousands of dollars  in new capital gains taxes on agriculture producers, destroying their  livelihoods.   Mr. Speaker, 98 percent of all American farms and 90 percent of all  American small businesses are family owned and operated. A budget  proposal that eliminates the stepped-up basis and imposes the farm  killer tax is not a game changer for American family businesses. It is  a game ender.   Agriculture is a multigenerational calling. This is National Ag Week  when we celebrate the tireless efforts of farmers, ranchers, and  producers who have earned our support. President Biden's budget  proposal is the opposite of support. It is a gut punch to the people  who feed, fuel, and clothe us all.   This week, I introduced a bipartisan resolution with more than 60 of  my colleagues who support the preservation of the stepped-up basis,  oppose any efforts to impose new taxes on family farms and small  businesses, and recognize the importance of generational transfers of  farm and small business operations. I encourage all of my colleagues in  this body to support it.   If we want to invest in the future of our country, we need to invest  in the future leaders of American agriculture. Congress must preserve  the stepped-up basis and oppose the farm killer tax.   I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my  farm bill impact series and highlight more programs and titles within  the bill that I believe Congress must understand and support to ensure  that agriculture thrives in America. The people who feed, fuel, and  clothe us all deserve our unwavering support.                            ____________________
