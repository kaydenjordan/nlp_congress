 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Smith for his  incredible leadership on the life issue in the Congress.   Mr. Speaker, 47 years ago the moral and religious fabric of the  United States was tragically torn. As a result of the Roe v. Wade  decision, 61 million unborn children have lost their lives, and  millions of women and families have been torn apart by abortion. I  promised my constituents that I would be a voice for the voiceless in  Washington, and I have no intention of breaking that promise.   Over the past year my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  time and time again blocked legislation that protects the unborn and  women's health. Last year we saw lawmakers block the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act over 80 times, explicitly endorsing  infanticide.   A number of important pro-life bills have been introduced in this  Congress, including, as Mr. Smith mentioned, my Teleabortion Prevention  Act and the Child Custody Protection Act that protects young women who  are being taken across State lines for an abortion. Both have been  stalled by partisan politics.   We also saw lawmakers in New York and Virginia cheer legislation that  would allow abortions in the ninth month of pregnancy when most babies  are viable. This is an outrage. Protecting the voiceless unborn is one  of the most significant contributions we can make in our lives, and we,  as a nation, need to get back to protecting it.
