 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney for  shepherding this bill and for all of her incredible leadership today  and over the years.   I rise in support of H.R. 7519, my bill designating the post office  at 2050 South Boulevard in Bloomfield Township, Michigan, as the Dr.  Ezra S. Parke Post Office Building.   Dr. Parke and his family moved to Bloomfield Township in 1822. Madam  Speaker, that was 15 years before Michigan became a State. He was a  dedicated public servant who established the first post office in the  area and helped lay the foundation for effective local government.   Dr. Parke served as Bloomfield Township's very first postmaster, from  1824 to 1836, and as township clerk from 1827 to 1844. He was widely  respected and wore many hats, including husband, father, physician,  teacher, and spiritual leader.   I am proud to honor Dr. Ezra Parke, who embodies the role of the U.S.  Postal Service in the development of my own township and of our entire  Nation and the centrality of the post office in the life of its  citizens from before Michigan's founding to this very day.   I thank Bloomfield Township Supervisor Dani Walsh and the Bloomfield  Historical Society for collaborating with me to choose Dr. Parke for  this much-deserved honor.
