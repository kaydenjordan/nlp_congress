 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DREAMers like my former intern, Luis,  who came to this country when he was 6 years old.                                time  1500     Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer two amendments in this en  bloc package to this appropriations bill. These two amendments will  finally provide the authorized funding levels of $12 million for the  regional infrastructure accelerator demonstration program, section 1441  of the FAST Act; and $10 million for the transit-oriented development  pilot program, section  [[Page H7044]]  1036 of the FAST Act. This funding will finally allow these two  important programs to move forward, improving infrastructure projects  and transportation options in my district in the Inland Empire and  throughout our country.   I appreciate the chairman's and the ranking member's support.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to this  appropriations bill.   Section 235(b) of the INA requires that any individual who arrives at  a U.S. port of entry and asks to apply for asylum must be granted an  interview with an asylum officer. That is the law. It does not say our  borders are open, but it does say that we do not turn away asylum  seekers at our borders.   However, in recent months, NGOs have documented many cases where  Customs and Border Protection officials have turned away asylum seekers  at ports of entry. These actions are clearly prohibited by section  235(b).   My amendment would simply prevent any use of funds to violate section  235(b). Our taxpayer dollars should not be used to break the law.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to Division E  of the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act.   Immigrant families in my district and across this country are  terrified. They are afraid because of the things that President Trump  has said and because of the policies that he has proposed.   President Trump has been clear about who he thinks immigrants are. He  thinks immigrants are lazy. He thinks immigrants are unskilled. He  thinks immigrants are dangerous criminals.   Just yesterday, he ended the DACA program, crushing the dreams of  800,000 talented and courageous young Americans.   He has promised to triple the number of ICE agents to build a  deportation force to go into immigrant communities. Under President  Obama, ICE was told to focus on detaining and deporting dangerous  criminals. But President Trump has told ICE they should go after  whomever they can find.   Now, every immigrant without papers is a target, young and old. This  is why immigrants are so afraid. Democrats in Congress have been united  in standing up against President Trump in his war on American  immigrants. We have blocked money for the wall and for his deportation  force. But we also need to put some healthy constraints on President  Trump's Department of Homeland Security.   My amendment will strike section 209 of Division E, which grants the  Secretary of Homeland Security authority to reprogram or transfer funds  for the purpose of detaining immigrants prioritized for removal.   President Trump has made his intentions very clear. He wants to  deport every one of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this  country no matter what those consequences may be.   With this bill as it is currently written, there is almost no limit  how far he can go. Congress must stand up and make clear where we  stand.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's concern for  public safety. The reality is that this administration has kept  Congress in the dark about immigration policy.                            ____________________
