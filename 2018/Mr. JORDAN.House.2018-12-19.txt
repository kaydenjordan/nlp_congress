 Mr. Speaker, everyone knows the old line: Fool me once,  shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. But we are going to have to  change that line. We are going to need a new one. The new line should  be: Fool the American people four times, shame on Congress.   Remember what we did in March? The March big omnibus spending bill?  We said: Oh, no. We are not going to put the border wall funding on  this bill because we are going to do it in September.   Then we get to September and say: Do you know what? Wait a minute. We  are not going to put it on this bill because we are going to do it on  December 7.   And then December 7 has come: Wait a minute. We are not going to keep  our promise. We are not going to put the border wall funding money on  that bill. We are going to do it December 21.   And what did we learn today? Now they are talking about kicking it to  February 8. You have got to be kidding me. Really?   I mean, February 8, when Nancy Pelosi is Speaker, I am supposed to  believe--we are supposed to believe that we are then going to build the  border security wall and keep our promise from the 2016 campaign? No  way.   Four different times we promised something and then kicked the can  down the road. I will tell you this: You know when else we should have  done it? March, September, December 7.   And now do you know when we really should have done it? Last week.  Last week when the President of the United States stood in the Oval  Office and told Congresswoman Pelosi: Nancy, this is fine. This is  fine. We don't need to go behind closed doors. Transparency is a good  thing.   Let's do what we said. Let's build the border security wall that we  should have passed last week. Instead of taking a 6-day weekend, we  should have passed it last week.   So I am sick of the games. The House Freedom Caucus is sick of the  games. More importantly--most importantly--the American people are sick  of the games.                                time  2100    So just like Congressman Perry said, let's do what we said. We make  this job way, way too difficult. It is pretty simple. What did you tell  the voters you were going to do? What did they elect you to do? Go do  that.   Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the Freedom Caucus is going to do that. We  have an amendment. We have an amendment that says $5 billion for the  wall, reform our asylum laws, fix the problem--a commonsense, basic  amendment that everyone in this country knows needs to be done.   And now is the time to do it. We didn't do it the four times before,  but now is the time to do it. So let's get it done this week. Let's do  what we said.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's leadership of our group. I  appreciate his Special Order tonight. We know what we have to do. Let's  just do it.
