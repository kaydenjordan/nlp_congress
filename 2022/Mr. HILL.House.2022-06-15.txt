 Mr. Speaker, I do rise in opposition to H.R. 2543. I thank  my friend from Houston, Texas, and our colleagues on both sides of the  aisle that worked on many of the bills that are in the package today.                                time  1315    It is a shame that that package was not put together in such a way  that we could be here in a bipartisan visit about the ones that we  actually support and that we think could be enacted into law. Instead,  Democrats have put together a partisan package of bills that politicize  our central bank and do nothing to address the insidious inflation that  is hurting all American families and workers--Black, Brown, and White.   Mr. Speaker, one thing I know is that H.R. 2543 will not become law.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, Arkansans woke up and as they went to work and  filled up their tanks for the week, they had to pay $5 for gas. That is  not as high as it is here in Washington, but $5 is hurting all of the  hardworking families in my State.   While Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is still toeing the  economically illiterate party line on inflation, even economists from  the left of center admit that government spending was too much and not  targeted.   Don't believe me?   Listen to President Biden's key advisers.   Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers predicted, a month after  President Biden took office, that the proposed American Rescue Plan  would ``set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a  generation.''   Now Larry Summers is forecasting a recession.   Steve Rattner, Mr. Obama's former economic adviser on his staff, said  Mr. Biden was ``wrong to omit the important contribution to inflation  from excessive fiscal and monetary stimulus.''   The truth is, after the CARES Act and the December appropriations  bill of 2020, there was plenty of COVID money left over, and the  economy was well on its way to recovery with vaccines being  distributed.   But House Democrats supercharged demand-side stimulus by adding  another $2 trillion in unpaid-for spending in that so-called American  Rescue Plan. Mr. Speaker, Americans aren't feeling rescued. They are  feeling like hostages--hostages to the daily theft of the Biden  inflation.   Now, Mr. Speaker, the President fashions himself as a budget hawk,  saying last month that he personally reduced the deficit last year, and  he is complaining that we on this side of the aisle aren't giving him  any credit. But what he doesn't tell you, Mr. Speaker, is that he is  taking credit for deficits that were falling due to those expiring  COVID programs.   The facts are, Mr. Biden has not reduced deficits. In fact, he has  increased them. The Congressional Budget Office's latest numbers  project $16 trillion in additional debt between now and 2032.   So I hear a lot of talk about deflection on our House floor today,  and the deflection of this bill, Mr. Speaker, is the deflection from  the insidious inflation that our families are facing. If House  Democrats were serious, then they would target and spend less money.  They would stop blaming Putin and accusing American companies of price  gouging. They would stop cutting off capital to American energy  companies through ESG mandates and intimidating banks, and they would  stop threatening trillions in more taxes.   While government spending and supply chain constraints have  contributed to higher prices, this inflation also stems from the Fed's  loose monetary policy--too loose, too lax, and for too long.   Just as House and Senate Republicans worked to tailor and end the  COVID funds at the end of 2020, we also urged the Federal Reserve to  end zero interest rates and begin shrinking their balance sheet.  Instead of doing anything to address these root causes of inflation,  H.R. 2543 on the House floor would instead expand the Fed's mandate to  address socioeconomic disparities.   Two weeks ago, Mr. Biden met with Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the Oval  Office where Mr. Biden said that he embraced the Fed's independence.  Apparently, House Democrats didn't get the memo. At a time when our  central bank has failed to carry out its current mandate for sound  money and price stability, Democrats want the Fed to not only be a  climate regulator but also to end racial inequity. Expanding the Fed's  mandate to address socioeconomic disparities would further inject  uncertainty and risk into the Fed's monetary policy and politicize our  historically independent central bank.   House Republicans believe Congress should return to pre-pandemic  debates on our spending priorities, abandon economic pop science fads  like modern monetary theory, and urge our Federal Reserve to return to  its core mission.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill, H.R. 2543.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the ranking member on  the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. McHenry, for his  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit. It addresses the core flaw  that House Republicans believe presides today. We hear the voices of  those 80 percent of Americans who say that $5,000 extra coming out of  our pockets is what is hurting the working families, Black, White, and  Brown, in my home State of Arkansas. We know inflation is the top issue  facing this House and facing our families that we represent.   That is why if we were to adopt my motion to recommit, we would  instruct the Committee on Financial Services to adopt my amendment to  H.R. 2543. This amendment, Mr. Speaker, is straightforward. It would  simply focus the Federal Reserve, as Representative Byron Donalds so  eloquently outlined, on a single mandate: price stability.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text of my  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
