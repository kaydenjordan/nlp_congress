 Very soon, Mr. President, AI will reshape life on Earth  in very dramatic ways. It will transform how we fight disease, tackle  hunger, manage our lives, enrich our minds, and ensure peace. But we  cannot ignore AI's dangers: workforce disruptions in a very serious  way, misinformation and new weapons, threats against our elections, and  there is the danger that we may prove incapable of managing this  technology at all. Congress cannot behave like ostriches in the sand  when it comes to AI.   Yesterday, I laid out my SAFE Innovation framework for AI. I call it  that because innovation must be our North Star. AI could be our most  spectacular innovation yet, could lead to generations of prosperity, so  Congress must promote its growth here in the United States. But if  people don't think innovation can be done safely, without danger, that  will stifle AI's development and even prevent us from moving forward.   So my SAFE Innovation framework balances both prioritizing security,  accountability, protecting our foundations, and explainability as  safeguards, guardrails we need to make AI work safely for us.   Yesterday, I also announced that later this year, I will invite the  top AI experts to come to Congress and convene a series of first-ever  AI Insight Forums for a new and unique approach to developing AI  legislation. These Insight Forums are the first of their kind. They  have to be the first of their kind because AI moves so quickly, will  change our world so decisively. It is so much deeper in its complexity  than almost anything else we have dealt with and lacks the legislative  history in  [[Page S2198]]  Congress that other issues like the military or education or healthcare  have.   Our jobs as legislators will be to listen to the experts and learn as  much as we can so we can translate these ideas into legislative action.  We must work quickly but not precipitously, because this issue is so  complex. We will have no artificial deadlines. We will come up with  proposals in a matter not of days or weeks and not of years, but  months.   These forums can't and won't replace the activity already happening  in Congress on AI. Our committees must continue serving as the key  drivers for legislation we produce in Congress, but the AI forums will  give us lots more information and knowledge from which we can draw  legislation.    I thank all Senators from both sides who are already working on this  issue. We are keeping it bipartisan, as it must be.   We must exercise humility as we proceed. ``Humility'' is a key word  here because this is so overwhelming. Success is not guaranteed. AI is  unlike anything we have dealt with before, and it may be exceedingly  difficult for legislation to tackle every single issue. But if we can  find some solutions and create some consensus, we must press ahead. As  Theodore Roosevelt said, ``We are in the arena.'' And there is no  substitute for government being involved because without government,  there will be no guardrails. Some companies may put them in, but they  even won't put them in if other companies don't and gain an advantage.  So government must be involved here. It is the only force powerful  enough to impose guidelines on what could otherwise be an unfettered  AI.                    Welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi    Now, Mr. President, on the Modi visit, later this afternoon, I will  join congressional leaders in welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi of  India to the U.S. Capitol, where he will speak before a joint meeting  of Congress.   I will tell Prime Minister Modi the same thing I told him earlier  this spring when I led the largest Senate codel ever to India: Our two  nations will need each other if we are to beat back the forces of  autocracy.   When I visited India, I got to see the vibrancy and future potential  of that society. It is astounding. And India will grow in power and  strength over the next century.   If we want to hold firm against the Chinese Government and the  Chinese Communist Party, then the world's two largest democracies must  work in unison to ensure peace. It means expanding trade and expanding  opportunities for workers to come to the United States. It means  safeguarding our common defense, which I know will be one of the big  announcements during the visit.   But I also told Prime Minister Modi during our meeting that we cannot  lose sight of the values that define us as democracies in the first  place, like freedom of expression, minority rights, and civil  liberties. I told this to him in person because without that, no  democracy--no democracy--can long thrive.   So I look forward to meeting for the second time this year with the  Prime Minister later this afternoon to stress the importance of  democratic values and the urgency of our Nation working together.                          Tax Convention with Chile    Mr. President, on the Chile tax treaty, for decades, Chile has been  one of America's strongest partners in Latin America--economically,  diplomatically, militarily, and scientifically.   Today, the Senate will take a monumental step to strengthen United  States-Chile relations by passing the Chile tax treaty. This treaty has  been in the works for over a decade. It has strong bipartisan support,  and now is the time to finally get it across the finish line.   The United States-Chile treaty is consistent with other tax treaties  we have with more than 60 countries, which boosts American  competitiveness on the global stage.   Chile is the home to the world's largest lithium reserves--the  precious metal used in emerging technologies like iPhones, EV  batteries, and renewable energy storage.   So as the world races to advance clean energy technologies, Chile  will be a critical ally for anyone looking to lead the way. But without  a tax treaty with Chile, American companies could face double taxation  and other barriers to investment and trade, leaving them at a  significant disadvantage against foreign competitors.   If the United States is serious about remaining ahead of countries  like China, it is imperative we pass this treaty today and put American  business back on a level playing field with the rest of the world when  it comes to Chile. So this is a very important treaty for our future  and for our leadership in technology and in clean energy. I hope it  will get as close to unanimous support as anything can get in this  body.   I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, especially  Senators Menendez and Risch for their work on this issue, and I look  forward to the Senate finally getting this treaty passed later this  afternoon.                                 H.J. Res. 44    Finally, Mr. President, on the pistol brace CRA, later this morning,  Senate Republicans will force a vote on a bill seemingly designed to  make America's gun violence epidemic even worse. Here, at a time with  all this gun violence, Republicans are putting a bill on the floor that  makes it easier--easier--to conceal an assault-style pistol, something  that has been used in mass shooting after mass shooting. Shame on them.   At issue is a commonsense rule released by the ATF regulating the use  of pistol braces, widely available accessories that modify AK-style  pistols so that they function identically to short-barreled rifles. If  you have ever seen a gunman fire what looks like a machine gun with  just one hand, that is what pistol braces allow you to do. And because  they don't have a long barrel, it makes it much easier to conceal them;  so people for bad purpose, particularly those who are involved and want  to do mass shootings, love these weapons. And we are making it easier  for them to get them.   Some of the moves that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  make are just appalling.   America's legacy of gun violence has been made significantly worse  because of pistol braces. Even a surface look at recent mass shootings  reveal that gunmen were often aided by a pistol brace.   In the shooting in Dayton in 2019--9 killed, 17 injured--outside a  bar, the gunman used a pistol brace.   Consider the shooting in Boulder in 2021--10 killed, including a  police officer. Again, the gunman used a pistol brace.   And we cannot forget that tragedy in Nashville--three teachers  murdered, three 9-year-olds slaughtered. The photo from that day haunts  me and should haunt us. I think of it all the time: students ushered by  police in a single file through the parking lot, parents frantically  looking for their children, a little girl--that is the picture I think  of--a little girl looking out the window of the schoolbus in tears,  scared for her life.   Today's Republican push to ease access to deadly pistol braces is an  insult to countless families who have lost loved ones because of these  enhanced weapons. This proposal is a shameful--shameful--step backward  in America's fight against gun violence, and it is just utterly  confounding and perplexing that our Republican colleagues are pushing  this kind of legislation.   Americans are tired of hard-right politicians who intentionally turn  a blind eye to all the suffering in our communities while they actively  work to take us backward in the fight against gun violence. I will  strongly oppose this CRA and urge my colleagues to likewise vote no.                 Nomination of General Charles Q. Brown, Jr.    Mr. President, finally, later this morning, I will be meeting with  Gen. CQ Brown, President Biden's nominee for the next Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff.   General Brown is exceptionally qualified to serve as the Nation's  highest ranking military officer and will be an important adviser to  the President on military decisions and operations.   General Brown's nomination would normally pass with consent, without  cloture needed. I want to hear this morning from General Brown about  the damaging impact that Senator Tuberville's holds on senior military  promotions is having on our national security and military readiness.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S2199]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, America's tragic epidemic of gun violence  has been made worse by easy access to pistol braces. But today,  amazingly enough, with all of these mass shootings, Republicans want to  loosen safety rules regarding these accessories and take us backward in  the fight against gun violence. It is hard to believe that that is what  is happening.   Pistol braces make it easier to conceal and transport weapons that  function as highly dangerous short-barreled rifles and, in many  instances, have been accessories of choice in recent mass shootings.  Some of these mass shooters choose these braces to cause mayhem, and we  are loosening the rules on them.   It is hard to believe our Republican friends are doing this. How on  Earth can Republicans look at our Nation's gun violence and think the  right answer is to make these accessories easier to own? How can  Republicans look away from tragedies in Dayton, in Boulder, and in  Nashville, and in so many other places where pistol braces were  involved, and conclude that we should reverse commonsense gun safety  rules?   When you use a pistol brace, if you are up to bad purpose, it makes  it easier to conceal a weapon with AR-15-like power.   Today's Republican push to reverse safeguards against deadly pistol  braces is an insult to families torn apart by these accessories. It is  in my mind almost every day, when the shootings occurred in Tennessee  and the shooter used a pistol brace, and three 9-year-olds were killed,  as well as three teachers, and you saw the picture of the little girl  crying on the bus leaving the school because she was so frightened. I  think of that picture every day.   This proposal would mark a horrible--horrible--step backward in  America's fight against gun violence. I urge my colleagues--I hope on  both sides of the aisle--to vote no.                             Vote on H.J. Res. 44    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this treaty is not getting much  attention, but it is one of the more important things we are doing in  the Senate in the last month--in the last few months--because it is  very important for U.S. leadership, in the things we care about in  terms of climate change, clean tech, EV batteries, that we have this  treaty.   The treaty is going to have lasting benefits for the United States  and Chile. It expands investment in one of the most mineral-rich  regions in the world--critical for making EV batteries and other clean  tech. It will ensure that Chinese competitors won't continue to have  the edge over U.S. companies in the race for lithium and other minerals  when it comes to Chile.   The Chilean people want to be close to the United States. I see some  of our Chilean representatives in the Gallery. This treaty makes us  much closer because there is no double taxation for American companies  when they want to invest in Chile.   Let's not forget that Chile has more lithium than any other country  in the world, and lithium is one of those key elements that we need to  make EV batteries and make solar panels and so many other things.   So this Chile tax treaty is very good news for American jobs,  American clean energy transition, and we are strengthening our economic  bonds with a crucial ally, a vital ally, in South America.   I just had the opportunity to meet with the representatives of the  Chilean Government--the Foreign Minister, the Ambassador.   I want to thank you for being here on this wonderful occasion.   I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for doing  this--Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch.   This is a very important treaty that will serve the United States,  Chile, and the world economy very well in the years to come.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 178.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 56.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 33.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 8.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, June 22, be  waived.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk,  and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  S. Res. 247 and the Senate proceed to the en bloc consideration of the  following Senate resolutions: S. Res. 247, S. Res. 277, S. Res. 278,  and S. Res. 279.   There being no objection, the committee was discharged of the  relevant resolution, and the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    Mr. President, in this criminal case pending in Federal  district court in the District of Columbia and arising out of the  events of January 6, 2021, the prosecution has requested testimony from  a Senate witness.   In this case, brought against Alan Hostetter, trial is expected to  commence on July 6, 2023, and the prosecution has requested testimony  from Daniel Schwager, formerly counsel to the Secretary of the Senate,  concerning his knowledge and observations of the process and  constitutional and legal bases for Congress's counting of the Electoral  College votes. Senate Secretary Berry would like to cooperate with this  request by providing relevant testimony in this trial from Mr.  Schwager.   In keeping with the rules and practices of the Senate, this  resolution would authorize the production of relevant testimony from  Mr. Schwager, with representation by the Senate legal counsel.    I know of no further debate on the resolutions en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  preambles be agreed to and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1734, which was received  from the House.    I further ask that the Cruz-Cantwell substitute  amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of the following bills en bloc:  Calendar No. 36, S. 264; Calendar No. 37, S. 829; Calendar No. 38, S.  349; Calendar No. 44, S. 206; Calendar No. 72, S. 111; and Calendar No.  94, S. 1549.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  amendments, where applicable, be considered and agreed to; that the  bills, as amended, if amended, be considered read a third time and  passed; and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the upcoming adjournment of the Senate, the President  of the Senate, the President pro tempore, and the majority and minority  leaders be authorized to make appointments to commissions, committees,  boards, conferences, or interparliamentary conferences authorized by  law, by concurrent action of the two Houses, or by order of the Senate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the junior  Senator from Virginia and the junior Senator from Hawaii be authorized  to sign duly enrolled bills or joint resolutions from June 22, 2023,  through July 10, 2023.    Mr. President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that  [[Page S2253]]  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn to then  convene for pro forma sessions only, with no business being conducted,  on the following dates and times, and that following each pro forma  session, the Senate adjourn until the next pro forma session: Monday,  June 26, at 2 p.m.; Thursday, June 29, at 10 a.m.; Monday, July 3, at  10 a.m.; and Thursday, July 6, at 10 a.m.; further, that when the  Senate adjourns on Thursday, July 6, it stand adjourned until 3 p.m. on  Monday, July 10; that on Monday, following the prayer and pledge, the  Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed  expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that following the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session  to resume consideration of the Small nomination; further, that the  cloture motions filed during today's session ripen at 5:30 p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:23 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, June 26, 2023, at 2 p.m.                            ____________________
