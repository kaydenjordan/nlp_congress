 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to  the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.   First, I thank all of our brave veterans for putting their lives on  the line to defend our freedom and our families. After sacrificing so  much, no veteran should ever have to struggle to get the care and  resources they have earned. We should always have their backs.   My provision today will do just that, ensuring that veterans have  access to high-quality job training, workforce development, and career  navigation services. These skills will help our veterans transition  back into civilian life, reach their career goals, and care for their  families.   We know that veterans have the skills to make them exceptional  workers, but they often face barriers to employment. Data shows that  unemployment rates are higher for veterans than nonveterans.   My amendment will ensure that veterans are prioritized to receive  Federal career resources, and it builds on the work I have helped lead,  working across the aisle since I was elected to support our veterans  and their families.   The first piece of legislation I passed in Congress was to expand  hiring of post-9/11 veterans. Today, we have the opportunity to fight  for them like they fought for us.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and I thank  the chairman for his leadership.
