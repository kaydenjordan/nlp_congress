 Mr. Speaker, tonight, I rise to celebrate a dear man in  northern California from the town of Palo Cedro in Shasta County.  George Stevens celebrated his 100th birthday on December 28.   Mr. Speaker, I had the pleasure of being able to stop by and spend  time with George and his family at the event at the Palo Cedro  Community Center, to celebrate with him and recognize, also, his  service to our country, which is pretty amazing.   George is a Pearl Harbor survivor. He was there in the Army at the  base there during the Pearl Harbor attack. Later, if that wasn't  enough, he ended up being deployed to Europe, where he was at the  Normandy invasion later on in 1944. And if that wasn't enough, a few  months later in the winter, he fought at the Battle of the Bulge.   None of us would have the freedom we have if it weren't for people  like George and all of his comrades who were there in that war  preserving freedom for us and so many others with that sacrifice.   He is a true patriot, a great American, and he is a guy that still  drives and does his home repairs around his place there in Palo Cedro.   Mr. Speaker, we are really proud of George and wish him a happy  birthday. I am glad I got to spend time with him and his family.                            ____________________
