 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  American Rescue Plan. I thank Chairman Yarmuth, our Speaker, our  committee chairs, for addressing this emergency urgently.   People across America are struggling. Yes, this package is big, but  the scale of the challenges that families face is enormous. They need  our help, and half measures just won't cut it. We cannot wait.   This bill extends expiring unemployment benefits, provides $1,400  payments, permanently expands the child tax credit to $3,000 per child,  and raises the minimum wage, way long overdue. And, yes, it provides  State and local funding to protect the jobs of essential workers, who,  in spite of the risk that they face, provide essential services to keep  this country running.   Mr. Speaker, this bill also fights the virus with funding for testing  and vaccinations for communities of color that have been hit the  hardest from COVID.   Finally, this bill funds our global pandemic response. COVID doesn't  respect borders. A global pandemic requires a global response.   I thank Chairman Meeks of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for  working with me to ensure that America will play its role to help fight  the pandemic abroad.   Let's take this bold action and pass this bill tonight.
