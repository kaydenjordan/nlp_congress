 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished  career of central New York broadcasting legend Roderic Woodruff Groat,  and to celebrate his retirement after more than 50 years on television  in our community.   Better known as ``Rod Wood,'' he is a household name in central New  York and a trusted source of news throughout our region. For five  decades, he has been there to deliver the news to families throughout  our community.   Before beginning his career in broadcasting, Rod proudly served in  the U.S. Army with the 504th Military Police Battalion. In 1976, he  worked on NewsChannel 9, and has been a fixture at the station ever  since.   Outside of work, Rod is extremely devoted to his family. He stood in  support of his wife, Nanette, through her 9-year battle with cancer,  and proudly celebrated 52 years of marriage before her passing earlier  this year. Together, Rod and Nanette raised 5 children and were blessed  with 10 grandchildren.   The dean of central New York broadcasting, our community will truly  miss welcoming Rod Wood into our communities and our homes every  evening.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in honoring  Rod Wood for a remarkable 50-year career in journalism. I wish him all  the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
