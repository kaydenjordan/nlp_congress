 Mr. President, during National Adoption Awareness  Month, I have the distinct honor of recognizing Diana Tolstedt of  Billings. For nearly three decades, she has been helping people  navigate all aspects of the adoption process. She has made a positive  and lasting impact in the lives of many Montanans.   Through her work with Lutheran Social Services of Montana, Diana has  gently guided and counseled adoptees, birth parents, and adoptive  families. For a dozen years, she has been a recruiter with Wendy's  Wonderful Kids, leading a program dedicated to finding adoptive  families for the longest waiting children in foster care from eastern  Montana.   Throughout the United States, there are over 100,000 children in  foster care who are waiting for adoption, each needing a loving home  and stable environment to allow them to thrive and reach their  potential. In the midst of this adoption challenge, folks like Diana  are a guiding light to help others traverse adoption obstacles. I would  like to thank Diana for having a heart as big as Yellowstone County and  a commitment to brightening the hopes of children one life at a  time.                            ____________________
