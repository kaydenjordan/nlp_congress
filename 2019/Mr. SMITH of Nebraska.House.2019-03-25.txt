 Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring attention to the  harsh weather and flooding experienced throughout the State of Nebraska  over the past few weeks.   On Wednesday, March 13, a large storm, known as a bomb cyclone, hit  our State of Nebraska and much of the Midwest. It brought with it  blizzard conditions, high wind, and large amounts of rain, followed by  highly destructive flooding, which continues in some areas today.   As I spent the past week touring damage and recovery efforts, one  theme was clear: Nebraskans don't scare from a challenge, nor do they  stand by as their friends and neighbors suffer. Entire communities have  come together to fill sand bags, open shelters, and rescue neighbors in  need. Ranchers across the State have battled to clear pastures, reunify  herds, and reach newborn calves.   I appreciate President Trump moving quickly to approve a Federal  disaster declaration requested by Governor Ricketts and supported by  the entire Nebraska congressional delegation. Governor Ricketts has  estimated the cost of rebuilding infrastructure destroyed by the storm  at more than $400 million, and the Nebraska Farm Bureau estimates the  toll from lost crop and livestock production could top even $1 billion.   The recovery will not be easy, but the hard work and dedication of  Nebraskans across the State will be on full display as we recover,  rebuild, and renew what was lost in these tragic events.                            ____________________
