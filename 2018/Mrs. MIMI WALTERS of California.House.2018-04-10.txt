 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of  my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, in February,  Congressman Paul Mitchell of Michigan and I established the Tax Reform  Truth Tellers series to combat the misinformation being spread about  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Today I had the distinct honor of joining my colleagues from the  great States of California and New York to talk about the benefits this  historic tax reform bill is having on our communities and local  economies.   When it comes to taxes, our two States have something in common: some  of the highest State tax rates in the country.   My district in Orange County, California, is home to great people,  beautiful weather, and a rich history, but it is also located in the  highest taxed State in the Nation.   It is my duty to find ways to help my constituents build and achieve  their American Dream, whether it is opening a small business, sending  their children to college, or saving for retirement. Unfortunately,  high taxes can prevent these dreams from becoming a reality.   While the State legislatures in Sacramento and Albany keep placing  [[Page H3086]]  crushing tax burdens on their residents, congressional Republicans take  action to lower the Federal tax burden on hardworking Americans and job  creators in our districts.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did just that by lowering rates and  restoring the ability of American companies to compete globally.   For too long, our Tax Code was broken. It imposed high tax rates on  families, individuals, and small businesses; it was full of special  interest loopholes; it contained a tax structure that encouraged  companies to ship jobs overseas; and individuals, families, and job  creators spent nearly 9 billion hours each year preparing their taxes,  which cost the economy $400 billion in lost productivity.   Last December, we addressed those issues and fixed our outdated Tax  Code when we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This legislation lowers  rates for nearly every taxpayer, doubles the standard deduction for  individual and joint filers, and maintains popular deductions that will  help working families in cities like Irvine, Mission Viejo, and Tustin.   When the new withholding rates took effect in February, Orange County  residents saw their take-home pay increase. Now, families and  individuals are rightfully keeping more of their hard-earned paychecks.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has also encouraged economic growth and job  creation. Since the tax reform package was signed into law, our economy  has experienced its most robust growth rate since 2005, consumer and  manufacturing confidence are near record highs, and just last month,  the U.S. economy experienced its strongest month of job growth in  nearly 2 years.   Over 500 companies have given their employees new benefits, like pay  raises, bonuses, and increased matching 401(k) contributions. In the  last 3 months, 4 million American workers have received bonuses.   Furthermore, the National Association for Business Economics has  increased its 2018 economic growth projections to nearly 3 percent.  This positive economic news is a direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act.   Mr. Speaker, the results of tax reform are exceeding our  expectations, especially in my district. Some were concerned about the  potential ramifications this bill would have on Orange County, but in  the last few months, our community and local economy has flourished.  Orange County residents are keeping more of their paychecks, allowing  them to spend and invest their own money as they see fit; after all, it  is their money, not the government's.   Local businesses are benefiting, allowing them to create jobs and  provide higher wages for their employees. One example is the Walt  Disney Company, Orange County's largest employer and the place where I  held my first job as a senior in high school. With their savings under  the new Tax Code, Disney gave each of its 125,000 employees a $1,000  cash bonus. Disney also established a new higher education initiative  that will cover tuition costs for hourly employees.   STERIS, a medical device company, has several facilities throughout  the State of California, including one in Tustin. Following the  enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, STERIS gave its employees a  $1,000 bonus. Throughout the country, millions of Americans are  benefiting from tax reform, and STERIS is an example of a company  making those benefits a reality for my constituents in Tustin,  California.   These Orange County companies reflect just a small sampling of the  success the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is having across the Nation.   Today, my colleagues from California and New York will share their  stories from their districts about how their communities and local  economies are thriving due to the new tax law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight), a  United States Army veteran, a member of the House Armed Services  Committee, and a representative of California's 25th District.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao), my friend and a member of the  Committee on Agriculture and the representative of California's 21st  District.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney), a member of the House Financial  Services Committee and the Representative of New York's 22nd District.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Collins), a fellow member of the House  Energy and Commerce Committee and the Representative of the 27th  District of New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Denham), my friend and colleague, and a  member of the House Agriculture and Transportation and Infrastructure  Committees, who represents the 10th District of California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), a fellow Californian and a  member of the House Budget Committee, who represents the Fourth  District of California.    Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of Americans  will see an increase in take-home pay because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act.   Under this new law, a typical middle-income family of four will see  an average tax cut of over $2,000. Those cuts will vary from State to  State. In California, a family of four will see a cut of $2,840, and in  New York, $3,129.   Individuals and families will take this money and put it toward their  retirements, mortgage payments, or college savings.   There are over 400 Chipotle locations in California. In fact,  California has the most Chipotle restaurants in the country. Since the  Tax Cuts and Job Act passed, Chipotle is providing hourly and salaried  workers with bonuses up to $1,000 or a stock grant. The company is also  improving employee benefits and has announced plans to provide  additional paid parental leave. These bonuses and increased benefits  make a big difference in people's lives.   Chipotle also plans to spend $50 million to renovate its stores. This  means opportunities for construction companies and numerous small  subcontractors, which will invigorate local economies, including my  home of Orange County.   Tax reform is spurring the free market economy to provide opportunity  and an increased standard of living for all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, according to a recent survey, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  has significantly improved the economic outlook for small businesses.  The survey recorded historic highs in the small business confidence  index, showing that support for tax reform is growing within the small  business community.   In fact, small businesses have rallied around the new tax policy,  with over half of the country's small-business owners viewing the law  as having a positive effect on their business. Nearly half of small  businesses expect to see immediate tax benefits this year. Small  businesses are the leading job creators in our country and are the  engines of economic growth.   Mr. Speaker, McDonald's is one of the largest employers in  California, with over 1,000 locations. Following the enactment of the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, McDonald's announced plans to contribute $150  million to cover tuition costs, expanding its current Archways to  Opportunity education program.   Nearly 400,000 employees are eligible for benefits that can be used  toward college or trade school. McDonald's now offers $2,500 per year  in tuition benefits for crew members, and $3,000 per year in tuition  benefits for store managers.   Thousands of McDonald's employees will benefit from this enhanced  program, and it is thanks to tax reform that companies like McDonald's  are able to do more to empower their employees.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
