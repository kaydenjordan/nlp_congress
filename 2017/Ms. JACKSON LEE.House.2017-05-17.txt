 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the rule for H.R.  115, ``Thin Blue Line Act of 2017.''   I would like to acknowledge and commend our law enforcement officers  in the room today and across this country who have worked tirelessly on  our behalf.   I know personally the level of stress and challenges posed, because I  have many friends that have and are currently serving my Congressional  district in Houston and our country very well and with great  distinction.   I support our policies that are necessary so long as we are doing so  with fairness, in accordance with our Constitution, and in a manner  that is not duplicative of statutory measures already in place.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 115 imposes the death penalty for the killing or  targeting of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first  responders as a 17th aggravated factor for homicide.   H.R. 115 is duplicative and unnecessary because under 18 U.S.C.  3592(c), there already exists an aggravated factor that achieves the  goal of punishing by death, a defendant who kills a law enforcement  officer, thereby, making.   This bill does nothing to protect our law enforcement; instead, it  raises constitutional questions as to its validity because ``targeting  law enforcement'' is substantially vague language that will subject  many innocent lives to death, based purely on their desire to exercise  their First Amendment rights about the well-documented racial disparity  in treatment throughout our communities.   We must ensure that we do not create legislation of broad scope and  vagueness that will have a chilling effect on an insular group.   H.R. 115 is laced with a discriminatory effect that will trigger  strict scrutiny under the 14th Amendment, and open the gateway for  draconian habeas laws.   This bill will create a slippery slope, further adding to recent  turbulence caused by Attorney General Jeff Session's memo and  destroying whatever trust remains between law enforcement and  communities.   This bill sends troubling messages around the world about how we view  and measure life in America in this 21st century.   It is time to get serious about this epidemic and not hide behind  vague language because `all' lives matter, blue, black, brown, white.   Mr. Speaker, while some may say that any adverse effects of the bill  before us are de minimis, and thus, will not severely impact the racial  disparity found in the use of the death penalty, it is neither the  amount of words in this bill nor the amount of time used to utter them  that is significant; rather, it is the discriminatory effect that will  result in communities disproportionately impacted by the death penalty.   Let us take for example, the case of Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. ___  (2017) where the death penalty verdict was based merely on `whether  defendant is likely to commit acts of violence in the future' and a  psychologist opined that being black did increase the probability. The  trial court reasoned that ``introduction of any mention of race was de  minimis,'' in other words, insignificant.   As Chief Justice John Roberts stated for the Court in reversing the  lower court; ``Some toxins can be deadly in small doses.''   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 115 is extremely deadly because it will undoubtedly  contribute to the continuation of well-documented and pervasive racial  disparities in the imposition of the death penalty.   Since 1976 only 20 white prisoners have been executed for the murder  of an African American victim, while an alarming 286 African American  prisoners have been executed for the death of white victims, and 42% of  African Americans currently remain on death row.   Death penalty generally, has been criticized over the years by legal  scholars and by Supreme Court Justices who have opined in several  instances, that `the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment, which  prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.'   Even in 1958, when the Court first explicitly spoke about the death  penalty as having constitutional challenges, it said in Trop v. Dulles,  ``the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause must draw  its meaning from the `evolving standards of decency that mark the  progress of a maturing society' rather than from its original  meaning.''   Mr. Speaker, there is no argument that we have evolved and matured  significantly since we first implemented the death penalty in the 1600s  and thus, we must evaluate cautiously, laws that seek to further  advance this flawed, astronomically costly and unjust practice.   Capital punishment does not work; it is discriminatory and is used  disproportionately against the poor, minorities and members of racial,  ethnic and religious communities.   Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976,  82% of all executions have occurred in the South (37% in Texas alone),  which contributed to the United States status as one of five countries  in the world to account for the most executions in 2012.   FBI data has shown that the death penalty is not a deterrent and in  fact, 14 states without capital punishment in 2008, had homicide rates  at or below the national rate.   Taking another life does not stop violence.   Like mandatory minimums, public opinion for the death penalty is  currently at its lowest with a 42% opposition, evidenced in a 2016 Pew  Research report, which found that the U.S. now dropped to number seven  worldwide in countries accountable for the most executions.   Mr. Speaker, over two-thirds of the world's countries have abolished  the death penalty either in law or practice, and the U.S. is the only  Western country that still uses the death penalty.   Even family members of murder victims and other individuals who have  witnessed live executions of death row inmates, particularly, in the  recent botched and questionable executions, have called for a repeal of  this practice and ask instead for alternative sentencing.   In fact the death penalty solves nothing, and may even perpetuate the  suffering of the parents, children, or siblings left behind.   We do not need to expand the use of the death penalty where public  opinion is at its lowest, but instead, implement sound and practical  legislation that will save lives of our officers and the people they  serve, where public opinion for this measure is extremely high.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 323 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign       Interference in the 2016 Election. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole  [[Page H4244]]       rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the       bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall,       immediately after the third daily order of business under       clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole       for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 356.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2266,  the ``Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017.''   H.R. 2266, the ``Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017,'' would authorize  four additional permanent bankruptcy judgeships and convert 14  temporary bankruptcy judgeships to permanent status based on the most  recent recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the United States.   H.R. 2266 was introduced on May 1, 2017 by Ranking Member John  Conyers, Jr. (D-MI) together with Chairman Bob Goodlatte and  Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Chair  Tom Marino (R-PA) and Ranking Member David Cicilline (D-RI) as original  cosponsors.   This bipartisan legislation is time-sensitive as the temporary  judgeships are due to expire on May 25, 2017. No hearing has been held  on this legislation.   A bankruptcy judge may hear and determine all cases arising under the  Bankruptcy Code and certain related proceedings. A district court,  however, may withdraw--in whole or in part--any case or proceeding  referred to a bankruptcy judge. If designated by the district to  exercise such authority, a bankruptcy judge may conduct a jury trial on  consent of all the parties.   Currently pending before Congress is H.R. 244, the ``Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2017,'' which extends for one year the temporary  judgeships for the District of Delaware (two judgeships), the Southern  District of Florida (two judgeships); the Eastern District of Michigan;  the District of Puerto Rico; and the Eastern District of Virginia.   In analyzing bankruptcy judgeship needs, the Judicial Conference  employs, as a first step, a case weight formula devised by the Federal  Judicial Center that is intended to provide a more accurate and useful  measure of judicial workload than a mere count of filings does.   Pursuant to Conference policy, ``if a district's annual weighted  caseload per authorized judgeship is 1,500 weighted filings or more,  the district will receive consideration for an additional judgeship.''   With respect to the Conference's current request for additional  bankruptcy judgeships, the weighted case filings have increased by more  than 55 percent for most of these districts since the last time  additional judgeships were authorized in 2005, according to the  Conference.   In addition, all 14 of the temporary bankruptcy judgeships that the  bill converts to permanent status are set to lapse as of May 25, 2017.   To offset the cost of this legislation, H.R. 2266 increases the  quarterly fee payable that chapter 11 debtors pay to the United States  Trustee System Fund, but only with respect to debtors that have  quarterly disbursements in excess of $1 million dollars during the  period when the Fund has less than $200 million.   This provision is substantively identical to a legislative proposal  made by the prior Administration as represented in President Barack  Obama's budget request for 2017.   Taken together, the resulting analysis provides a reliable basis upon  which Congress may assess the necessity of authorizing additional  judgeships and extending temporary judgeships.   For all of these reasons, I support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 419, the  ``Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act of 2017''.   The Public Safety Officers' Benefits program or PSOB Program provides  death, disability, and education benefits to public safety officers and  their survivors.   The PSOB Program is administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance,  or BJA, which is a component of the Department of Justice.   Under the Program, the death benefit is provided to eligible  survivors of public safety officers whose death was a direct and  proximate result of a traumatic injury sustained in the line of duty or  certain work-related heart attacks or strokes.   The Program provides a disability benefit to public safety officers  who have been permanently and totally disabled as the direct and  proximate result of a catastrophic injury sustained in the line of  duty, if that injury permanently prevents the officer from performing  any gainful employment.   The education benefit provides assistance to spouses and children of  public safety officers killed or disabled in the line of duty who  attend an educational program at an eligible education institution.   All too often, these first responders and their families needlessly  suffer months and years of uncertainty after experiencing a loss of  life or a traumatic injury.   This bill is a show of appreciation for the brave men and women who  have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving in the line of duty as  well as an expression of appreciation and support to the families of  these first responders.   S. 419 improves how the Department of Justice processes claims under  the PSOB Program.   The measure authorizes the Bureau of Justice Assistance to establish  rules based on standards for the PSOB Program and it requires the  Bureau of Justice Assistance to give substantial weight to evidence and  facts  [[Page H4251]]  presented by a federal, state, or local agency when determining  eligibility for death or disability benefits.   These two requirements will decrease the time in which claims are  processed, thereby reducing the backlog of families awaiting a decision  on their benefits claim.   S. 419 also increases the level of transparency regarding claims  processed by requiring the Bureau of Justice Assistance to publish and  update information on the status of pending claims.   By requiring that updates on pending benefits claims be posted on  public websites, the public will be able to evaluate the performance of  the Bureau of Justice Assistance in timely processing claims.   As we honor our fallen heroes this week during National Police Week,  I think now is as greater a time as any to ensure that we remove  barriers that hinder their families from obtaining benefits we promised  them when we enacted the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act.   Accordingly, I strongly support S. 419.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 2169. the ``Improving  Fusion Centers Access to Information Act of 2017,'' which would enhance  information sharing in the Department of Homeland Security State, Local  and Regional Fusion Center Initiative.   This bill requires outreach to be conducted to fusion centers in  order to identify gaps in information sharing and consultation with  other Federal agencies to develop methods to address such gaps.   Additionally, it requires the DHS Secretary to coordinate with the  heads of other federal departments and agencies to provide operational  and intelligence advice to fusion centers and support their efforts to  operate efficiently and effectively.   H.R. 2169 requires the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis  (I&A) to ensure fusion centers have access to Homeland Security  information sharing centers and that DHS personnel are deployed to  support fusion centers in a manner consistent with the department's  mission and statutory limits.   Fusion centers provide the means to local, state, and tribal law  enforcement to bring together information from distributed federal and  private sector sources for the purpose of collection, retention,  analysis, and dissemination. The term fusion centers first coined by  the Department of Defense (DOD) refer to the fusing of information for  analysis purposes.   The Houston Regional Intelligence Service Center is a Fusion Center.   The mission of the Houston Regional Intelligence Service Center is to  provide security to the Houston area by gathering, developing and  sharing intelligence regarding the capabilities, intentions, and  actions of terrorist groups and individuals which pose threats.   Houston hosted the 51st Super Bowl earlier this year and the Houston  Regional Intelligence Service Center was on duty for this major  national event.   This year's Super Bowl had:   10,000--volunteers;   140,000--visitors; and   1 million--people who participated in at least one Super Bowl event.   The Super Bowl took place free of incidents, which is a testament to  the collaborative work of federal, state, and local law enforcement  through the Houston Fusion Center.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not only good for our country, but it also  will greatly benefit the citizens of Houston, Texas.  [[Page H4271]]    If local law enforcement is given the proper resources, information,  and intelligence, they will know how to properly handle terrorism  threats.   H.R. 2169 will strengthen our economy while keeping our fellow  citizens safe.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting H.R. 2169  because the safety of citizens from potential threats is critical to  the security of the homeland and strength of our economy.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2281 the  ``Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017.''   As a Senior Member on the House Committee on Homeland Security; and  former Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime  Security, I know well the importance of protecting our nation's  borders.   I thank my colleague Congressman Vela for sponsoring this bipartisan  legislation, which reauthorizes the Border Enforcement Security Task  Force (BEST) program.   An escalation in drug trafficking and transnational criminal activity  along our nation's southern border has led to record levels of violence  and drug trafficking-related homicides.   Despite significant efforts to combat the drug trade, many  governments in the region suffer from overwhelmed criminal justice  systems and law enforcement agencies.   There must be a multi-pronged approach to solving the drug crisis in  the United States, it must include treatment upon demand; education;  increase resources for border interdiction and seizure of illicit drugs  and advanced technology to detect and track those who may be engaged in  illegal activity along the border.   The Border Enforcement Security Task Force is accomplishing the  important law enforcement component of border security.   The Border Enforcement Security Task Force achieves its goal of  border security enhancement by facilitating collaboration among  federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign law enforcement agencies to  execute coordinated activities in furtherance of border security and  homeland security; and enhancing information-sharing, including the  dissemination of homeland security information among such agencies.   The BEST program is currently administered by DHS, and involves  information sharing and law-enforcement operations between personnel  from federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign law-enforcement  agencies to combat criminal activity near the United States borders.   This program has established teams of law enforcement agents from  over 100 law enforcement agencies that form units to investigate  transnational criminal activity.   This approach supports better cooperation and collaboration among  federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies when  investigating criminal activity along the southwest and northern  borders, as well as at the nation's major seaports.   Since their inception, BEST Units have collectively initiated more  than 10,654 cases.   These actions have resulted in more than:   2,718 criminal arrests   7,245 administrative arrests   110,711 pounds of cocaine   5,517 pounds of ecstasy   1,764 pounds of heroin   1,036,749 pounds of marijuana   6,325 pounds of methamphetamine   2,988,561 rounds of ammunition   4,657 vehicles   $130.2 million in U.S. currency   15,062 weapons   This bill instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security to also  consider:   The cross-border threats posed by transnational criminal  organizations;   The Department's homeland and border security strategic priorities;  and   The departmental Joint Task Forces and other multi-agency cross- border operations when establishing new BEST Units.   In addition, this bill would update the Secretary's existing  reporting requirement to provide an assessment of how BEST Units  enhance information-sharing among law enforcement partners, coordinate  with Departmental Joint Task Forces, and advance the Department's  homeland and border security strategic priorities.   This legislation will improve and update the information sharing  practices between our law enforcement agencies so they will operate in  a cohesive manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2281 the BEST  program because it had proven throughout the years to improve our  border security, along with improving how our law enforcement agencies  operate and share vital information.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1677 ``Caesar  Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2017.''   This bill, introduced by my colleague, Foreign Affairs Committee  Ranking Member Eliot Engel, uses sanctions to put pressure on the  Syrian government and anyone supporting it to stop committing war  crimes against humanity.   I support this legislation for its important and necessary purpose to  halt the wholesale slaughter of the Syrian people, encourage a  negotiated political settlement, and hold Syrian human rights abusers  accountable for their crimes.   The Syrian government, empowered with support from Iran and Russia,  has pursued a strategy of targeting civilians to eliminate any  opposition to its rule, including arresting anyone who opposes it.   The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported the deaths of  60,000 people in prisons since the start of the conflict.   The Syrian government is the main aggressor in a conflict that has  resulted in at least 400,000 dead and 14 million Syrians displaced;  between 2011 and 2015, the Syrian Network for Human Rights attributed  96 percent of civilian deaths to the Syrian regime.   Additionally, President Bashar al-Assad has blocked United Nations  humanitarian aid from reaching the intended recipients.   Who is Caesar? Caesar, who uses the pseudonym to remain anonymous as  a way to protect his family, defected from the Syrian military in 2013.   He worked as a crime scene photographer for the Assad government  after joining the military, years before the current conflict began.   As the conflict escalated, so did the number of bodies he would  photograph each day.   Photographing the torture and rising death began to change his  attitude towards the regime and in 2013, with help from the opposition,  he faked his own death and defected from the Syrian military.   When he fled in August 2013, Caesar had collected over 53,000  photographs of detainees who had been tortured and killed.   He handed these photographs over to an anti-government political  group, the Syrian National Movement, who then distributed the  photographs to other groups, including Human Rights Watch (HRW).   With these photographs, HRW ``found evidence of widespread torture,  starvation, beatings, and disease in Syrian government detention  facilities.''   With the conflict in Syria in its fifth year, the U.S. House of  Representatives introduced a bill intended to punish the Assad regime  and its supporters and based it on both Caesar's photographs and his  testimony in front of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs this past  July.   The photographs and testimony show a clear connection between the  reported human rights violations and the Assad government, legitimizing  the bill and giving clear evidence to the international courts if  President Assad stands trial for international war crimes.   H.R. 1677 is intended to sanction both the Syrian regime and any  actors, what the bill refers to as a ``foreign person,'' who support  its human rights violations by imposing sanctions on them.   This support can be in any capacity, such as economic or military  support.   H.R. 1677 is important and necessary as the United States cannot sit  in silence while tens of thousands innocent civilians are slaughtered  by Assad's authoritative regime.   Assad's crimes are not only against humanity but also against  democracy, and I fully support legislation aiming to stop these  atrocities.    Mr. Speaker, I will continue to join my colleagues  in honoring our law enforcement officers across America, particularly  in my home State, and look forward to providing that tribute in days to  come. I thank my colleague, the sheriff, for his work.   I have come to the floor today, however, to again comment on the  appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Russian collusion,  alleged Russian collusion of the President's campaign operatives and  the President as relates to the 2016 election.   Director Mueller is a well respected law enforcement leader. I look  forward to his quick response. But I believe it is important for this  Congress, and I ask Speaker Ryan to ensure, that the committees of  jurisdiction--Oversight and Government Reform, House Judiciary  Committee, and House Intelligence Committee--do their work as well.  That work would include hearings on the issues before us and an  impeachment inquiry to determine the facts.   I believe that we can do this together, Mr. Speaker, not as  Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans. The truth must be found,  and America will be better for it.                            ____________________
