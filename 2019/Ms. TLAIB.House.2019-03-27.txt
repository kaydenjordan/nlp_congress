 Madam Speaker, I grew up in the district I serve where I  have seen firsthand the results of the failing to hold those in power  accountable to the laws of the land. From corporate polluters who  continue to violate the Clean Air Act with no real enforcement to stop  the violations that hurt our public health, I have also seen firsthand  a megabillionaire who directly violated Federal and State processes  that resulted in thousands of trucks to rumble through our local  neighborhoods where one in five children have asthma.   Do you know why those in power looked the other way? Because of  political influence on my colleagues who then became conflicted.   This is why I rise today to put forward H. Res. 257, which creates a  transparent process to ensure the protection of our democracy. That  ensures that we don't have a lawless society that results in  irreparable harm to the American people.   Doing nothing when we are seeing a blatant disregard of the United  States Constitution and our ethical norms is dangerous. No one, Madam  Speaker, including the President of the United States, is above the  law.   I know many have focused on actions that were conducted prior to his  taking the oath of office, and that is important. However, as  critically important are the actions by the President after he swore to  uphold the United States Constitution before all of us.   He is not a CEO, Madam Speaker, anymore, but a public servant who is  held accountable not to shareholders and investors, but the actual  American people, real people, people who expect all of us to follow the  laws.   In the 2 years since he took office, President Trump racked up more  than 1,400 conflicts of interest involving the government, those trying  to influence it and The Trump Organization, according to a report  released by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.   President Trump used the Presidency to enrich himself by repeatedly  promoting his businesses as extensions of his administration. Political  allies, wealthy donors, special interests, and foreign governments have  adopted a key tactic of patronizing Trump's businesses to garner favor  with the Trump administration.   Here are some of the key findings from CREW's tracking of Trump's  conflicts of interest:   President Trump made 118 visits to his properties in his second year  in office, bringing his 2-year total to 281 visits to properties he  still profits from while serving as President of the United States.   In his second year in office, President Trump and other White House  staff promoted Trump businesses on at least 87 occasions. More than 150  political committees, including campaigns and party committees, have  spent nearly $5 million at Trump businesses since he became President.  At least 13 special interest groups lobbied the White House since  Trump's inauguration, some for the first time, around the same time  they also patronized a Trump property.   At least three foreign governments held events at Trump properties  during Trump's second year in office. Two of those countries did so  after holding similar events elsewhere in previous years.   Not only has President Trump still refused to divest from his  businesses, he seems to have doubled down by reinforcing the idea that  The Trump Organization is an extension of the Trump administration.   These offenses must be investigated.   In total, CREW found more than 900 conflicts in the second year of  the Trump administration. This presents a clear picture of a Presidency  used to turn a profit and the President's businesses serving at points  of access to the corridors of power.   This report shows that special interests, foreign governments, and  political allies continue to pour money into Trump's bank accounts  while the American public is left in the dark about whether or not the  President's policy decisions are made in the best interests of our  country, or is it in the best interests of the President's bottom line,  benefiting himself personally.   We have been sent here to legislate. I am thinking about the historic  For the People Act we passed right here in this Chamber, the gun reform  package we passed, legislation to protect our lands, to increase and  strengthen healthcare for Americans, and much more.   I am proud of my first bills. One protects our public health in  regards to petroleum coke exposure, and the other, which has a wide  range of support, would prohibit the use of credit scores by the auto  insurance industry.   However, Madam Speaker, none of these bills is free from the harm  that comes from the current administration and the President of the  United States not complying with the clauses of the United States  Constitution. When these conflicts and direct violations to the  Emoluments Clause are not investigated, we set a dangerous precedent  that those issues we passed in this Chamber are not important.   I think about the recent announcement that T-Mobile and Sprint would  like the Federal Government to approve a merger between the two  companies. In the same breath, T-Mobile spent close to $200,000 at the  D.C. Trump hotel. This is what we call an upgraded version of pay to  play, and it dangerously corrupts our democracy.   When President Truman sidestepped the Constitution and went to war,  every sitting President had done the same. One of the first major  challenges to the War Powers Act came in 1981 when President Reagan  deployed military personnel to El Salvador without consulting or  submitting a report to Congress.   In 1999, President Clinton continued a bombing campaign in Kosovo  beyond  [[Page H2880]]  the 60-day limit cited in the law. A more recent War Powers Act dispute  arose in 2011 when President Barack Obama initiated a military action  in Libya without congressional authorization.   You see, Madam Speaker, when we do nothing, we set a precedent and  allow it to become the norm. I can't stress enough how dangerous this  is to the core of our democracy.   This will not be the last billionaire CEO who runs for President who  will attempt to not divest from his business interests.   Now, what we have witnessed from this administration are acts that  could very well be impeachable offenses outside of the scope of the  Mueller investigation. We have a duty in this Chamber to inquire about  these acts, to investigate them, to find out if there was any  wrongdoing, and to seek accountability if it has been found.   That is why, today, I have introduced a resolution that calls on the  Judiciary Committee to inquire into these activities that may be  impeachable offenses. There are serious pieces of evidence out there,  many that have come through the various committees of this body, in the  media, and things within the public eye. An investigation will take a  look at all of those things with the question: Are these impeachable  offenses? Is our President acting above the rule of law?   As Congress, we have a job to ensure that is exactly what is not  happening. If, at the end, it gets the President to comply, then we  have done our job. If the President doesn't, then we move forward and,  at the very least, put any future President on notice: Congress will  hold you accountable and will require you to divest in your businesses.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 34 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, March 28, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
