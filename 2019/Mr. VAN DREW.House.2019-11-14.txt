 Mr. Speaker, today I want to acknowledge the Salem  Medical Center, as they recently celebrated 100 years of service to the  south Jersey community.   The medical center has been a staple of the area since its creation  and has evolved over time to meet the changing needs of Salem County.   Salem Medical Center offers cutting-edge hospital services and a wide  array of outpatient programs to ensure the people of south Jersey have  access to the healthcare they need. The center has also been expanding  in recent years, thus providing patients with more advanced technology  and higher quality care.   I want to thank the Salem Medical Center for their reliable service  to south Jersey for the past 100 years and hope they continue to  flourish in Salem County for 100 more. Their nurses, their doctors,  their technicians, all of their employees are our heroes. May God bless  them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
