 Madam Speaker, right now, 12,643 Pennsylvanians are being  denied a paycheck because of a partisan fight they have no control  over. It is time to end this shutdown and restore our government's  ability to protect our country and deliver vital services to our  people.   The longer this shutdown goes on, the worse the impact will be, not  just on Federal workers, but on the communities that depend on them.  Unless we act, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP,  will be at risk. Over 94,000 families in my district depend on SNAP,  and national data shows that over 40 percent of beneficiaries are  children.   I have heard from food banks in my community that they expect a  twelvefold increase in people who need assistance if SNAP recipients  don't receive their benefits. That is unacceptable.   We must reaffirm our most fundamental duty: to stand with and support  our most vulnerable constituents. Let's act to protect people across  this country from hunger and malnutrition by protecting SNAP and  reopening the government.                            ____________________
