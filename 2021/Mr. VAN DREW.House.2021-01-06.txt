 Madam Speaker, before I start, something I didn't plan  on saying. This is a debate. It is a discussion. Everybody has a right  to an opinion. That is American. Because someone doesn't agree with  your view or your ideas does not mean that they are liars. It means  they have a different view, a different opinion.   And I think, for God's sake, as people watch this or see it or hear  it, they expect more from us than that. We can disagree at a certain  level. There is nothing worse than moral pomposity.   You know, today was an amazing and terrible day. But one thing that  we do know is that our law enforcement protected lives, and they  protected and preserved our democracy. I watched firsthand, as I always  have, just as I do back home in south Jersey, these brave men and women  put their lives on the line to defend all of us.   May God bless the woman who lost her life today, and may God bless  what will always be the greatest Nation in the history of the world:  the United States of America.   At the core of our country's greatness is our democratic system of  government. Without faith in the integrity of our elections, Americans  will not have faith in our democracy.   The United States of America is the international embodiment of  freedom and opportunity, the shining city on a hill. Free and fair  elections have always been a hallmark of America's greatness.   After this past Presidential election, approximately 60 million  Americans have serious doubts about the outcome. That is a number that  we cannot ignore.                                time  0150
