 Madam Speaker, as America opens up and we go over  100,000 deaths attributed to the COVID, it is important that we look at  all our options to reduce the number of deaths related to this disease.   I feel the government is leaving too much to the pharmaceutical  industry to develop a vaccine. Well, the answer may be a more natural  one and one that is a lot cheaper for the American public.   Madam Speaker, I strongly believe that we should be looking more at  the benefits of vitamin D. Vitamin D is from the Sun. It is free. I  encourage people to ignore the politicians who say you have to spend  all day indoors, but get out and grab the Sun.   We have been told since we were children that you get vitamin D from  the Sun, and that is the way you stay healthy. If you can't grab the  rays, grab some vitamin D pills. That is another way to get your  vitamin D.   It is not just me saying it. I encourage folks back home to Google  ``Northwestern University vitamin D,'' or ``Trinity College in Dublin,  Ireland, vitamin D,'' and you will see there are a lot of experts  outside of the CDC who are already pushing it.   Madam Speaker, I encourage people to use that method to keep the  number of deaths from COVID down.                            ____________________
