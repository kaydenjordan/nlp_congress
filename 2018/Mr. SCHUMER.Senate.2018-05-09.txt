 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Thank you, Mr. President.   First, I want to spend a moment in recognition of Teacher  Appreciation Week. I am sure everyone here remembers a teacher who  inspired them, challenged them, and propelled them to greater heights.  I will never forget Mrs. Roberts, the Cunningham Junior High School  teacher who opened my eyes up to science; Mrs. Riley, who inspired a  love of literature; and I will never forget Mrs. Wagman, who kindled my  interests in government and politics, an interest that never died.   That is what great teachers do. They open doors previously thought  closed. They work day and night to give every one of us the opportunity  to succeed. What a noble calling.   In my view, teaching in the 21st century should be the same kind of  exalted profession as law or medicine was in the 20th century. It is  such an important job, in terms of our future, our economy--competing  with China. The education of our young people is No. 1. Often around  here we forget that, and in many of the States they have forgotten it.   Teachers enjoy their jobs. They make huge financial sacrifices. Many  of them could make much more money in another profession. So I think we  should appreciate teachers, not only in thanking them--I thanked three  who changed my life, and there are many more--but we should thank them  by rewarding them financially because it is such an important  profession.                            ____________________     Mr. President, secondly, I would like to address the  news this morning that Secretary of State Pompeo will be returning from  North Korea with the three Americans who were held there against their  will. We are all glad to see them returning home. Their families are  delighted. We are all delighted.   Let's not forget, this is not some great give on North Korea's part.  We cannot forget that no regime has the right to hold American citizens  in captivity without cause. Under no circumstances should American  citizens be viewed as bargaining chips by foreign capitals. I hope  President Trump and Secretary Pompeo are clear about that because the  same goes for other countries wrongly detaining Americans--Iran, China.  If countries in the world think they can detain Americans and get  something in return, we will see many more hostages.   So we are all rooting for the diplomacy with North Korea to succeed  and, in that respect, I urge the Trump administration to work with our  allies with a coordinated and considered strategy to see if we can  denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, but the hostages shouldn't be part  of it. We are happy they have returned, but North Korea shouldn't gain  by taking Americans and then releasing them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in a few hours, the Senate will vote to  proceed to the nomination of Michael Brennan to the Seventh Circuit  Court of Appeals.   Mr. Brennan has not received a blue slip--that is a notice of  approval that has been a tradition in the Senate--from one of his home  State Senators, Ms. Baldwin. So the vote today will be a slap in the  face to the custom of senatorial courtesy. It will be a slap in the  face to the bipartisanship we hear so many on the other side of the  aisle and so many more Americans talk about. It is blatant disrespect  to every Senator who wants to withhold his or her judgment on a judge,  a tradition that has been respected by Democrats and Republicans until  Leader McConnell abruptly changed this earlier this year for circuit  court judges.   What makes this even more galling is the history of this vacancy on  the Seventh Circuit. Mr. Brennan will fill the seat that had been held  open by Wisconsin's other Senator for 6 years during the Obama  administration. Well, how was Senator Johnson able to withhold? He  didn't return his blue slip, and Senator Leahy, the Democratic chair,  respected it. The same should prove true for Senator Baldwin. She  should get the same respect from Senator McConnell and Chairman  Grassley that Senator Johnson got for this same seat from then-Leader  Reid and Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, but,  no, our Republican colleagues keep changing the rules.  [[Page S2559]]    Senator Johnson's right to refuse a judge from his home State, which,  as I said, was respected by then-Chairman Leahy, was defended publicly  in an op-ed by--guess who--Mr. Brennan himself. He wrote an op-ed--he  was not a nominee for judge then--saying Johnson's right to hold the  seat open should be respected. Now he is on the floor with the blue  slip being ignored for the first time since I have been here, since  1998.   How is Senator Baldwin's right to consult on judges for her State any  less important than Senator Johnson's? It is mind-bending hypocrisy, it  is an appalling double standard, and it is another erosion of minority  rights and the tradition of comity that I know so many of my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle wish played a greater role in the Senate.   Furthermore, as Senator Baldwin has talked about, they have always  had a bipartisan commission recommending judges in Wisconsin. There  were several nominees who got through that bipartisan commission,  needing both Democratic and Republican support to get through that  commission. As I understand it, they were ignored by the White House,  and Mr. Brennan, a hard-right nominee--I am not sure if he didn't pass  the committee or wouldn't have passed the bipartisan committee of  Wisconsin--is here on the floor. This is the second time we are going  to be voting on a judge who didn't receive both blue slips. There will  be another hearing today in the Judiciary Committee on Ryan Bounds for  the Ninth Circuit in Oregon, even though he didn't receive a blue slip  from Senator Wyden or Senator Merkley.    I would admonish my friends on the other side of the aisle that this  is a very dangerous road you are treading. As everyone knows, the winds  of political change blow swiftly in America. The minority one day is  the majority the next. There will come a day when the shoe will be on  the other foot once again, and I don't think my friends will be too  happy if they are not afforded the courtesy of consulting on home State  judges.   I like the tradition of bipartisanship when it comes to judges. I  argued privately with Leader Reid that we shouldn't remove the 60  votes. I was successful on the Supreme Court--he didn't include that-- but not on district court and circuit court judges. So in a tit for  tat--I understand that--Leader McConnell said that we are doing it for  the Supreme Court too. But the blue slips are a whole new world.   I have always had three standards for the judges I participate in  choosing for New York. Excellence--they should be legally excellent,  not political actors. Diversity--I like diversity on the bench when we  can get it. We always try, and we have had a lot of success in New  York. But I also like moderation. I don't like judges to the far  right--that is obvious--but I also don't like judges to the far left  because judges who are ideologues tend to believe they can make law  rather than interpret law.   Week by week, month by month, year by year, the bounds--both sides of  the aisle are somewhat to blame, but this blue slip goes way beyond-- and the tradition of bipartisanship that have kept judges more in the  center, that have kept judges who tend to interpret the law rather than  make it have evaporated. Once the blue slips are gone, that is the last  vestige. There will be little incentive for the majority to consult the  minority on judicial nominations. That is objectively not a good thing.  We want judges who are qualified, evenhanded, not partisan instruments.  A Senate that acts only as a rubberstamp for the President's nominees  is not doing its job, and we may as well not advise and consent if the  party in power, even by one vote as it is here today, just rubberstamps  every one of the President's judges.   So I urge my Republican friends to consider the larger implications  of the vote on Michael Brennan--the seat that was vacant for 6 years in  response to the blue slip. By the way, Leader McConnell and Chairman  Grassley signed a letter with Leader Reid--then-Majority Leader Reid-- not to get rid of the blue slip, which he listened to. So if you want  to talk about tit for tat, this one doesn't belong. Reid kept the blue  slip, even though lots of vacancies stayed for a lot longer than a  year. McConnell is getting rid of it for circuit court judges, and it  is a move away from an impartial, nonpolitical judiciary.   Every Senator, if he or she were facing what Senator Baldwin is  facing today, would want this body to defend their rights. I would urge  at least one or two of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle not  to vote in lockstep and for the sake of the Senate, for the sake of the  country, to vote no on Brennan, whether you agree with his views or  not, as a protest to the way this has happened.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, there is one final topic--net  neutrality. Later today, Democrats will take the Senate another step  toward the consideration of a resolution to restore net neutrality.  When the Republican-led FCC voted to repeal net neutrality in December,  they handed the large internet service providers all the cards. They  said: Do what you will with the internet. Charge consumers more for  faster service if you like or segment the internet into packages  forcing the average family to purchase faster times for their favorite  websites. Let big corporations purchase faster internet service while  startups, small businesses, and consumers are left in the dust. Public  schools, rural Americans, communities of color, or anyone in a remote  area or without substantial resources could be at a significant  disadvantage if the ISPs start charging more for decent internet.   People say: Well, let a private company do whatever it wants. Let  them charge whatever they want. But in certain goods, which are  essential, we don't do that--utilities, highways. The same thing now  applies to the internet. It is a necessity, and we have to have  protections for average folks, for small businesses, for working  families. That is why Democrats are so concerned about net neutrality  and why we are trying to restore it. We believe that the internet  should be kept free and open like our highways--accessible and  affordable to every American, regardless of the ability to pay. It is  not that you don't pay; it is that if you are a little guy or gal, you  shouldn't pay a lot more than the big shots. We don't do that on  highways, we don't do that with utilities, and we shouldn't do it on  the internet, which is another modern, 21st-century highway that is a  necessity.   Every Democrat supports our net neutrality CRA, as well as one  Republican, Senator Collins. Unlike most legislation, Democrats can  force a vote on the floor of the Senate on our proposal. Today, Senator  Markey will take the first step in that process. He is going to  discharge the CRA from the Commerce Committee to the Senate calendar.  That means we will have a vote on the ability to preserve net  neutrality and help the little guy pay for services on the internet,  and that will make that vote available next week. So I urge average  Americans--young people, old people, everyone in between--and small  businesses to email, call, write, visit your Senator on the Republican  side, and urge them to preserve net neutrality. It is only right, it is  only fair, and it makes economic sense.   No matter what, my friends on the other side are going to have to put  themselves on the record on this issue. Whose side are you on--the big  internet and cable providers or the average consumer who depends on the  internet? This vote can be summed up in one phrase: Whose side are you  on? I urge all Americans--particularly younger Americans who get this  better than my generation because they have lived with the internet  their whole life--to contact their Senators this week and next week  before the vote and demand that their Senator restore net neutrality.   Americans, please contact your Senators. Your wallet and well-being,  in ways far more significant than most things we do here, depend on it.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
