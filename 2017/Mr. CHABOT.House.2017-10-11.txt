Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation introduced by Chairman  Knight and Ranking Member Murphy of the Committee on Small Business'  Subcommittee on Contracting and Workforce aims to modernize and improve  the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology  Transfer, or SBIR and STTR, programs.   The SBIR and STTR programs have helped thousands of small businesses  create new technologies, commercialize their ideas, and generate new  jobs. While creating these benefits in the private sector, the programs  offer, in a cost-effective manner, ways for Federal agencies to solve  operational problems. H.R. 2763 strengthens these two programs in quite  a few ways.   First, the bill emphasizes agency accountability by creating several  firm reporting deadlines for covered agencies and for the SBA to  provide future Congresses with improved information that will lead to a  better understanding of the programs' strengths and weaknesses.   Second, the legislation clarifies the congressional intent of the  2011 reauthorization to ensure that taxpayers reap the benefits of the  SBIR and STTR programs by binding the technologies developed in the  programs to long-term projects at the Department of Defense.   Third, the legislation extends a popular pilot program included in  the 2011 reauthorization that would allow all participating Federal  agencies to award a phase II contract immediately if the agency finds  that the small business concern has already completed work typically  done during phase I.   Fourth, it makes permanent the option for all participating agencies  to  [[Page H7943]]  establish commercialization readiness programs, or CRPs. As a pilot  program from the 2011 reauthorization, these CRPs have been shown to  provide much-needed support to small companies nearing the completion  of the process and have helped advance technology to the  commercialization phase.   Fifth, it extends, through 2022, the provision that allows  participating agencies to utilize 3 percent of their allocation for  administrative functions, conduct outreach in an effort to bring more  companies into the SBIR and STTR programs, and increase deterrents to  waste, fraud, and abuse.   I want to thank Congressman Knight and Congresswoman Murphy for the  bipartisan work on this important legislation. I would also like to  thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson of the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology, as well as Chairwoman Comstock and  Ranking Member Lipinski of the Subcommittee on Research and Technology,  for working together with us to produce this bipartisan bill that we  have before us this afternoon.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Knight), who is the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Contracting and Workforce on the Small Business  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank all those who spoke on this  legislation, a very bipartisan, good legislation, here this afternoon  on the House floor.   In closing, whether it is new software system for tracking contract  payments or a new medical device to help with cancer treatments, or a  new piece of technology that literally saves lives on the battlefield,  the SBIR and STTR programs have consistently delivered results to  Federal agencies. They are worthy programs that do what they are  supposed to do, but we can always do better. This legislation improves  and modernizes these programs, and I ask that all of my colleagues  support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
