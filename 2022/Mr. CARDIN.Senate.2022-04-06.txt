 Madam President, I rise today in strong support of Judge  Jackson to be the 116th Justice of the Supreme Court of the United  States.   As a Senator, one of the most important responsibilities I have under  the Constitution is whether to provide my consent to a President's  nomination to the Supreme Court, the highest Court in our land.   The Framers carefully designed our Constitution using an intricate  system of checks and balances. The Framers designed the third branch of  government, the judiciary, to be an independent branch from the  political branches of government: the legislature and the executive  branch.   Judges were given the unusual protection--unlike Congress and the  President--to have lifetime tenure and to hold their offices during  good behavior. Judges, therefore, do not have to fear retribution or  loss of their office or diminution of their paycheck if they make an  unpopular decision.   So while the Supreme Court must show a healthy respect for the other  coequal branches of government, it must, at the same time, preserve its  own independence and ultimately interpret the laws and Constitution of  the United States. A critical part of the Supreme Court's role is to  preserve and protect the Constitution and to make sure that all  Americans are treated equally under the law.   The marble entrance of the Supreme Court has etched above it the  promise of equal justice under the law for all persons who enter. The  Supreme Court must vigorously uphold the civil rights and civil  liberties of all Americans and pay special attention to safeguarding  and enforcing the constitutional rights  [[Page S2001]]  guaranteed in our system of government.   As we know from our history, the Supreme Court has not always  protected all Americans and, indeed, in the past has treated some  Americans as less equal than others, simply due to their race,  religion, or gender, among other factors. So let us remember the  preamble to the Constitution, which declares that ``We the People of  the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish  Justice''--it is certainly not a perfect union, but I do believe in the  words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that ``the arc of the moral  universe is long, but it bends toward justice.''   Americans know that the Supreme Court makes profound decisions every  day that impact the lives of people across this country. The Supreme  Court regularly tackles so many of the controversial issues of the day  that involve issues such as voting rights, criminal justice, labor law  rights, environmental protection, and many, many more.   Turning now specifically to Judge Jackson's nomination, she would  replace Justice Stephen Breyer on the Court, who, fittingly, she had  clerked for after graduating from law school. Judge Jackson has an  extremely impressive background and legal credentials and now sits as a  judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit, often called the Nation's second highest court.   The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal  Judiciary gave Judge Jackson a unanimously ``Well Qualified'' rating  for the Supreme Court, which is its highest rating. The committee notes  that to receive this highest rating:         A Supreme Court nominee must be a preeminent member of the       legal profession, have outstanding legal ability and       exceptional breadth of experience, and meet the very highest       standards of integrity, professional competence and judicial       temperament.    Judge Jackson passed all these tests with flying colors during her  Senate confirmation process.   I had the privilege of chairing Judge Jackson's first Senate  confirmation hearing in 2009, when President Obama nominated her to  serve on the U.S. Sentencing Commission. I then had the opportunity to  visit with Judge Jackson earlier this month, prior to her confirmation  hearing. It was a real pleasure to speak with her. I am familiar with  her background and many of her rulings. She is also a former Maryland  resident. We had much to talk about, as she had many connections to my  State.    Her brother served both as an infantryman and officer in the Maryland  Army National Guard, during which he was twice deployed overseas; and  he also served as an undercover narcotics recovery officer in the  Baltimore City Police Department.   Judge Jackson is eminently qualified. In our meeting, we talked about  her personal experience and her commitment to equal justice under the  law, especially for those who have had difficulty accessing our legal  system. She discussed her work as a public defender and providing  defense free of charge to the most vulnerable members of our society.  In this work, Judge Jackson carried out the mandate of the Sixth  Amendment of the Constitution, which provides that:         In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the       right to a speedy and public trial . . . and to have the       Assistance of Counsel for his defence.    She talked about her outreach to our next generation, in terms of  talking to students in high school and college, as well as our next  generation of lawyers in law school. I am often reminded of the words  of my dear friend, the late Congressman Elijah Cummings of Baltimore,  that ``our children are the living messages we send to a future we will  never see.''   I do think Judge Jackson is having an important and ongoing  conversation about democracy with our students. I frankly think she  will be a powerful role model for so many who will follow in her  footsteps--in particular, women and women of color who see Judge  Jackson break yet another barrier and glass ceiling at the Supreme  Court. These students can believe that, yes, they belong even in the  highest Court in the land and the most elite corridors of power in our  Nation's Capital.   We discussed the importance of an independent judicial branch of  government and protecting the rights of individuals against powerful  special interests that would abuse their power. I was impressed with  Judge Jackson throughout our conversation.   Judge Jackson exemplifies the American story and experience. Her  parents were public schoolteachers, and Judge Jackson said she was  inspired to go into law by watching her father study when he was in law  school. Raised in Miami, FL, she attended Florida public schools. She  then went on to earn her BA magna cum laude from Harvard University  and, later, her JD cum laude from Harvard Law School.   She went on to clerk for three different Federal judges: Judge Patti  Saris in the District of Massachusetts, Judge Bruce Selya of the First  Circuit Court of Appeals, and then Justice Stephen Breyer on the  Supreme Court of the United States.   After working in private practice, she joined the U.S. Sentencing  Commission as an assistant special counsel before serving as an  assistant Federal public defender in Washington. Judge Jackson then  returned to private practice again before being nominated in 2009 by  President Obama to serve as a commissioner and, later, vice chair of  the U.S. Sentencing Commission.   As I noted earlier, I had the privilege to chair this confirmation  hearing for Judge Jackson, after which she was unanimously confirmed by  voice vote in the Senate in 2010. In this role, I noted that Judge  Jackson often worked to find common ground with her fellow  commissioners, who brought very different backgrounds and perspectives  to the Commission. In particular, Judge Jackson made significant  strides to make our criminal justice system and sentencing policy more  fair and just.   For example, she worked on a bipartisan basis to effectively  implement the Fair Sentencing Act, which addressed the 100-to-1  disparity in the law regarding crack cocaine and powder cocaine, which  had led to disproportionate and discriminatory treatment of minorities  in our criminal justice system.   I am hopeful that Judge Jackson can use these same skills of finding  common ground with individuals from different backgrounds and build a  consensus as a Justice on the Supreme Court.   In 2013, President Obama nominated Judge Jackson to serve as the U.S.  district judge for the District of Columbia, and again, the Senate  unanimously confirmed her nomination by voice vote. As a district court  judge, Judge Jackson wrote more than 500 opinions and considered a wide  array of issues that would come before the Supreme Court. She has a  real breadth of experience here, including cases involving  constitutional, civil rights, and national security issues;  administrative issues involving Federal Agencies; environmental issues;  criminal law and procedure issues; and matters involving government  transparency.   On the bench, her record clearly demonstrates that Judge Jackson  impartially applies the law and precedent to the facts in a fair and  impartial manner, regardless of her own personal views on the subject.  Judge Jackson took special care to make sure the parties before her  understood her approach to deciding cases, and she issued clearly  reasoned decisions.   As Judge Jackson said in her confirmation hearing for the district  court circuit, When I worked with clients as a defender, ``[m]ost of my  clients didn't really understand what had happened to them. [N]o one  really explained to them what they were supposed to expect, so they did  not know where things might have gone wrong.''    Therefore, as a judge, Judge Jackson said that she will ``take extra  time to communicate with'' the parties. ``I speak to them directly and  not just to their lawyers. I use their names. I explain every stage of  the proceeding because I want them to know what is going on.''   In reviewing her record, I notice that Judge Jackson's analysis and  decision making have led her to rule both for and against the  government in different cases, both for and against employers and  workers, for and against criminal defendants and prosecutors, based on  the merits of the case and her application of the law to the facts of  that particular case.   In her confirmation hearing and written answers to questions for the  record,  [[Page S2002]]  Judge Jackson pledged to support and defend the Constitution and  further pledged to rule without fear or favor or prejudice or passion,  consistent with her judicial oath. She indicated she understood the  limits of the judicial role and the importance of adhering to  precedents of the Court.   Just last year, President Biden elevated Judge Jackson to the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Senate  confirmed Judge Jackson to this position by a bipartisan vote of 53  voting in favor in an evenly divided Senate.   In that confirmation hearing, Judge Jackson again stressed the  importance of courts having ``a duty of independence from political  pressure, meaning that judges must resolve cases and controversies in a  manner that is consistent with what the law requires, despite the  judge's own personal views of the matter, and this is so even with  respect to cases and controversies that pertain to controversial  political issues.'' She is committed to carrying out her oath as a  judge.   She particularly noted that she did not pay attention to who was in  the administration when ruling on cases, which is consistent with her  case record, ruling both for and against the Trump administration in  different cases.   Judge Jackson did a superb job during the recent confirmation  hearings, as our Presiding Officer knows, and consistently impressed me  with her talents. Not only was she eminently qualified--we already knew  about her outstanding qualifications; not only was she in command of  all the legal subjects--we knew that she would excel in discussing the  law and her job as a judge; but her demeanor in the face of repeated  and often outrageous assaults by Republican Members of the Senate truly  set her apart. She maintained her judicial temperament throughout this  week's hearing and showed why she will be a major factor on the Supreme  Court. Judge Jackson's confirmation hearing reinforced to me how  critical it will be to have her on the Supreme Court.   Members of the committee unsuccessfully tried to distort Judge  Jackson's sentencing record. The record clearly rebuts these charges,  as Judge Jackson's sentences are well within the judicial mainstream,  and Judge Jackson often followed the recommendations made by the  probation office.   The ABA Standing Committee debunked several of these myths when they  analyzed Judge Jackson's record as part of their review process before  her confirmation hearing.   The ABA testified at the hearing:         We did speak to various prosecutors and defense counsels       for Judge Jackson. . . . None of them felt that she       demonstrated bias in any way. . . . One prosecutor said, ``I       did not observe any bias, and the Judge was fair to all sides       in connection with sentencing in all aspects.'' . . . We       asked pointed questions as it related to bias--whether it be       to defendants, whether it be to the government, and we found       no bias.    That was the ABA.   In terms of the allegations that Judge Jackson is ``soft on crime,''  the ABA testified:         We heard consistently, from not only defense counsel but       prosecutors, how unbiased Judge Jackson is. We heard phrases       like ``doing things by the books.'' For example, one       prosecutor described the sentencing hearing involving a very       high profile, sensitive national security matter. What she       said was, it was classic Judge Jackson. . . . What really       impressed this prosecutor was that after oral argument, Judge       Jackson took a recess, went back to [her] chambers, and when       she resumed the bench, came out with a sentence that was more       in favor of the government. What more impressed the       prosecutor was that the Judge's ruling included arguments       that had been made both by the defense and [the] prosecutors       during oral arguments. It is not as if she came into the       hearing with her mind made up. She listened to what counsel       on both sides said and came up with a sentence that the       prosecution was quite happy with.    Several prominent law enforcement organizations support Judge  Jackson's nomination.   The Fraternal Order of Police wrote:         From our analysis of Judge Jackson's record and some of her       cases, we believe she has considered the facts and applied       the law consistently and fairly on a range of issues. There       is little doubt that she has the temperament, intellect,       legal experience, and family background to have earned this       appointment. We are reassured that, should she be confirmed,       she would approach her future cases with an open mind and       treat issues related to law enforcement fairly and justly.    The International Association of Chiefs of Police supports Judge  Jackson's nomination. They wrote:         [W]hen the IACP chooses to support an individual, we do not       take it lightly, and [we] take into careful consideration       their background, experience, and previous opinions issued as       they relate to law enforcement and criminal justice issues. .       . . During her time as a judge, she has displayed her       dedication to ensuring that our communities are safe and that       the interests of justice are served. We believe that Judge       Jackson's years of experience have shown she has the       temperament and qualifications to serve as the next Associate       Justice on the Supreme Court.    That was the International Association of Chiefs of Police.   Judge Jackson has an unusually broad range of support from law  enforcement groups, crime victims and survivors, business associations,  and civil rights groups.   Former DC Circuit Judge Thomas Griffith introduced Judge Jackson at  her confirmation hearing. Judge Griffith, a President George W. Bush  appointee, vouched for Judge Jackson's ``careful approach,  extraordinary judicial understanding, and collegial manner. . . . Judge  Jackson has a demonstrated record of excellence, and I believe, based  upon her work as a trial judge when I served on the Court of Appeals,  that she will adjudicate based on the facts and the law and not [in a]  partisan [manner].   Former Fourth Circuit Judge Michael Luttig, a President George H. W.  Bush appointee who recently advised Vice President Pence, offered a  similar endorsement when he wrote that she is ``eminently qualified to  serve on the Supreme Court'' and is ``as highly credentialed and  experienced in the law as any nominee in [recent] history.''   Her colleagues have given her the highest ratings. Those who know her  best, those who have worked with her, give us all great confidence in  her qualifications and ability to serve on the Supreme Court.   A group of conservative lawyers--many of whom served in previous  Republican administrations--wrote in strong support of Judge Jackson  and said:         While some of us might differ concerning particular       positions she has taken as a judge, we are united in our view       that she is exceptionally well-qualified, given her breadth       of experience, demonstrated ability, and personal attributes       of intellect and character. Indeed, we think that her       confirmation on a consensus basis would strengthen the Court       and the nation in important ways.    It is long past time for the Supreme Court to seat a highly  qualified, Black, female attorney as a member. As we strive to provide  equal justice under the law to all Americans, she would be only the  sixth woman out of 116 Justices to serve on the Supreme Court and only  the second woman of color and the first Black woman. A Justice Jackson  will bring sorely needed diversity to the Supreme Court, both  demographically and professionally.   The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights noted:         This professional diversity is another critical step in       ensuring our courts look more like America. Judge Jackson       will be the first justice with any significant criminal       defense experience since the retirement of Justice Thurgood       Marshall in 1991, and she would be the only Supreme Court       justice to have served as a public defender. Public defenders       play a [critical] role in our legal system, yet they are       vastly underrepresented on the federal bench. At all levels       of our judiciary, there are nearly six times as many former       prosecutors on the federal bench than former criminal defense       lawyers, and just over 5 percent of federal appellate judges       have experience as a public defender. . . . Our highest court       should reflect the diversity of the legal profession, and       Judge Jackson's meaningful experience is greatly needed on       our Supreme Court.    I believe that Judge Jackson will faithfully uphold her judicial  oath, which contains a special provision whereby judges promise to  ``administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to  the poor and the rich.'' I believe she respects the separation of  powers and checks and balances in our system and that she is committed  to uphold the civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans.   I will proudly vote to confirm Judge Jackson so she will become  Justice Jackson.   I yield the floor.
