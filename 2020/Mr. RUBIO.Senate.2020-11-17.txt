 Madam President, today, I honor the life and legacy  of Scott Irving Peek, Sr., who passed away on November 10, 2020 at the  age of 94. Known to many as Scotty, he was raised in Jacksonville, FL,  with a strong work ethic that carried him through a storied life and  career. After high school, Scotty served in the U.S. Merchant Marines  during World War II. He then went to the University of Florida on a  track scholarship in 1945; however, his service to our Nation took  precedence, and he served in the U.S. Army from 1946 through 1948. He  then returned to UF, where he played both football and track and in  1952 earned his degree in physical education, health, and recreation.   After college, Scotty heard the calling for public service and began  a career on Capitol Hill, serving as an aide to Florida's U.S. Senator  George Smathers. His advice and counsel was lauded, and he quickly  became an integral member of Senator Smathers' team and family. He  served his State and Nation with honor. It was in Washington, DC that  he met his wife, Lillian Barretto, and perhaps his greatest  accomplishment, together they raised six children: Nancy, Rosemary,  Scott Jr., Catherine, William, and George.   After returning to Florida, Scotty started a public relations firm  and enjoyed a successful career in many ventures, including real  estate. If you knew Scotty, you knew he was passionate about his family  and the University of Florida. He served in multiple capacities for the  UF Foundation, and that incredible work was honored by three UF  Presidents.   Through his devotion to his wife of 65 years, children,  grandchildren, great grandchildren, family and friends, there is no  doubt that Scotty left a mark on this world. I honor his life and  continued legacy.                            ____________________
