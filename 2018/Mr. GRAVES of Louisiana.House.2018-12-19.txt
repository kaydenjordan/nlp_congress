Nothing in this Act shall be construed as modifying the       requirements of sections 301(a), 302(h)(6), 303(a)(15), or       304(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and       Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1851(a), 1852(h)(6), 1853(a)(15),       and 1854(e)), or the equal application of such requirements       and other standards and requirements under the Magnuson-      Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C.       1801 et seq.) to commercial, charter, and recreational       fisheries, including each component of mixed-use fisheries.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, back in April of last year, in April of 2017, we  introduced legislation known as the Modern Fish Act, the Modernizing  Recreational Fisheries Management Act. A few months later, in July, on  July 10, the Senate introduced a companion measure.   Mr. Speaker, the House bill has 24 bipartisan cosponsors and, on July  11, the House passed this bill, the House version, H.R. 2023, as part  of H.R. 200, the overall Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation Act  Reauthorization.   Mr. Speaker, Magnuson-Stevens was first authorized in 1976, very  important legislation that largely at the time was designed to manage  commercial fishing out in Federal waters across the United States.   Over time, we have seen extraordinary changes in fishing, both in  commercial fishing, in technology and demand on species, changes in  technology and science and our ability to better manage these species;  and, importantly, Mr. Speaker, changes in the demand from recreational  fishers. People like you and I, myself and our kids, we enjoy going out  and fishing.   Magnuson-Stevens was designed largely to manage the commercial side,  and it largely lacked the important balance or consideration of the  millions and millions of fishers, of anglers, that go out and enjoy it  just as families, and this bill helps to fix that.   The Modern Fish Act will recognize in Federal law for the first time  that recreational fishing and commercial fishing are fundamentally  different activities and, therefore, should be managed differently to  fit the characteristics of each sector.   Mr. Speaker, while recreational fishing is an experience-based  activity, commercial fishing is designed for profit. It is a for-profit  activity, it is a business activity.   We have seen significant evolution in the way that the States manage  State waters, recreational and commercial fishing in State waters. And  let's keep in mind, there is nothing that distinguishes State waters  and Federal waters. When you get outside the seaward boundaries of  States, generally 3 miles in most States, it is indistinguishable. The  species go back and forth, but the management styles have fundamentally  changed.   In my home State of Louisiana, our recreational fishers have  determined that they are going to impose a fee on themselves to improve  the collection of data to improve the science to better inform our  fishery management decisions. The Federal Government has the  opportunity to do the same thing and, in some cases, to better involve  States to ensure the complementary nature of fisheries management in  the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic, the Pacific, Alaska, and in other  areas.   This bill will allow the Regional Fishery Management Councils to  manage recreational fisheries more successfully based on public access,  without hard quotas, or TACs. Ultimately, these changes will help to  avoid sudden closures and drastically changing fishing regulations that  have been plaguing many Federally managed fisheries.   The State of Louisiana is one of the most productive ecosystems in  the North American Continent. We have nearly 90 percent of the  freshwater inputs in the Gulf of Mexico coming through our State. We  have one of the top commercial fishing industries in the Nation--in  fact, the largest in the continental United States--and we produce more  shrimp, blue crabs, oysters, crayfish, and other species than anywhere  else in this Nation.   It is important to also keep in mind that we are one of the top  recreational fishing destinations. We are a place where many people  like to come to fish: redfish, speckled trout, red snapper, Amberjack,  cobia, and many, many other species. We have got to have that balance.  This bill moves in the right direction to ensure that we do have a  balance.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, let me just say this. The regulations, the laws,  that manage our roads, we have a very different structure on how 18  wheelers, how trucks are managed, versus cars; we have different rules  on how civilians versus military engage; we also have a different tax  code for businesses and individuals. This bill simply does the same  thing: it recognizes that there is a difference between commercial  fishing and recreational fishing.   Especially in our home, in the Gulf of Mexico, it recognizes that  there is extraordinary participation on the recreational side of  fishers, of just the general public, going out there and enjoying that  experiential activity to go out there and go catch fish in the Gulf of  Mexico. We must ensure that we have better science, that we have better  decisions in the Gulf of Mexico, and that we have better balance on how  these fisheries are managed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I reiterate that this is bipartisan legislation. I thank  my friend from Arizona for the cooperation in ensuring that we get text  that everyone agrees is a step in the right direction in improving that  balance in the management of commercial and recreational fisheries, in  ensuring that we have the best science informing our decisions and that  our resource managers have access to that information and are allowed  to use it. I thank the 24 bipartisan cosponsors from States like  Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, and many other coastal States  in the United States that worked with us on this to ensure that we move  in the right direction. And I thank the dean of the House and the king  in the North, Congressman  Don Young, for all of the work that he has  done for decades in progressing Federal fisheries management policy.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Bill Ball, Dustin Davidson, and the many  staff who helped to work on this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.
