 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  bringing this important bill to the floor.   We have heard it mentioned that, in 2002, in a bipartisan way, we  already have law that a baby born alive, at any stage of gestation, any  weeks of life, born alive, it is already illegal to kill the baby, and  that was a bipartisan bill; so I can understand why my friends on the  other side of the aisle want to keep changing the subject. Every vote  today should be for this bill.   We have already agreed that you have to save the lives of these  children. The problem is that we don't have strong enforcement  mechanisms. This bill provides enforcement mechanisms. This bill  specifies any medical care. This should be a unanimous vote.   That is what we need to talk about here today--in fact, life begins  at conception--to have laws that protect babies born alive. Now,  remember, these are babies who are born alive. There have been  questions about whether or not it happens.   Melissa Ohden, who testified in the Judiciary Committee a couple of  years ago, was a baby born alive. She started her own network, the  Abortion Survivors Network, where she has had contact with 203 other  abortion survivors.   Sometimes when they go in to start the abortion, they start the  treatments, the dilation, and the chemical treatments, the baby comes  out alive. I know people listening to this here today might believe  that this is a horror story and that this doesn't happen. It happens in  America.   We need to fight this, make it illegal, and pass this bill, so that  those babies are given the same protection as any other child who is  alive. This is a no-brainer. The only shame today is that when this  vote is cast later, if there are not 435 ``yes'' votes on that board  today, that should be the shame of this situation. These are live  babies. This is a no-brainer bill.   I am proud to represent the State of West Virginia, where respect for  human life is cherished. Every Member of this body should respect human  life. If it is already law, you should have no problem voting for it.  That is all the more reason to support the bill before us today.   The voters of this country have elected us to do the job of the pro- life majority. It is time we pass bills like this, and more bills like  this, so that we can show people we care about the unborn children.                                time  1315
