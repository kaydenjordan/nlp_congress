 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our workers,  specifically our autoworkers. Right now, they are doing what many of us  came here to do, which is to get wages up. They want to get their wages  up. It is really important for this Congress to stand with them, not  just for their families but for our economy.   They work for companies, great American companies, that have made  tens of billions of dollars in profit. If we allow the profit to just  be concentrated among a few, our economy won't grow as fast. If we say  to the hundreds of thousands of autoworkers, yes, you deserve a very  big raise, that means that the spending power will be distributed in a  way that will grow our economy much faster.   I stand with our autoworkers. I believe in what they are doing, and I  wish them the best luck as they continue to negotiate for better wages  and better working conditions.                            ____________________
