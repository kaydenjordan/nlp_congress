 Mr. Speaker, Thursday and Friday of next week, I plan to  visit my alma mater, the United States Military Academy at West Point.  I hope to spend time with the Department of Social Sciences and thank  them for their service to our country and for their current job of  training our next generation of warriors.   I am sure that many of the faculty also mentor individual cadets.  During my era, we called it sponsoring. This is a critical part of the  job that I want to continue to encourage them to do.   You see, I am headed back to West Point to attend the burial of my  sponsor, Colonel Witter. I met the Witter family during my first free  Sunday morning of Beast Barracks. We met at the Lutheran service in the  Old Cadet Chapel in the cemetery.   Colonel Witter and his wife, Mary Ellen, and children, Nanette,  Dorinda, and Mathew, welcomed me into their home. They provided a safe  haven away from the constant scrutiny of the upper class. They provided  a full meal now and then when full meals during my era as a plebe were  not always assured.   Having been raised in a large family, they provided a second family,  a younger brother that I never had and two younger sisters that I  already had plenty of.   As in any family, sometimes I was helpful and sometimes maybe a  burden. The Witter family was always there for me, in good times and  bad. Whether I was breaking the porch swing or kitchen chairs,  seriously burning Mathew, or spending the night when I was told not to,  I was also forgiven.   Colonel Witter took a special focus on my school performance. I was  on the other dean's list, the list academic deans pay closer attention  to. Graduation for me was not a slam dunk. Colonel Witter would summon  me to his office to encourage me and help motivate me academically.  When I told him I thought I was doing okay, he responded: ``I get your  grades.''   I could not have graduated from West Point without the love and  support from the Witter family. For this, I will be eternally grateful.   Colonel Witter, 84, passed away Monday, January 6, 2020, in South  Carolina. This is a picture of him at the military academy as an  instructor. I was blessed to have a chance to be able to visit with him  and Mary Ellen a year ago last March.  [[Page H246]]    Colonel Witter was a native of Wausau, Wisconsin. He was the last  serving son of 20 children of the late Jerry and Amelia Witter.   Colonel Witter was a veteran of the United States Army, a retired  military intelligence officer, and a United States Military Academy  professor of social sciences at West Point. He was a decorated military  veteran, earning the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, Meritorious Service  Medal, Air Medal, Joint Service Commendation Medal, National Defense  Service Medal, Humanitarian Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with  two bronze stars, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Combat  Infantryman Badge. He was preceded in death by his son, Mathew, and all  of his 19 brothers and sisters.   Survivors include his wife of 61 years, and my second mom, Mary  Ellen; two daughters, and my second sisters, Nanette Jordan of Norwalk,  Connecticut, and Dorinda Selby of Beaufort, South Carolina. He also had  five grandchildren: Ashley Benusa of Hong Kong; Taylor Jordan of  Boston, Massachusetts; Zachary Jordan of Waterbury, Connecticut; Senior  Airman Mathew Selby of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona;  and Thomas Selby of Beaufort, South Carolina.   Funeral services were held yesterday at St. John's Lutheran Church in  Beaufort, South Carolina. I will be attending the burial service, which  will take place at West Point Military Academy Cemetery on January 24,  2020, at 10 a.m.   Mr. Speaker, I conclude with Matthew 25:21: ``His Lord said unto him,  Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over  a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into  the joy of the Lord.''
