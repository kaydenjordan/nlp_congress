 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5574) to require the TSA to develop a plan to ensure that TSA  material disseminated in major airports can be better understood by  more people accessing such airports, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5574         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``TSA Reaching Across       Nationalities, Societies, and Languages to Advance Traveler       Education Act'' or the ``TRANSLATE Act''.       SEC. 2.

(2) Major airports.--The term ``major airports'' means       Category X and Category I airports.        (3) Non-traveling individual.--The term ``non-traveling       individual'' has the meaning given such term in section       1560.3 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.        (4) TSA material.--The term ``TSA material'' means signs,       videos, audio messages, websites, press releases, social       media postings, and other communications published and       disseminated by the Administrator of the TSA in Category X       and Category I airports for use by both traveling and non-      traveling individuals.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 5574, known as  the TRANSLATE Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman Van Taylor of Texas,  for once again joining me in introducing this legislation, which will  ease TSA's security processing at our Nation's major airports.   The TRANSLATE Act is bipartisan legislation building upon the  Transportation Security Administration's ongoing efforts to increase  access for non-English speakers, and for those with vision and hearing  impairments, as they navigate the security screening process.   It does this by directing TSA to analyze common languages other than  English that are spoken by both our international travelers as well as  those who reside in the nearby community and then develop and execute a  plan to disseminate security information in those languages to ease the  screening process.   I represent the heart of Las Vegas Valley, including McCarran  International Airport, which is one of the Nation's busiest airports,  welcoming passengers from around the country and around the world who  come to enjoy all that southern Nevada has to offer.   Navigating our air system can be stressful enough--if you travel back  and forth, you know what I mean--for even the most well-seasoned  traveler. Removing potential language barriers to ease TSA processing  is not only beneficial for those travelers but also for the general  public rushing to catch their flights.   Southern Nevada's community is rich in diversity. One of every three  Clark County residents speaks a language other than English at home.  Nationwide, that number is just over one out of every five residents.  Yet, much of what TSA communicates to travelers and transportation  workers through signs, announcements, videos, and online content is in  English.  [[Page H6297]]    Let's be clear. You shouldn't have to worry about missing a plane at  an airport in the U.S. just because you don't speak English. Making  travel and security information easier to understand for non-English  speakers and for those with vision and hearing impairments will help  create a more comfortable and efficient airport experience for  residents and visitors alike.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Homeland  Security for their unanimous support of this legislation last month and  the chairman for his assistance in getting this passed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of  the TRANSLATE Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's airports connect Americans to one another  and to the rest of the world. But for travelers who do not primarily  speak English or who experience hearing or vision difficulties, the TSA  screening process can be challenging and result in delays for all the  other travelers who are standing in line.   By requiring TSA to make its signage and announcement more accessible  to passengers at major airports, my bill will bring much-needed  inclusivity and efficiency to the whole travel experience. I know we  all appreciate seeing signs in English when we are traveling abroad.  U.S. airports should be just as welcoming and reflect the diversity of  our constituents and the travelers who visit our cities.   So, once again, Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for  H.R. 5574, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.
