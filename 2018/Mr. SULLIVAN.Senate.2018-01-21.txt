 Mr. President, as you can see here, a lot of the  Senators are coming down to talk about the government shutdown. We are  in a completely avoidable shutdown. There are a lot of speeches, but I  think it is important to be clear on one fact. The position of the  Democratic leadership on Friday night was this: Unless you agree with  our demands on the DACA issue by midnight, we will shut down the  Federal Government. I don't think anybody disagrees that is what the  position was Friday night. The irony, of course, is there wasn't even a  bill to agree on, but that still was their position. The decision was  in their hands and they made it and here we are. This was completely  avoidable, and we need to get this government of ours up and running  again.   I have been coming to the floor for the last few days--on the eve of  the shutdown and each day during the shutdown--to emphasize one point;  that the American people need to be skeptical. They need to be very  skeptical as the Members of the Senate Democratic leadership and some  of their colleagues trot out newly polished talking points emphasizing  their concern for the military readiness, rebuilding our forces, and  more spending on defense.   You might be hearing this. As a matter of fact, I have heard that  argument from the leadership on the other side more in the last 3 days  than I have heard in the last 3 years as a Senator in this body. Even  the junior Senator from Vermont this morning on CNN was talking about  the importance of rebuilding our military. Wow. That is new. So you are  seeing these new talking points.   I respect and get along well with all these Senators, the Democratic  leader, Democratic whip, the junior Senator from Vermont I just  mentioned, and the Senator from Wisconsin was just on the floor talking  about--again, a big emphasis on the Democratic side on the military. I  have respect for them. I know they are all patriotic, and they all love  their country, but one thing I think is pretty clear--at least in my 3  years in the Senate--this has not been their area of focus. It hasn't  been. Go look at the speeches. There has not been the focus on fully  funding and rebuilding our military. That is not where the Democratic  leadership has been, but it seems to be now with these new points.   Of course, I welcome this. I welcome this change of heart. I welcome  this new emphasis on fully rebuilding our military forces. In fact,  there are many of us in the Senate who serve on the Armed Services  Committee, like the Presiding Officer, led by Senator McCain. We have  been focusing on this issue for years. There are a lot of Republicans  and some Democrats. I mentioned a few on the floor the other day. This  is an issue we have been focusing on literally daily because it is a  huge problem right now in the country. It is enormously important for  my State, the great State of Alaska. Whether it is our Active-Duty  Forces or Reserve Forces, we have thousands not only serving in the  military now but who have served. We have more vets per capita than any  State in the country and thousands of civilians and family members who  support them.   These issues of military funding and rebuilding our military are  really important to a lot of us. I welcome the Democratic leadership's  new focus in the past 72 hours on military readiness, supporting our  troops, and rebuilding our forces. But I will admit this--I am  skeptical. I am very skeptical.    The American people watching this debate at home or in the Gallery  should be skeptical too. You should be skeptical when the junior  Senator from Vermont goes on CNN and talks about being strong on  military funding. You should be a little bit skeptical.   Why? What is really going on here? Why is there all this new talk  from the Democratic leadership about how important fully funding our  troops is? Why weren't they talking about this last year or the year  before?   I think they might be overcompensating. I think they might be  worried. I think they might be feeling a bit defensive. I think they  might be trying to preempt arguments that their policies of late have  actually been harmful to the military and our troops and their  families. The truth is, their policies of late have been harmful to our  military forces and our readiness.   Here are a few important points. From 2010 to 2016--the second term  of the Obama administration--the Department of Defense budget declined  by 25 percent. That is not a focus on the buildup of military; that is  for sure.   There were also dramatic troop cuts. As a matter of fact, when I  first started in this body in 2015, the Obama administration announced  that they were cutting 40,000 Active Duty Army  [[Page S405]]  troops; 5,000 were focused on Alaska. Because of this, we have seen  readiness in our Armed Forces plummet.   Here are just a few disturbing facts and a few disturbing trends. At  least one-third of Marine aviation isn't flying right now. We have had  numerous mishaps that have killed marines because of aviation  accidents. Only 5 out of 58 Army brigade combat teams are fully ready.  We have the smallest Air Force in U.S. history. We have a pilot  shortage--really, a crisis--in the Air Force and the Navy with regard  to being able to recruit pilots. Training hours for our pilots each  month have been cut in half. There are reports right now that Chinese  and Russian pilots are getting much more monthly training than our  forces. We have had naval mishaps at sea that have killed several  sailors in the prime of their lives--the best and the brightest of our  country.   We all recognize that there is a big problem. As we were cutting  forces and cutting spending for the last several years, the national  security threats to our country were dramatically increasing. We are  cutting forces, we are cutting spending, and ISIS is rising. North  Korea is becoming an enormous and immediate threat, as are Iran, China,  and Russia.   The world isn't any safer, yet we have been cutting our military  forces and the funding for our troops. That is why there is starting to  be a change right now. We passed the National Defense Authorization Act  with a dramatic authorization for an increase in military spending, but  it is still not appropriated.   When it comes to the Democratic leadership's new talking points,  actions speak louder than words. The new talking points don't mean much  in the face of actions that have actually undermined our military.   Let me provide a few examples. In the past 3 years, every Defense  appropriations bill that has passed out of the Appropriations Committee  has been filibustered by the Democratic side. Let me say that again.  Every single time we have brought a bill, usually a very bipartisan  bill, out of the Appropriations Committee for the funding for our  troops, it gets filibustered by the Democratic side. That is not  supporting our military.   A number of us have come down and talked about this. We have  encouraged our colleagues: Don't support the filibuster. We have asked:  Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this?   We all know that our forces have been cut too dramatically. The  national security challenges have increased, yet every single time we  bring a bill out of the Appropriations Committee to fund our troops,  the other side filibusters that bill.   If most people back home knew that, whether you are a Democrat or  Republican, it doesn't matter what State you live in--if you knew that  was what was going on here on the Senate floor, you probably wouldn't  be happy. But that has happened. That still happens every time.    No, I will not yield. I will finish, and the Senator  can respond to this later.   Hopefully my colleague from Hawaii hasn't been one of those who have  been filibustering spending for our troops, but it has happened. In the  summer of 2015, it happened five times in a row.   Next--right now we are having these discussions on the appropriate  level of defense spending, but the other side is saying: No, there has  to be parity, with ``parity'' meaning that if we increase defense  spending, which people are now saying we need to do--and we do--we have  to correspondingly increase domestic spending.   Well, again, the vast majority of Americans don't agree with that  position. That is not a position that is showing strong support for our  military, yet that is the position right now. That is one of the  reasons we have had difficulty coming to a final topline number.   In other words, if you want to increase the budget for the Marines,  you need to increase the budget for the EPA or another domestic agency.  Well, that is not showing this newfound emphasis and importance with  regard to the military.   Let me provide just one last point. This government shutdown--we all  know that really hurts our troops. We all know that really hurts  training. We all know that really hurts planning. Right now, if you are  a lance corporal in the Marine Corps fighting in Iraq or somewhere else  around the world for our national security, you have just been told  that you are not getting paid. Right now, the families of survivors for  the military--meaning that your husband, your wife, or your dad was  killed in action--get survivors benefits. Guess what happened on Friday  night. Those families no longer get survivors benefits.   We have all heard it, and I agree that a CR is bad for the military.  I fully agree with that. There is one thing that is absolutely worse  for the military and our troops right now--shutting down the  government. That is worse. That is worse than a CR.   When my colleagues on the other side trot out statements from General  Mattis and others, that is their view. Shutting down the government is  the worst thing we can be doing right now.   There was a little bit of news today. This was in the Alaska Dispatch  News, or what is now known as the Anchorage Daily News, about what is  going on in my State of Alaska. I am going to quote a couple of  sentences from this article.   It says that LTC Candis Olmstead of the Alaska National Guard ``wrote  that the Alaska National Guard also canceled its monthly drill weekend,  scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, due to the government shutdown.  About 4,000 Guard members''--we have a lot of military in Alaska-- ``throughout the state had planned to attend.''   I guarantee, some were en route, and they were told to go home.  Alaska is a big State. Sometimes you can fly 1,000 miles within Alaska  to go to a drill weekend.   She said: ``Drill weekends are when the bulk of our force--our  traditional or part-time Guard members--train alongside our full-time  personnel.'' Well, that is not helpful for our military.   National Public Radio this morning did a big story on what was going  on with the military. Again, they focused on Alaska as well. They said  that at least 4,000 people were impacted.   The reporter talked about how stressful this is for families. Let's  say you are a corporal in the Army. You and your family can go into  debt because you are not getting paid. Think about being deployed  overseas, and your wife is calling you, saying: I can't pay the rent.  That is what we did. That is what my colleagues did on Friday night.   These new talking points, saying ``We really support the  military,''--be skeptical because actions speak louder than words.   It is not just the military members. In Alaska, there are hundreds,  probably thousands, of family members in the civilian world--many of  whom are veterans--who, according to an NPR story this morning on the  radio, are going to go to work on Monday. They are going to be told  whether they are essential or not, and they have 4 hours to pack up  their stuff and go home.   This is clearly, clearly disrupting our military. It is not just  Alaska. It is all over the country. To be honest, it is all over the  world.   Let's talk about the civilian workforce in Virginia. In this same  article that I read from earlier, it says:         While uniformed personnel are largely shielded from the       shutdown effects--    Because they are still working and, by the way, they are not getting  paid--       civilian employees whose jobs are not deemed critical to       defense operations will be furloughed.        There are more than 740,000 Defense Department civilians.       Mattis said Friday that about half of them would be       furloughed.    Again, it is not just military members. It is the families. I  mentioned survivors benefits. There is also something called insurance  that covers things, for example, like funerals.   This article continues:         Already on Saturday, other effects were felt across the       military. One particularly sensitive one is the temporary       suspension of $100,000 payments promised to military families       in the event their loved one dies so that they can travel and       prepare for funerals.    Well, that has now been suspended. It even affects our forces  overseas.   The article goes on to say:         The American Forces Network, which carries television       broadcasts of sporting events and other programming, was       taken off the  [[Page S406]]       air at midnight, leaving deployed U.S. troops without one       common way to watch National Football League playoff games       this weekend.    That might sound like a small thing. It might sound like a small  thing, but if you are deployed overseas, serving your country overseas,  you want to touch base with America. Watching a football game is a  great way to do that. Guess what. Our troops are not even going to have  that small privilege.   In conclusion, the next time the Democratic leadership or some of my  colleagues come to the floor or go on CNN emphasizing their concerns  for the troops and rebuilding our forces, knowing that we have to do a  lot more, spend on the military, be skeptical. Be skeptical.   The talking points are nice. We are hearing them from everyone. It is  the actions that count. It is the actions that count, and they speak  louder than these newly crafted, slick talking points.   This has not been the focus of the Democratic leadership. It hasn't  been. I believe some of those giving these new talking points are a  little bit concerned or maybe a little bit haunted by the specter of  the Democratic Party once again being known, as they were in the 1970s,  as the anti-military party.   Now, I will say this: The vast majority of my colleagues, Democrat  and Republican, care about our forces, are patriotic, and care about  our veterans. But the way you show that is not through new talking  points; the way you show that is through actions and policies that are  truly and sincerely focused on supporting our troops and rebuilding our  military.    We can start that. We can start those kinds of actions by ending this  ill-conceived government shutdown with a vote tonight.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
