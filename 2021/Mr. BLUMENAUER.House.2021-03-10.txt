 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments  moments ago.   This is historic legislation dealing with priorities long neglected.  The charts that he presented tell it all.  [[Page H1274]]    The Republicans, with their $1.7 trillion tax cut, primarily for  people who didn't need it, versus our priorities, dealing with making a  major impact on child poverty, dealing with health, dealing with our  local governments being able to survive. This is a reflection of  Democratic values, and the difference it makes is stark.   I am proud to vote in favor of this recovery act. I am proud of what  it is going to do for people who need it most. The contrast between  Democratic priorities and what the Republicans did when they used  reconciliation could not be more stark.   I appreciate the gentleman illustrating it, and I hope that the House  will approve this measure.    Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to be here today  with my colleagues, Mr. Thompson and Mrs. McBath.   Mr. Speaker, Lucy's courage is an inspiration to me.   This has been a priority for me in the quarter century I have been in  Congress. I have supported every single reform that has advanced. But  we have a change today because we have never had in 10 years the  alignment with a House leadership and a Senate leadership that will not  bury it and a President who will enthusiastically sign it into law.   This is a landmark legislation that many of us have been working on  literally for decades, and this is one more example of what difference  it makes to have Democrats in charge and being able to advance  meaningful gun safety.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their hard work, and I am  proud to stand with them.
