 Mr. Speaker, since the Trump administration  announced the end of the DACA program in September, more than 16,000  people have already lost their protection from deportation and their  ability to work. Each day we fail to act to protect DREAMers, 122 more  people lose those protections and the ability to contribute to their  country in the same way they have for as long as they have lived here.   These DREAMers teach our children, care for our loved ones, start  businesses, strengthen our communities, defend our Nation, and believe  that our country, their country, will see them for the Americans they  are.   One of our country's proudest DREAMers, Jose Antonio Vargas, once  said:         Citizenship to me is more than a piece of paper.       Citizenship is also about character. I am an American. We are       just waiting for our country to recognize it.    Jose is right. It is high time our country recognizes the DREAMers  for the Americans they really are. It is time we show our national  character.                            ____________________
