 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J.  Res. 40. This resolution undermines our NICS background check system.   I am a gun owner and a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, but  this isn't about denying people the right to own a gun. It is about  upholding the law, and the law is very clear on who should be reported  to the NICS system.   The law was passed more than a decade ago to keep guns out of the  hands of people who can't responsibly own them. These are not people  just having a bad day. These are not people simply suffering from  depression or anxiety or agoraphobics. These are people with a severe  mental illness who can't hold any kind of job or make any decisions  about their affairs. So the law says very clearly that they shouldn't  have a firearm.   The Supreme Court in the Heller decision recognized that the Second  Amendment grants Americans the right to own firearms, but they also  stated that reasonable restrictions to that right can apply, such as  when a person is diagnosed with a severe mental illness.   The Social Security Administration is simply obeying the law.   So what exactly is the objection here?   Passage of this resolution puts Americans at risk. It would prevent  the Social Security Administration from reporting the names of those  who should not have a gun and prohibit that indefinitely.   If there are concerns about the rules, let's revise it. But the CRA  process is not a revision. It would ban Social Security from even  amending their rule. This is a dangerous overstep, and I urge Members  to consider the safety of our districts. No one wants another Virginia  Tech. No one wants another Newtown.
