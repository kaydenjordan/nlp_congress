 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight in strong support of the  U.S. Department of Commerce's inquiry into China's predatory trade  practices, their hacking of U.S. firms, and widespread dumping of  foreign solar components into the United States.   While China routinely violates human rights and churns out inferior  products, American companies are breaking new ground in the solar  sector and supporting thousands of good-paying jobs for middle-class  workers and families.   Northwest Ohio is home to two remarkable such firms: First Solar and  Toledo Solar. These domestic industries are charting a course for a new  era of American energy independence.   Our energy independence, security, and national strength demand we  make and build solar components right here at home. Our Nation must  stop relying on other countries for far too much of what we use.   We have the workforce and skill sets to get the job done right here.  Let us unleash American energy ingenuity for our workers, our  communities, and for a secure energy future for our Nation in  perpetuity.                            ____________________
