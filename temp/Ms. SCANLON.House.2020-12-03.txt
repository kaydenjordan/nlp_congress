 Mr. Speaker, this week, December's rent and mortgage  payments came due for millions of Americans, marking another gut- wrenching deadline for families who have been forced to make the  impossible decision between putting food on the table or keeping a roof  overhead.   We have been asking for months for the Senate to take up one of the  relief packages that the House has passed and sent for consideration or  for the Senate to come up with its own COVID relief proposal. While  there has finally been some movement this week, it is way overdue.   My constituents cannot wait any longer. As the coronavirus surges yet  again in my region, I hear every single day from folks who have  exhausted every resource to scrape by, but they cannot make ends meet  without more relief.   These are folks like Denise from Linwood. Last spring, she and her  husband both lost their jobs in the hospitality industry. They have two  kids at home learning virtually. Now they are faced with the expiration  of unemployment benefits, and they fear eviction come January.   Ann from Wayne is a schoolteacher who is trying to get a COVID test  so she can take care of her elderly mother and do her job, but she has  had to jump through hoop after hoop because we still lack a national  testing strategy.   My constituents and our local officials are doing everything in their  power to feed their families and stay safe. It is past time that the  Federal Government does the same. America is waiting.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, like my colleague, the distinguished member  of the Committee on Rules from Georgia, I, too, hope that the renewed  interest in both Houses in passing COVID relief yields fruit sooner  rather than later. It does require that the Senate make it a priority,  and I have been advised that the Senate's priority this afternoon once  again is confirming another conservative judge. So we will both have to  hold out hope as we move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I am here today, pleased to rise in support of today's  rule and the underlying legislation, the MORE Act.   It becomes clearer by the day that the time is long overdue for the  Federal Government to bring its marijuana policy into the 21st century.   The current approach has failed our youth, has failed to stem more  harmful drug usage, and, most notably, has failed communities of color  across the United States. That is because, when it comes to marijuana,  there are two justice systems in the United States: a gentler, more  understanding system mostly available to White Americans, and a  punitive, less-forgiving system primarily enforced against Black and  Brown Americans.   Mr. Speaker, this isn't justice. This is not who we must be as a  nation.   Thousands of people, mostly younger Black and Brown men, remain  incarcerated, while a growing number of States, including Pennsylvania,  have decriminalized and legalized marijuana for medicinal and  recreational use.   The question is no longer whether we are living in a world if we will  legalize cannabis. States across the country are leading the way and  demonstrating how to safely, responsibly, and effectively regulate  cannabis for medicinal and recreational use.   Mr. Speaker, the MORE Act will decriminalize marijuana by removing it  from the Controlled Substances Act and apply retroactively to prior and  pending marijuana-related convictions. The bill will also require  Federal courts to expunge prior convictions and require courts to  consider resentencing hearings for those still under supervision.   The MORE Act will not fix all of the injustices caused by the  obsolete and ineffective approach of the Federal Government towards  cannabis, but it is a good and long-overdue start.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to side with justice and  side with common sense to support this rule and the underlying  legislation.
