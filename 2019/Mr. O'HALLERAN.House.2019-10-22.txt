 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the high cost of  prescription drugs in this country.   This year, I have held 26 townhalls across Arizona's First  Congressional District. At each and every one, I hear from families,  seniors, and veterans who are concerned about the overwhelmingly high  cost of their prescription drugs.   I hear from people like Karen from Globe, Arizona, a 74-year-old  widow who cannot afford her prescriptions and often goes without them;  or Elizabeth from Tucson, Arizona, who said: ``I don't have much  hope.'' An American saying ``I don't have much hope'' is unacceptable  in America.   Between the years 2012 and 2017, the average annual cost of  prescription drug treatment increased by more than 50 percent--way  above inflation rates--while the annual income for Arizonans increased  by only 12 percent. In 2017, 26 percent of Arizona residents stopped  taking medication that is prescribed, due to cost.   The skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs has become a crisis in  this country, and something must be done. It is critical that we come  together to identify commonsense, bipartisan solutions to address these  costs and ensure that hardworking families can access the care and  prescriptions they need at affordable prices.    I am working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to bring  down these costs by identifying a holistic approach that allows  Medicare to negotiate for lower prices, caps out-of-pocket drug  expenses for seniors, and improves access to lower cost generic drugs.  Throughout this process, we must protect innovation and allow for the  research and development of new drugs on the market.   As we discuss these solutions, we must also remember the ways this  crisis disproportionately affects medically underserved rural and  Tribal communities. We need to identify solutions to address their  unique needs because Americans deserve quality, affordable care  regardless of their ZIP Code. No one should ever have to make the  choice between the medication they need and putting food on the table.   Mr. Speaker, I am working hard to ensure this is a reality for all  Americans. Let us all start to begin to have hope again.                            ____________________
