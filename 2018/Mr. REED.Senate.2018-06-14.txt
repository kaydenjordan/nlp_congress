 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2885 to amendment  No. 2276.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment  be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute.    Mr. President, the Reed amendment would name a fellowship  program on behalf of Senator John McCain. I can't think of anything  more fitting, in addition to the naming of this bill, than naming this  fellowship program on behalf of Senator McCain.   I hope all of my colleagues will join me in voting unanimously for  Senator McCain's fellowship program.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
