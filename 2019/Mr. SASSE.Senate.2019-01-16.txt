 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am going to speak again shortly from the  floor, but, very briefly, I want to associate myself with the comments  of my senior Senator, Deb Fischer from Nebraska, who just spoke and  welcomed Nebraska's pro-life students to the Capitol over the next 3  days. It is wonderful to be associated with a movement that is  fundamentally about love and is about the dignity of every baby. So I  join my senior Senator in welcoming Nebraska's pro-life students to the  Capitol and to Washington, DC, for the March for Life on Friday.   I thank the President.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to offer a very basic  resolution. I want Senators to unanimously reaffirm our oath of office  to a Constitution that explicitly rejects religious bigotry.   It is useful to regularly remind ourselves that Americans are First  Amendment people. Each of the five freedoms in the First Amendment-- speech, press, religion, assembly, and protest--defines who we are. In  America, we talk, we read, we argue, and we march and worship without  fear. Because of this fundamental celebration of human dignity and  human freedom, America is big enough to welcome a whole bunch of meaty  and messy fights on everything from whom you vote for to whom you call  God.   Just as the First Amendment prohibits the government from dictating  anyone's religious beliefs, so, too, the Constitution explicitly  rejects religious tests for Federal office. Our Constitution explicitly  rejects religious tests for Federal office. This isn't a Republican  belief; this isn't a Democratic belief; this is an American belief.  But, tragically, over the last couple of years, some strange things  have been happening in this body, and we seem to be forgetting some of  those basic 101 American civics truths.   I want to tell you a story. Brian Buescher from my State was recently  nominated by the President to be a Federal judge for the District of  Nebraska. This is an honor for him and his family, a celebration of his  brain, work ethic, and his integrity. By the way, Brian is also  Catholic and an active member of the Knights of Columbus.   The Knights of Columbus, for those of you who don't know, is the  largest Catholic fraternal service organization in the world. The  Knights' 1.6 million members of the organization raise millions of  dollars for charity every year, and they contribute millions of hours  of volunteer service.   Like a lot of guys back in Nebraska, Brian joined the Knights of  Columbus to give back and to also be involved in a bunch of fish frys.  This is not the stuff of headlines, but it is the stuff of basic  neighborliness.   This is where the story gets weird because at Brian's confirmation  hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee a few weeks ago, one of  my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee called the Knights of Columbus  ``an extremist organization.'' Huh? It got worse. Brian then got a  letter from a Member of this body asking him if he would resign his  membership in the Knights of Columbus if he were confirmed to the  Federal bench to ``avoid the appearance of bias.''   This is nuts. We are talking about the largest Catholic fraternal  organization in the world being called an extremist organization and a  nominee for the Federal bench being asked to resign from this  organization so that he can serve without the appearance of bias. The  clear implication here was that Brian's religious beliefs and his  religious affiliations--in this case, an affiliation with a Catholic  organization that invests countless hours and millions of dollars  annually serving special needs kids--Brian was supposedly therefore  potentially unfit for Federal service. This is the same kind of garbage  that was thrown at a Member of this body, John F. Kennedy, 60 years ago  when he was campaigning for the Presidency.   So today I have introduced a resolution--a 101-level, basic  resolution--that simply reaffirms the belief of this body in American  religious liberty. The resolution simply says that it is the sense of  the Senate that disqualifying a nominee for the Federal bench or any  Federal office on the basis of his Catholic beliefs or membership in  the Knights of Columbus violates the no religious test clause of the  Constitution. It seems obvious on its face.   In this resolution, we are simply reaffirming with President Kennedy  and with countless other Americans across 230 years--Protestant,  Catholic, Jew, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Agnostic, Atheist and others-- we are simply reaffirming the idea that America is big enough for  disagreements. Stated differently, we are saying that we believe the  U.S. Government is not in the business of trying to resolve debates  about  [[Page S266]]  Heaven and Hell; rather, the business of the U.S. Government is to  preserve peace and order so that you and your neighbors can precisely  wrestle about things such as Heaven and Hell or sports loyalties or  dietary preferences. America can handle principled pluralism and  honest, serious debate.   This resolution ought to have the support of every single Member of  this body. After all, each of us took an oath to defend this very idea  when we first came here. This is what America is actually about.   The text of the resolution before us states:         Expressing the sense of the Senate that disqualifying a       nominee to Federal office on the basis of membership in the       Knights of Columbus violates the Constitution of the United       States.        Whereas, throughout the history of the United States, the       religious liberty protected by both the First Amendment and       the No Religious Test Clause of the Constitution of the       United States has been at the heart of the American       experiment;        Whereas, in 1960, the presidential candidacy of John F.       Kennedy was met with significant anti-Catholic bigotry;        Whereas, then-Senator Kennedy responded to the bigotry with       these timeless words: ``For while this year it may be a       Catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed, in       other years it has been, and may someday be again, a Jew or a       Quaker or a Unitarian or a Baptist. . . . Today I may be the       victim, but tomorrow it may be you, until the whole fabric of       our harmonious society is ripped at a time of great national       peril.'';        Whereas the Knights of Columbus (in this preamble referred       to as the ``Knights'') constitute the largest Catholic       fraternal service organization in the world;        Whereas the Knights have a proud tradition of standing       against the forces of prejudice and oppression, such as the       Ku Klux Klan and Nazi Germany;        Whereas the Knights are founded on the principles of       charity, unity, fraternity, and patriotism; and        Whereas, in 2017, the Knights made more than $185,000,000       in charitable contributions and volunteered more than       75,600,000 service hours: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that       disqualifying a nominee to Federal office on the basis of       membership in the Knights of Columbus violates clause 3 of       article VI of the Constitution of the United States, which       establishes that Senators ``shall be bound by Oath or       Affirmation, to support th[e] Constitution'' and ``no       religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to       any Office or public Trust under the United States.''    Period. Full stop.   If a Senator has a problem with this resolution, they are probably in  the wrong line of work because this is what America is. This is a super  basic point. No religious tests. If someone has a problem with this  resolution, what other parts of the Constitution are they against?  Freedom of the press? Women's right to vote? Freedom of speech?   This isn't hard. There are no religious tests for serving on the  Federal bench. We in this body should rebuke these anti-Catholic  attacks.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of S. Res. 19, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    I thank the Members of this body for reaffirming basic  constitutional 101 stuff today. I will report back to Brian Buescher,  the nominee for the Federal Bench for the District of Nebraska, that he  can ignore those questions he received about whether he would resign  his membership in the Knights of Columbus before this body proceeds to  vote on his confirmation.
