 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my good friend Mrs. McMorris  Rodgers' bill, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act. This  legislation would make commonsense reforms to menu labeling and help  ease the burden on businesses, while providing consumers with the  information that they need.   The regulations, finalized by the Obama administration in 2014,  presented incredible challenges to businesses and would cause some  insurmountable challenges for them to be in compliance with the law.  This bill would allow for a more targeted approach and provide relief,  while ensuring people have the nutritional information they need to  make educated decisions about their health.   Let's take a second to look at how exactly this bill benefits people  across the country. This directs restaurants and food establishments to  disclose visible information on calorie counts, the number of calories  per serving, and accounts for online ordering with remote-access  labeling directions. Self-service establishments will need to place  signage with nutritional information for each food item.   Finally, it ensures that the nutritional disclosure of food contents  would need to comply with current standards, ensuring that restaurants  will adhere to a guideline that they know they can trust.   While this is good for consumers, it also makes important reforms for  the establishments. It sets out protections to prevent frivolous  lawsuits. It puts forth a good faith threshold so that businesses  aren't ultimately penalized for what could be a small error from one of  their employees. It gives establishments the flexibility in labeling  that may not maintain the same item list at all of their locations.   This legislation is about ensuring integral parts of our communities  aren't subjected to unfeasible regulatory expectations while providing  transparency to customers.   I am proud to cosponsor this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  support the underlying legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  spending measure under consideration and what it means for our country  and our constituents.   This continuing resolution we are considering includes a number of  extremely important health provisions that are desperately needed.   Under this legislation, we will see a 2-year extension of federally  qualified health centers that employ nearly 190,000 people and serve  over 24 million people across the country.   There is also a 2-year extension of public health programs such as  the National Health Service Corps, the Teaching Health Center Graduate  Medical Education, Family-to-Family Health Information Centers, and the  Sexual Risk Avoidance Education Program.   Additionally, this helps hospitals by eliminating the $5 million in  reductions for Disproportionate Share Hospitals that were included in  the ACA.   Many of the good bills my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce  Committee have worked on are included in this legislation to improve  public health and make reforms to Medicare.    Finally, this legislation pushes through a permanent repeal of the  Medicare payment cap for therapy services, meaning that patients will  have better access to important medical devices.   All of these efforts wouldn't be possible without the work of  Chairman Walden, Chairman Burgess, and my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle in the Energy and Commerce Committee.   Mr. Speaker, now is the time to work together to ensure that these  bills are passed into law, and that is why I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  150th anniversary of Wesley Monumental United Methodist Church in  downtown Savannah, Georgia, just off of Calhoun Square.   On January 19, 1868, 54 people formed the original congregation,  meeting in an old school building. This small congregation formed the  very beginning of the church that today is a monument to John and  Charles Wesley, the founders of Methodism.   Construction on its current design began in 1875, and finances were  contributed from across the world, truly making this a church that  belongs to all methodists no matter where they are from.   Through a yellow fever epidemic, two fires, and more, the  congregation and its gothic-style building have endured. Today, around  500 people worship each Sunday and enjoy services that embody a rich  music heritage at Wesley Monumental and some of the best sermons in  town.   This current congregation truly has a great responsibility to care  for this historic place. I am confident that they are up to the task.   On a personal note, Mr. Speaker, my wife and I have been members of  this church since 1980. We have raised three sons in this church, and  it has truly been a blessing to my family.                            ____________________
