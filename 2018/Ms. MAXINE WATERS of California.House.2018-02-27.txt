 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4296. This bill is  simply another rollback of rules put in place after the financial  crisis. It would undermine the stability of our country's largest  financial banks by restricting the way regulators set capital  requirements for these institutions.   Before I get into why this bill is problematic, let me take a moment  to clarify what capital is and what it is not.   Some have said that capital is money that is held on the side or in  reserve and cannot be used to lend to borrowers. This couldn't be  further from the truth. Capital is not a reserve. Capital refers to the  terms of the financing a bank receives.   In the most simplistic example, a bank receives funds from customers  making deposits, loans it receives from other institutions, and stock  it has issued to investors. The bank uses all of these sources of  funding to make mortgages and other loans to customers. However, there  are important differences.   Bank debt has terms like regular interest payments that, if it stops  paying, the bank fails.                                time  1600    However, a bank can stop paying dividends on a stock without it  failing. Banks funded with lots of debt are described as being higher  leveraged and risky because only a small drop in the value of their  mortgages and other assets can cause them to default.   Funding a bank through higher levels of capital makes the bank  stronger, because even if the loans it has made lose value, the bank  can avoid default by temporarily halting payments to their investors or  lowering the value of the stock.   H.R. 4296 would impact something called operational risk capital,  which is the capital used to cover the possibility of losses to the  largest banks caused from their operational failures, such as rogue  traders, fraudulent sales practices, and cyber breaches.   H.R. 4296 would diminish this type of capital, which only about 10  megabanks are required to maintain under an enhanced framework, by  restricting the information that regulators can use to determine the  appropriate balance of safe funding, like bank stock versus debt, that  megabanks should have to address potential operational losses that may  occur.   The bill would direct regulators to primarily consider a megabank's  current activities and not their past behavior when setting the capital  level, thereby enabling the bank to take on more debt.   According to Americans for Financial Reform, a nonpartisan coalition  of more than 200 civil rights, consumer, labor, business, investor,  faith-based, and civic and community groups:   ``While current activities are obviously central to operational risk,  and are already treated as such, the recent loss experience of banks is  the best concrete evidence regulators usually have as to the magnitude  of current and future risks. Recent past activities are also vital to  understanding the future exposures of the bank, including potential  legal exposures.''   Thus, this change to how regulators determine the appropriate amount  megabanks should maintain for operational risk is imprudent. A  megabank's past actions are often the best indicators of future  potential risks that it may experience.   Well, memories seem to quickly fade in Congress about the problems  that led to the last financial crisis, so let me list some of the  examples of past megabanks' operational failures by J.P. Morgan's  ``London Whale'' trades and Wells Fargo's long list of violations that  have ripped off millions of consumers, including those harmed by their  fraudulent accounts scandal.   Given these examples of past misconduct, the megabanks have  collectively paid more than $160 billion in fines since 2010. It is  absurd to suggest that their past behavior shouldn't be taken into  account when determining how much capital they should hold.   Even the Basel Committee, which several of President Trump's  appointees now serve on, agreed in December, when they finalized Basel  III reforms from where the operational risk capital originates,  writing:   ``Banks which have experienced greater operational risk losses  historically are assumed to be more likely to experience operational  risk losses in the future.''   So it makes no sense to have a forward-looking assessment that  deemphasizes a megabank's past failures in setting these capital  requirements. It is almost as if this bill is saying: ``Don't pay any  attention to that. No matter how bad they have been, don't look at  their past performance. We don't want you to look at that, because we  know if you do, you will make a different decision about capital  requirements.''   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill's  changes would cost the Federal Government $22 million. This calculation  was based on the fact that the capital change would not only affect the  bank's probability of failure, but also the magnitude of future losses  to our entire financial stability, which, in turn, affects the overall  U.S. economy.   This is not a bill to help community banks. It has nothing to do with  community banks. Let me repeat that. This is not a bill to help  community banks, so what we wish we would not hear is someone coming up  talking about how it is going to hurt community banks. That is often  used as an excuse. When we are trying to rein in these megabanks, they  always lop in the community banks with it. This has nothing to do with  community banks. This is a bill for the 10 largest banks in this  country.   So the megabanks on Wall Street are hoping Congress will let them  take on riskier debt by directing the regulators to downplay, if not  outright ignore, their recent and extensive operational failures.   Mr. Jamie Dimon, the CEO and chairman of JPMorgan Chase, wrote in his  2016 annual letter to shareholders that:   ``Operational risk capital should be significantly modified, if not  eliminated.''   Let's think about it like this: most adult consumers in this country  have a credit score. Banks use those credit scores to determine whether  or not to lend to a consumer and, if so, under what terms.   These credit scores are based on a consumer's what?   A consumer's past payment history, because this information is  considered one of the best indicators of a person's likelihood to  default on future credit obligations.   Now, we all know that credit scores are problematic, but no one,  including me, is proposing to get rid of them, because we can all agree  that past payment information is a good indicator of how someone will  handle credit in the future, but this bill takes that principle and  throws it out the window when it comes to the 10 largest banks in this  country.   Keep in mind, these same banks will continue to use a consumer's  credit score for underwriting and rating of mortgages and other  consumer loans, but the megabanks themselves are asking this Congress  not to judge them on their past behavior, as they judge consumers, and  to let them have a clean slate moving forward. If that isn't a double  standard, Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what is.   Mr. Speaker, bank profits reached an all-time record high in 2016.  Compensation for Wall Street CEOs has shot back up to levels last seen  in 2006, and business lending is up 75 percent since 2010. All this  happened while U.S. banks added more than $700 billion in capital to  absorb potential losses. There is a simple reason for this: healthy  banks lend.    U.S. banks also lent significantly more than their European  counterparts, because our banks boosted their capital levels, while the  European banks did not.   So despite Republicans' ``Chicken Little'' arguments about the dire  consequences of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory reforms, the  data speaks for itself. Banks are making more money than ever and  lending more than ever, but apparently that is not enough.   So I am here again today appealing for Congress to continue to uphold  the commonsense safeguards for consumers, the broader economy, and the  [[Page H1310]]  megabanks. I reject this Wall Street giveaway.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this harmful legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as  she may consume to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), a member of  the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty). She has raised a question  about the analogies that the chairman made, and those analogies seem to  escape ordinary logic.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as  she may consume to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard), a member  of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   In addition to the concerns I have raised about this bill, I also  want to mention a change to H.R. 4296 made in the Rules Committee just  last night.   Because H.R. 4296 makes the 10 largest banks more likely to fail, the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determined that there was a  higher likelihood that taxpayer funds would be used to wind down a  megabank. To offset these costs, Republicans have taken funds from the  Federal Reserve's surplus account.   So what is the Fed's capital surplus account? Effectively, it is a  rainy-day fund intended to ensure adequate capital is available to  absorb possible losses. Several stakeholders have raised concerns that,  by reducing the Fed's surplus account, Congress could negatively affect  the Federal Reserve's independence in monetary policy decisionmaking by  rendering it dependent on Treasury for recapitalization in the event  that total Reserve bank capital is depleted.   Put simply, this bill not only makes the 10 largest banks more likely  to fail, but it also makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will  be unable to address problems in the financial system going forward.   I would like to also mention that, in a letter opposing this bill,  the Center for American Progress highlighted, again, several budgetary  considerations we should keep in mind as we debate this bill. And, of  course, I have either mentioned or alluded to it, but it is important  that we understand that the Center for American Progress is very  concerned, and the CBO also projects, that H.R. 4296 will increase the  deficit due to an increase in expected losses to the Federal Government  stemming from an increase in the likelihood of another financial  crisis.                                time  1630    The bill would pay for these costs by lowering the Federal Reserve  System's surplus funds, once again treating the Fed like a piggy bank  and shifting privately generated losses to the public.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, early in my statement,  I warned that there would be someone who would come on the floor and  claim that it was going to hurt community banks, small town banks; and  this bill has nothing to do with community banks or small town banks.   This is about megabanks. This is about SIFIs. This is about the banks  that can cause harm in the whole system. This is about those banks that  we must be concerned about because of the displacement that they can  cause, not only in this country, but internationally.   Mr. Speaker, I just remind you again this has nothing to do with  community banks. This has nothing to do with small town banks. This is  just the big banks that are significantly important banks.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let's put aside the complex terminology we often use  with Financial Services legislation and call this bill what it really  is: a short-sighted giveaway to Wall Street megabanks.   Approximately ten banks we are talking about, the very largest banks  in our Nation, have to abide by operational risk standards under an  enhanced framework. They are required to maintain this additional  capital so when they continue to engage in risky behavior, like opening  millions of fake accounts to drive up profits, they will not  immediately become insolvent, sparking a financial crisis.   And may I just stop here for a moment and say: it is odd that, given  the information that we have discovered about some of our megabanks,  particularly Wells Fargo, that was involved not only in creating fake  accounts, false accounts in their clients' names, but also selling them  basically insurance that they did not need, I am wondering why my  friends on the opposite side of the aisle are not more concerned about  this operational risk that they take.   For example, when we talk about operational risk, include in that the  fines, the fines that we have placed on Wells Fargo and other banks  that have been caught committing fraud on its clients. It seems to me  that this would be taken into consideration, and I don't think they are  going to stop.   We have gone through a crisis. In 2008, we had this meltdown. We had  a recession, almost a depression. We had to bail out all of these  banks, yet we have Members, particularly on the opposite side of the  aisle, who are doing everything that they can to go back to some of the  practices that will cause us to be in the same situation we found  ourselves in in 2008.   So I would just simply say that this attempt to basically say: don't  look at our past, no matter how bad we have been, no matter how many  fines have been placed on them, forget about that. We don't like that.   So in saying that, what they are basically saying is they are going  to create more risk and they are going to put banks in the position of  possibly failing.   So with that, I would just like us not to forget that our current  operational risk capital standards didn't come out of nowhere. They are  still recovering from the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis, which was  largely caused by unsafe practices by large internationally active  megabanks and inadequate regulation that ignored past misconduct and  risky activities.   The crisis stripped wealth from millions of American families and  destroyed the economy. Since we passed the Dodd-Frank Act and the  regulators have implemented standards from the international Basel III  accord, including our operational risk capital rules, we have made  tremendous progress to create a better capitalized and more stable  banking system, and this is bearing results.   Megabanks have experienced record-breaking profits for the past  several years. Now they expect us to believe that these commonsense  rules that take into account their previous behavior was keeping them  from providing more affordable credit to hardworking consumers in  search of the American Dream?   As I mentioned earlier, a bank can still make loans to credit-worthy  consumers while funding those loans with capital instead of debt.                                time  1645    Operational capital is not cash locked away at night, but, rather, it  is the value of a bank's assets minus its liabilities or debts. A well- capitalized bank that has adequate sources of funding can accommodate  losses without reducing its lending. In fact, it would be able to lend  in good times and in bad.   We should direct the regulators overseeing megabanks like Wells Fargo  with its years of numerous consumer abuses and JPMorgan Chase with its  London Whale trading scandal not to ignore these past failures and put  our constituents at risk.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are rushing through  deregulatory measures to help their friends on Wall Street. But  Congress must not forget that it was hardworking consumers across the  country who paid dearly for Wall Street's faults in the last financial  crisis. So I would urge Members to vote ``no'' on this bill.   I am very pleased that while my colleagues on the opposite side of  the aisle keep talking about this being a bipartisan bill and they  mention Mr. Meeks'  [[Page H1314]]  name from New York, et cetera, we have the support of the Congressional  Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus in opposition to  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.    I am opposed to the bill in its  current form.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final  amendment to the bill which will not kill the bill or send it back to  committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final  passage, as amended.   We have talked at length today about how H.R. 4296 is a bill for Wall  Street megabanks, and I deeply disagree with the bill's approach. So I  offer this motion to recommit not in a manner that sends the bill to  the committee and kills the bill, but, rather, to attempt to improve  the bill before the House votes on final passage of the measure.   Let's discuss the elephant in the room. We all know megabanks have  been given a free ride in Washington for far too long. During the  savings and loan crisis, the government had no problem throwing bankers  in jail for breaking the law. Over 1,000 bank executives were  prosecuted. But now megabanks just get a fine, a slap on the wrist, for  harming consumers.   Since 2010, megabanks have racked up over $160 billion worth of  fines, yet they keep breaking the law. We have talked about Wells  Fargo's growing list of illegal actions that have harmed millions of  consumers. Sure they have been fined, but these fines are just the cost  of doing business. This soft enforcement approach is just increasing  their operational risk and losses, which, at the end of the day, will  impact not only all of their customers, but the broader economy as  well.   I hope Republicans and Democrats can all agree that any megabank that  engages in a pattern or practice of unsafe or unsound banking practices  and other egregious violations that has resulted in profound consumer  harm in the last 10 years is not entitled to any benefit of regulatory  relief provided under this bill.   So my amendment excludes a megabank like Wells Fargo that has  fraudulently opened millions of accounts without their customers'  consent, enrolled consumers in life insurance policies without their  consent, and forced nearly 1 million Americans to purchase automobile  insurance that they didn't even need.   Since 2016, I have been calling for Wells Fargo to face real  penalties. Last year, I introduced H.R. 3937, the Megabank  Accountability and Consequences Act, to compel the Federal bank  regulators to fully utilize existing authorities to stop these  megabanks from repeatedly flouting the law and harming millions of  consumers.   So I was glad to see Janet Yellen on her last day at the Federal  Reserve take bold action to cap the bank's size until it cleans up its  act. I am talking about Wells Fargo. This is what Janet Yellen did on  her last day at the Federal Reserve.   But we must do more to send a strong message to all megabanks that  there will be real consequences for their bad actions that mislead,  abuse, or deceive its customers.   H.R. 4296, in its current form, would send the opposite message to  recidivist megabanks. They should not reap the profit of easier  operational capital requirements while their operational breakdowns are  only increasing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this motion to recommit so  that we do not reward a recidivist megabank like Wells Fargo for  repeated operational failures that ripped off millions of consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
