 Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the  Girl Scouts of the United States.   On this day in 1912, the Girl Scouts of America was officially  launched in Savannah, Georgia, with a meeting of just 18 girls. Now,  107 years later, the Girl Scouts have engaged and inspired generations  of young women and empowered millions to serve their communities.   More than 50 million women are alumni of the Girl Scouts: 58 percent  of the women who serve in Congress were Girl Scouts, and 72 percent of  the women who serve in the Senate were Girl Scouts as young women.   My daughters and I have been lucky enough to be a small part of this  rich history, and, for the past 5 years, I have served as a Girl Scout  leader for my daughter's troop. Two-and-a-half million girls and adults  nationwide participate in this tremendous program.   In my time as a Girl Scout leader, I have gotten to know so many  bright and talented young women, to learn from them and with them, and  to use the tools and lessons of the Girl Scouts to instill within these  future leaders a fundamental belief in the power of service, the value  of character, and the importance in our community.   As storied as this organization's past is, it will always be focused  on the future. That is the purpose of Girl Scouts.                            ____________________
