 Mr. President, I rise today. along with my colleague  Senator Cardin, to introduce the Home Health Emergency Access to  Telehealth Act or Heat Act. This bipartisan bill would help ensure that  seniors who rely on home health care have the choice to receive these  critical services through telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic and  future public health emergencies.   COVID-19 is the greatest public health challenge since the flu  pandemic of 1918 and has claimed the lives of more than 200,000  Americans. This public health emergency has underscored the need for  older adults and other at-risk populations to have access to health  care in the home setting. Home-based care is crucial to ensuring that  this pandemic does not create devastating long-term health consequences  due to delayed care. The highly skilled and compassionate care that  home health agencies provide are an important component of this inhome  care.   I have been a strong supporter of home care since my very first home  visit, which took place in my hometown in Aroostook County early in my  Senate service. This experience gave me the opportunity to meet and  visit with home health patients, where I saw first-hand what a  difference highly skilled and caring visiting nurses and other health  care professionals make to the lives of patients and their families. I  have been a passionate advocate for home care ever since.   In March, my bipartisan home health legislation, the Home Health Care  Planning Improvement Act, became law as part of the Coronavirus Aid,  Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This new law will improve  the access Medicare beneficiaries have to home health care by allowing  physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists,  and certified  [[Page S6416]]  nurse midwives to order home health services. Far too often seniors  experience unnecessary delays in accessing home health care. To avoid  these needless delays, it is common sense that other medical  professionals who are familiar with a patient's case should be able to  order these services.   Home health professionals have continued to provide face-to-face  services during the COVID-19 public health emergency, but this crisis  has created additional challenges, including the need to maintain an  adequate supply of personal protective equipment to protect themselves,  their patients, and their patients' families. The use of telehealth and  virtual visits can help address these challenges. Unlike other Medicare  providers, however, home health agencies are not eligible to receive  Medicare reimbursement for telehealth services during the COVID-19  emergency.   In May, I led Congress' first hearing examining COVID-19's  devastating impact on seniors. During the hearing, Dr. Steven H.  Landers, President and CEO of the Visiting Nurse Association Health  Group, testified that, despite this lack of Medicare reimbursement, his  organization has found telehealth to be an essential part of providing  high quality home health care during the COVID-19 public health  emergency. He urged action to ensure that home health providers can  continue offering these critical services remotely.   Maine home health care providers have also shared stories about how  telehealth is helping them to continue caring for their patients during  COVID-19. Through a combination of video visits and care calls, one  provider has been able to care for a woman with severe heart and lung  disease and keep this patient out of the hospital. The nurse would  speak with the woman by phone a couple of times per week to assess any  symptoms that needed follow up. If the nurse identified an issue during  the call, she would schedule a video visit and also work with the  patient's physician to modify medications as needed.   The bill I am introducing today would authorize Medicare  reimbursement for home health services provided through telehealth  during a public health emergency where telehealth can be used  appropriately. The services would not be reimbursed unless the  beneficiary consents to receiving the services via telehealth. To  ensure that the Medicare home health benefit does not become a  telehealth-only benefit, Medicare reimbursement would only be provided  if the telehealth services constitute no more than half of the billable  visits made during the 30-day payment period.   Home health serves a vital role in helping our nation's seniors avoid  more costly hospital visits and nursing home stays. The COVID-19  emergency has further underscored the critical importance of home  health services and highlighted how these agencies are able to use  telehealth to provide skilled care to their patients. The Home Health  Emergency Access to Telehealth (HEAT) Act would ensure that seniors in  Maine and across the country retain access to remote home health  services during the COVID-19 emergency and future public health  emergencies.   Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________
