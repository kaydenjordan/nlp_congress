 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage all of my  colleagues to continue the work with all urgency to finalize the  pending fiscal year 2023 appropriations measures.   Notably, for Indiana's First Congressional District, I would  highlight the vital importance of the community-funded projects  included in these measures that will grow the northwest economy. For  example, I am grateful for the inclusion of specific funds that will  support economic development at the Michigan City Harbor, construction  for improvements to Central Avenue in Portage, and the expansion of  cargo operations at the Gary/Chicago International Airport.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to continue to prioritize  completing this necessary work so that we can support economic growth  and job creation in northwest Indiana and communities throughout our  Nation.                            ____________________
