 Madam Speaker, the killing of Adam Toledo  shook the Nation.   The video released a week ago shows a 13-year-old boy being chased by  an officer, complying with instructions to drop it, and it show his  hands up. Still the officer shot Adam in the chest. He complied and  still died.   It is hard to watch the video and not imagine a son or a nephew in  his place. It brought about very powerful, personal emotions for  people. I know it did for me.   I was around the same age as Adam when I moved to the neighborhood of  Little Village. I have known countless youth who have died on our  streets, whether it was gun violence from gangs, or in this case, the  police.   We must pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and end  qualified immunity.   But in Black and Latino communities, we know the police play by a  different set of rules too often. Change requires more accountability.  We must invest in families and youth rather than violent policing.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)   ``To rest in peace, Adam Toledo, our families and our community need  justice and hope that this doesn't happen again.''   Para descansar en paz, Adam Toledo, nuestras familias y comunidad  necesitan justicia y esperanza de que esto no se repetira.
