 Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to have this  opportunity. I thank the chairman as well, and I want to thank the  ranking member for all of the work that she has done in this area. She  has been a part of the avant-garde to protect and maintain  community banks.    One of the great difficulties that we have had with our committee is  defining what a community bank is. We have had testimony to indicate  that a community bank can be $50 billion or more. We want to make sure  that the small institutions that the chairperson is talking about  continue to exist.   It is unfortunate, but if we pass this legislation, there is a good  likelihood that the level of consolidation that will take place will be  antithetical to the very commentary that we are hearing with reference  to the need for community banks, small banks to make sure small  businesses will receive loans. There is a contradiction contained  within the very effort that is being made.   I am honored to have with me a statement from over 200 civil rights  community organizations, labor unions, businesses, investors, faith- based businesses, community and civic groups; and this statement  reads--this is from them, but I concur with it: ``Raising the limit to  $3 billion is a policy well calculated to significantly reduce the  number of community banks in the U.S. First, raising the limit will  allow medium-sized community banks of $2 to $3 billion in size to more  easily acquire smaller community banks. . . .''   That is a significant comment because the acquisition of smaller  banks is going to cause us to have fewer smaller banks, and the  argument that is being made is that the smaller banks are the ones that  are servicing small businesses.  [[Page H987]]    It goes on to read: ``. . . reducing the number of independent  community banks. Second, allowing holding companies to borrow  excessively will raise the risk of bank failure the next time the  financial system is under stress.   ``A $3 billion limit is unjustified, as there is no evidence that  community banks over $1 billion in size are currently too small to  survive. According to a recent FDIC report, `While economies of scale  are important for community banks, historical trends in the size  distribution of community banks that have survived over the last  quarter century do not suggest that economies of scale require a  community bank to grow or merge to asset sizes larger than $1  billion.''   My point is that I am a proponent of community banks.                                time  1145     The point is that I am a proponent of having  small banks. I call small banks community banks. I am a proponent of  this. If I am a proponent of it, then I support the notion that we  cannot allow them to be consolidated such that we will have fewer of  them.   I think this legislation is a little bit misguided in that it  contradicts the very premise upon which it rests.
