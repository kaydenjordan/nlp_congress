 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 2181, the Chaco  Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act.   Ancient civilizations called the area around Chaco Canyon home  thousands of years before the earliest settlers of ancient Egypt and  Mesopotamia. In fact, Native American people have occupied this region  continuously since 10,000 BC, creating massive public and ceremonial  buildings, a complex system of roads for trade, and beautiful crafts  and artwork.   Today, there are more than 4,000 archeological sites, millions of  artifacts, and countless sacred cultural resources that provide modern- day Native people a direct link to their ancestors who lived in the  area thousands of years ago.   Reckless oil and gas development could destroy the fragile  archeological and cultural resources in the area, including ones that  have not yet been discovered or cataloged. In fact, there has never  been a comprehensive Native-led study of the cultural resources in the  Chaco region.   It is fitting that we are talking about protecting Chaco Canyon in  New Mexico and the Grand Canyon in Arizona on the same day. Both are  UNESCO World Heritage sites, and both are national treasures needlessly  threatened by industry to pad their bottom line.   That is why I strongly support the Grand Canyon Centennial Protection  Act debated earlier and why I urge my colleagues to support this bill  and the 10-mile protection zone around Chaco Canyon's archeological  resources and the present-day communities that it creates.   This is sacred ground that we have an obligation to protect for  future generations to enjoy and learn about. We must pass this bill to  preserve this place to teach our children and our children's children  about the rich history and culture of the Native people who lived in  the American Southwest.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  [[Page H8627]]
