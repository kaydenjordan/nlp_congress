 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 6, the Dream and Promise Act.   This is a historic day. H.R. 6 provides a long-awaited pathway to  citizenship for Dreamers, to temporary protected status recipients, and  deferred enforced departure status individuals.   A floor vote on this bill could not have come soon enough. More than  2.5 million immigrants currently living in fear that they would be torn  from their families could find relief in this bill.   Losing them would be disastrous to our communities, and it would harm  our economy. It would be devastating to so many. This includes 130,000  Asian American Dreamers and 9,000 TPS recipients who urgently need  relief from the President's xenophobic threats to tear apart immigrant  families.   The Dream and Promise Act unites us around the shared ideal that  anybody can live the American Dream if they are willing to work for it.  That is the lesson that has inspired generations of immigrants to build  this country, and that is the lesson we cannot afford to forget.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill.                            Parliamentary Inquiry
