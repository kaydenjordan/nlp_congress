 Mr. Speaker, we just heard my friend from Michigan talk  about how NATO allies have to live up to their obligations.   NATO allies have been living up to their obligations. In fact,  article V of NATO has only been invoked once, and it was on behalf of  the United States by our NATO allies.   The way to get NATO working is not to blow up a NATO summit, and it  is not to disparage NATO allies--allies of half a century. Now we see  that same wrecking ball strategy in the United Kingdom, our oldest ally  on the face of the Earth.   This is no way to conduct foreign policy. It is destructive, and it  will hurt the United States' interests that have been served long by  our allies and by NATO in particular.   I hope the President of the United States comes to his senses and  understands talking discretely is far better than blowing it up.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on H.R. 50, the  Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act.   We have seen this bill before. It was a bad idea then, it is a bad  idea now.   Proponents of this bill, as we have just heard, may argue that  regulations are burdensome and costly--and sometimes they are--but, in  fact, the benefits of agency regulations far outweigh the costs.   The most recent draft report of the Trump administration's own Office  of Management and Budget on the benefits and costs of regulations found  that the estimated annual benefits of rules between 2006 and 2016,  which covers nearly all of the regulations during the previous  administration, were between $219 billion and $695 billion. Those are  the benefits, the value of benefits.   By contrast, it said that the cost of those same rules were estimated  at between somewhere around $59 billion and $88 billion. The benefits  far outweigh the cost to the American public.   This bill will impose numerous requirements that will slow down the  regulatory process and give regulated industry an unfair advantage over  public health organizations, doctors, scientists, and ordinary  Americans when new rules are made.   The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act was important in helping to strike a  balance between the need for Federal regulations and the burden those  regulations placed on State and local governments. I know that. I was  the head  [[Page H6182]]  of a very large local government. Congress should endeavor to strike,  however, a similar balance with mandates on the private sector, without  putting our fingers on the scale for the very industries that need  regulations, as this bill does.   Under this bill, agencies would be required to consult with impacted  entities in the private sector on a proposed rule before the rule is  even made available to the public, giving a very unfair advantage to  the industries to be regulated. Agencies should consult with industry  on proposed rules, of course. Regulated corporations, however, should  never been given an explicit and unfair preference over other  stakeholders, particularly the American families and consumers these  rules are designed to protect.   Drug manufacturers, for example, should not get to influence an  opioid safety regulation before public health experts. The energy  industry should not get to weigh in on a regulation before those  citizens whose air and water quality would be affected are heard from.   This bill would also significantly expand in almost a sweeping way  judicial review under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.   UMRA currently prohibits a court from delaying or invalidating a rule  based on an agency's compliance with UMRA. This bill would eliminate  that restriction.   This bill would also allow judges to second-guess agency experts by  evaluating the adequacy of agency analyses, including cost-benefit  estimates, giving broad new power to the judiciary to get into the  rulemaking process and, in some cases, perhaps, to substitute  themselves for regulatory agencies. This is something I don't believe  we want to see.   The bill would also require an agency to conduct a retrospective  cost-benefit analysis of any existing rule if requested by the chairman  or ranking member of the committee. This provision would require  agencies to conduct analyses on potentially thousands of rules,  diverting unnecessary time and attention away from fulfilling their  missions. That is designed, basically, to preclude new rulemaking from  happening at all.   H.R. 50 would also repeal the exemption that is currently in UMRA for  independent agencies. As a result, the independence of agencies like  the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Product Safety  Commission could be compromised because the Office of Management and  Budget would now have a role in shaping rules those agencies issue.   The bottom line is that regulation can make our air cleaner to  breathe, our water safer to drink--by the way, we are reminded of that  right now here in Washington, D.C., where we have a water boil  advisory--the products we use safer, and provide protections that are  critical for a healthy economy. H.R. 50 would impose new roadblocks  that would make it harder to provide those protections for the public  we serve.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, before I recognize Mr. Cummings, the  distinguished ranking member of our committee, I do want to say, it is  the same old thing: Oh, this is just commonsense. Of course we favor  sensible regulation that protects our air and water.   Really. The same crowd that says that is witnessing the dismantlement  of regulations and, frankly, the defenestration of the regulatory  agencies charged with that mission, like the EPA. The late, lamented  Administrator of the EPA has set about on a wrecking ball mission at  EPA, and I don't hear my Republican friends speaking up, decrying that,  and defending those regulations to protect the public.   This is a pig in a poke. My colleagues should not support it.   Mr. Chair, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Cummings), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My friend from Texas is right. This will certainly provide a lot more  clarity for private enterprise. I am not sure it is the kind of clarity  we want, because they are going to get their nose into the business of  rulemaking to serve their interests.  [[Page H6184]]                                     time  0945    There are rules that could not have been enacted if H.R. 50 had been  law. For example, after the Deepwater Horizon explosion that killed 11  crew members and set off the worst oil spill in American history, the  Department of the Interior finalized a rule in 2016 to tighten controls  in blowout preventers and calling for rig operators to have third  parties certify that the safety devices worked under extreme  conditions. That rule would have been precluded because of the  provisions of this bill.   The sanitary transportation of human and animal food, this rule  establishes requirements for parties engaged in the transportation of  food, including food for animals, to use sanitary transportation  practices. That would have been precluded.   The corporate average fuel economy standards to regulate miles-per- gallon number of light-duty vehicles such as sedans, minivans, and any  vehicle that weighs less than 10,000 pounds would have been precluded.   The long-term care facilities arbitration agreements ban nursing  homes and assisted living facilities from forcing patients and their  families into private arbitration to resolve disputes. We protected the  interests of consumers and their families at a time of need. That rule  would have been precluded, too.   So that may be the reason why the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards,  150 organizations, have come together to oppose this bill. It is not in  the public interest.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Clay), a distinguished member of the Oversight and Government Reform  Committee. It gives me great pride to recognize my dear friend.    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have left.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), a distinguished member of the  Oversight and Government Reform Committee. It gives me great pleasure  to recognize my distinguished colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from North Carolina. I appreciate her  fervor, and I know she is sincere in her convictions with respect to  this legislation and to the underlying issues.   As someone who came from local government, coming here to Congress,  running one of the biggest local governments in the United States, I  certainly am sympathetic to the purposes of the Unfunded Mandates  Reform Act, and I supported many of those provisions.   This goes too far. This isn't just an UMRA improvement. This is  gutting, wholesale, the regulatory process that provides enormous  benefits, and we know that from the OMB itself in terms of the benefits  versus the cost of rulemaking to protect the public.   Where we can make improvements, great, but gutting it, giving the  regulated industries an inside opportunity to shape or block those  regulations before the public ever even sees them, expanding, in a  great way, the role of the judiciary to second-guess and subvert the  role of rulemaking agencies in the executive branch, I think, does  raise constitutional issues, as Mr. Cummings said, that sooner or later  will have to be addressed.   So I think this is a very flawed piece of legislation, despite the  good intentions of my friend from North Carolina. I urge all of my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on something that is simple, neat, but wrong,  as H.L. Mencken once said.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend for her thoughtful  amendment.   This amendment would significantly improve an already bad bill by  exempting the independent agencies, who should not be brought under the  penumbra of this bill at all. It will absolutely cut their independence  and make them subject to the rulemaking and the supervision of the OMB  in a way that Congress never intended. That is why they are independent  agencies.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this thoughtful  amendment, and I thank my good friend from New Jersey for her  leadership on this matter.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Maryland for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. It is a thoughtful  addition. Certainly, more transparency is a good thing.   But, as Mr. Raskin suggests, it doesn't change the underlying fact  that this is a flawed bill. It doesn't change the fact that it guts  independent agencies. It doesn't change the fact that it broadly  expands the role of the judiciary in an executive branch rulemaking  process. It doesn't change the fact that it basically gives unilateral  authority to the chairman and ranking member here in Congress to block  rules, period. And it doesn't change the fact that it gives the private  sector an unprecedented role in rulemaking a priority in a way that is  absolutely against consumer interests.   I know my friend from Maryland understands that, so I thank him for  his thoughtful amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this is a simple, clear amendment to the Unfunded  Mandates Information and Transparency Act. This amendment seeks to  establish a performance-based sunset mechanism stipulating that, in the  event that the annual rate of real GDP growth remains below 5 percent  over the first four quarters occurring after the date of enactment,  then the statutory changes made by H.R. 50 are repealed because the  bill will have proved to have been ineffective.   If the promise of deregulation and gutting the protection of the  American people is greater economic growth, then let's test that  theory.   This amendment sets up a real-world measurement and a sunset  mechanism that supporters and opponents can support. It features the  flexibility to ensure an appropriate response to the impact of H.R. 50  on America's economic  [[Page H6189]]  growth over the year following enactment.   If the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, by  lessening the independence of independent regulatory agencies and by  strengthening the influence of the private sector to be regulated in  the Federal rulemaking process, does, in fact, spur economic growth, we  should hold the policy accountable. During the Obama administration--a  time when President Obama's critics believed that overregulation was  inhibiting the economy from growing and stunting recovery after the  Great Recession, quarterly growth contradicted them. Quarterly growth  of real GDP was at least 5 percent once and over 4 percent 11 times.   In fact, in 2014, when Congress last considered, but did not enact,  this bill and the supposed hobnail boot of government was on the neck  of our economy, GDP actually grew at an annual rate of 4.6 percent and  5.2 percent in the second and third quarters, respectively, of that  year.   The provisions of H.R. 50 would make it harder for Federal agencies  to safeguard air and water quality, the safety of food and consumer  products, and the health and welfare of all Americans, all in the name  of spurring economic growth. Therefore, it follows, if it fails to spur  that promised economic growth and achieve an average annual growth of 5  percent over the year following the enactment of the law, then the  statutory changes made by this bill should be repealed because they  failed. Anything less would be a bad deal for the American public.   Finally, I would note that, according to the preliminary estimate of  the Congressional Budget Office, this amendment would not increase  direct spending or reduce revenues, and I strongly urge my colleagues  to adopt it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1015     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
