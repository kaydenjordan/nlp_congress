 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss our  work in the House to advance innovative solutions to improve access to  affordable healthcare for people in my district in New Hampshire and  across the country.   Over the past 2 weeks I have had the opportunity to visit with  hospitals and providers throughout my district to discuss the  challenges facing healthcare in my State. I have heard consistently  that the efforts of the Trump administration to sabotage the Affordable  Care Act are causing serious anxiety for patients and healthcare  providers.   The American people have made clear they want Democrats and  Republicans to work together to improve access to affordable healthcare  and to abandon the partisanship that has seen protections for  individuals with preexisting conditions threatened and access to  healthcare restricted.   I am excited that next week the House will pass innovative  legislation that will have a real impact on the lives of hardworking  families, including my bill to protect people with preexisting  conditions. We are advancing pragmatic solutions and stabilizing and  strengthening the Affordable Care Act.                            ____________________
