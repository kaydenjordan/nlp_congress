 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the birthday of  Ralph Johnson from Cherokee, Iowa, who turned 100 years old on Monday.   Ralph is a member of the Greatest Generation, serving in the Navy  during World War II. He truly embodies the bravery, courage, and  selfless sacrifice of an American patriot, working as a head mechanic  in the Pacific theater.   If you talk with Ralph, he will tell you harrowing stories about his  service, like the time the Japanese flew so low over his ship, he could  see the pilot's face.   On behalf of a grateful nation, we thank Ralph for his service and  sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take a moment to recognize Linda  Sommerfeld and David Scott, who made Ralph's special day great.   Happy birthday, Ralph. We wish you many blessings.                            ____________________
