 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of the people  of the San Joaquin Valley in favor of H.R. 3922.   The people of the valley whom I represent in California did not send  me here to put the lives of children at risk. I have made a commitment  to improve access to healthcare for families that I have the honor to  represent here in the House. I will continue to meet that commitment.  The question is: Will Congress do the same and extend the Children's  Health Insurance Program?   My congressional district has perhaps the largest percentage of  children who qualify for the Children's Health Insurance Program in the  entire country. The coverage is vital to families throughout my  district, but it is particularly important to communities like Gustine,  Planada, Chowchilla, and Biola, where these healthcare clinics provide  such important, valuable healthcare to these children and their  families.   Approximately 71 percent of the children in my district receive their  medical coverage through the combination of the Children's Health  Insurance Program and Medicaid. We cannot let this end.   This bill is not perfect, to be sure, but these children cannot be  put at risk with further delays in funding for the important programs  that this bill extends. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.
