 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   I have great respect for my colleague, Mr. Babin, who introduced this  amendment, and I understand his intentions. I just believe that it is  too late in the game to be changing this rule. There are many companies  who have invested in this technology.   We seem to have a problem in Congress where we can't give clear  direction to businesses, and, therefore, it creates a lot of  uncertainty. They sometimes make investments and the rules change. This  will be a time when the rules would change before this investment would  even be made.   There have been specific issues, like livestock, that have been  addressed already in committee.   Mr. Chairman, again, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance  of my time.
