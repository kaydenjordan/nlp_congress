 Mr. President, let me just share what just happened here.  I have been involved with this for a long time, including over in the  House when we had our NDAA. Now, I am fully aware and everybody here  knows that we have passed this NDAA for 57 consecutive years, and we  are going to pass it. But one of the things I really don't like about  the procedure is that one person--any one person, Democrat or  Republican--can object, as this was just objected to, and cause us to  have to file cloture. This is going to put this off for a period of  time, and two undesirable results can result. One result can be that it  can ultimately deny Members from offering their amendments, whether  they are germane or not.   I will state how much I appreciate the fact that Senator Reed and I  in our committee have worked very closely together, and we made a  decision that we want to have an open amendment process. We had  discussion of this in our committee and everyone agrees with this.   This could have the effect of ultimately closing the door to everyone  who has an amendment. We don't want that, but we did everything we  could to stop an objection from taking place so that we could at least  move on to the bill.   We need to get on the bill, and then we can try to do all kinds of  arrangements. At one time, Senator Reed and I talked about maybe coming  up with 10 amendments or 15 amendments or 3 amendments each, Democrats  and Republicans, so that we could at least say to the individuals on  our side--and I would say to my Republican friends--that I will do  everything within my power to see that you get a vote. Unfortunately  you can't do that because you can't guarantee there will be a vote. So  that is the thing I regret, and the other bad part of this is that it  is going to put it off for about a week.    I just got back from all of our war zones, talking to our troops on  the ground, telling them that this is going to happen, that we are  going to be taking up the NDAA, and telling them what is in it in terms  of pay raises, what is in it in terms of priorities, and how we are  going to try to get modernized. Right now we have several pieces of  equipment that over the last 10 years have been ignored, and we have  peer competitors in Russia and in China that have better equipment than  we do. An artillery piece is evaluated by rapid fire and range, and  right now our rapid fire is not as fast as either Russia's or China's.  We see what is happening in the China Sea. We are over there. We see  that our allies are looking and thinking: You know, the Chinese are  preparing for World War III. What are we doing?   By postponing this, all of our troops and all of our very valued  people who are risking their lives on a daily basis are going to  wonder: Why didn't we go ahead and go with this thing? It is wrong.   I do want to say this. Senator Reed and I and our committees did  everything we could to try to accommodate everyone as best as our rules  would allow us to do. In living with the limitations that we have, we  have done everything we can do.   I do want to compliment the entire Senate Armed Services Committee.  We have also worked on the House side. Between Senator Reed and me-- Democrats and Republicans--we have done everything we could to keep  this from happening. Again, as long as I can remember, at the last  minute, one Senator can put this off and create the damage and  potential damage that has been created now. I do regret that.    Mr. President, I think it is kind of unprecedented to  have, in this case, the acting chairman and the ranking member be so  close together on what we have attempted to do.   I think it is worthwhile to note, as Senator Reed brought up, that we  had the committee hearing on this, and it is very rare we come out as  we did on that. We actually did that in 1 day. It was 1 day, and it was  9 hours total. I am not sure if that is some kind of a record or not,  but it shows that we are working very well together, and I was hoping  that would take care of this today.   Anyway, we are now going to start discussing this bill. Since we have  lost the opportunity to move to the bill and actually start on  amendments, I think it is more important now to at least talk about  what we are anticipating. Today we will begin consideration--even  though we are not on the bill, we can still talk about it. This is the  John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2019.  It is the most important piece of legislation we consider every year.   As I have said, this is now the 57th consecutive year that we have  done this. I remember that just a few years ago we got very close to  the middle of December or the end of December, which is an absolute  deadline to get it done for the fiscal year. We had to go to the big  four, and we got it done and got it passed. Well, we don't want to do  that now. We want to do it the right way, and we want to consider all  of the amendments because in that year, we got the bill, but we didn't  consider any amendments.   You can talk to any of the Members. A lot of times they were in  closed meetings, and we talked about the necessity of getting the  amendments opened up so that anyone could offer an amendment, and, of  course, they were denied doing that at that time. Now we are still in a  position that we can do this, but it has put it off about a week.   Anyway, this is the most important legislation we pass every year.  One more time, I want to thank Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of  the Armed Services Committee, for his work on this and for the fact  that we were able to do it as rapidly as we did. I also want to thank  the majority leader, Senator McConnell, not only for bringing the NDAA  to the floor this week, but also for his willingness to do so under  regular order. That is what we wanted, and we were able to do it.   Finally, and most importantly, I want to thank the committee  chairman, Senator John McCain, for his strong leadership in the  preparation of the NDAA this year, which he has done each year for a  long period of time. Make no mistake, he may not be here today, but  this is his bill. His priorities and his policy objectives are in this  bill. This year's NDAA is a true embodiment of what Chairman McCain has  worked to advance during his decades of service and his tenure as  chairman of this committee. It deserves to bear his name, and it does  bear his name.   We are all keeping Chairman McCain in our hearts and our prayers as  he continues to prove that he is the fighter we all know him to be. I  am sure he is watching right now. Senator McCain, we all know the  fighter you are. There is no one else like you, and we want you to  continue that fight, and we are anticipating that is going to be taking  place.   The NDAA represents some of the finest traditions of this body. For  57 years, Congress has passed this vital legislation to authorize  funding and provide the necessary authority for our military to protect  this great Nation.   I am proud that the Senate Armed Services Committee overwhelmingly  passed this bill. I think, at one point, we had 300 amendments. We were  able to sit down, reason together, incorporate several of them into a  managers' package, come to the committee, and actually pass it  overwhelmingly.   This is more than just a piece of legislation, but it is a message to  each and every one of our servicemembers that they are our No. 1  priority. That is why I didn't like the idea that there is an objection  to moving to this bill today. I was with our servicemembers who are  overseas all last week, telling them what we were going to do, why we  were going to do it, and why it is a top priority. Unfortunately, this  sends the wrong message to them.   This is more than just a piece of legislation; it is what we have to  do to defend our Nation. After all, you have to keep in mind that the  No. 1 thing we need to be doing here in the U.S. Senate, as well as in  the House, is defending America. Our Founding Fathers said that; it is  in the Constitution; and that is what we are about do to now.   The fiscal year 2019 NDAA keeps faith with our troops. It has a 2.6- percent pay raise--the largest in 10 years--which, in some small way,  honors their enormous sacrifice.   In total, the NDAA supports $716 billion in fiscal year 2019 for  national defense. It authorizes a base defense budget of $639 billion  for the Department of Defense and the national security programs of the  Department of Energy, as well as $69 billion in the overseas  contingency fund. When it all adds up, you have $716 billion. That is  what we should be doing around here. We are glad we are at the point  where we can give priority to defending our Nation, as it should always  have been.   This is funding an important step toward recovering from years of  cuts in our defense budget under the Budget Control Act and  sequestration, which harmed our military readiness and slowed down our  modernization efforts. As I mentioned before, sequestration has held us  back, but it has not held our adversaries back. All the time we were  held back over the last 10 years, our peer competition out there-- Russia and China--haven't been holding back. That is why I said that in  areas such as artillery, they are ahead of us.   Every time I go--and I am sure the Chair finds the same thing to be  true--back home where the real people are, they assume we have the best  of everything. That was the kind of standard we had set in World War  II, and, of course, we backed away from that. We have areas--not just  artillery, but triad and hypersonic--in which we were not able to keep  that up, and all the time that we were doing nothing for the last 10  years in the triad system, the Chinese and the Russians were advancing,  and they are ahead of us now.   Hypersonic is something not many people know about. It is a weapons  system that moves at five times the speed of sound, and this is  something that is  [[Page S3007]]  going to be where future wars are going to be fought. Yet China and  Russia are both ahead of us right now.   So with this bill, we are going back and are advancing in some areas  where we have been very, very slow. The goal, as always, is to provide  our warfighters with the resources and capabilities they need and to do  so on time, on schedule, and at a reasonable cost.   Now I am going to run over this because I think it is important that  people out there know--and even some Members in this body, if they are  not on the committee, might not be aware--that the legislation  authorizes starting $23 billion for shipbuilding to fund 10 new  construction battle force ships. It also provides for the procurement  of 117 naval aviation aircraft. It has $7.6 billion to procure 75 F-35  Joint Strike Fighters.   I think we all recognize the mistake we made back when we had the F- 22. We should have, at that time, stayed with the original amount, and  now we regret we didn't do it. We don't want to make that mistake with  the F-35s, so we have that provision in there.   We have $2.3 billion to procure 14 KC-46s. This is kind of  interesting because that is ultimately going to replace the KC-135s,  which have been around for 58 years now. I can remember, in the last  administration, the Secretary of the Air Force was having an event, and  I remember commenting at Altus Air Force Base that in 1959 two  wonderful things had happened. No. 1, I got married and, No. 2, we  delivered our first KC-135. She said: Well, I guess that offers  security for you here at Altus for the next 59 years, and I think it  does. That is how important that is. Our KC-46s are necessary, and this  has the procurement of 14 of these.   We have $350 million to procure Air Force light attack aircraft;  procurement of 117 Army helicopters; $70 million to prototype the next- generation combat vehicle; and $100 million each for the U.S. Marine  Corps light attack aircraft and Group 5 Unmanned Aerial System; and  lastly, $10 billion for the Missile Defense Agency.   That is finally getting us up to where we had fallen behind during  the last administration. We might as well say it as it is. We now have  everyone agreeing. This is good. This bill has been unnecessarily  postponed for another week. Someone is making a point there.   Along the way, the NDAA makes adjustments to the administration's  budget request to ensure programs are sustainable and accountable and  protecting American taxpayer dollars. It also takes steps to ensure we  are prepared for a world defined by strategic competition with China  and Russia, addressing China's militarization of the South China Sea,  and deterring Russia's military aggression and cyber attacks.   We know that is happening right now. Several of us, including the  Presiding Officer, just about a month ago, were in the South China Sea.  You see what the Chinese are doing, which is totally illegal. It is not  land they own. They talk about reclaiming land. They are not reclaiming  land. It wasn't previously claimed by anybody. They have seven islands  now out there. We are talking about over 33,000 acres out there where  they created huge military formations. All of our allies in that part  of the world are assuming they now have to take sides in what might be  World War III. You see that what they are putting on these islands is  all military, 100 percent, just as if they are preparing for World War  III. It is a huge thing happening right now. We saw it there.   By the way, it is not just the South China Sea. We just got back from  Djibouti. The first time in the history of China, they have military  bases that are not within the confines of China. This supports the  implementation of the Nuclear Posture Review by authorizing $65 million  to develop a low-yield, submarine-launched ballistic missile. I know  that is controversial, and there will be amendments on there. We look  forward to that.   The ranking member and I don't agree on everything. This is one area  that probably we don't agree on. We want to have amendments. We want to  have an open debate. That is what we are going to have. Unfortunately,  that is going to be delayed for a period of time that I believe is  unnecessary.   Finally, the NDAA supports our allies and partners around the world.  It authorizes $5.2 billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund.   We just got back from Afghanistan. Things are going well there. We  had a chance to talk to General Nicholson and the rest over there. Some  good things are happening, despite what an unfriendly press sometimes  wants to lead you to believe.   For the fight against terrorism, it authorizes $1.2 billion for the  counter-ISIS efforts via the Train and Equip Programs in Iraq and  Syria. The Train and Equip Program is one we all agree--at least in the  committee--that it is very important to continue. It authorizes $6.3  billion for the European Deterrence Initiative and $200 million for  security assistance to Ukraine, including defensive lethal assistance.   This is something we should have done a long time ago. I happened to  be in Ukraine when they had their last election--well, actually about 3  years ago. That was a time when, for the first time in 96 years,  Ukraine didn't have one Communist in its Parliament. They did that  because they love us. Of course, people came in and started killing  them. We know what happened there. It was well publicized.   We had the opportunity to send some lethal defensive equipment over  there to help them since they have this love for the West. At that  time, the administration wouldn't allow that to take place.   Anyway, we offer $500 million for Israeli cooperative missile defense  programs. By the way, I always like to say, when talking about Israel,  there is kind of an assumption out there that they are dormant, and we  are providing this. They actually have developed some systems over  there that are superior to ours. There is no better relationship  anywhere in the world than between the United States and Israel. Good  things are happening there. The President is strongly in support of  that. Of course, we have a great guy over there who looks to us as  their closest friend.   It also includes the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act  that was adopted by the Senate Banking Committee, which will give the  Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States the authority it  needs to address some of the national security concerns.   As we move forward to considering the fiscal year 2019 NDAA, we have  to remember our primary constitutional responsibility is to provide for  the common defense of our great Nation. We forget that. People go back  home and never talk about defending America. They kind of play on this  assumption that we already have all we need and that it is no longer a  mission that is worth fighting for. We have to face the facts that this  is the most dangerous world we have ever faced. The military advantage  we once enjoyed has eroded, and we cannot delay modernizing our  capabilities and restoring readiness.   You don't have to go any further than looking at some of these  countries like North Korea. Right now, some good things are happening.  I believe, 6 days from now, a meeting will take place between Kim Jong- un and our President. It is unprecedented, and I am very excited about  it. Nonetheless, in this world today, you can have one small country  that has the capability of wiping out an American State, and it is  something we haven't been dealing with in the past. That is all part of  this bill we are talking about now that we are going to be passing and  going to conference with the House.   Today, our Nation commemorates the 74th anniversary of D-day. The  brave Americans who stormed the beaches of Normandy embodied the spirit  that continues to inspire the service and sacrifice of so many-- fighting, sometimes against unsurmountable odds, in the name of  freedom, and we won.   I urge my colleagues to keep in mind the meaning of this day  throughout consideration of this legislation, the John S. McCain  National Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. It will help assert  the quantitative and qualitative military advantage we will have. I  would almost say reassert that because we have lost it. General Dunford  made the statement that we are falling behind in our ways. It has  always been our qualitative and quantitative advantage over the enemy.  [[Page S3008]]    I hope the ranking member agrees we can move forward with an open  amendment process. This is very important. This is one we all agreed  on, and we were hoping we would be in that process right now, but it  didn't happen. Unfortunately, sometimes it is going to be lost.   We are committed to working with everyone here as soon as possible  and get the amendments rolling.   I want to yield to Senator Reed, but before I do, I want to make sure  we get on the record that I have never seen, in the years I have been  here, more cooperation than we have between the Democrats and  Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize my former  staffer, Ms. Annie Caputo, as she is finally confirmed by the Senate as  a Member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Annie has over 20 years  of experience handling nuclear energy issues, which will serve her well  in her new role at the NRC.   Annie worked as senior policy adviser on my EPW committee staff from  2007 through 2012 and again in 2015 through 2016. Her experience and  expertise is so well known and well regarded that staff and Senators on  both sides of the aisle seek her input when it comes to nuclear issues.  During her career, Annie also worked for the House Energy and Commerce  Committee and Exelon Corporation, which operates more nuclear plants  than any other company.   Her expertise was invaluable to me during the aftermath of the  Fukushima nuclear accident, in my work to ensure the NRC issued timely  decisions on new nuclear plant licenses, and most recently, she has  been central in developing the bipartisan Nuclear Energy Innovation  Act.   I want to congratulate Annie Caputo on this well-deserved  confirmation and wish her well in her new role at the NRC.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize my good friend  and former staffer, Mr. Frank Fannon, who has been confirmed to lead  the State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources.   We have seen how expanding U.S. energy exports to Eastern Europe has  supported our allies and curbed Russia's influence in the region. As  Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources, Frank can use his  leadership  [[Page S3029]]  and expertise effectively to advance American energy dominance and  enforce energy sanctions, like those against Russia and Iran.   Frank served as energy counsel to the Senate Committee on Environment  and Public Works from 2003 to 2007. While at EPW, his knowledge on  energy issues was vital. He drafted key provisions of the bipartisan  Energy Policy Act of 2005, legislation that helped to unleash American  innovation and set the conditions for today's energy abundance.   I want to congratulate Frank Fannon on this well-deserved  confirmation and wish him well in his new role at the State Department.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize my good friend  and fellow Oklahoman, Mr. Gregory Slavonic, for his Senate confirmation  as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Manpower and Reserve Affairs at  the Department of Defense.   Greg was raised in Oklahoma City, OK. He graduated with a bachelor of  science from Oklahoma State University and then enlisted in the Navy.  After completing boot camp and signalman ``A'' school he received  orders to the aircraft carrier USS Constellation (CVA 64) and completed  two western Pacific deployments in support of combat operations in  Vietnam. In 1976, he earned a master's degree from the University of  Central Oklahoma.   His military awards include the Legion of Merit Medal; Bronze Star  Medal, two awards; Meritorious Service Medal, three awards; Navy and  Marine Corps Commendation Medal, two awards; Combat Action Ribbon;  Presidential Unit Citation; and numerous other campaign and service  medals.   Throughout his 34-year career in the Navy and as chief of staff to  Senator James Lankford, Greg has served his country and his home State  of Oklahoma with great honor and distinction. He will bring those  experiences of success to this position and continue the excellence  that has been the trademark of the U.S. military.   I want to congratulate Greg Slavonic on this well-deserved  confirmation and wish him well in his new role at the DOD.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
