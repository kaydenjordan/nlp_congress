 Mr. President, I rise to speak on the opening of the  Cheyenne National Cemetery and the hard work that has been put in to  this project over the past few years.   This is a historic accomplishment for Wyoming. The Cheyenne National  Cemetery is the first veterans cemetery in Wyoming that is run by the  Department of Veterans Affairs. Before I became a Senator, Wyoming was  campaigning for a national cemetery within the State. Once I was in the  Senate, I had the opportunity to help advance this project with the  help of veterans, F.E. Warren Air Force Base, and the patriotic people  of Wyoming. They are all to be congratulated, and I know all are  thankful this day is finally here.   The opening of this national cemetery will allow veterans in rural  areas to be buried in their home State. Before it was constructed,  veterans had to go to neighboring States in order to be laid to rest.  Now, the Cheyenne National Cemetery will be used to serve approximately  22,000 veterans and their families. Wyoming has worked for a long time,  in conjunction with the VA, to give our State veterans what they  deserve: a place to rest in peace alongside their fellow  servicemembers. Burial services have also been expanded to veterans'  spouses and other eligible family members, for they too have sacrificed  so much for their country.   National cemeteries are a way to honor our service men and women and  serve as a constant reminder that freedom isn't free. It comes to us at  great cost and tremendous personal sacrifice. Each name that has been  enshrined has a story to tell about someone who left family and  friends, safety and security behind to be part of a cause much greater  than themselves. In the end, many of them gave up all of their  tomorrows so that today's world might be a better place for us all to  live.   I am extremely proud of the steps that the VA and the great State of  Wyoming have taken in order to honor our veterans. We must never forget  the sacrifices of these brave men and women.                            ____________________
