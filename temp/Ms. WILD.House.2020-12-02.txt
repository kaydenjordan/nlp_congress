 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Alan Jennings, a  constituent of mine and a very good friend, who has spent decades  working to weed out hunger and poverty in my community.   Alan joined the Community Action Committee of the Lehigh Valley,  CACLV, as a young man in 1980. For the past 30 years, he has served as  the executive director of the agency, touching countless lives,  challenging barriers of race and bias, and working to expand diversity  in the nonprofit sector.   Now Alan is stepping down to get some much-needed rest after a  lifetime of hard work.   Under Alan's leadership, CACLV's funding has increased 30-fold. His  entire life's work has been about building a just and equitable society  for all.   From providing food to hungry families to raising funds for low- income and working-class kids to be the first in their families to go  to college, Alan has lived the mission of community action every single  day.   Alan, on behalf of the people of the Seventh District, thank you for  your extraordinary leadership. We are so grateful to you. As you begin  a new chapter, I join people in every corner of our community in  wishing you the very best.                            ____________________
