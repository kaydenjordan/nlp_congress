 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I hadn't had this in the opening, but I want to disagree  with my friend right off the top. The President of the United States  does not work for the Congress of the United States. He works for the  American people, and he heads up a branch of government that is a  coequal branch of government. So, on that, we will have a long  discussion.   Mr. Speaker, it has been a very eventful week in the Rules Committee,  and it is only Tuesday. Last night, the committee met and reported out  a rule that covers two drastically different measures. H.R. 2740 is an  appropriations package that covered first 5 and then 4 of the 12  appropriations bills for fiscal year 2020. We also considered H. Res.  430, a resolution that gives authority to the Office of the General  Counsel of the House of Representatives to seek to enforce certain  subpoenas for documents through litigation.   Shortly after we finish here, the committee will again convene to  consider the remainder of the appropriations package, which will be on  the floor as part of a separate rule tomorrow.   Meanwhile, our Members will attempt the miracle of being in two  places at once as we continue to debate H. Res. 430, which falls into  our original jurisdiction here on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 430 comes from a dispute over documents relating  to the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the  2016 Presidential election. The dispute also stems from the inherent  oversight authority of Congress and our ability to perform oversight  functions over the executive branch. It falls into the fuzzy boundaries  between the branches of governments as to when and how we may compel  the executive branch to turn over documents to the legislative branch.   I lay out that framework because there is an important point here  that is being lost. The Democratic majority clearly wants to make this  dispute entirely about this President, this Attorney General, this  White House counsel, this investigation, this subpoena of documents.  The Democrats want to focus attention there because they think it helps  them politically to do so. But this dispute really shouldn't be about  just that. It should, rather, be about the difficult and thorny  questions that emerge in a system like ours with three branches of  government with checks and balances.   In a sense, what the majority is seeking to do here today is  completely unprecedented, both in its intent and in its execution.  Consider the only other times the House has filed a lawsuit to seek to  enforce a subpoena for documents. It has happened twice before, Mr.  Speaker, once in 2007, to seek documents from former White House  Counsel Harriet Miers, and again in 2012, to seek documents from then- Attorney General Eric Holder as a result of the congressional  investigation into the Fast and Furious scandal.   In both of these cases, the House had already voted to hold both  Miers and Holder in contempt of Congress before filing suit, which has  not yet happened in this case. In the Miers case, 138 days elapsed from  the first document request to the Judiciary Committee voting to hold  her in contempt. In the Holder case, it was significantly longer, in  that 464 days elapsed from the first document request to the committee  voting to hold him in contempt. That was well over a year.   Here, the majority is forcing us to rush forward at a much faster  pace. Just 44 days elapsed from the date of the first document request  to the Attorney General until the Judiciary Committee voted to hold him  in contempt. James Holzhauer has been champion of ``Jeopardy!'' for  longer than that.   I don't understand the majority's haste here. Without exhausting all  other options--continuing negotiation, discussion, compromise, and  turning to a vote on contempt as the last resort--the majority is,  instead, pushing this forward into litigation with the executive  branch. In doing so, they may well be placing the House in a position  that causes significant long-term damage to the institution.   When this matter goes before the courts, it will do so as a case of  first impression and under an untested legal theory. In both the Miers  and Holder cases, the House previously voted to hold those two  individuals in contempt of Congress. Nothing like that has been done  here. Using untested tactics like this could set a dangerous precedent  that harms us all, Republicans and Democrats, in the long run.    Finally, I would also note that it is not clear what this resolution  will ultimately accomplish. Since the House has not yet exercised all  the tools in its tool kit, and since it is not clear that the  negotiations with the Justice Department and the White House over the  documents at issue are at an end, this whole thing may be nothing more  than sound and fury. Indeed, given how quickly the majority is rushing  into things, it seems unlikely that the only course of action left in  the House is to file a lawsuit.   I strongly urge the majority to continue working with the Justice  Department and the White House to find a resolution to these issues  without resorting to knee-jerk lawsuits that may ultimately damage the  House as an institution.  [[Page H4405]]    Today, we are also beginning consideration of H.R. 2740, an  appropriations package covering 5 of 12 appropriations bills: Labor,  Health and Human Services, and Education; Legislative Branch; Defense;  State and Foreign Operations; and Energy and Water Development. These  five bills cover over 70 percent of our total discretionary spending  for fiscal year 2020.   To be precise, Mr. Speaker, we were to do five bills. At the last  moment, the majority pulled the Legislative Branch appropriations bill.  I will let them explain why at their leisure.   As a longtime member of the Appropriations Committee, I am pleased  that we are beginning to move the appropriations bills to the floor.  Unfortunately, the bills before us have numerous flaws, most notably  that they are marked to allocation levels that aren't realistic.   As we move forward through the appropriations process, I think we  need to be clear about the challenges we face this year.   At the end of September, fiscal year 2019 expires, and sequestration  cuts contained in the Budget Control Act of 2011 will automatically  take effect for fiscal year 2020. In order to prevent that, we need to  come to a bipartisan, bicameral budget deal that the House, the Senate,  and the President can all agree on. If we don't, then it doesn't really  matter what fake number the House marks to. Sequestration will hit, and  our defense budget will automatically be slashed by 11 percent and our  nondefense budget by 9 percent below the allocations of 2019.   The spending levels in these appropriations bills are not just  ambitious; they are unrealistic. Not only are the funding levels for  many of these bills too high, so high that the Senate and the President  will never agree to them, but the allocations the Appropriations  Committee used reflect the misguided notion that any increase in  defense spending must be matched by an increase in nondefense spending  that is more than twice as high.   That is simply not a realistic assessment of our national priorities  or the fiscal limitations imposed on us by our rising national debt.  The defense provision of this bill, for example, comes in at $8 billion  less than the President told us was needed to adequately fund the  military, maintain readiness, and be prepared to confront international  threats.   After years of severe underfunding of our Armed Forces and at a time  when threats are emerging everywhere around the globe, spending less  than the administration asks for on defense in order to push more money  into domestic programs is not a wise course of action.   I am disappointed that the majority chose to strip out pro-life  provisions that have been carried in appropriations bills for years.  Instead, they added controversial pro-abortion riders that virtually  guarantee no Republican support whatsoever for this package.   As the former chair and current ranking member of the Labor, Health  and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am  familiar with the need for compromise on that particular piece of  legislation. But by pushing forward with blatantly partisan riders like  these, the majority is guaranteeing the outcome of these bills: dead on  arrival in a Republican-led Senate and no chance of getting a  Republican President's signature.   In the coming months, I hope we work through these problems, as we  did last year, frankly. If the majority intends to move forward with  unrealistic spending levels and insists on maintaining partisan riders,  then we are simply guaranteeing a failed appropriations process.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, our failure has consequences. A best- case scenario is a yearlong continuing resolution that funds the  government at the exact same level as the current year. That is the  best scenario if we fail. The worst-case scenario is another government  shutdown or sequestration that automatically cuts all government  funding levels. Neither of these is a good outcome for the House as an  institution, for the Federal Government, or more importantly, for the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, although I cannot support either bill before us today, I  am hopeful that, eventually, we will reach a bipartisan, bicameral  compromise on spending that the vast majority of Members in this House  can support. That requires realistic funding levels and elimination of  partisan riders from this package. The spending package before us today  may be a worthy starting point, but it will take hard work and  compromise to move the final bill that can become law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the  great State of Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin Hern).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). My good friend is the most  eloquent advocate for life in this Chamber.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule immediately to bring up H.R. 3056 for  consideration under an open rule.   The bill provides $4.5 billion of funding to address the immediate  humanitarian crisis on the southern border. This is a crisis of  significant proportions, Mr. Speaker.   Our facilities for holding new arrivals, particularly children and  the vulnerable unaccompanied minors, are already at the breaking point.  Simply put, we need more resources, and we need them today.   This is not the first time we have needed to provide supplemental  appropriations for this purpose. Back in 2014, then-President Barack  Obama asked us for $3.7 billion in supplemental resources for precisely  the same purpose. He got it. At the time, we had 60,000 unaccompanied  minors who arrived in 2014. We face a similar and, frankly, larger  humanitarian crisis today.    President Obama was right to request supplemental funds to deal with  the crisis then. We would be right to appropriate supplemental funds to  address that similar crisis now.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my friend made reference a little bit earlier to  amendments. He talked about the total number of amendments, but he left  out the distribution of amendments. So, as the House considers this  rule, I think we ought to take a look at how the Rules Committee has  handled making amendments in order so far this Congress.   The rule on the floor today is making 106 amendments in order, out of  540 submitted, with hopefully more to come with tomorrow's rule.   Today's rule includes 22 amendments sponsored solely by Republicans.  Sadly, this is considered an improvement over the majority's previous  efforts.   With today's rule, in total, this Congress, 73 percent of all  amendments made in order have been sponsored solely by Democrats--73  percent. Just 16 percent are sponsored by Republicans, with 11 percent  bipartisan.   How does this compare with the last Congress? When Republicans were  the majority party, 45 percent of all amendments made in order were  sponsored solely by Democrats. Only 38 percent were sponsored solely by  Republicans, with another 17 percent being bipartisan.   At the beginning of this Congress, the Democratic majority repeatedly  promised a new, robust, and open process at the Rules Committee. They  pledged that good ideas would be welcomed, no matter where they came  from, and that thoughtful amendments would not be blocked.   Unfortunately, they have a long way to go to keep that promise. I  think the numbers speak volumes.   We are 5 months into the 116th Congress. Should we expect this trend  of shutting out minority party ideas to continue? Should we expect the  same course of action in our rule tomorrow and in our rule on the  second appropriations package next week and in  [[Page H4409]]  other rules in the weeks and months to come?   When will the promises made by the Democratic majority be kept? If  not now, when?   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge opposition to the rule. The rule will  make in order two measures: H. Res. 430 and H.R. 2740.    H. Res. 430 is a premature and ineffective resolution that will push  the House forward into untested and ill-timed litigation with the  executive branch over the subpoena of documents. While the House has an  important oversight role to play, we must be careful to exercise that  role wisely and carefully, lest we cause long-term damage to the  institution.   H.R. 2740 is a package of 5 of the 12 outstanding appropriations  bills that use unrealistic allocation levels and eliminate longstanding  pro-life protections that must be restored before these bills can  garner any Republican support.   I actually look forward to working with my colleagues in the House  and the Senate as we move forward in the appropriations process, and I  urge the majority to compromise with the Senate and the White House in  order to achieve a final spending deal that avoids drastic  sequestration cuts or, worse yet, another government shutdown.   I think that is actually the great lesson of the appropriations  process, Mr. Speaker. We know we can do this. We did it last year, and  we did it pretty well together.   But my friends have to get past the idea that they can impose their  will on a Republican Senate and a Republican President. They are simply  not going to be able to do that. They are going to have to bargain to a  middle ground and compromise.   In the Appropriations Committee, as a rule, we do that, and we do it  pretty well. I am hopeful that we can continue going forward on that  front.   I am concerned, however, that the vitriol, if you will, that we see  in the investigative and oversight efforts of our friends will spill  into that process and lead us into a very difficult situation in  September.   So, as we move forward on the appropriations front, again, I hope all  of us relearn the virtues of compromise, understand that we were all  sent here by the American people, that we have to work with one another  to accomplish something, and that none of us can impose their will on  the other.   With that, I look forward to working with my friend and with his  colleagues and, certainly, through the appropriations process to making  sure that the government is appropriately funded and well governed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
