 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate Korean-American Day. I  am proud to represent the largest Korean-American population of any  congressional district in the country.   Tomorrow we recognize the 119th anniversary of the arrival of the  first Korean immigrants to the United States, and the recognition that  they have contributed to the life and well-being of the people of the  United States for so many years.   One person that is an example of that is Erin Pak, who leads the  Kheir Center, a community health center in Los Angeles. During the  pandemic, they kept their doors open, taking care of anybody who needed  help; everything from testing, to vaccine boosters, to people who are  Korean, Latino, it didn't matter their background. But their doors were  open during the toughest times.   It is with that kind of commitment that Korean Americans have really  made not only L.A. a better place to live, but the United States a  better place to live.   So I urge my colleagues to support my resolution to recognize the  ideals of Korean-American Day and the essential contributions of Korean  Americans to American life.                            ____________________
