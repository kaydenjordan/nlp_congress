 Madam Speaker, last week, the Sunshine State was  devastated by the 393rd mass shooting of 2019.   On December 6, a gunman opened fire at the Naval Air Station in  Pensacola, Florida, killing three and wounding eight. One of the  victims is Pinellas County's very own Mohammed Haitham.   Nineteen-year-old Mo, as he was known to his family and friends, was  a track star at Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg and a shining  example of all the best our community has to offer.   He joined the Navy to serve his country shortly after finishing high  school, with a dream of graduating from flight school.   Our Nation was robbed of a sailor, and a St. Pete family was robbed  of a son.   My heart goes out to Mo's family and loved ones as they try to make  sense of the senseless.   Madam Speaker, we stand with the Haitham family. The entire community  is behind them.   I pray for all those affected in Pensacola, and I pray for Congress  to take action on gun violence.                            ____________________
