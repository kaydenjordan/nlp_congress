 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my dear friend, Detective  Mike Waggoner, for his service with the Knoxville Police Department.  You see Mike in this picture with that incredible moustache.   Detective Waggoner joined the department on November 11, 1974, and I  note that I was in the fourth grade at that time. He is celebrating 49  years of service with the KPD.   Waggoner embodies all the characteristics the Knoxville Police  Department likes to instill in future generations of officers.   As such, every year, an officer of the department is awarded the Mike  Waggoner Leadership Award. This award is given to the officer that  exhibits strong passion, dedication, and thoroughness while inspiring  those around them to do the same.   This award was named for Detective Waggoner as he has spent his  career in service to the people of Knoxville and is a respected leader  among his fellow officers.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Detective Waggoner on his 49 years of  service. He is a great friend, a great father, and a great husband. I  thank him for all he has done for our city.                        Honoring Captain Jack Gillooly     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jack Gillooly, an  American hero who served his country during World War II.   At 103 years old, he is believed to be the oldest living Navy  football player and Navy aviator. He played in three Army-Navy football  games and never lost to Army. Jack played in the last game held at West  Point in 1943.   Jack had a long list of highlights, but most would say his best was  his tackle of Glenn Davis, a Heisman Trophy-winning Army halfback.   After graduation, he was assigned to the USS Columbia and fought in  the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the longest Naval battle in World War II. He  survived three kamikaze attacks on his cruiser.   Jack wanted to get off the water and into the air, so he applied and  was selected to become a Naval aviator. During the Cuban Missile Crisis  in the early 1960s, he was the commanding officer of an antisubmarine  fighter.   Captain Gillooly was also part of the Navy's first electronic  countermeasure squadron during the Korean war, and he was the base  commander at Orlando Air Base, which was later converted into the  Orlando Naval Training Center.   Our country's heroes are the men and women of our Armed Forces, Mr.  Speaker. It is my honor to recognize Captain Jack Gillooly as the  Tennessee Second District's November 2023 Veteran of the Month.                       Honoring Colonel Edmund Morrisey     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Colonel Ed  Morrisey who passed away on November 7 at the age of 94.   In 1952, Colonel Morrisey was commissioned a second lieutenant in the  Reserves in the U.S. Air Force and placed on Active Duty as a weapons  controller.   In 1968, the colonel became the first commander of the I.G. Brown  Training and Education Center at McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base.  He went on to build the Air National Guard's premier professional  military education institute, leading it for 15 years.   He is the only field officer in the National Guard to have earned the  Order of the Sword, the enlisted force's highest honor to be bestowed  on officers. The sword symbolizes truth, justice, and righteous power  given to a leader among leaders.   Ed is survived by his wife of 41 years, Pauline; his son, John;  stepdaughter,  [[Page H5943]]  Cindy; his grandchildren and his great-grandchildren. We won't forget  Ed's service to this country and the impact he had on those he loved,  Mr. Speaker.                      Honoring the Life of Ross Bagwell     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Ross Bagwell,  Sr., who passed away on November 23 at the age of 91.   Ross grew up in east Tennessee where he watched his first television  broadcast. He was not only a loving husband and father but also a  trailblazer for television producing, bringing east Tennessee to the  forefront of America's television production.   Most people think that it all happens in Los Angeles or New York;  but, no, it happens right there in my hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee.   He originally worked on the Howdy Doody show. He produced hundreds of  hours of programing, including ``I-40 Paradise,'' ``Club Dance,''  ``America's Castles,'' and Nickelodeon's ``Hey Dude,'' shows that I  actually watched a lot of, especially the country music.   Ross was always very kind to me. He always catered in barbecue when I  would visit him. He was a dreamer with a genuine love for creativity.    He always talked about wanting to build a waterfall in Knoxville on  the Tennessee River, right there on the riverfront. I, of course, was  the county mayor at the time. We couldn't make it happen because it  would have been a city project.   Through CineTel and RIVR Media, the do-it-yourself concept, which you  see so prevalent out there now, was actually a creation of Ross  Bagwell.   He met the love of his life, Sue, in the eighth grade. They were  together their whole lives until her passing in 2022.   Ross is survived by his daughter, Dee; brother, Joe; two  grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. He will be missed by those  who love him, Mr. Speaker, but he will not be forgotten.                            ____________________
