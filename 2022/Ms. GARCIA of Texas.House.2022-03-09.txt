 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Girl Scouts of San Jacinto Council on their century of service to the  girls of southeast Texas. One hundred years ago, the Girl Scouts of San  Jacinto Council was founded in Texas. Today, the council has grown  immensely to 54,000 Girl Scout members. That is a lot of girls who are  being empowered to lead and serve.   You see, Girl Scouts are changemakers who become bold and strong  leaders. In fact, the 117th Congress boasts a record number of women  members, and more than 55 percent of us are Girl Scout alums.   While I never really was a Girl Scout, I served on their board for  many years in Houston, and I know firsthand no matter what these Girl  Scouts choose to do in life, they will be well-prepared.   I can't wait to see what the next 100 years will bring to the Girl  Scouts of San Jacinto Council.                            ____________________
