 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 268,  legislation to add the Fort Brown earthworks to the Palo Alto  Battlefield National Historic Park, and I urge my colleagues to vote in  favor of this bill.   I introduced this legislation to preserve a piece of history that is  not only  [[Page H3721]]  central to south Texas, but to our great Nation. Adding this piece of  Fort Brown is critical to interpreting the Mexican-American War and the  changes made to our international boundary. It is a record of our  Nation's border expansion extending to the Pacific Ocean.   In hopes of establishing the Rio Grande River as the southern border  of the United States, General Taylor ordered the construction of Fort  Texas in March of 1846.   On May 3, 1846, Mexican General Mariano Arista attacked Fort Texas.  Under the command of General Zachary Taylor, U.S. forces, including  Lieutenant Ulysses S. Grant, fought at the Battle of Palo Alto and the  Battle of Resaca de la Palma, two decisive victories that would force  the Mexican retreat across the Rio Grande.   While the siege produced limited damage to the fort, Major Jacob  Brown, who had command of the post, was mortally wounded in its  defense. Afterward, General Taylor named the site Fort Brown, and the  surrounding area became the town of Brownsville, Texas.   The Fort Brown earthworks is the only standing architecture in the  United States associated with the Mexican-American War. Bringing the  earthworks into the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park  helps tell our Nation's story and protects this important symbol of the  transformation of the country resulting from the 19th century westward  expansion.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  legislation so we can protect an essential piece of our history that  will help us to tell the story of our Nation long into the future. I  thank the chairman and the ranking member for their support in this  legislation.
