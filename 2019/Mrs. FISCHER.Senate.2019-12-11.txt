 Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues to honor  my friend, the senior Senator from Georgia. At the end of this year,  Senator Isakson will retire after 20 years of service to the people of  Georgia in Washington.   After protecting our Nation in the Georgia Air National Guard,  graduating from the University of Georgia, and serving as a  representative in his State legislature, the door opened for a son from  Atlanta to run for Congress. Georgia saw in him then what we see in him  now: a principled leader, a skillful communicator, and a man worth  trusting. It is no surprise that the people of Georgia have renewed  their trust in him time and time again. And I know I speak for my  colleagues when I say that we are grateful they did.   After six years representing Georgia's Sixth Congressional District,  the Senate gained a true statesman when he entered in 2005. When I was  preparing for these remarks, I came across one of his Senate reelection  speeches. I thought it was particularly revealing to his character and  how he carries himself in the Senate. He told the crowd that was  cheering him on:         I promise you I am ready . . . I am ready to tackle       whatever problem life brings to us as Americans.        With my feet rooted in conservative principles, my belief       in God the Father Almighty, and my belief in the people of       Georgia.    Mr. President, that is who Senator Isakson is.   No matter the obstacles that came his way, he has always been a  steady hand--strengthened by his enduring faith and deep respect for  his constituents. One of those mountains to climb was working on behalf  of our veterans to improve conditions at the VA and end the backlog  that was building for years. Under his leadership on the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, I was proud to work with him to pass the CHIP-In for  Vets Act into law in 2016. The bill allows local communities to take  the lead on new projects by permitting the VA to accept private  contributions to ensure VA projects are finished both on time and on  budget. His support of this bill meant that Nebraskans have the  opportunity to save millions of dollars when constructing the new Omaha  VA Ambulatory Clinic. A GAO report indicates that our new facility is  now $34 million under budget and 4\1/2\ months ahead of schedule. I  know generations of Nebraskans will be grateful for his help in getting  this bill across the finish line.   On a more personal note, one of my fondest memories of Johnny was our  trip to Normandy, France, this year to commemorate the 75th anniversary  of D-Day. As a veteran himself, everyone in this body understood the  abounding respect and gratitude he carried for our Nation's  servicemembers as he led the delegation--the same respect and gratitude  he shows to our veterans everyday as he leads the Senate in providing  resources to meet our veterans' needs.   Mr. President, I think if there is any moment that foreshadowed  Johnny's service to Georgia and our Nation, it was his speech  immediately after being sworn in to the House of Representatives. He  turned to his new colleagues and said, ``I hope, in years to come, I'll  be a respected friend, and one who joined with you to make a difference  in the United States of America.'' What a respected friend he has  become. What a difference he has made. It has been a honorable journey,  and it ends with us confirming that the legacy he has worked hard to  achieve from the very beginning has now come true in the end.   Johnny, you are a great leader, a careful listener, and a gifted  legislator. It has been a privilege to work with you and call you  friend. You have served the State of Georgia and our country well. I  wish you and Diane all the best on this next chapter in your lives.  Godspeed.                            ____________________
