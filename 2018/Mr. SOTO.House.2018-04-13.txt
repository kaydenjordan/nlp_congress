 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a hero of our district and  a wise woman of Haines City.   Mary Naomi Ginwright Sanks is 99\1/2\ years old, and a living legend.   As a resident of Haines City, she is a community matriarch, who has  and continues to dedicate her life serving others.   Ms. Sanks has provided a home to more than 20 foster children, and  adopted 4 children of diverse races and gender.   She is a hard worker who continuously extends her hand to help by  volunteering to serve at her church and community.   Mother Sanks, as she is affectionately known by the community, is a  devoted and compassionate mentor and caregiver who continues to  routinely cook and serve food for those who are sick and bed restricted  throughout the community.   When residents seek Mother Sanks' advice regarding how to navigate  the complexities of life, she can often be heard responding with a  smooth smile and warm words of wisdom and advice to say, ``keep it  moving.''                            ____________________
