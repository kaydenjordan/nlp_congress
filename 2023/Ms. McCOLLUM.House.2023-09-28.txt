 Mr. Speaker, Republicans spent 3 weeks trying to bring  the Defense appropriations act to the floor. Three times it went to the  Rules Committee. The first two times, the rule failed on the floor, and  it failed, in part, because a small minority of Republicans do not  support any Ukrainian assistance, including support for Ukraine that  has been in the base Defense bill for 9 years.   The Republican Conference knew for weeks that this was a problem for  them, and that is why they have created this pseudo minibus that we  have been working on the past few days. It is loaded with extreme  social policy riders to appease the far right so that their party can  advance a Defense bill.    Earlier this week, Republicans could have used the Rules Committee to  strip out the Ukraine funding from the Defense bill. They chose not to  do so then. Instead, the Rules Committee made two Republican amendments  in order to strike any Ukrainian funding. Then that amendment came to  the floor, and they asked the House to do its will.   The Biggs amendment was rejected by this House by a vote of 104-330.  The Gaetz amendment was also rejected 93-339. In a closely divided  Congress, this is about as clearly a bipartisan vote as you can get. In  both cases, the Republicans and the Democrats stood together with  Ukraine, but the Republicans found out that they still had a problem  with the extreme right in their party.   Even after the votes, the vocal Republican minority threatened the  [[Page H4794]]  Speaker again to take down the Defense bill, all because the votes  didn't go their way, so here we are today.   The Speaker has sent the Defense bill back to the Rules Committee to  override the will of this House in its most basic democratic process of  amending bills.                                time  1515    It is ironic that the Speaker is so focused on passing the defense  bill in such an undemocratic way. He has wasted weeks letting the far  right abuse the Republican majority, while at the same time failing to  address the impending government shutdown.   Today, these extreme Members are abusing the entire House of  Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, Members, the lessons from the last 3 weeks could not be  more clear. When you don't stand up to bullies, they continue to bully  you. That is what is happening here. The bullies in the Republican  Conference have won once again at the expense of this institution. That  is why I would ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question.   Let's stand up to the bullies in this Chamber. Let's strip this  outrageous provision from the rule and return this House to regular  order where every vote matters, and when the vote of the majority of  the House speaks, it is respected.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The Speaker and this House have catered to the extreme right again  because they refuse to write a Defense bill that can get bipartisan  support. So, here we are again, debating Ukraine security assistance.   As I said during the rules debate, we debated this funding twice  yesterday. The Biggs amendment was rejected by the House by a vote of  104-330, and the Gaetz amendment was rejected by this House 93-339.   We debated this. This House considered similar amendments in the  National Defense Authorization Act earlier this summer. At that time,  the Greene amendment was rejected by a vote of 89-341, and the Gaetz  amendment was rejected by 70-385.                                time  1830    These amendments were rejected because a majority of this House  stands for preserving democracy. We stand for working with our  democratic allies in preventing Vladimir Putin from seizing land  through force, and these amendments were rejected because of the  strong, bipartisan support for including consistent funding for Ukraine  in the base Defense bill.   The Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative has been part of the base  bill since fiscal year 2015. The support has included training for  Ukrainian troops, munitions, spare parts for vehicles, weapon systems,  and medical supplies, and the Department of Defense has mechanisms in  place to monitor our assistance.   That is the work of the DOD Security Assistance Group-Ukraine. I also  have traveled, and I traveled with subcommittee Republicans and  Democrats to review how the training and equipping the Ukrainians were  moving forward because, I agree, congressional oversight is important.   The funding has been critical to ensure that Ukrainians could  withstand Vladimir Putin's invasion last year. Congress began this  support after Russia's unprovoked, illegal seizure of the Crimean  Peninsula in 2014. Five different chairs of the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee across both parties have consistently included this  funding in the base Defense appropriation bill, and that includes  Chairman Calvert, myself last Congress, and Chairwoman Granger when she  chaired the subcommittee.   We included this funding because Vladimir Putin is a bully. He  threatens just not Ukraine but global stability. Putin uses  paramilitary groups like the brutal Wagner organization to destabilize  African nations using murder, rape, and torture to achieve his foreign  policy goals.   In February 2022, Putin wanted to take all of Ukraine and overthrow  this democratically elected government. Russia deliberately fired  cruise missiles into apartment buildings, shopping malls, schools,  daycare centers, and even hospitals.   It is clear: Putin is a war criminal, and he must be confronted. That  is why this Congress has consistently included funding as a priority in  this base bill--to help Ukraine fight back against this illegal, unjust  invasion of their territory. It is important that we, along with our  allies, continue to support their fight for freedom.   The rest of the world is watching, including other authoritarian  nations, as to how the United States, NATO, and other allies continue  to support Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me and others bipartisanly  to support this bill one more time again and vote for supporting  Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), ranking member of the full Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), a leader in the Ukrainian Caucus here in the U.S.  Congress.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, as I have said many times this week, this  Congress has consistently provided this funding for the last 9 fiscal  years. I hope we will work hard to make sure that this funding returns  in conference back to the base bill in the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee.   Providing training and equipment to Ukraine has helped them withstand  Russia's full scale invasion, and continuing this support in the base  bill on a bipartisan basis is important to maintaining that effort.   I had the privilege of meeting women from Ukraine who are in the  Ukrainian ambulance corps. They drive around in subcompacts. They drive  around without bulletproof vests and whatever first aid equipment they  can find firsthand to save lives.   I have had the honor and privilege of meeting people who are going  through our training courses that we do with NATO in Germany, as the  chair was referring to. I had the privilege before the invasion  happened in February 2022 of meeting the mayor of Kyiv where he was  just asking if he could make sure that the United States had the right  caliber bullets for the hunting rifles and some of the guns that the  Ukrainian citizens in Kyiv and the surrounding areas had so they could  support their military should the invasion occur. We did that. It was  an honor to work with those who made sure that that happened.   Mr. Speaker, recently I had a friend in Nisswa, Minnesota, who was  returning home from Kyiv where she had not only time to spend with her  mother and go mushroom hunting and watch firsthand the post-traumatic  stress that her family is dealing with, but saying goodbye to a cousin  who is returning to the front lines after healing from a wound.   Ukrainians are fighting. They are fighting for their very existence,  and they are fighting for their strongly held democratic values that we  share and, as I said, for their very existence. They are standing up to  an authoritarian bully, and we should continue to stand up with them  and support them in the ways we have been doing.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
