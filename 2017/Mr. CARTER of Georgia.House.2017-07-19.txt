 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel  Thomas Kunkel, who retired on July 10, 2017, as the commander of the  23rd Wing at Moody Air Force Base, near Valdosta, Georgia.   Colonel Kunkel has served in the United States Air Force for over 20  years, and he has logged nearly 3,000 hours of flight. As commander of  the 23rd Wing, he led over 5,000 airmen spread over four bases  throughout the country.   An example of his extraordinary leadership and bravery occurred when  one of his fellow airmen was shot down behind enemy lines during the  Kosovo conflict in 1999. Colonel Kunkel bravely led a successful  mission to rescue the missing pilot that was shot down by a missile.   Colonel Kunkel was also a part of the Air and Joint Staffs in  Washington, D.C., that serve as advisers to the President of the United  States.   He was stationed all over America, in addition to his time abroad in  Iceland and Qatar, defending the freedoms we all greatly enjoy.   I am proud to rise today to honor Colonel Kunkel for his leadership,  his commitment to our country, and his commitment to our airmen.  Colonel Kunkel will now begin service in the Secretary of the Air Force  Legislative Liaison Office here in Washington, D.C. I wish him all the  best.           Honoring Ernie Lee, State of Georgia Teacher of the Year     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Ernie Lee, who was named the 2016 Teacher of the Year for the State of  Georgia.   Mr. Lee is a dedicated U.S. Government, civics, and history teacher  to his students at Windsor Forest High School on Savannah's south side.   After being named as Georgia's Teacher of the Year, Mr. Lee was a  finalist for National Teacher of the Year.   Before becoming a teacher in 2008, Mr. Lee practiced law for over 20  years. You can clearly tell through his demeanor and passion that he  discovered his true calling when he began teaching.   Mr. Lee is currently working as a fellow at the Smithsonian Institute  in Washington, D.C., studying the State of Georgia's historical  relationship with Indian Nations, specifically the Supreme Court case,  Cherokee Nation v. Georgia.   His research during the fellowship is centered around writing and  publishing lesson plans on the topic. I can't thank Mr. Lee enough for  his dedication to Georgia's students and his ability to inspire them to  learn about history and government.                    Recognizing the Life of James P. Burns     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life of Mr. James P. Burns of Warner Robins, Georgia, who passed away  on April 31, 2017, shortly after celebrating his 100th birthday.   Mr. Burns used his 100 years to make his country and his community a  better place to live. Mr. Burns served in the Army Air Corps and the  United States Air Force from 1940 to 1960, fighting for his country  during World War II and the Korean war.   After being honorably discharged from the Air Force, Mr. Burns worked  another 16 years for the Department of Defense before retiring at  Robins Air Force Base in Georgia.   Upon his retirement from the DOD, Mr. Burns and his wife, Lucille,  dedicated their lives to helping fellow members of the south Georgia  community. In his 20 years, Mr. Burns volunteered over 14,500 hours at  the Houston Medical Hospital. When he wasn't volunteering for the  hospital, Mr. Burns could be found helping seniors do their taxes or  transporting food for the local food bank.   I am proud to recognize Mr. Burns' life today and his dedication to  the community. He will certainly be missed.                            ____________________
