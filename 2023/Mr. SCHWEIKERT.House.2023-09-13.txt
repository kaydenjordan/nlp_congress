 Mr. Speaker, as a courtesy and also the fact that the  gentleman did a kindness to me a while back--so what goes around comes  around--I am going to give Mr. Hoyer a couple more minutes to finish  his speech.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois  (Ms. Kelly) so that she may complete her comments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Hoyer has been kind to me. There was  a while back when we were beating each other up on the floor, I think  he gave me more time to finish. Sometimes you remember those things.   Mr. Speaker, I am well caffeinated, and I am angry, so let's actually  have some fun on the truth with math. I am terrified what is going on  around here because we are making crap up. So let's actually do math.  [[Page H4290]]    Mr. Speaker, this is what we were borrowing per second over the last  12 months. Every single second we were borrowing $72,932. Every second  we borrow 72,000, and 20,000 of it is just interest, and it gets  dramatically worse between now and the rest of the decade.   There is a punch line here I need you to understand. How many times  have you listened to Members walk behind these microphones and do this:  Well, I don't get to vote on mandatory spending, I only vote on  discretionary. Seriously, you have been here how long, Mr. Speaker? It  is our mantra. Well, I vote on defense and nondefense discretionary,  and that is like 30 percent of the budget. It is actually closer to 27.   Well, guess what? Every dime we as Members of Congress now vote on is  borrowed. It is all borrowed money. Look, I threw together this chart-- thank you to the staff--but in the current budget year the  appropriation was about $1.8 trillion, 1.8, 1.3, and in the July update  we have spent about $1.7 trillion on discretionary. This is not  Medicare. This is not Social Security. That is this orange part here.  We have functionally in the last 12 months we have borrowed $2.3  trillion.   Does anyone see the math problem?   The 2023 discretionary spending budget was going to be 1 trillion,  831 billion, and we are going to borrow, when this fiscal year is  over--my math is encroaching in on $2.2 trillion, so my staff thinks it  is going to be 2.1. You know, what is $100 billion between friends?   I need you to process what I am saying. If anyone out there is  listening, if there is any staffer sitting in your office watching the  television, understand everything your Member of Congress votes on,  everything is borrowed money.   Tell me, do you remember, it was a year--actually, let's go back  where I can say something personal. In February, March I came behind  this very microphone and I predicted saying, do you know I think we are  actually heading towards borrowing $1.8 trillion, and I got mocked. I  have to apologize, I was wrong. It wasn't $1.8 trillion. We are heading  towards 2.1, 2.2. It is much worse.   You just heard the left talking about how wonderful everything is.  Explain to me how in May last year, a year ago, May 2022, we thought  the budget deficit for this year would be about mid-800s, 860, $870  billion, and now we are heading toward 2.2. What happened?   Medicare costs went up dramatically. Tax receipts have fallen. You  heard about how wonderful this economy is. Isn't it neat? We are doing  all these subsidized projects. The government is handing out money to  anyone who wants to build a factory. Yay, a socialized, nationalized  economy. We functionally soft nationalized the chip industry. Isn't it  wonderful? Think of what is going on. Yet the tax revenues have fallen  actually fairly dramatically. Brilliant economics once again from what  the left did last year.   Then the third thing no one seems to want to fixate on, that  Inflation Reduction Act that they passed, you know, that they were  celebrating here, if you even read what the leftwing economists say in  their journals, okay, about half of inflation was supply chain stress,  and yes, half of it was the excessive spending.   Okay. So the people in my community, unless you have had a 20 percent  pay hike, if you live in the Phoenix-Scottsdale area, you are poorer  today. You are poorer today than you were 24 months ago. Will the left  take responsibility for that? Will they take responsibility for 50  percent of it?   This is the insanity, and the wheels are coming off, and no one else  seems willing to come behind these microphones and tell the truth about  what is happening.   Every dime we vote on--because remember Social Security, veterans  benefits, and those things are on autopilot. They are mandatory. They  are earned benefits. They are a formula. No one here votes on them. It  is borrowed money. So the old days when you heard Republicans come  behind the microphone saying, well, if we would just get rid of waste  and fraud, if we would just get rid of foreign aid we will be fine.  Foreign aid is about 12 days of borrowing, and I will show you a number  of things where Democrats, the left, makes crap up.   The dollar amounts--well, if we would just tax rich people more, if  we would just get rid of the threshold on Social Security. I am going  to show you it gets nowhere near the types of moneys they misrepresent  to you. We won't use the word ``lie'' tonight. I am going to try to do  my best.   All right. We are just going to run through a number of these because  I gave away a little time, and I only have a half an hour tonight-- actually, I probably only have 20 minutes left--trying to start to  demonstrate how fragile we are.   There was a bond auction about 4 hours ago, 5 hours ago of 30-year  paper here, and it all sold at the very top of the market, basically  meaning if you thought interest rates were going down tomorrow, they  are not. You are starting to see actually how fragile we are. We are  starting to look at numbers within 10 years. Our interest rate  calculations on what we are going to pay on the debt are absolutely  wrong. They are absolutely wrong.   We are now starting to see math saying, we may be missing in--9  budget years from now total interest was predicted to be as high as 1.4  trillion, just the interest. I need you now to add another $315 billion  to it, and that difference is just the marginal interest rate increases  we have had over the last several weeks.   When you are borrowing $26 trillion from the public--when you hear  the 32, $33 trillion, a bunch of that is money that we actually borrow  from the trust funds, which are also running out of money. So why this  is important: This big red hump here, that is defense spending for  2024. It is like $820, $830 billion. This one here is interest, just  interest, we are going pay in 2024.    My math says, there is a very high likelihood that the interest this  government pays in the next fiscal year will be equal to every dime we  spend in defense. Interest will equal the defense budget. So next time  you are talking to a leftist who says, if you would just cut defense  spending--interest now is equaling defense, and that is next year. That  is the budget we are working on right now.   Understand how much trouble we are in. I am going to go through some  of these fast because there is not a lot of time, but this one is  really important. Almost no one here understands or talks about it. It  is not the $2 trillion we are going to issue as new debt next year; it  is functionally the almost $10 trillion that comes to market next year.  We have about $7.6 trillion that gets refinanced. Those are bonds from  years ago that were at remarkably low interest rates. They are coming  due.   We are going to bring almost $10 trillion to market of U.S. sovereign  debt next year.   What happens when we bring that debt at these new higher interest  rates? Anyone here paying attention?   We have gone off the rails. Well, we don't care. That is math. We  don't do math here. This is a math-free zone.   Pay attention to this. This will be a story as we move through next  year when you bring $10 trillion to market, and you have got to  convince investors to buy this debt and that they won't get a better  rate of return if they go buy a high-quality corporate paper over here  or they should roll over their debt and buy U.S. sovereign and at the  same time we are going to be issuing a couple trillion also as  additional virgin debt.   This is where we are at.   You start to look at--we were doing this calculation a couple months  ago, that just by raising the interest by a single point, which we have  more than exceeded, you start to look out a few years, and by the 10- year window you might be having a $3.7 trillion a year shortfall, a  deficit of $3.7 trillion and it is mostly that growth. This is not  calculating in the new higher medical costs. This is just basically  interest fragility.   This board is important to my Democratic brothers and sisters who  basically--the comment I always get is, well, if we just would tax rich  people more. Please, buy a calculator. Read some of the documents that  your own leftist economists produce because if we would confiscate--I  had a lot of caffeine today--next year, if we would confiscate every  dime--so you make $500,000. The next dollar you make we just take it;  the government takes everything. So you make $500,000, give everything  up. So the guy that makes a billion dollars next year, we take  [[Page H4291]]  every dime of it, that would bring in about a trillion and a half  dollars. A lot of money.   This number is already wrong. Before we were projecting a $1.7  trillion shortfall budget deficit in 2024. Now we are thinking if this  year is 2.2 what will next year be? But confiscate everything over  $500,000--how often have you heard, if we just tax the rich we will be  fine? That is an absolute fraud. Remember, the number one driver of  debt here is not Democrats, it is not Republicans, it is demographics;  the one thing we are not allowed to talk about.   We are not allowed to tell the truth.   We made promises and we have no cash to keep them. At some point here  I am going to set myself on fire after soaking in kerosene. We are  going to talk about Social Security and how ugly the basic math is.   Oh, let's actually start that right now. Look, we have put together  these slides just trying to demonstrate--on this side over here, these  are the taxes you have paid over your lifetime, the average couple, the  average couple. The one bar here I want you to get your head around is  this orange bar, that is Medicare. Do you see that gap? These are the  benefits you receive. That gap from here to here, that right there,  that is 75 percent of all future debt. We are not supposed to talk  about this because it gets people unelected. But the fact of the matter  is unless we have a revolution in delivering the cost of healthcare,  the 130--it may be dramatically more now; that number hasn't been  updated in a while--of U.S. sovereign debt that we plan to issue over  the next 30 years, 75 percent of it is Medicare, 25 percent if we cover  the shortfall on Social Security.   I am not going to make you go through that one.   So let's actually have some fun with math. I had a sort of a group  discussion. Most of the room were people on the left, but they were  very polite. Every other person claimed to have a Ph.D., and we got to  the discussion saying, hey, the actuary reports the CBO basically  saying 9 years from now the Social Security trust fund is empty. It is  empty. So that first year, 2033, $616 billion is the shortfall. If you  are an average couple in America, that is a $17,200 cut to your Social  Security check. We will double senior poverty. How many people have you  seen come to this microphone and say, I give a damn about seniors; I  don't want to double senior poverty? Have you seen the stories of how  many baby boomers are starting to live on the streets in America? The  projections--this is an article today, and I think this was actually-- God, I am not even sure where this was published--actually, it may have  been The Wall Street Journal today. Read the article. Understand what  is happening. The fragility. Then we are going to tell these people we  are taking 25 percent of their Social Security check from them? It is 9  years from now.    But the problem is that first year we are short--let's just do 1 year  of math--in 2033, that is $616 billion.   Let's do the Democrats' suggestion. We are going to tax people over  $400,000. Tax everyone over 400,000, so there is a stone hold. You pay  your Social Security, your FICA tax up to $160,200. Then you don't pay  any, but once you hit 400,000, and everything up, you will pay the 12.4  percent Social Security tax. Great. It is $80 billion. The shortfall is  616, but the Democrats' solution is 80 billion.   Does anyone see a math problem?   So let's go on to the next one. Let's do Bernie Sanders' suggestion.  Let's get rid of the capital. Every dime you earn you are going to pay  12.4 percent. When you do the dynamic score on it that is about $158  billion.   Did I mention the first year shortfall is 616? $616 billion, removing  the cap, tax everything, only produces $158 billion.                                time  1945    What is that? $437 billion shortfall. What would you like to do?  Where would you like to get it? Our Democrat colleagues refuse to have  the discussion, how we are going to save Social Security and not do the  immoral thing and double senior poverty. They won't have the  conversation, because the President stood right there and said you are  not allowed to talk about Medicare and Social Security, and everyone  applauded, because they are going to do attack mail and attack  television ads because you talked about trying to do the moral thing  and save this program.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining?    Mr. Speaker, let's actually walk through what this  means. You are right now expecting that 17,200 or 17,400--there is a  little dispute--the cut you are getting as an average couple in America  in 9 years. Yea. Okay. Let's actually do that thing where we are going  to tax everyone over $400,000. That cut now becomes 13,482. Remember,  that is just on the first year. If you completely remove the cap and  just tax every dime, without the dynamic score of how much of the  economy you slowed down, the cut that average couple on Social Security  is going to get is going to be approaching $11,000 a year. That is the  Democrats' moral solution. Does anyone here own a calculator?   Then let's actually go a little bit further. The hard left here says:  Well, let's do the oligarch tax. You say, huh? This is a tax that is  unconstitutional, and it is I think in front of the Supreme Court this  coming year, where the Democrats' solution is: We know we have been  lying to the public. We are not going to tell them that, but we are  going to offer another tax proposal where the Democrats want to tax  unearned capital gains.   You say, huh? What is that? Well, you are rich. You have a building.  You have a business. You have an asset here. You haven't sold it, but  there are capital gains there. Every year, the government is going to  come in and ask for part of it. If you are really rich, they might want  10 percent of it, but if you are only moderately rich, every year you  might only have to pay 2 percent. It would be paying unrealized capital  gains because that is where the real money is.   The problem is the fantasy of going after that money--and this is  without a dynamic score. How so how does it change behavior? Remember,  taxes like this change behavior. We won't do the geeky economics. It  produces about $137 billion. That first year, it would produce $137  billion.   Do you remember the previous board? Social Security has a $616  billion shortfall in the first year, and the most radical tax proposal  produces $137 billion. Am I getting the point across? Do you understand  how difficult these numbers are?   They said we are going to come and do feeder. Oh, we are building  another factory that there are no workers for and there is no one who  wants the product, but we subsidize it. In our office, our new nickname  we call this is soft nationalization of industry, because the Democrats  figured out the way to buy the love of big industry, big business, is  hand them cash.   As Republicans, we try to say let's fix the tax code so you have to  compete with each other. You have got to go out there and engage in  creative destruction and make these better, faster. Democrats say, make  the same old crap you used to make, but we are going to give you the  cash to do it. It is insane economics.   This board is a little harder to read, but we were trying to figure  out if the hard left's theory of we are going to have all of these  taxes but we are going to sweep the assets of rich people, which is  unconstitutional and we will find out next year if my nonlawyer legal  opinion is true from the Supreme Court.   The principle of this board is that the CBO has told us we are  heading toward 115 to 120 percent of debt to GDP in sort of the 10-year  window. With all of these new taxes of the Democrats, we are still  about 111 percent of debt to GDP, and this is assuming every dime comes  in. It is a fraud, and this is supposed to make you feel better. Oh, we  have a tax proposal; just those nasty Republicans won't let us blow up  the economy.   I know this is hard to read, but why this is so difficult is, you see  these gaps, these lines are basically to say--you see the gap? The tax  proposals being proposed by the Democrats to save the Social Security  trust fund get nowhere near it. As you go out further in time, the gap  gets bigger and bigger.   Part of the punch line here I need someone to process. That is in 9  years.  [[Page H4292]]  In less time than that, the Medicare part A trust fund, which is about  40 percent of all Medicare spending, is gone. The transportation trust  fund is gone. We are hitting numbers. The $2.1 to $2.2 trillion we will  borrow this year, we were not supposed to hit for a decade. We are  borrowing now at rates that we were not supposed to see for years. This  is the Democrats' economy. This is sort of nationalizing much of  industry. The chips industry, now the green energy industry, we are  handing out cash. Something happened. We are building all of these  factories, but we are getting no tax receipts from it. Something has  gone horribly, horribly wrong out there, instead of our brothers and  sisters on the left and those of us on the right coming together and  saying we have a moral obligation not to have baby boomers on the  street as part of their retirement, not to double senior poverty.   To my young kids--yes, I am an old dad. I have a 14-month-old and an  8-year-old. Do they deserve to have a future? CBO math basically says  in 20 years, if we wanted to maintain baseline services as they are  today, we have to double taxes. That means my kids live in a world  where they are dramatically poorer than how all the rest of us have  lived.   You want to know why the middle class is so cranky? Once again, back  to something I said in the beginning. The middle class in this country  is poorer today than they were 24 months ago. If you live in my  community, if you haven't had over a 20 percent pay hike in the last 24  months, you are poorer today than you were before. This is the  morality?    Let's have the most difficult discussion this place a capable of.  What are we going to do? I have come behind this microphone dozens and  dozens and dozens of times showing you that if we could actually have a  revolution in the cost of healthcare--and I have brought the ways to do  it. I have brought all sorts of charts to say, hey, did you realize  diabetes is 33 percent of all healthcare spending? Could we have a  revolution there? Are we really going to do the same old farm bill? Are  we going to actually understand we have ways to help our brothers and  sisters live healthier lives, come back into the labor force, have some  economic growth, and stop watching America die? In the next decade, we  will have more Americans dying than being born in this country. We are  dying as a society, and we are financing it ourselves.   The immorality of what we are doing, whether it be the debt or the  way we are hiding from it, there is hope. There is a way it works. Is  this place capable of actually thinking? Are we going to continue to do  the petty, well, so and so hurt my feelings, so I am going to oppose  this?   I mean, I like this. I am not going to read this. This is  uncomfortable. I can't go home and explain this to my chamber of  commerce. Screw you. This is a moment of action, so I am going to give  you an absolute radical proposal that I just want you to ruminate. I  accept it has no chance of passing, and I will use this year's numbers.   In the 2023 budget year, nondefense discretionary spending is--let's  call it about $740 billion. About $326 billion of that is money that we  are borrowing and sending to States, counties, cities, many of them for  programs I absolutely love like justice grants and other things. I have  always supported these, but we are borrowing money to send to entities  that have their own taxing and borrowing authority. That is the  definition of insanity.   For those who come in here and say, I want to defend the 10th  Amendment, I have got a great way for you to do it: Stop borrowing  money over here to send to States so they have to come and lobby and  grovel at your office every 6 weeks. It would be hard. The hallways up  and down might be depopulated because they won't be lined up at our  door begging for more cash.   Is it rational for us to borrow hundreds and hundreds of billions of  dollars over here and hand it to entities that have their own taxing  authority?   To my brothers and sisters on the left, this is the punch line. You  bang on me saying, we just need to raise taxes. Great. You control most  of these cities. Go raise the taxes and make it so we stop borrowing  the money.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
