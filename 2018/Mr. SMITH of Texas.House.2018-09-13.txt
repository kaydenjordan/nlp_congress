Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 6227, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, this bipartisan National Quantum Initiative Act is  cosponsored by House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Ranking  Member Eddie Bernice Johnson, as well as 24 other committee members.  The bill has earned widespread support and was unanimously approved by  the committee on June 27.   Before I explain what the bill does, I would like to explain why it  matters so much.   In our lifetime, we have seen remarkable advances in the size and  speed of our computers. Most of us carry phones in our pockets that are  several thousand times more powerful than all the combined computing  power available to NASA during the Apollo missions. Yet, as impressive  as these advances have been, quantum computing has the power to affect  an even more dramatic transformation of our society and worldwide  technology.   Computers today rely on tiny on-off switches within a processing  chip. Technological advances have made possible supercomputers that can  perform series of on-off operations at astonishing speeds. But  classical computing technology is nearing its limits. Each switch can  only operate in one of two positions, off or on, zero or one.   Quantum computing is different. Rather than on-off switches, quantum  computers rely on qubits. These are subatomic particles that can be  both on and off at the same time. This enables quantum computers to  perform complex calculations at speeds that are potentially millions of  times faster than today's most advanced supercomputers.   Countries that harness the power of quantum computing will be able to  revolutionize cybersecurity, healthcare, communications, financial  services, and transportation, just to name a few of the industries.   The flip side of this is that quantum computing will make traditional  IT security programs obsolete. The nation that develops quantum  communications technology first may be able to decode, in a matter of  seconds, other countries' sensitive national security information,  proprietary technologies, and personal information.   Other countries are investing billions of dollars in new research  facilities and equipment for quantum computing. China has publicly  stated a national goal of surpassing the U.S. during the next decade.  That is why it is imperative that we act now to develop a national  quantum strategy and preserve America's dominance in the scientific  world.   The National Quantum Initiative Act achieves this by creating a 10- year Federal program to accelerate quantum research and development in  the United States. The bill leverages the expertise and resources of  U.S. industry, academia, and government to move quantum information  science to the next level of research and development.   The legislation enables a National Quantum Coordination Office within  the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. This office  will oversee interagency coordination and strategic planning, serve as  a central point of contact for stakeholders, conduct research, and  promote commercialization of Federal research by the private sector.   The bill also supports basic research, education, and standards  development at the National Institute of Standards  [[Page H8232]]  and Technology, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of  Energy.   Madam Speaker, $225 million a year of these agencies' baseline  funding will now be directed to new quantum research centers and  laboratory research. Their activities will address fundamental research  gaps, create a stronger workforce, and develop revolutionary knowledge  and transformative innovations to give U.S. companies and workers an  enduring competitive advantage.   The bill ensures that U.S. high-tech companies, which are investing  heavily in quantum research, and a surge of quantum technology startups  will contribute their knowledge and resources to a national effort.   H.R. 6227 was developed with input from industry, academia, national  laboratories, Federal agencies, and the administration. It was an open  and bipartisan process.                                time  1400    The input of those stakeholders has yielded a strong consensus bill.   Additionally, Senator Thune and Senator Nelson, the chairman and  ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, have introduced a  companion bill in the Senate. With bipartisan, bicameral support and  the backing of the administration, I believe this bill could become law  by the end of the year.   Let's take action to spur America's quantum development. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) for those nice  comments. And she is right, this was a very bipartisan effort and a  very bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Weber), who is also the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee of the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), who has been a longtime and active  member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and also the  former vice chairman of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), who is one of the few members of the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee to actually be a member of  three subcommittees. He is a member of the Energy Subcommittee, the  Research and Technology Subcommittee, and the Space Subcommittee, and  we appreciate his active service on the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other requests for time  either,  [[Page H8234]]  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 589) to establish  Department of Energy policy for science and energy research and  development programs, and reform National Laboratory management and  technology transfer programs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike title IV.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 589, the bill now  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 589, the Department of Energy Research and  Innovation Act, is the product of more than 4 years of work by the  Science Committee to advance basic research in science and technology  and set clear science priorities for the Department of Energy.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on the Science Committee  who have sponsored this legislation with me, particularly Ranking  Member Eddie Bernice Johnson, Vice Chairman Frank Lucas, Energy  Subcommittee Chairman Randy Weber, Energy Subcommittee Vice Chairman  Steve Knight, and Energy Subcommittee members Dana Rohrabacher, Mo  Brooks, Neal Dunn, Randy Hultgren, Marc Veasey, Zoe Lofgren, Dan  Lipinski, and Paul Tonko, as well as full committee members Barbara  Comstock, Brian Babin,  Andy Biggs, Clay Higgins, Elizabeth Esty, and  Ed Perlmutter.   Six standalone Science Committee energy research bills from last  Congress are included in this legislation.   The DOE Research and Innovation Act prioritizes critical basic  research and science at the DOE national labs. It provides the first  comprehensive authorization for Office of Science programs, which  conduct and support more than $6 billion in research each year.   This legislation also requires DOE to coordinate research across the  Department. It provides private industry with increased access to the  unique user facilities and capabilities of the national labs that will  help to develop advanced technologies for the next generation.   Title I of H.R. 589 improves the technology transfer process between  DOE and private industry.   The innovative early stage research performed at the national labs  can have great value to the private sector. While the labs consistently  develop ideas and technology that have commercial potential, Federal  red tape and bureaucracy discourage the cooperation needed for the  private sector to take technologies to market.   Title I enables national lab directors to better partner with  industry and ensure that the United States can remain a world leader in  science and technology.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois, Representative  Randy Hultgren, and the gentleman from Colorado, Representative Ed  Perlmutter, for their initiative on this issue and for sponsoring  similar legislation in the last Congress to advance these important  reforms at our national labs.   Title II of the legislation requires DOE to better manage and  coordinate research efforts at the Department of Energy.   This title also requires DOE to provide a regular analysis of science  and technology activities within the Department. This will identify key  areas for collaboration across science and applied research programs,  and allow the Secretary to identify programs that cost too much and  could be better undertaken by the private sector.   Title III establishes priorities and provides statutory direction for  the basic research programs within the DOE's Office of Science. This  includes research and basic energy sciences, biological and  environmental research, high-performance computing, nuclear physics,  high-energy physics, and fusion energy science.   These basic research programs are central to the mission of the  Department. Investment in this research can lead to new scientific  discoveries that will maintain U.S. leadership in technology and  innovation.   This title also authorizes basic research programs in solar fuels,  electricity storage, exascale computing, and low-dose radiation.   The House has previously passed Science Committee legislation by  Energy Subcommittee Vice Chairman Knight and subcommittee member  Hultgren to authorize these four key basic research programs.   H.R. 589 represents a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to modernize  and increase the productivity of the DOE national lab system,  streamline DOE research programs, and prioritize the basic scientific  research that will maintain American leadership in science.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Weber), who is the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee  of the Science Committee.  [[Page H8235]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Kansas (Mr. Marshall), who is the vice chairman of the Research  and Technology Subcommittee of the Science Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have further speakers, but I will  yield to the ranking member if she has any speakers. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Knight), who is the vice chairman of the Energy  Subcommittee of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California for his comments and also for his initiatives on the subject  of energy in so many ways. Several other bills that we are considering  are a result of that initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I have no other requests for time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Weber) for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, S. 97, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act,  directs the Department of Energy to enable the American nuclear power  industry to conduct civilian nuclear energy research and development  that will advance our leadership in nuclear technology.   While we are considering the Senate version of this bill today, I  would like to credit the author of the original legislation, Energy  Subcommittee Chairman Randy Weber, his primary cosponsors, and Science,  Space, and Technology Committee Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson  for their years of leadership on this issue.   The originating Science, Space, and Technology Committee legislation  was developed over 4 years of collaboration, including hearings,  coordination with DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and  countless meetings with stakeholders. Every effort has been made to  ensure this legislation will provide the resources necessary to more  effectively and efficiently develop the next generation of nuclear  power.   Advanced nuclear energy technology is the best way to make reliable,  safe, and emission-free electricity available throughout the modern and  developing world. The legislation authorizes the research facilities  and infrastructure necessary to help development of new, advanced  nuclear reactors here at home, maintaining American leadership in the  global nuclear technology sector.   This technological edge allows us to better influence global  nonproliferation standards and prevent civilian nuclear energy  technology from being misused for weapons development overseas. S. 97  directs DOE to develop plans for long-term research and authorizes  critical infrastructure at the DOE national labs. This includes  leveraging DOE state-of-the-art super computers to accelerate the  theoretical development of advanced reactors.   The bill also authorizes construction of a research reactor at a DOE  site. This research reactor will provide access to the fast neutrons  necessary to develop advanced nuclear reactors. By investing in  research infrastructure, DOE can maximize the impact of Federal  research dollars and facilitate the development of a wide variety of  nuclear technologies.   Finally, S. 97 creates a reliable mechanism for the private sector to  partner with DOE labs to build DOE-certified prototype reactors at DOE  sites. While the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has heard  from dozens of companies with innovative reactor designs, the ability  to move new nuclear technology to the market has been stalled by  government approval and licensing red tape.   S. 97 provides an alternative pathway for these nuclear  entrepreneurs. The safe development of advanced nuclear technology at  DOE sites will provide access to DOE resources and expertise, and fast  track the commercial regulatory process by involving nuclear reactors  at the earliest stages of prototype design and construction.  [[Page H8239]]    Nuclear power has been a proven source of safe and emission-free  electricity for over half a century. By enacting this legislation and  investing in the capabilities needed by the private sector to develop  advanced reactors, we can build on the history of American leadership  in nuclear power and reduce emissions around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Weber and Ranking Member  Johnson for their work on this bill, as well as our Senate colleagues,  including Senator Mike Crapo, Senator Jim Risch, Senator Lisa  Murkowski, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, and Senator Cory Booker for  leading the effort to pass this bill through the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support and clear  this legislation for President Trump's approval.                                time  1445
