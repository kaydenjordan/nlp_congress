 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman.   I am really proud, Mr. Speaker, of the Budget Committee. We did great  work last week, and everyone was heard: six motions on the Republican  side, six motions on the Democratic side, and the debate was civil.  Tones weren't raised; theatrics, by and large, weren't employed; and we  made the bill better. That was the process the week before that when  the committees of jurisdiction had this legislation.   It is my hope that, as we pass this bill off the floor of the House-- and it is a bill being passed off the floor of the House and not into  law right now--and as it goes to the Senate, that the bill will  continue to be improved. That is the legislative process.   I am very proud of the members of the staff of the Budget Committee  for being a major part of that process and starting that process. We  did good work. You don't have to pass this bill to find out what is in  it as we had to with ObamaCare. This process will continue.   I am very pleased, also, that we have Medicaid block grants, or lump  sum payments to the States, that are available now to cover at least  our able-bodied children and adults. It is a huge step forward in  letting States have the flexibility they need to decide who really  needs this assistance, how they should get it, and what they should get  in terms of health care.   This is good legislation. This is what we were sent to do, and we are  keeping our promises to the American people by passing this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
