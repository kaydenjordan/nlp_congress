 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Madam Speaker, I am here to condemn the President's  hostile actions against Iran that led us to the brink of war.   President Trump had no legal justification to launch an attack  against Iran. The President's dangerous provocation was unlawful and  unconstitutional, and Congress must assert its sole authority to  declare war. His actions made America less safe.   Today, I will be voting for a War Powers Resolution to check the  President's use of military action against Iran. But the need for  Congress to reassert its authority does not end there. We must repeal  the 2002 AUMF and prevent the administration from engaging in an  unauthorized war by restricting funding from being used to wage war  against Iran.   We must not yield to the voices of extreme hawks that see war as the  only answer. We must not go to war with Iran.
