 Mr. Speaker, as one of the first Muslim woman elected ever  in the history of the United States to Congress, I rise in support of  opposing all forms of hate. No one should ever experience feeling less  than, live in fear, or be exposed to oppression, discrimination or  violence because of their sexual orientation, their immigration status,  their faith, the color of their skin, their ethnicity, their income  status or any other form of identifiers. I rise in support of our  United States Constitution where all beings are created equal and will  fight every day to oppose racism in our country.   I urge my colleagues to have an open heart, to be present, to serve  with compassion, and to hear one another. My colleagues have a rare  opportunity to serve with me, an American Muslim woman, who can offer a  different understanding of what it is to be a country that is truly  equal and inclusive.
