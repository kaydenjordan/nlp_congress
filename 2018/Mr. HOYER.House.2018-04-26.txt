 Mr. Speaker, this week, Democrats are highlighting our  ``Better Deal'' that we are offering the American people.   One area where this Republican Congress has given the American people  a bad deal is healthcare. Because of their repeated attempts to repeal  and undermine the Affordable Care Act, uncertainty has plagued our  health insurance markets, leading insurers to flee and premiums to go  up.   Republicans included in their tax law a provision that will take  coverage away from 13 million people and hike premiums by more than 10  percent annually.   The Trump administration is also making every effort, Mr. Speaker, to  unravel vital consumer protections through rulemaking. Now many who  were finally protected under the Affordable Care Act will again be  vulnerable to discrimination and to higher costs for comprehensive  coverage.   That is the Republican approach, unfortunately, to healthcare: higher  costs, lower coverage, and, yes, an age tax, and a return to the days  when insurers could deny coverage based upon preexisting conditions.   Democrats are offering a better deal: stabilizing markets, bringing  down premiums, making prescription drugs more affordable, and  protecting Medicare and Medicaid, which are the Republicans' next  targets.                            ____________________
