 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from California  offering me some time, and I want to thank Representative Cook, as  well, for his efforts.   I rise in support of the Big Bear Land Exchange Act.   My community in San Bernardino County experiences some of the highest  levels of air pollution anywhere in the country, and, in order to  combat this pollution, we must find ways to reduce emissions in our  region. This bill will help us do just that.   This land exchange between the county and the Federal Government will  allow the establishment of a recycling and recovery center in my  neighboring district. This facility would decrease the long distances  that trucks have to travel to dispose of waste and will allow us to  divert this waste by repurposing recyclable materials.   This legislation is good for our communities and is a smart way to  help mitigate pollution and combat climate change.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Cook,  for his work in championing this bill and for his bipartisan  collaboration. I have worked with Mr. Cook on a number of issues  representing San Bernardino County. Nobody is more thoughtful when it  comes to what our future direction holds. I know his heart is in San  Bernardino County, as well, and no one will ever doubt that about his  intent.   Just because he doesn't want to hang out here with us in this  facility oftentimes doesn't mean that he isn't publicly driven and  publicly minded in order to deliver for his constituents. This bill is  one of those examples.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleague the  remainder of the next 12 months and in the years ahead, and I want to  thank him for his efforts in this regard.
