 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and appreciate  him yielding, and also appreciate Chris Smith's leadership on the pro- life issue here in the United States Congress.   It takes a strong and committed force to constantly be on top of  every component of the life issue every day and night. I am convinced  that Chris Smith misses sleep over this, as I do and many of us do. But  today, we have got something to be happy about, Mr. Speaker, and that  is that the $286 million that goes into family planning and is under  title X, the purpose of those funds is to help plan the number and the  spacing of children. And I think that God should be in charge of that.   I have long said that a solution for our society is good people need  to have a lot of babies and raise them right. And once we get our  social agenda right, if we get our faith right, if we get our families  right, if we understand the Constitution, if we have a work ethic that  is right, and if our integrity is there, all the rest will  automatically take care of itself.   I see these little babies when I look around in my church. Our church  is just full of little ones. I had a little newborn in front of me last  Sunday and I watched how the family passed that little newborn along. I  saw a granddaughter shoot across the aisle to grandparents. Nobody  worries. I don't  [[Page H4274]]  worry because those kids there are going to be all right.   This country always takes care of its little ones. There has never  been a time where we could have more confidence in taking care of our  little ones, but we have got to get them born.   We are seeing money borrowed from China to supplement a national debt  to go into a title X family planning program. Abortion is not family  planning. Abortion is ending a significant component of the family.   This program also has statutory prohibition on abortion. So this  policy that is unfolding here--thankfully, from the Trump  administration--will restore the statutory provisions and Planned  Parenthood themselves--you have heard the number, Mr. Speaker, 56  million--and my math came out to 60 million. It is in that category-- that is used to advocate for abortion and to actually commit abortions.   Some people aren't moved by the utter immorality. I have looked at  some things that I saw today as I was flying in this morning, and I  looked around on the internet and picked up some things. One of them  that caught my eye was that the U.S. birth rate has hit a record low.  Now, that record low consists of this: There were only 60.2 babies born  per thousand women in this past year in 2017. That is the women between  the ages of 15 and 44, the fertility years, as the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention describes it--only 60.2. That is the lowest it  has ever been since we have been keeping records, and we have been  keeping records for decades.    Also, the total fertility rate is the lowest it has been since 1978-- and I think we had an anomaly in 1978--but that total fertility rate,  Mr. Speaker, I point out that in order to sustain our population as it  is, just a level population, it takes 2.1 babies per woman in order to  sustain our population. And that is rated in the total fertility rate.  That is 1.764 today, babies per woman, the lowest it has been since  1978, and well below--hundreds and hundreds below--what it needs to be  able to sustain our population.   And here is another record that is the lowest in 30 years. Now think  of this: The population of the United States of America is as high as  it has ever been--about 326 million or more. With 326 million people,  you would think the higher the population is, the more babies would be  born into that population--at least you would set a record on babies  born into the population because our population is as large as it has  ever been.   But here is the real data on it. There were 3,853,472 births in 2017.  That is the lowest number of births in 30 years. The lowest number of  births in 30 years, and we also need to add to that, there are roughly  1 million abortions that took place in America in 2017.   So if those babies had been born, we would have had 4,853,472 little  ones here rather than the 3.8 million that is in the data that we have.                                time  2000    According to this data, 21 percent of the babies conceived in  America's lives are ended by abortion, Mr. Speaker, and I am seeing an  administration that is moving around on the side of life. I am seeing a  society that is moving along on the side of life. I am watching the 4-D  ultrasounds where now we can hear the heartbeat and we can watch them  move and squirm in the womb.   I am encouraged that America's society and America's civilization is  moving toward the side of life.   Eventually, we will see the end of Roe v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, and  Planned Parenthood v. Casey. We will get there, Mr. Speaker. And the  work that is done by Mr. Smith and others and, thankfully, the  President and the administration get us closer to that day.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud this decision, and I thank the gentleman from  New Jersey for this Special Order hour.
