 Madam Speaker, before we begin, I actually want to  yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).                     Honoring the Life of Tristan Krogius     Madam Speaker, we all get behind these microphones on  occasion and we want to share something. And tonight, I am going to try  to stay on a theme. I am going to try to walk through one of my intense  frustrations around here that we keep making public policy.   Let's be honest. We just passed--the Democrats, I don't think a  single Republican voted for it--a $350 billion bill that originally was  labeled as America COMPETES Act. But if you look at the math in it and  the spending in it, it is functionally, hey, let's give lots of money  to our special interests who actually support them politically.   So here's the theme. If I came to any Member of Congress, any one of  our staff, anyone out there listening in the public and said, What  makes people poor? Seriously. What makes our brothers and sisters who  are working poor poor?   And you get these discussions, Oh, we don't tax rich people enough  and transfer their wealth, or we don't do this, or we don't do that.  And it turns out, when you actually look at the math, almost none of  those things are actually true.   It is complicated. So we have been doing a project for almost a year  in our office, of trying to understand what is different. So we held a  hearing recently, on health disparities. Guess what?   There really are health disparities between certain urban minority  populations, my Tribal communities in the Southwest. But why?   Also, take a look. There is crime, crime differential. When someone  steals your stuff or breaks your bones, you're not able to go to work,  you're not able to accumulate.   You actually start to look at all these things that are societal  factors. You open up the border, you are competing against others with  similar skill sets, labor sets.   And my argument is, over this last 12 months of unified leftist,  unified Democrat control of government, we are just crushing people. We  are crushing  [[Page H967]]  the working poor. We are crushing the middle class. And the data--I am  going to prove it.   But one of the most interesting things we have been looking at--and  we have actually taken some ridicule for fixating on this, but the math  is the math.   I would typically start these presentations with take a look at the  accumulation of U.S. sovereign debt. It is exploding. Twenty-nine  years, $12 trillion, and that is based on last year's CBO math. It is  Social Security and Medicare, primarily Medicare. But 31 percent of  Medicare spending and borrowing is just diabetes.   But also, that other project we have been doing of what makes certain  populations poor. Well, it turns out our brothers and sisters who are  often working poor or just trying to survive, have dramatically higher  health problems, and it is primarily diabetes. In rural poverty, in my  Tribal poverty, in my urban poverty, look at the diabetic numbers.   So wouldn't the most compassionate thing be to not do what the left  keeps saying, we are going to build more clinics, help people live with  their misery. But how about doing something revolutionary? How about  curing, how about investing in curing our brothers and sisters who  suffer?   And we are working, and it is hard, and it is difficult math. But  what would happen if you got a cure to income inequality? Well, then  you would have to eventually adjust for crime and open borders and all  the other things that we are going to talk about.   And we have taken some ridicule saying, well, type 1, type 2  diabetes, you can't--well, it turns out we have been tracking the  science. And there was a time we used to have this constant debate here  where Democrats would accuse Republicans of not following the science.  And we are obviously, particularly with COVID, accusing the Democrats.   But does anyone here actually have an alert on their search engines  to track the news stories of some of the really amazing stuff  happening?   So this is a story, functionally, from yesterday, and it is a unique  approach. They are functionally doing a CRISPR-altered stem cell. And  the beauty of that is, what happens if I can get your body to start  producing insulin again?    And because we know type 1 diabetes, and part of type 2, is an  autoimmune reaction. Your body is killing the cells that produce  insulin. And so with that little bit of CRISPR technology, your body  doesn't recognize it, and doesn't kill the very cell that is producing  the ability to take on your glucose. It has begun. It has actually  moved into type 1.   So think of this. We just spent $350 billion--well, at least the  Democrats are trying to--and something like this, if you had done a  version of Operation Warp Speed or call it whatever you want if that is  too Trumpian for the left.   But the single biggest driver of U.S. debt is diabetes; 33 percent of  all healthcare spending; 31 percent of Medicare spending. You would  think this place would be almost giddy.   Now, maybe it doesn't work maybe, ultimately. But the ability to say,  we are going to do something that is noble, compassionate, loving, and  cure the misery instead of keeping populations sort of trapped in their  misery because they are beholden to one political party's largesse.   It is beginning. This is the type of disruption--this is symbolic of  the type of disruption that makes the country wealthier, more  prosperous, and minimizes misery. And we have been talking about this  technology coming for about a year. Why are we not doing more investing  in it?   So the White House has an initiative. Wonderful, but they need to  redesign--and the same thing here in the House--we need to redesign  where the resources of primary research, or the incentive to bring a  product to market, or the timing it takes to make it through the math  of a phase one, phase two, phase three.   We do it the wrong way. Just as the Democrats' bill they just passed  where it is command and control, it is almost a 5-year plan. The  Federal Government will decide who gets a grant, who doesn't get a  grant. You now have to come be really nice to the administration and  your Member of Congress if you want money for your business.   The arrogance of this place. One of the hazards of Members of  Congress--it is like that running joke: What are the two times in life  you think you know everything? When you are 13 years old, and the day  after you get elected to Congress.   The debate here often sounds like it is a decade out of date. But  think about the board I was just showing. If there really is--and it is  now in phase one trial--an ability to cure type 1 and make a dramatic  difference in type 2, try to understand what that means for the  financials of the country and the world, what that actually means for  health and misery.   But also, what it potentially means for populations that we talk  about constantly, we virtue-signal constantly, but we don't actually do  something in raising their living standards, raising their economics,  closing income inequality,   And instead, we are in a body right now with unified Democrat control  where the solution is, send someone a check. Well, sending someone a  check doesn't end the misery. Disruptive technology like this is what  cures the misery that is what we should be almost evangelizing here.  And I know that is hard.   So let's talk about some of the other things that make the working  class poorer, the working poor substantially poorer. We saw--and I know  there have been many Members here who have come and talked about  inflation, but I don't think we have understood the misery it  ultimately brings. And it is the slow type of misery, because every  time we go to the grocery store, that piece of protein you wanted, or  that milk, or something else gets a little bit more expensive. Your  paycheck may have gone up, but somehow everything you are buying goes  up more.   And we are going to walk through a couple of boards here, just  showing the fact of the matter under Democratic unified control of  government, our society has actually gotten poorer, even though we have  pumped stunning amounts of money, of cash into the society, and we are  going to sort of show that.   So understand, we all saw the number at the end of the year, 7  percent inflation. In my home, I am from the Phoenix area, we are  approaching 9 percent, a lot of that is driven by housing. Imagine what  this index did to homelessness.   We are going to see some statistics here of the narcotics and other  things that have been coming across the border now that we have sort of  an open border policy from the left.   And instead, I would like to talk about the economics and the misery  such policies have brought and how it all ties together.   So let's go back a little more on inflation. If you think about  inflation, how many times have you heard our brothers and sisters on  the left get behind their microphones and talk about, it is increasing  inequality?    So I thought that was the Holy Grail here. Close inequality. But yet,  their policies keep growing it. We are seeing some numbers here where  there is about $3,500 of additional spread of inequality, driven by a  single year's worth of policies that drove up inflation.   And the solution from the left is well, we are going to send them  another check, even though the check is actually what substantially  drove creating inflation.   Remember, basic economics. Remember your elementary school and your  high school economics class. What is inflation? It is too many dollars  chasing too few goods and services. Real simple. The real world is  actually a little more complicated, but that is classic.   So you have two things: You can keep jacking up interest rates to  squeeze out liquidity of dollars chasing those goods or, or and, or  plus, you can do the other side, like we did in 1981. They raised  interest rates.   But people forget, the first year of President Reagan, even with a  Democrat Congress, they adopted tax cuts and policies to make more  stuff. If you have lots of dollars out that chasing things, you have  got a couple of solutions. You could squeeze the dollars out of the  economy to lower inflation, or you can make more stuff, because it is  too many dollars chasing not enough goods.  [[Page H968]]    Okay. Make more stuff. It is a classic supply-side solution. Make the  tax code, the regulatory code, the incentives to make more stuff.   Instead, we just passed a $350 billion bill that functionally puts  government in charge of grants and control of what they want, instead  of the information part of the market, where resources, where the  ability to act quickly, we should be incentivizing the animal spirits  to go make more stuff as a way to lower this inflation that is crushing  people. And it is a much more elegant way because it creates jobs, it  creates products. But for some reason, the left is almost maniacal in a  Keynesian view of the world saying, well, do lots of stimulus.                                time  1215    Madam Speaker, they seem unwilling to even accept the data produced  by their side that says they have raised the misery of so many  Americans.   Understand that the math at the end of the year was pretty simple.  Inflation went up, and people's wages went up, but there is a gap. The  gap keeps growing, and that gap is the fact you got poorer last year.   This is the one that I am still just shocked there is not more  discussion about. If you see the percentage of monthly change in real  wages--remember, you may get your paycheck. Your paycheck may go up. If  your rent, your fuel, your food, everything else in your life went up  more--you see how many months people got poorer.   If you look at the way we are doing policy here, it is the  administration and my Democratic colleagues' willingness to continue to  spend money at just stunning levels in ways that the economics say you  are going to actually make people poorer. Planned economy hasn't worked  particularly well anywhere in the world.   You start to see the data of the gap, and we have not tried to  present this in a mean way. The fact of the matter is, the Democrat  policies--remember, they took over Congress 3 years ago. They now have  unified government after the last election. The gap between the wealthy  and the poor is growing.   Do you remember 2018 and 2019 and the vicious rhetoric that came from  our brothers and sisters on the left after we did tax reform? Yet, in  modern economic times, it was the greatest success we have had in  shrinking income inequality. You are going to see some boards here  where food insecurity, it worked.   Our brothers and sisters on the lower quartiles--and I always hate  that term. The fact of the matter is, they became dramatically less  poor. Then when the Democrats take power, they abandon the very things  that were working. Their policies, at some point you have to admit to  everyone, because we are feeling and seeing it, you have made the rich  richer; you have made the poor poorer; you have increased the misery.   Madam Speaker, we all know the saying. When something isn't working,  stop it. Take a breath. Take a look at what was working. It turns out  the ideological calcification that is Congress now is more important to  that dogma than what actually works.   So, we sort of walk through these. I know this seems like a lot, but  we keep trying to make the point over and over that the data is  factual. It is not just information by virtue signaling. The data is  the data is the data.   This is my comment from the quartile. So these are our brothers and  sisters. We are calling them the lower 20 percent. Well, how much of  their income goes to housing, transportation, food?   Now, you notice these numbers are off the chart. That is because they  also receive subsidies, earned income tax credits, other things we do  to try to make their life less miserable.   Somewhere along the way, this body forgot that if you are poor, I  mean truly poor, that bottom 20 percent, the majority of your income  goes to housing. What did the Democrats accomplish this last year? We  blew up the price of rent.   There were speeches from a number of us from 1 to 2 years ago, saying  you need to create the safety net. You need to create a bottom so the  economy snaps back, but be careful. When you create too much liquidity,  government spending, you are going to blow up the cost of everything  for people. It happened.   What is the solution? The left now talks about doing another stimulus  bill to make their lives even more miserable.   Maybe it is the arrogance of: These folks in the poorer quartiles,  they have been indoctrinated. They are going to vote for the left. So  just abuse the crap out of them. They are still going to vote for you.   The fact of the matter is, if you look at the real data of who votes  for the Democrats anymore, it is the urban elite. That is who finances  their campaigns. It is no longer the working men and women. They  migrated much more to the Republican side.   So maybe what I am seeing is politically logical, but economically,  it is brutal. The math is the math. At some point behind the math are  people who are suffering.   Think about this. You just saw on the chart where the lowest couple  of quartiles spend most of their money just trying to do housing. Take  a look at what we have done to the housing prices. This is mostly rent.  You know, when you are in that bottom third, you are a renter. How many  people right now who are renting we now are responsible for economic  policies, liquidity of cash, where we have blown up the cost of  housing, blown up the cost of rent, that we now will have trapped so  much of America into being permanent renters for the rest of their  lives? They are never going to build that savings account that owning a  house is and that became part of being able to retire and is part of  the American Dream.   The math is the math. You look at African Americans, Latino  populations, and the amount that has moved into struggling just to  cover the rent, it has blown up dramatically.   This just doesn't disappear. You don't wake up tomorrow and say, hey,  we decided we are going to do economic policies, regulatory policies,  tax policies. So we make a lot more stuff. Yes, the Federal Reserve  pulls liquidity out. It fixes inflation. Oh, isn't it neat? All the  rents went back down.   It doesn't work that way. How long before these populations get their  incomes back where they can actually survive, where just the cost of  having a place to live isn't consuming almost every dollar of their  lives?   We don't talk enough about the policies here and the misery they have  created. Yet, we have pumped so much cash into the system that we take  a look at State and local, and they are sitting on boatloads of cash.   There is another really interesting trend line here. How did this  happen? We had the speeches here 1 year ago, 1\1/2\ years ago. The  world is coming apart. The world is falling apart. Yet, somehow state  and local tax receipts actually held up dramatically well. We overshot  the mark.    Then what did we do? Even though we knew they were doing just fine,  the actual fall in receipts, which is the proper term for tax  collections, was marginal. What did the Democrat policy do? Let's send  them more cash because that is their constituents.   I want to walk through some of the other aspects that we believe left  policies are making the working poor, the middle class, poorer. Here is  a simple concept. I have said it over and over, but you have to  understand it is this layering effect.   Let's say you are that individual that didn't graduate high school.  The value you bring to work is your willingness to work. So you are the  person hanging drywall. You are doing labor. You are doing landscaping.  Your goal is one day you hope to own the landscaping company. You hope  to own the plaster company. What you sell is your labor and your  willingness to work.   What are the two ways you crush that population economically? We just  did the inflation. We saw how much of their income now is going to just  surviving.   The second thing you do is you make them compete against millions of  others with similar skill sets. So there is this great economic  argument. If you want to grow American GDP, immigration is a big deal,  but it has to be immigration that has a multiplier effect on everything  from tax receipts to productivity. You don't import massive poverty.   It is uncomfortable to talk about it this way. The fact of the matter  is,  [[Page H969]]  being a border state, what is happening at our border? You are not  bringing folks who grow the economy. The data says actually what you  are doing is you are making the working poor poorer.   I don't know how often anyone here will talk about our crisis at the  border, which is real. Come to Arizona. Go to Texas. The societal  impact, when you do it this way, we can get into some of the really  interesting economic data saying, hey, when populations leave this  country, you have just actually wiped out the ambitious populations  because these are people willing to pack up and leave. You actually  hurt the departing country. The fact of the matter is, you also hurt  the folks here.   The numbers at the border are just stunning. I mean, when you start  thinking of, during this administration, a couple of million folks,  they may be wonderful people. It is not about them. It is the impact of  the very people we claim we care about, that we claim we are trying to  help. We claim we are trying to close income inequality. We claim we  are trying to make the poor less poor. Then we do everything we can to  crush them.   It is just the economics. I just can't figure out what the left is  doing intellectually. They know this number. If it was a decade, 10, 15  years ago, all the literature we keep finding, it was Democrats who  were fixated on locking down the border because they knew it hurt the  poor and the working poor. They used to accuse Republicans of wanting  open borders to push down labor values. Do you remember? It wasn't that  long ago. The argument was flipped.   There goes my theory that maybe the left truly has abandoned working  men and women in this country because they are no longer their  defenders. They are almost the defenders of someone who needs a cheap  landscaper.   The border numbers are real. I mean, when you start seeing the data  coming from the administration itself, they make it really hard to find  the actual facts. When you see numbers that are 278 percent increases,  you start to realize what this is going to mean.   There is a great paper. We came here and talked about it a few months  ago. It is a decade old. It talks about what happens when you get these  waves of illegal crossing, and they get rolled into your economy. It  was talking that it would take a decade for that lower quartile, the  poor middle class, the working poor, for their incomes to start to come  up.   It was solely a division of a number of people with similar skill  sets attacking the same types of positions and work. It was a Democrat  paper. I mean, it was written by folks who made it very clear they were  on the left.   Isn't it fascinating how quickly the understanding of demographics  and population dynamics--what it does to the very people that our  friends on that side used to say they cared about?   We do lots of virtue signaling here and lots of pretty words. The  data is the data is the data. The policies are the policies. The  policies are killing the middle class. They are killing the working  poor.   You start to look at these things, and here is the great irony. Think  of this. Last year, the last 2 years, legal visas have collapsed. At  the same time, you have these huge runs at our border. Now, this  probably requires a much more deep dive on economic multipliers and  certain types of skill sets and those things. The fact of the matter  is, these populations up here, we know we get an economic multiplier.  These populations over here, it is uncomfortable, but it is the math.  It becomes a contribution from society to them.   We did a presentation about a year ago and talked about if you saw  what was happening in the entire industrialized world--remember, the  only place in the world right now with positive fertility rates is sub- Saharan Africa. I know this is geeky, but it is important. I know it is  not politics by shiny object, which is now what Congress is about. This  is important. The Western world is collapsing demographically and  fertility-wise.                                time  1230    The driver of U.S. sovereign debt is our demographics. We are getting  older. Somehow Congress didn't figure out there were baby boomers until  the last year or two, and now they still don't really want to talk  about it; so for 65 years they just didn't know we were coming.   But what happens when you even see data--China's demographics are  collapsing. Europe's we know have been collapsing. Even countries like  India, we are seeing their fertility rates fall off rather  dramatically.   The model basically says in the coming two, three decades, it won't  be worldwide fights over hydrocarbons like we had functionally in the  1970s or rare earths. Remember how many people would come behind these  mikes just a couple years ago, rare earths, we are all going to go to  war over rare earths.   Turns out now that we know how to do the iron-air battery and all  these other things, the rare earth consumption looks like there may be  a path around the massive needs.   It turns out over the next couple decades it is going to be the  battle for smart people, and that is a really interesting thing to  think about.   So if we do the brilliant thing with unified leftist government, we  make sure that legal visas, legal immigration crashes, but we open up  our border to bring in more poverty and misery to even our own poor. I  mean, you can't make this stuff up. It is just like every policy set  has great headlines, great talking points, acting like you are caring,  and you are completely avoiding the misery Democrat policies keep  bringing to the society.   And then there are the things we sort of call second-degree, third- degree effects when you open up the border. Come to my community of  Phoenix, see the dramatic increase in homelessness. Does anyone else  out there care? I did a ride-along a couple weeks ago with a neighbor  who is an officer, and we spent 4 or 5 hours driving around. He has  been doing this, like, 28 years, and he's telling me he has never, ever  seen--that the homeless population has doubled; the crime, people  breaking in and stealing stuff, but they are stealing stuff from other  poor people. The violence.   And then we start to see the data of my southern border in Arizona,  the amount of narcotics. One of the classic--if you want to play  economist, the price of drugs that are killing people has crashed. When  you see the narcotics fall in price, what does that tell you? There is  a hell of a lot of them.   So, okay, maybe it is leftist orthodoxy you need an open border, but  did they have to flood my neighborhoods with narcotics? Did they have  to spike the homelessness around the country, particularly in Phoenix?  Did they have to make more people's lives miserable? Because that is  what the policies of this administration and the Democrats who control  this place have done. I don't think they meant to do it.   It was obvious if they thought like an economist instead of virtue  signaling for policy. Remember, we make policy now around here by  feelings, by what we can say behind these microphones to get someone to  send us money, even if it is crap and really hurts people.   And you start to see the misery the Democrat policies have put on our  streets. And of course their solution, well, we are going to send them  a check. Of course, the check will also continue the cycle of  inflation, making people poorer. It is just--I almost wish we could  have, where there is no television cameras, no mikes, put ourselves in  a room with a couple people who own calculators and say: Let's walk  through what has worked in the last 25 years and the things that  haven't worked.   Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Thank you, Madam Speaker.   Then when you are done doing your ride-along with the Phoenix city  policeman, he is heartbroken. He has actually even moved out of the  very neighborhood that he loved, that he has patrolled because even he  thinks the property crime, the violent crime, the people living in the  alleys has become too much for even him and his wife.   But the other thing he talked about was how many overdose deaths, how  many people--now, we need to accept, a lot of this is a combination of  COVID policy, economic policy. We are hunting for the 2021 number, but  everything we have gotten so far, we have created misery out there.  [[Page H970]]    Go pick up your community newspaper. Do they even still talk about  how many have died from overdoses or has it just become so commonplace  it is not worth reporting on that type of misery anymore?   And then you start to look at the crime statistics. And, look,  Democrats often accuse Republicans of talking about crime to scare  people. That is not where I am at. My district is an urban-suburban  district. I care about these lives, but I also am fascinated by the  economics of it.   Well, it turns out we did inflation, we did housing, we did the  devaluing of people's labor by opening up the border, but we almost  never have the conversation of how do you move out of poverty when  people keep stealing your stuff?   I have what I will call an acquaintance, he is almost a friend. As a  kid I used to hang drywall. He still has the drywall business. Now he  has passed it on to his kids and his grandkids, and they are really  good. They can do a level 5 smooth coat. That has always been my dream  to learn how to do that the right way. It is a weird hobby. And he  talks about they are now not doing projects in certain areas because  people keep stealing their stuff, and it is really hard to keep people  employed. It is really hard to be that micro-entrepreneur where you are  selling your talent, and your talent is functionally your willingness  to show up and the fact you have a couple drywall spades.   So we are also working on a project now in our office to try to  understand how much of income inequality, people being poor, is the  fact that they live in a crime-ridden area, crime-ridden ZIP Code where  people keep breaking their bones and stealing their stuff; and by  stealing their stuff, they can't accumulate assets, and how much of  that stuff was the very things they need for work.    And then you overlay just the incredible spike of deaths, of murders  that are happening in parts of the country. Now, maybe this is a  societal reaction to locking up parts of the population, idleness. I  don't know. I am not a sociologist. But we have to understand, so many  of our urban areas across the country, there is misery.   But there is hope. If we could get our policy sets correct around  here, there is incredible hope because we do have a society that  desperately, an economy that desperately, a country that desperately  needs people. They need workers. You see the workforce shortage  continues even with today's numbers.   We need to talk a little--I will do this; this might be a weird  transition. Really good unemployment numbers today. Even though  unemployment actually went up as a percentage, but the number of jobs,  which that is a good sign, people being willing to take the jobs, be a  little careful, we need to retake a look at what they call the labor  force participation number because it has been reindexed. Every year  you actually try to do a calculation.   We haven't had a chance to look at the Bureau of Labor Statistics'  underlying numbers. There was a beautiful spike in labor force  participation. We need to figure out how much of that, though, is they  changed the numbers of the population that is available to be in the  labor force. But today was a good number.   But the wage inflation number was really dangerous because we have  talked about one of our models we have in the Joint Economic Committee  is that if we spike much more, we are on the cusp of a wage-price  spiral. And that is just a great way to create misery in the society  because those are really hard to break.   Once again, we were doing, in 2018-2019--I believe much of it came  because we fixed some great inequities in our Tax Code. But something,  if you start to look at the data, why in this last year has there been  this massive number of retirees--a million and a half more--than we  ever modeled for? Why are so many people basically saying screw this, I  am out of the labor market, I am disappearing?   At the very time that if we were actually doing policy where you  wanted to deal with the debt, you wanted to be able to keep having  enough receipts, tax revenues to be able to keep our commitments on  Social Security and Medicare, if you wanted to lower the misery in the  country, you would be doing policies that would be trying to get young  males into the workforce--there is a weird number there where they are  not showing up for the workforce--but also folks who are eligible for  retirement, early retirement, to stay in the workforce.   Those are policies that I think Republicans and Democrats could agree  upon, labor and business could agree upon, and yet I sometimes feel  really lonely around here talking about these things. But it's the  math. You see these numbers. When you are losing a million and a half  folks who are choosing to retire early, you do realize the data  basically says a large portion of these people in a few years,  particularly if inflation continues for the next couple years, will be  in poverty.   One of the greatest ways to minimize poverty for folks in their  retirement years is to have them delay retirement. Something is  perverse out there when we have created a society that is incentivized  to go take your Social Security at 62 and take the cuts, the lower  benefit. I am just really concerned about this.   And then you start to take a look at other population dynamics. And  this goes back to my earlier statement that I believe in this coming  decade, actually the decade we are in and the next one, the fight for  smart people will be akin to the pursuit of rare earths or hydrocarbons  or those things from the past.   You see it, this is happening all around us. There is a collapse in  the demographics. This is China, U.S., Europe, and it is for all of us.  We are less bad than some of the others, but it is miserable. And it is  the great opportunity of saying if we would fix the Tax Code--and, yes,  maybe it is time to look at border adjustability, so we stop having the  arbitrage, and when we try to sell things there is this massive tax  arbitrage of manufactured goods from the United States.   But this is our reality. And yet this place will live on being  enraged over the next mask mandate or this or that. Those are big  deals. But they are not what is going to wipe out this Republic. Being  unwilling to deal with the fact of our math.   And so think about this. We should be ashamed--and Republicans have  part of this, too, as part of our sin. A small part, but part of it. We  have been trying to do the math. Take a guess how much money we handed  out per family in COVID aid. It is out there. So think of this.   I just showed you a bunch of slides saying working men and women have  gotten poorer in the last year, but the debt exploded in the last 2  years, and now we are doing the math, saying, do you realize we put out  over $76,000 per household in cash, that was COVID cash? Over $76,000.  That is our best math at this point. And we have been having to go up  and down different budget reports.   But do you feel, anyone here in this room or around the country, do  you feel you got $76,000 worth of value the last 18 months? But that is  what we spent, and that is what we tacked onto my little girl's bonds  that she gets to pay for.                                time  1245    Maybe the concept of throwing more and more cash and blowing up  inflation and destroying the incentive to work and delinking society  from the nobility of work--oh, by the way, that work actually makes  them much less poor. Now you actually start to see that, over the last  couple years, it made more sense not to participate in society.   This is what we did. Maybe they weren't thinking, maybe they didn't  mean to, but this is what we did. So we delinked--we functionally  financed staying home.   Then the last little perversity of just from today, you will hear  many of the left try to tout that $350 billion bill they just passed  here in the House. If you dig through it, it is like, you know, a 5- year plan, government-planned economy. It really is sort of terrifying.  But there is a little gem stuck in the left's bill they just passed.   Do you realize in there you have the pandemic ending in 2025? It is  not based on: Hey, we have antivirals now. Hey, we have vaccines now.  Hey, we now have home PCR tests. We have all the things we said we  needed. They are here, but instead, we are going to keep the pandemic  going--and that is what you all just voted on--until 2025.  [[Page H971]]    My argument is, it is about the money. The pandemic declaration has  become a conduit to hand out cash, hand out cash to your favorite  groups to make corporate America, hospitals, and others addicted to the  Democratic Party because they are handing out cash. And now, we just  passed a piece of legislation that says the pandemic ends in 2025.   I beg someone out there: Please listen. Turn course on the policies.  Come up with a unified theory that moves prosperity because economic  growth, prosperity, is moral. But almost every act moved by the  Democrats this year, almost every initiative from this White House, has  made America poorer. It has made America more dangerous. And now, they  are passing pieces of legislation to make sure we stay in this sort of  dystopian chaos for years more.   Take a breath. Look at the data. Look at the misery this place has  created over the last year. And seriously, I beg of you, consider  having some self-awareness and some reflection and stop it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
