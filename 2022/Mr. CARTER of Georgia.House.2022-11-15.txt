 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my  condolences to the families of Vince Dooley, legendary football coach  at the University of Georgia.   Coach Dooley was a talented multi-sport athlete in his youth and  played quarterback for the Auburn University Tigers.   In 1960, he married the love of his life, Barbara, and they have four  children together.   In 1963, he became the head coach of the University of Georgia  Bulldogs, where he led them through 1988. During his tenure, he guided  the prolific football team to a record of 201 wins and only 77 losses.  Coach Dooley's teams won six Southeastern Conference championships and  the momentous 1980 national championship.   As a coach, he received five Coach of the Year awards, was five times  voted SEC Coach of the Year, and has now been inducted into the College  Football Hall of Fame.  [[Page H8499]]    After he retired from coaching, he remained the Athletic Director at  the University of Georgia until 2004, guiding the football program and  building many other athletic programs into national powerhouses.                                time  1015    Off the gridiron, Vince was passionate about gardening and American  history and preservation. He was considered a master gardener and had a  species of roses named after him.   He was involved with many organizations that focused on preserving  Revolutionary War battlefields and was inducted as a Georgia trustee by  the Georgia Historical Society.   Earlier this month, I was proud to sign on to a resolution, alongside  several members of the Georgia delegation, thanking him for his service  to our State.   Vince Dooley was truly a pillar of his community, and his impact will  be felt for generations to come.        Congratulations to Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport on their selection as the  Conde Nast 2022 Readers' Choice number one airport in the United  States.   The Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport is a hub for travel  regionally, nationally, and internationally.   With its small-town feel, the Main Street-inspired concourse greets  travelers with a plentiful helping of southern charm. The many  restaurants and shops provide weary travelers, both coming and going,  with a snippet of what the First District has to offer.   I personally am very well acquainted with this airport, as I have  traveled through this airport hundreds of times on my way to and from  Washington, D.C.   Serving nearly 3 million passengers each and every year, the airport  serves as a gateway to the First District of Georgia and its many  destinations. Just a short drive away are world-class beaches, resorts,  and golf courses, with the cultural hub of Savannah being foremost.   Additionally, it serves as an important cargo hub in conjunction with  the Port of Savannah, the fourth busiest port in the Nation.   Despite their busyness, they excel in providing outstanding customer  service and southern charm. For the third year in a row, they have been  voted the number one airport in the United States.   I, on behalf of the entire First District of Georgia, congratulate  the employees and the administration of the Savannah/Hilton Head  International Airport for earning this distinction.                           Honoring Martin Grizzard     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the  life and service of the late Martin Thurman Grizzard of Thomaston,  Georgia.   Martin was born October 17, 1938, in Hixson, Tennessee. Being the  oldest of four brothers, he learned to take care of the people around  him at an early age.   In 1963, he would graduate from Mercer University's Southern School  of Pharmacy, committing his life to the care of others. Just 2 years  later, Martin opened Northside Drugs, a pharmacy in the small town of  Thomaston, Georgia.   During his long career as a pharmacist, he would serve on the Georgia  State Board of Pharmacy, eventually becoming president in 1984. In  2013, his store would serve its one-millionth customer after nearly 50  years of faithfully providing care for the community of Thomaston.   Though a million seems like a large number, it only represents a  fraction of the true impact that Martin would have on this world during  this time not only as a pharmacist but as a philanthropist and father.   Finally laid to rest at the age of 83, he is survived by his wife of  62 years, Mrs. Betty Grizzard; his daughter, Pam; and his three sons,  Martin Jr., Michael, and Stewart.   The prayers of myself and my family belong to the Grizzard family and  all those impacted by this tremendous loss.                            Honoring David Ralston     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  leadership and service of my good friend, my former suitemate, David  Ralston, who recently announced that he would be ending his tenure as  speaker of the Georgia statehouse.   David has been speaker since 2010 and has overseen some of the most  historic legislative accomplishments in our State's history.   He attended Young Harris College and North Georgia College, where he  earned his bachelor's degree with honors. He then went on to graduate  from the University of Georgia School of Law.   An attorney by trade, Speaker Ralston started his career in public  service in 1992 when he was elected to the Georgia State Senate. In  2002, David was elected to the Georgia House and was chosen as speaker  in 2010.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  leadership and service of David Ralston, who recently announced that he  would be ending his tenure as Speaker of the Georgia State House of  Representatives.   David has been Speaker since 2010 and has overseen some of the most  historic legislative accomplishments in our State's history.   He attended Young Harris College and North Georgia College, where he  earned his bachelor's degree with honors. He then went on to graduate  from the University of Georgia School of Law. An attorney by trade,  Speaker Ralston started his career in public service in 1992 when he  was elected to the Georgia State Senate.   In 2002, David was elected to the Georgia State House of  Representatives and was chosen as Speaker in 2010. During his term as  Speaker, he presided over the enactment of landmark legislation,  including the State's first-ever income tax cut in 2018.   In the wake of the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, he led the effort to  create and pass the State's hate crime law. Earlier this year, he was  one of the greatest proponents of the legislation, saying that this  bill was his ``only priority'' for 2022. The bill was a complete revamp  of the State's mental health care services and passed with unanimous  support.   He has been heralded as fair, thoughtful, and level-headed by those  on both sides of the aisle. While he will still serve in the Georgia  State House of Representatives, his presence on the dais will be  missed.   A committed public servant, statesman, and a dear friend, I thank  David Ralston for his leadership and for being a great suitemate when  we served together in the Georgia State House of Representatives.                            ____________________
