 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the fiscal  year 2018 budget resolution, which is a critical first step to  achieving comprehensive tax reform and making the American economy  great again. I also applaud Chairwoman Diane Black for her leadership  in producing this budget.    Our Nation has not significantly reformed our Tax Code in more than  three decades, which has allowed the Tax Code to explode in complexity  and unnecessary burden on hardworking American families and businesses.  Moreover, while the United States is a world leader in innovation and  entrepreneurship, we have failed to reduce our corporate tax rate,  which stands at 35 percent, the highest in the developed world. And I  would add, corporations don't pay tax; the American people pay tax.   The unified framework unveiled earlier this year will simplify the  Tax Code for everyone, eliminate wasteful tax loopholes, and reduce  taxes on businesses. I am also pleased to see that the plan eliminates  the death tax on farmers and moves to full expensing. Under this plan,  the average family will see an increase in income between $4,000 and  $9,000, annually.   While I believe this budget is necessary to spur economic growth and  increase wages, I am extremely disappointed that the Senate removed the  $203 billion of mandatory spending cuts, given the challenge the  national debt poses to our great United States. However, we should not  make the perfect the enemy of the good, and I understand that issues as  complex as the budget and tax reform require compromise.   I appreciate the leadership of Speaker Ryan, Chairman Brady, and the  rest of the leadership team for their hard work on tax reform, and I  look forward to working with my colleagues to moving tax reform over  the finish line and to President Trump's desk.
