 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, first of all, I thank the chaplain for  the happy birthday that was part of the prayer. So they heard it in  Heaven, as well as throughout the United States.   Before the 2016 election, Democrats speculated very feverishly: Would  Donald Trump accept the results of the election of 2016?   Then he won, and it is the Democrats who have refused to accept the  result. They sought to delegitimize the election, citing Russia's  meddling or questioning our Presidential election system. On  Inauguration Day, you know the famous Washington Post headline said it  all: ``The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.'' He was  President about 1 hour at that time.   In fact, we now know that efforts to fabricate a Russia collusion  narrative were already under way well before the President was  inaugurated. The same people are again fretting that President Trump  might not somehow accept the election results if he loses. And, of  course, under our Constitution, no President has any option but to  accept those results because the term ends on January 20.   But can't we also ask the alternative? What if President Trump does  win? Well, this was the advice from Hillary Clinton to former Vice  President Biden: that Biden ``should not concede under any  circumstances.''   So will the Democrats respect the election results this time?   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
