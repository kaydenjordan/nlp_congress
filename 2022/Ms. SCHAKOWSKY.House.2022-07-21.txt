 Madam Speaker, I thank the sponsors of this  legislation for their support. I have been proud to join them.   Madam Speaker, you know, you would think that everyone would want to  protect access to contraception and to family planning, especially  people who are opposed to abortion. Yet, we have seen that there have  been efforts to exclude available and effective contraception, that  there has been an effort to limit the choices that women have to even  have contraception. So, yes, we absolutely need to pass this bill. We  need to pass it into law. We need to do it right now.   Madam Speaker, 99 percent of Americans are in favor of contraception,  so let's pass this legislation. We should do it with all our Members on  both sides of the aisle.
