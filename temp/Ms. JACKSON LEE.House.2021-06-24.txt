 Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary  Committee, I rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 13, a Congressional  Review Act (CRA) resolution of disapproval to undo an Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (EEOC) final rule issued January 14, 2021 that  threatens to harm working people seeking relief from discrimination and  to impede the work of the EEOC.   The EEOC final rule made several changes to conciliation, the process  by which the EEOC tries to settle a charge of workplace discrimination,  all of which harm employees.   Instead of ensuring that discrimination charges are resolved fairly,  the EEOC's final rule imposes several new obligations and disclosures  that:   1. Significantly weight the conciliation process in favor of  employers;   2. Delay justice and increase the likelihood of harm to working  people;   3. Divert scarce EEOC staff time and resources away from  investigating discrimination; and   4. Contravene controlling U.S. Supreme Court precedent.   The Senate passed S.J. Res. 13 on May 19, 2021, and by following  suit, the House can ensure this harmful rule is rescinded and the  status quo ante is restored with respect to the EEOC's procedures.   The EEOC must be able to conduct its work efficiently in order to be  effective in its mission to prevent and remedy workplace  discrimination.   This mission is even more critical in the middle of a global pandemic  that continues to have severe economic repercussions for women, people  of color, and other marginalized communities, including a heightened  risk of job loss, health and safety hazards, and discrimination based  on sex, race, age, and disability.   Madam Speaker, individuals who experience discrimination on the job  already face significant hurdles to seeking redress, including  retaliation, lack of information about their rights, and lack of access  to legal assistance.   When an individual does file a charge of discrimination against their  employer with the EEOC, the agency collects information and conducts an  investigation.   If the EEOC finds ``reasonable cause'' to believe employment  discrimination has occurred, the parties are invited to participate in  the conciliation process, which seeks to settle or resolve the charges  of discrimination informally and confidentially, in lieu of filing a  lawsuit.   Title VII requires the EEOC to attempt resolution of charges  informally before considering or proceeding with litigation, and the  EEOC may only pursue litigation if conciliation has failed.   The final rule will only deepen the barriers working people face  coming forward to report discrimination and obtain justice by requiring  the EEOC to grant the employer access to details of the victim and  witnesses' identity and allegations, escalating the risk of retaliation  for workers.   Claims of retaliation made up more than half of all charges filed at  the EEOC in FY 2020, and fear of retaliation prevents many victims of  discrimination from coming forward and many witnesses from being  forthright--something that may be especially true during an economic  crisis.   The rule also requires the EEOC to disclose critical information  concerning the EEOC's legal analysis of the case to employers, and  employers only.   In other words, the EEOC would be required to automatically turn over  its case files to employers whom the agency believes to have acted  unlawfully, but not to the working people who are seeking a remedy for  the discrimination they faced.   This practice would exacerbate resource and information inequities  between the parties to the benefit of employers only.   The EEOC, whose mission is to prevent and remedy discrimination,  should not, in its own procedural rules, disadvantage the very party  seeking to remedy discrimination.   By imposing inflexible rules on the conciliation process, the EEOC  final rule also flouts congressional intent and is inconsistent with  Supreme Court precedent.   In its unanimous 2015 decision Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, 575 U.S.__,  135 S. Ct. 1645, No. 13-1019 (2015), the Supreme Court stated that  ``every aspect of Title VII's conciliation provision smacks of  flexibility,'' which allows the EEOC to tailor its approach to  conciliation in the way most appropriate in each case.   Without flexibility, the EEOC will be forced to divert resources away  from investigating and remedying workplace discrimination and put them  toward satisfying the final rule's burdensome standards, resulting in  increased delays at the expense of victims of discrimination.   By invoking the CRA and passing a resolution of disapproval, Congress  could quickly restore the status quo with respect to the EEOC's  conciliation procedures, minimizing the harm to workers and eliminating  the need for the EEOC to expend its scarce resources either undertaking  rulemaking processes to rescind the conciliation rule or implementing  the onerous new procedures in the final rule, and defending the  sufficiency of the new conciliation process in collateral litigation by  employers.   In addition, application of the CRA to the final rule ensures that  the EEOC would be prohibited from promulgating a ``substantially''  similar rule in the future that would hinder vigorous enforcement of  federal workplace antidiscrimination laws.   For all of these reasons, I strongly support S.J. Res. 13, the CRA  resolution of disapproval of the EEOC's final rule and urge all Members  to join me in voting for its passage.    Mr. Speaker, the greatest wealth enhancer that I  have seen in our immediate time in the United States Congress is the  child tax credit, which should be made permanent. It will provide an  opportunity for life and liberty and, yes, freedom for families in my  community; hardworking mothers and fathers and children who look up  into your eyes, some of them sometimes hungry.   It is important that this child tax credit be made permanent, and I  stand here ready to move it as fast as possible. Thank you to our  administration for what they are doing.   Now, I simply want to talk about justice in the courts, justice in a  court system that sentences individuals, nonviolent individuals to  years in prison to rot, even individuals who have done reimbursement or  compensation for their offense. Courts have to be, yes, a coequal  branch of government, but they have to have justice.   What about an individual that I have no stake in who happens to be an  entertainer under a horrible guardianship, forced to take medications,  forced not to have children?   I am on the Judiciary Committee and there is a lot to be done. Yes,  it is a coequal branch of government, but there has to be real justice.  When you go into a courthouse you deserve justice.                            ____________________
