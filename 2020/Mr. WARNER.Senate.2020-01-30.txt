 Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of myself, Senator Bennet,  Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Heinrich, I have a question to send to  the desk for the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Warner, Bennet, Blumenthal, and Heinrich  is for the House managers:         Our intelligence community and law enforcement leadership       unanimously concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 election       and that Russia continues those efforts toward the 2020       election. The Mueller report and the Senate Intelligence       Committee reached the same conclusion. Yesterday the       President's counsel said that foreign election interference       could be legal if it's related to ``credible'' information.       Does this mean it is proper for the President to accept or       encourage Russia, China, or other foreign countries to       produce damaging intelligence or information targeting his       domestic political opponents as long as he deems it to be       from ``credible information''?    This is for the House managers.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators and the Mr. Chief Justice, that is the  natural conclusion of what the President's lawyers are arguing.   Essentially, if the President believes that it would serve his  reelection interest to seek the help of a foreign intelligence service  to provide dirt on his opponent or in other ways assist his campaign,  as long as he thinks his winning is in the national interest, then that  is OK.   It is not OK, but no restraint can be placed upon him. Even if he  were to go so far as to proclaim a quid pro quo--hey, Russia, you have  got among the best intelligence services on the planet. If you will  engage those intelligence services on my behalf, I will refuse to  enforce sanctions on you over your invasion of Ukraine. That may injure  the security of our country, but, look, I think my reelection is more  important--that is where this bastardization of the Constitution leads  us--to the idea that no abuse of power is within reach of the Congress.   Now I want to take this opportunity to respond to a couple of other  quick points if I can.   First, counsel neglects the fact that, when we issued those  subpoenas, we stated in the letters accompanying their issuances that  they were being issued consistent with both the impeachment inquiry and  our oversight authority. They neglected to tell you the latter part-- that we explicitly made reference to our oversight capacity as  legislators.   Finally, on the issue of bribery, in the Nixon impeachment, there was  an umbrella Article of Impeachment that listed a series of specific  acts. Some of those acts involved criminal activity, and some involved  just unethical activity. If you were to accept counsel's argument, you  would have said that the articles that passed out of the House  Judiciary Committee in Nixon were likewise infirm because, if they were  going to charge the President with engaging in a criminal act, they  needed to make a separate article of it. Otherwise, how dare they? It  would be a violation of due process, and it would be thrown out of any  court--prosecutorial misconduct and the like.   OK. That is nonsense. On the one hand, they want to argue there is no  conduct here that is even akin to a crime, when, under McDonnell, in  fact, this would constitute bribery. Withholding a White House meeting  and withholding the provision of hundreds of millions of dollars in aid  under the precedent of McDonnell would be bribery, but there is no  doubt it is akin to bribery. They would say, unless you charge that--in  the Nixon case, they had 15 articles on each particular act, criminal  and noncriminal--then you could not make out a viable charge. That has  never been a constitutional principle. Just as they would have had the  House organize its impeachment investigation along the terms they  dictate, they now want to dictate how we can charge an offense.   At the end of the day, the task is to determine whether the conduct  that is charged has been committed and whether that abuse of power  rises to the level warranting impeachment. This is a technical legal  argument that, no, you have to charge it as we would like you to charge  it, and you can't make reference to the fact that, yes, these acts also  constitute bribery and that that is somehow offensive to legal or  constitutional principles. It is not. Yes, we could have charged  bribery. We could have had two separate counts. That is not a  constitutional requirement. Had we done that, as I said last night,  they would have attacked that, saying you are taking one offense and  making it into two.   That does not detract from the fact that the President's conduct  violated our bribery laws, particularly as they were understood by the  Framers, not as they were understood 200 years later. They violated  what the Framers understood from British common law to constitute  extortion. They violated the modern-day Impoundment Control Act. They  violated the Whistleblower Protection Act. They violated multiple laws,  but that is not even necessary.   What is necessary is that they abused their power. Counsel says:  Well, claims are made of abuse of power all the time. Yes, that is true  in political rhetoric, but these circumstances warranted impeachment.  The President was not impeached over climate change or any of the other  enumerable examples they gave of people rhetorically saying the  President is abusing his office. That is not what brought us here. What  brought us here was the President decided that he could withhold  military aid to an ally at war to get help in his reelection.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Oklahoma.
