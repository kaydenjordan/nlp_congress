 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 21. Once again, House  Republicans are showing their true colors--bringing a bill to the floor  that helps their Big Oil friends and hurts hardworking Americans.   This is a reckless and extreme bill. It will hamstring the single  most important tool the Biden administration has used to fight Putin's  price hike on gasoline. The chairwoman mentioned affordability, but by  releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the Biden  administration helped bring down gas prices by over $1.50 per gallon.  Republicans call that politicizing  [[Page H352]]  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I call that providing real relief to  the American people at the gas pump.   Again, Democrats are addressing affordability trying to bring down  high gas prices; and now, after promising to lower costs for American  families, House Republicans want to pass this bill that will raise gas  prices at the pump.   Make no mistake, Mr. Chair, that is exactly what this bill would do.  It would prevent the Department of Energy from using the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve to respond to price hikes until Big Oil is given open  access to drill on public lands.   Restricting the Federal Government's best tool for decreasing gas  prices in the middle of a global energy crisis defies any logic. After  all, this is a tool that administrations of both parties--Democrat and  Republican--have successfully used in the past.   It is baffling to me to see Republicans oppose President Biden's  release of oil from the reserve considering that in recent years,  Republican administrations withdrew even more due to oil sales that  they themselves mandated when they were in control of Congress. House  Republicans have also used the reserve as a piggy bank to withdraw  nearly 300 million barrels of oil to pay for their priorities. Yet now  they want to feign outrage that President Biden withdrew fewer barrels  to lower prices at the pump.   This is not serious legislation, Mr. Chair, but instead a political  stunt. Republicans are just upset that President Biden stood up and  actually used all the tools at his disposal to fight back against high  gas prices for American families.   This bill actually fights against American families and against  addressing affordability.   The Secretary of Energy was clear in a letter she wrote to Chair  Rodgers and me last week.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of that letter.                                        The Secretary of Energy,                                   Washington, DC, January 18, 2023.      Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers,      Chair, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Rodgers and Ranking Member Pallone:       Congratulations again on your re-elections to Congress and       selections as Chair and Ranking Member of the House Committee       on Energy and Commerce. I look forward to working closely       with you in the 118th Congress.        I write to express the Department of Energy's serious       concerns about H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response       Act. From responding swiftly to natural disasters to       executing a historic release of oil in response to Putin's       invasion of Ukraine, the Administration's use of the       Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has been critical to       ensuring adequate oil supply and lowering gasoline prices for       American families. This bill would significantly weaken this       critical energy security tool, resulting in more oil supply       shortages in times of crisis and higher gasoline prices for       Americans.        Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine created the worst       global energy crisis in decades. The President took       unprecedented action with allies and partners, releasing oil       from our strategic reserves, to stabilize global oil supply       and gasoline prices. We have heard directly from industry       over the last several months that these actions were       essential to maintaining supply.        And Americans see the results for themselves at the pump.       Today, gasoline prices are down by $1.70 per gallon from       their peak this summer. In fact, gasoline prices are now       below where they were before Russia's invasion. That was far       from a foregone conclusion a year ago. The Treasury       Department estimates that the Administration's SPR actions       reduced prices for American consumers at the pump by as much       as 40 cents per gallon. In addition to saving Americans       money, the SPR releases should provide a good deal for       taxpayers, by selling oil at a high price, with a planned       refill of the SPR at lower prices.        If enacted, H.R. 21 would make it harder to take such       action quickly to increase supply when the market needs it       most--driving up prices during crises. H.R. 21 would       significantly interfere with the United States' ability to       release oil collectively through the International Energy       Agency during an emergency supply shortage, as was done in       early March 2022. And H.R. 21 would severely restrict the       Department's ability to lend oil when disruptions occur due       to natural disasters or pipeline outages. Just last month,       when the Keystone Pipeline was suddenly shut down, refiners       in Texas and Louisiana were sent scrambling to keep       facilities running. This Administration--like those of both       parties have previously--quickly lent out oil to help       maintain operations, avoid shortages, and prevent further       price spikes. H.R. 21 would undermine our ability to take       such decisive action in response to future disruptions.        I believe it is essential that the SPR can continue to       address supply disruptions by rapidly providing oil in       response to emergencies. Arbitrarily requiring the completion       of reports related to energy production on Federal lands--a       matter which the Department of Energy does not control--would       only delay such critical action and increase prices for       Americans when energy disruptions occur.        Today, there is nothing standing in the way of domestic oil       production. In fact, oil production is up by 1 million       barrels per day under President Biden and is on track to       reach a new record high this year. Oil and gas companies are       currently sitting on approximately 9,000 approved but unused       permits to drill, and billions in record profits. They do not       need another giveaway.        I appreciate your consideration of these concerns, and I       hope we can work together on strategies to ensure American       energy productivity, security, and affordability.            Sincerely,                                              Jennifer M. Granholm.     Mr. Chair, in that letter, Secretary Granholm wrote that  by hamstringing the administration, this bill will result in ``more oil  supply shortages in times of crisis and higher gasoline prices for  Americans.''   The President also recognizes this bill is a bad deal for the  American people, and that is why he said that he would veto it if it  ever got to his desk.   Mr. Chair, I also include in the Record the text of the Statement of  Administration Policy.                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 21--Strategic Production Response Act--Rep. McMorris Rodgers, R-WA                             and 31 Cosponsors         The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 21, the Strategic       Production Response Act. The bill would significantly weaken       a critical energy security tool, resulting in more oil supply       shortages and higher gas prices for working families.        This Administration's use of the Strategic Petroleum       Reserve (SPR) has been essential to protecting our energy       security and to lowering gas prices for Americans. Following       Putin's further invasion of Ukraine last year, President       Biden authorized the largest-ever emergency release from the       SPR, in coordination with historic releases from allies and       partners. The results speak for themselves: today, gasoline       prices are $1.60 per gallon lower than their peak this summer       and below their pre-invasion levels. That was far from a       foregone conclusion: the Treasury Department estimates that       SPR actions reduced prices at the pump by as much as 40 cents       per gallon.        If enacted, H.R. 21 would significantly weaken America's       ability to take such decisive action to increase supply and       lower prices in times of crisis. Putin has tried to use       energy supply and high prices as a strategy to weaken the       United States and Europe's resolve to defend Ukraine. By       interfering with the United States' ability to release, oil       collectively, this legislation would help Putin's war aims.       In addition, H.R. 21 would severely restrict the       Administration's ability to increase oil supply and prevent       price spikes in response to natural disasters or pipeline       outages-as Administrations of both parties have done.        By arbitrarily requiring completion of a report related to       energy production on Federal lands, H.R. 21 makes it harder       to provide relief to Americans during energy disruptions       globally and at home. Moreover, there is nothing currently       standing in the way of domestic oil production. Production is       up by more than 1 million barrels per day under President       Biden and is on track to reach a new record this year. Oil       and gas companies are currently sitting on thousands of       unused but approved permits that they can use to further       increase production right now.        Because H.R. 21 will jeopardize our energy security and       increase gas prices for working families, the Administration       strongly opposes the bill.        If Congress were to pass this bill, the President would       veto it.    Mr. Chair, it is, frankly, stunning that after about 2  years of Republicans talking such a big game on energy security and  energy independence, that one of the Republicans' first bills this  Congress is a proposal that would seriously undermine both.   The truth is that Republicans' decades-old drill-baby-drill mentality  is outdated, it is reckless, and it simply cannot and will not protect  Americans from the volatile price movements of a global commodity. Our  country has adopted this mentality for decades, and it just doesn't  work.   The United States is already the world's top producer of both oil and  gas, and the fossil fuel industry already controls large portions of  U.S. public lands and waters, and it isn't using most of it. Right now,  fossil fuel companies control over 26 million acres of U.S. public  lands, half of which is going unused.  [[Page H353]]    The problem is not a shortage of land or leases.   Republicans only want the American people to think that that is the  case because they want to keep doing the bidding of Big Oil. But the  bottom line is, Big Oil doesn't want to pump oil because that would  lower prices. They don't want to do it. They don't want to address the  issue of affordability with gas prices. They don't want to pump more  oil.   No matter how much we drill anyway, doubling down on our fossil fuel  dependency is exactly what has kept us dependent on the global market,  and this global market where we have oil from other countries is  largely controlled by dictators and adversaries on the other side of  the world.   So, Mr. Chair, this bill is not serious. It is yet another old,  tired, one-page bill that shows just how antiquated and misplaced  Republican priorities are. We should be spending our time on serious,  thoughtful proposals that actually address our energy challenges and  opportunities, that lower gas prices as opposed to raising them, and to  ensure that Americans and their jobs don't get left behind as the rest  of the world transitions to clean energy.   Mr. Chair, if you really care about bringing down gas prices, you  would oppose this bill.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), who is the ranking member of the Natural  Resources Committee and who has worked so hard on clean energy issues.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), the former chair of the Select Committee on the  Climate Crisis who has done so much on clean energy issues.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cardenas), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Mrs. Fletcher), another member of our Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time remains on  each side?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Porter).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Mrs. Sykes).    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   I can't help but comment on the fact that my Republican colleagues  continue to get up and criticize President Biden for releasing crude  oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   I have to point out that Republican Presidents have done this many  times in the past, and I think the only reason why they are criticizing  President Biden is because they know it worked.   We know that since last June, when the gas prices were at their high  for the season, since the release, the prices have gone down by $1.50  per barrel, with all kinds of evidence to show that a significant  reason for that was because of releasing crude oil from the reserve.   Now, if you don't feel that is something that we should do, you can  say it, but the bottom line is, as Democrats, we were trying, and the  President was trying, to address an affordability issue.   The American people don't want to have to pay high prices for gas,  and they should not have to if we can do something about it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, again, in response to the previous speaker who  criticized the President, the President successfully used the SPR to  lower prices at the pump and provide relief to American families. Now,  Republicans want to take away the strategy, which will only result in  higher gas prices for Americans.    The President's strategy worked, and thanks largely to his actions,  gas prices have fallen an average of $1.50 per gallon nationwide since  their peak in June.   President Biden's actions also made money for American taxpayers. A  Wall Street Journal analyst found that the United States made nearly $4  billion in profit from Biden's sale from the reserves, receiving an  average of 96 cents per gallon of oil sold from it, well above the  current market price of approximately $82 per barrel.   The Department of Energy has already announced plans to purchase oil  to refill the reserve and will begin making those purchases at a low  fixed price later this month.   They have actually made money, lowered prices for the American  consumer, and are going to be able to fill the SPR at a lower cost.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   The previous speaker prior to the ranking member mentioned supply,  and I want to read sections of the letter from Secretary Granholm about  this that everyone received. She says:   ``Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine created the worst global  energy crisis in decades. The President took unprecedented action with  allies and partners, releasing oil from our strategic reserves, to  stabilize global oil supply and gasoline prices. We have heard directly  from industry over the last several months that these actions were  essential to maintaining supply. . . . If enacted, H.R. 21 would make  it harder to take such action quickly to increase supply when the  market needs it most, driving up prices during crises. . . . I believe  it is essential that the SPR can continue to address supply disruptions  by rapidly providing oil in response to emergencies. Arbitrarily  requiring the completion of reports related to Federal lands, a matter  which the Department of Energy does not control, would only delay such  critical action and increase prices for Americans when energy  disruptions occur. Today, there is nothing standing in the way of  domestic oil production.''   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Soto), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, today's bill shows that there is no real vision for  Republican energy policy. They don't have a path forward.   This was their chance to engage meaningfully on energy policy, to set  the tone for a new Congress, where we would work together to protect  American energy interests. Instead, they are reduced to defending their  oil and gas interests and attacking President Biden's successful  efforts to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower gas prices for  Americans.   I have said it before: Republican administrations, Republican  Presidents have released oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in  the past. I am sure that if we had a Republican President now, they  would be heralding the fact that he released oil from the reserves in  order to bring down gasoline prices at the pump.   I want to mention, again, this letter from Secretary Granholm, our  Energy Secretary. She states her Department's position on the bill.  According to her, this bill would severely restrict or threaten the  administration's ability to respond to emergency situations, such as  the emergency supply shortage from the one triggered by the war in  Ukraine. This bill would not only make it so that gas prices go higher  but make it more difficult for us to address supply problems.   The Secretary identifies, in my opinion, in irrefutable terms, the  Biden administration's successful use of the reserve to lower gas  prices for Americans.   Now, understand what this bill does. It prohibits the Department of  Energy from releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until it  expands oil and gas drilling on Federal lands by the same percentage  that it releases oil from the reserve.   The previous speaker, Mr. Soto, pointed out that the fossil fuel  industry already controls large portions of U.S. public lands and  waters, and it isn't using most of it. The problem is not a shortage of  leases or land. The problem is a fossil fuel industry more interested  in keeping supply artificially low so that prices stay artificially  high.   They don't want to pump oil because if they do so, then the gas price  goes down. That is not what they want. They want to make greater  profits.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues, please, the House Republicans are  doing the bidding of their Big Oil friends at Americans' expense while  threatening the President's ability to take timely actions to lower  prices for American consumers at the pump.    This bill is a giveaway to Republicans' fossil fuel friends, who  already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded subsidies and  enjoyed record-shattering profits last year at the expense of working  families.   Releasing oil from the reserve in response to Putin's invasion of  Ukraine was a critical, commonsense strategy that helped lower gas  prices for American families by a $1.69 per gallon since their peak.   Restricting the Federal Government's best tools in the middle of a  global energy crisis with no benefit other than increasing the profits  of the fossil fuel industry is extreme, and I don't use that word  loosely.   This bill is an extreme policy that is going to make it so much more  difficult for the President to act to deal with the supply chain  problems and to try to lower prices for average Americans. It is  extreme in the real sense.   Mr. Chair, for that reason, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  H.R. 21, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I don't disagree with the gentleman from  Florida in terms of prohibiting offshore drilling because I think that  we should not have any offshore drilling for oil and gas off the  eastern coast of the United States in the Atlantic and even in some  other areas.   I may have been mistaken, but I did not hear him mention the fact  that his bill also prohibits offshore wind and renewables off the coast  of Florida. I am totally opposed to the bill for that reason.    What we need to be doing is to be discouraging fossil fuels and  encouraging renewables. That is exactly what Democrats did in the  Inflation Reduction Act when we provided all kinds of incentives for  renewables, including solar and wind power, including offshore.   To have an amendment that says that offshore wind is not acceptable  or should be prohibited flies in the face of what we should be doing to  address the climate crisis.   For that reason, even though I may agree to the idea that----    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chair, I reclaim my time.   There is a very easy way, in my opinion, to manage and regulate  offshore wind. Certainly, it has to be regulated, but the gentleman's  amendment prohibits it and treats it the same way as he treats offshore  oil and gas drilling. Those two should not be equated.  [[Page H363]]    We need to move forward, and we need to encourage, as we do in the  Inflation Reduction Act, offshore wind and use of renewables around the  country.   Mr. Chair, for that reason, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1400     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment that would  exempt from the plan any oil and gas drilling in the North Atlantic  planning area which extends from New Jersey to Maine.   I opposed the underlying bill. I think it is poorly drafted and  extremely problematic, but I must make a point that in the incredibly  unlikely event that this bill would make it into law, we cannot have  any plan that considers offshore drilling in the North Atlantic.   An oil spill off the Atlantic Coast would be devastating to coastal  communities in New Jersey and up and down the Atlantic.   The Jersey Shore is home to over $700 billion in coastal properties  and the tourism industry generates almost half a million jobs, nearly  10 percent of my State's entire workforce. New Jersey's commercial  fishing industry generates over $7.9 billion annually and supports over  50,000 jobs.   Fortunately, there is widespread consensus that the Atlantic Ocean  should not be open to oil and gas drilling and put at risk of an oil  spill.   There are 259 Atlantic Coast municipalities on the record saying they  don't want drilling. In addition, 42,000 businesses represented by the  Business Alliance for Protecting the Atlantic Coast and 500,000 fishing  families from Florida to Maine are on record opposing offshore  drilling. They are right to support a ban. As you know, our coastal  communities depend upon healthy ocean ecosystems.   It is vital that the Federal Government protect the roughly 1.75  million American jobs and $137 billion in GDP that come from activities  along the Atlantic seaboard in industries such as tourism, recreation,  and fishing. It would be wrong to risk Atlantic coastal communities'  key economic engine--a clean ocean--for a roughly 7-month supply of oil  and a 6-month supply of gas when a spill would leave permanent damage.   I have been fighting to exempt the waters off the Jersey Shore from  oil and gas drilling for decades. It was the first bill I introduced in  Congress when I was first elected.   While I don't support the bill we are considering today, it certainly  cannot include any effort to open up our Atlantic Coast to drilling.   Mr. Chair, I ask all of my colleagues to support this important  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    I would like to reserve a point of order.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am  not opposed to it.    Yes, I withdraw the reservation of a point of order.    Mr. Chair, I do think actually that any amendment that  comes from either side of the aisle that would prohibit offshore  drilling off the coast of the Atlantic I would support. I think it  makes sense.   We have had this policy now in terms of the moratorium for a number  of years along the Atlantic and it should continue.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I reserve a point of order.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    I withdraw the point of order, yes.    Mr. Chair, I can only characterize this amendment as  extreme.   If adopted, this amendment would make an already reckless bill even  more careless and would weaken our national energy security.   Now, let me say that I totally disagree with what the gentlewoman  just said. First of all, what President Biden has done, as we have said  repeatedly today, is to release crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve in order to bring down gas prices. And he actually accomplished  that goal. It worked by bringing down prices about a $1.50 per gallon  since the peak last June.   In addition to that, we have set forth that this was to address the  supply chain because we know that with the war in Ukraine, the supply  chain was severely limited, and one of the purposes of releasing oil  from the reserve was to have more in the supply chain.   The gentlewoman also suggested that this administration is  restricting the use of public lands for drilling. That is simply not  the case. One-half of the public lands are available for drilling. As I  have said before, the oil companies simply don't want to drill because  they want to keep the prices artificially high.   Now, what the gentlewoman has done--and I just want to explain this  in a little detail. Right now, the bill before us does have an  exemption that says that you don't have to drill or put forth a plan to  drill on public lands if certain criteria are met.   It says that during a severe energy supply interruption, if the  President determines that an emergency situation exists and there is a  significant reduction in supply, a severe increase in the price of  petroleum products and/or such price increase is likely to cause a  major adverse impact on the national economy.   So even under this underlying bill, if those criteria are met, then  the President can use the SPR and release oil from the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve for these reasons.   What the gentlewoman has done--or tries to do--in this amendment is  eliminate those exemptions. So essentially what she is saying--this is  why this is so extreme--is she is saying it doesn't matter if there is  a problem with high prices. It doesn't matter if there is a problem  with the supply chain. We are not going to let the President release  oil from the reserve for any reason whatsoever unless a plan is put  forward to allow for more drilling on public lands.   That is extreme. Even the Republican leadership doesn't support that.  She is saying no exemptions whatsoever.   Imagine what this would do if we had no flexibility whatsoever no  matter what the price was, no matter what the supply was, and no matter  what the emergency is, not allowed. You have got to put together a plan  which could take years to put forward a way of drilling more on public  lands before we would be able to use this tool which is so important  for national security.   This is really, in my opinion, outrageous and extreme.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose  the amendment for this reason, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve a point of order.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I do support the amendment.    Yes.    Mr. Chair, I will be brief. As I said before, I am  supportive of any amendment that would prohibit oil and gas drilling  off the coast of the Atlantic as long as it does not also prohibit the  use of renewable resources such as wind. For that reason, I support the  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, again, I don't know how to characterize  this  [[Page H370]]  but to say it is extreme. The gentlewoman's amendment would provide an  even bigger handout to Big Oil, trading away our precious Federal  lands.   Now, just so we understand, right now, there is a limitation in the  underlying bill which, of course, we still oppose because the  underlying bill says that the plan--in other words, I think we all know  that this underlying bill says: You can't use the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve unless you open up more Federal or public lands to oil and gas  drillings.   But it does have a cap that says the plan required shall not provide  for a total increase in the percentage of Federal lands described,  lease for oil and gas, in excess of 10 percent.   Let me just give you an idea. In the underlying bill, it could result  in over 300 million acres of Federal lands being opened up for new oil  and gas drilling, an area equivalent to three times the size of  California and eight times the amount of Federal lands and waters  currently available for oil and gas development.   But the gentlewoman from Colorado says that is not good enough. The  government has to allow for another 5 percent beyond that, another 50  percent more than what I described in order for us to use the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve.   Again, the fossil fuel industry already controls large portions of  U.S. public lands and waters, and it isn't using most of it. Right now,  the fossil fuel industry is sitting on approximately 9,000 approved but  unused permits for drilling on public lands.   In total, the fossil fuel industry controls over 26 million acres of  U.S. onshore public lands, half of which is going unused.   Offshore, the fossil fuel industry has over 2,000 active leases,  covering 12 million acres of Federal water, 75 percent of which is not  being used to produce oil or gas.   So the gentlewoman says that she wants clean air and clean water.  Well, the consequence of this would be just the opposite. We would be  polluting the air and probably polluting the water as well, so it makes  absolutely no sense.   I mean, right now, there is nothing to stand in the way of  production, which is up 1 million barrels a day under President Biden,  not to mention oil and gas companies are sitting on billions of  dollars.   They are making huge profits. The oil and gas companies don't want to  produce more oil here in the United States because that would lower the  price.   They are about profits. They are about raising the price of gasoline  at the pump. By using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, President Biden  has reduced the price at the pump.   So what the gentlewoman is proposing is extreme because this even  allows more public lands to be leased, or require it, that is not going  to be pumped anyway because the oil companies don't want it, and at the  same time, prohibit this administration from actually helping the  American consumer by lowering prices. It is extreme.   Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to oppose it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentlewoman's  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment which would expose historic ranching lands in  Colorado to oil and gas extraction, extraction the community simply  does not want.   Mr. Chairman, the underlying bill we are considering today makes  clear that some in this Chamber want to see our public lands, lands  owned by all Americans, open to extensive new oil and gas extraction.  [[Page H372]]    As we have already heard, the bill risks opening an area more than  three times the size of California to new oil and gas development; and  this, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of Americans,  including more than two-thirds of western voters, consistently say that  they would prefer to see public lands protected rather than opened to  new degradation.   Protecting these lands supports the climate, outdoor recreation, and  local economies.   In the case of this particular amendment, the community in Thompson  Divide has already been fighting for more than two decades to protect  this area from new oil and gas drilling.   Since the early 2000s, the local community, including ranchers,  farmers, sportsmen, businesspeople, and community leaders, worked  together to fight for intact forests, big game and endangered species  habitat, and the region's ranching history.   Now the people of Thompson Divide have also opposed extraction  because they have seen its effects firsthand. They have seen how  companies more concerned with profit than public health polluted their  streams, leaking toxic chemicals into the groundwater.   The gentlewoman from Colorado, in the previous amendment, said that  she wanted clean air and clean water, but that is not the case. That is  not what is going to happen here with this amendment.   To stem these impacts, Democratic Members, including my good friend  and public lands defender, Representative   Joe Neguse, has long  championed protections for the Thompson Divide.   Because of these longstanding efforts from the community and those  who represented them, just last year, President Biden took action to  protect this landscape from new extraction for the next 20 years. His  decision to protect the Thompson Divide was cheered by citizens across  the State of Colorado as an essential protection for an irreplaceable  landscape.   This amendment before us would reverse these protections, exposing  this community again to poisoned wells and degraded forests. It goes  against the interests of the Thompson Divide community, against the  interests of Coloradans, and against the interests of the American  people.   So I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I heard my colleague from our committee  say that this was a perfecting amendment, and what I see it as is just  a more bureaucracy amendment.   The problem here with the underlying bill is that it basically makes  it impossible for the President to use--to release oil from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve when there is an emergency in order to  lower prices or to increase the supply.   What this amendment does is to put even more restrictions or make it  even more likely that a delay would occur because the gentleman says  that the plan required would include a list of parcels planned to be  offered for lease, including for each parcel, the size of the parcel by  acre, the location of the parcel, any permits and approvals necessary  to access the parcel, and produce oil and gas on the parcel.   Look, the bottom line is what it appears the sponsor wants is for the  Federal Government to spend its limited time during a crisis looking  over maps of critical public lands and drawing arbitrary lines instead  of taking rapid actions to lower gas prices for everyday families.   The underlying bill doesn't work because it puts all kinds of  restrictions on the President's ability to use the reserve, either to  lower prices, or to increase the supply in an emergency, and this  amendment only makes it worse.   It would throw more barriers to the Secretary using the reserve to  protect American families and businesses. It is so shortsighted,  considering how critical the Biden administration's use of the reserve  has been following Putin's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent global  gas shortages.   For a minority so concerned--I should say in this case, for a  Republican majority so concerned with cutting red tape, this amendment  would create quite a few unnecessary hoops for the Secretary to jump  through before taking swift action to help Americans. It just makes no  sense.   Again, over the past year, the Biden administration has demonstrated  that in an emergency, in an energy crisis, strategic use of the reserve  can bring relief to the pump for millions of Americans, and this  amendment puts that record of success by the Biden administration in  jeopardy.   So I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment and, of course, a ``no''  vote on final passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.    Mr. Chairman, I insist on the point of order.    Mr. Chairman, the pending amendment violates the  germaneness requirement of rule XVI, clause 7. That rule precludes  amendments ``on a subject different from that under consideration.''   The subject matter of the underlying bill is a requirement that the  Department of Energy issue a plan related to the leasing of Federal  lands for oil and gas drilling before certain first drawdowns from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   However, the subject matter of the pending amendment is different.  The pending amendment requires the suspension of certain financial  regulations limiting access to financing for oil and gas companies  until certain conditions are met.   Now, this places an unrelated condition on the drawdown of the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve that expands beyond the development of the  plan required by the underlying bill. Because the pending amendment is  on a different subject from that of the underlying bill, I urge the  Chair to hold this amendment as not germane.    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Ocasio-Cortez).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
