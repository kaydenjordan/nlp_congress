 Mr. Speaker, the latest inflation numbers are in.  Inflation has increased 7.1 percent in the last year, and in my home  State of Pennsylvania, it has increased 12 percent.   Despite the Biden administration celebrating, nobody in my district  is celebrating. There is no celebrating when my constituents go to the  grocery store, the gas station, and when they pay their home heating  bills. They feel this pain every day.   This inflation has primarily been caused by the assault on our  domestic energy and excessive government spending. We are now in  discussions on our appropriations bill.   Mr. Speaker, not only is the plan to add over 7 percent to compensate  for inflation--which was originally created by such excessive  spending--we are now going to double down and spend hundreds of  billions of dollars in excess of pre-COVID levels. In fact, the  Government funding bill being discussed is 25 percent more than  prepandemic levels and 10 percent more than last year.   There is no merit to this continued spending spree. It will only  further drive inflation and grow our deficit which, in turn, incurs  more interest to be paid on our debt. All the while the Fed is  increasing interest rates to further burden my constituents and to also  dampen our economy.   This is absolutely ``gas backwards'' policy.                            ____________________
