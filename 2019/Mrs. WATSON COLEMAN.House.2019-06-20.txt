 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share with my  colleagues the story of one of my constituents, Geraldine, as a  reminder that the work that we do here on the floor impacts people's  lives.   Geraldine received assistance from the Senior Community Service  Employment Program, which is also known as SCSEP.   We provided $464 million to SCSEP in the minibus package that we  passed yesterday, H.R. 2740. The bill included fiscal year 2020 funding  for critical programs at the Department of Labor that help Americans  like Geraldine find jobs and gain new skills in their journey to become  reemployed, programs like Job Corps, Registered Apprenticeship,  YouthBuild, and, of course, SCSEP.   Geraldine is a perfect example of why this funding is so important.  She is a mother and a grandmother and the main provider for her  granddaughter and two grandchildren.   When the financial crisis of 2008 hit, she lost her job, a  devastating moment for her family's only source of income. She quietly  retired, but like far too many Americans, she did not have enough  savings to stop working.   Her family needed her, and she needed to find work, a task made  difficult with her age, existing skill set, and, now, gap in  employment. Fortunately, Geraldine was able to take advantage of SCSEP  through Easterseals in New Jersey.   Created by the Older Americans Act of 1965, the Senior Community  Service Employment Program has helped low income, unemployed seniors  learn new, in-demand skills and reenter the workforce for more than 50  years. Participants enrolled in SCSEP receive a subsidized minimum wage  for work at a nonprofit agency while learning skills to help them  reenter the workforce.   But SCSEP does more than just skills training. Its greatest success  is helping seniors regain their sense of confidence and self- fulfillment. Some programs have services that help seniors get glasses  or even pay rent and utility bills.   Geraldine shared this with me, that SCSEP was instrumental in helping  her regain her sense of purpose. She was so successful in her program,  that she was offered a position at Easterseals to support new  participants in the program through their own journeys to reemployment,  people who were previously in the same position as she.   Increasingly, seniors like Geraldine have become the primary  caretakers for their grandchildren. This is especially true for places  that have been ravaged by the opioid crisis.   That is why it is so important that we support more programs at SCSEP  at the Department of Labor. There are countless seniors out there with  nowhere to turn. SCSEP is one of the answers that gets them back to  work.   Madam Speaker, before I close, I want to share with you one last  anecdote from Geraldine.   She shared with me her story about a boy in her community who didn't  want to throw away broken crayons. In defiance of his dad, this little  boy said even broken crayons still color just as brightly as ever.  Geraldine says that she sees herself in broken crayons and knows that  her colors shine just as brightly as any others.   We must ensure that critical programs like SCSEP are fully funded as  grandparents across America are increasingly becoming the primary  breadwinners in their families.   I am proud that my colleagues and I voted to pass H.R. 2740  yesterday, and as a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on  Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, I am  committed to advocating for more programs that support our seniors.                            ____________________
