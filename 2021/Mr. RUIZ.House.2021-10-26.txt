 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life of U.S. Marine  Corps Corporal Hunter Lopez and to urge the Senate to pass H.R. 5142 to  give our Nation's servicemembers who perished in Afghanistan on August  26, 2021, the recognition they deserve.   H.R. 5142 would posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal, our  Nation's highest honor, to the 13 heroes in uniform we lost that day,  including my constituent, Marine Corporal Hunter Lopez from Indio.   Corporal Lopez gave his life to save the lives of others. In fact,  just moments before the explosion went off, he had pulled two little  girls out of the fleeing crowd, preventing them from being crushed and  saving their lives. Because of him, two children now have a future and  the promise of a new life, many thousands reached safety, and many  others have a reason to hope.   And because of his efforts and the work of his fellow servicemembers,  over 120,000 of our fellow Americans and allies were able to evacuate,  and our Armed Forces completed the largest airlift in human history.   Madam Speaker, we must honor their sacrifice to our Nation. We must  award them the Congressional Gold Medal.                            ____________________
