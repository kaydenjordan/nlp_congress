 Madam Speaker, this is just one of the things that the  Caucus and the Congress have been doing to help make the economy  improve and help people deal with problems that COVID has caused us,  supply chain and all, which has slowed down the opportunity to get  products, and also causes inflation, but having the Workforce  Innovation and Opportunity Act to get people training, get them career  services, get skills to perform jobs is so important.    I think it was Mr. Courtney who mentioned how many more openings we  have than people to fill the jobs right now. I went to Walgreens the  other day and thought I got there early to get the drive-in, and they  said: ``We don't have enough employees to have the drive-in open this  morning.''   Everywhere you go, there is need for work, so we need to train people  so they can fill the jobs that are made available.   I am proud to vote for this bill, reauthorizing the program, which,  unfortunately, expired in 2020. This would put us back on track and  invest $78 billion over 6 years and retrain millions of workers per  year by 2028.   Memphis is a proud working-class city, and we must prepare our  workforce and our community for the 21st century and for the jobs right  now. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will ensure that  critical resources are provided for essential institutions like our  Benjamin L. Hooks Job Corps Center in Whitehaven.   This transformational work should involve all of our local leaders  and resources to ensure our programs and solutions are relevant and  useful to our community. I offered an amendment, which was accepted,  and I appreciate that. It will help ensure the subject matter experts  in local agencies, local educators, and community leaders can be  included as part of the workforce development boards. We look out for  each other in Memphis, and we want to see us move forward in the 21st  century.   Madam Speaker, I encourage everybody to vote for this bill.                                time  1500
