 Mr. Speaker, for far too long, families in my district  and across the country have struggled with rising healthcare and  prescription drug costs. So, I am pleased to report that relief is on  the way, thanks to Democrats' passage of the Inflation Reduction Act  this summer.   This act reins in out-of-control healthcare costs and will make a  real difference in family budgets by extending tax credits for health  insurance, capping prescription drug costs for seniors at $2,000 a  year, capping insulin costs for seniors at $35 a month, and allowing  Medicare to negotiate lower prices with drug companies.   A family of four in Ridley Park could save more than $2,800 in annual  health insurance premiums. A senior couple in Media could save more  than $13,000 in yearly healthcare costs.   If the Inflation Reduction Act's $35 insulin copay had been in effect  in 2020, a Springfield resident who uses NovoLog could have saved  $1,300 a year.   Importantly, all these benefits are fully paid for by making the  biggest corporations and billionaires pay their fair share.                            ____________________
