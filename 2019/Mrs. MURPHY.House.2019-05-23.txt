 Madam Speaker, if you spend your life working hard, then  you should have the dignity of a secure retirement. That is why I rise  today in strong support for the SECURE Act, a bipartisan bill that will  help more Americans retire with dignity and with a higher quality of  life. It allows older Americans to continue to invest more and for  longer in their traditional IRAs so that they can get a greater ROI on  their hard-earned money.   It also contains a provision I authored requiring employers to allow  long-term, part-time employees to participate in a company's 401(k)  plan. This change will especially help women, as women are more likely  than men to be long-term, part-time workers.   Finally, the SECURE Act fixes a mistake the Republicans made last  Congress when they rammed through their partisan tax giveaway to  corporations and the wealthy. In doing so, they inadvertently raised  taxes on Gold Star children and families.   As we fix this problem today, I hope this body remembers that process  matters and that a bad process leads to unintended consequences that  hurt everyday Americans. I am glad that we can undo some of that damage  today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the SECURE Act, which  is a good piece of bipartisan legislation that helps countless American  families.
