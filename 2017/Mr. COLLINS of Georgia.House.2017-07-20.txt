 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the  success of my friends and neighbors at the Hall County Chapter of the  Georgia Farm Bureau. This past year, the Farm Bureau launched Hall  GROWS, an educational initiative designed to help students expand their  knowledge of agriculture.   In my home State of Georgia, agriculture is the largest industry,  contributing $74 billion to the State's GDP. Our young people represent  the next generation of farmers, agricultural experts, and consumers. It  is our duty to ensure that these young students possess an  understanding of the strategic advantage that agriculture represents  for the United States.   The Farm Bureau is donating time, funding, and other resources so  that schools can cultivate gardens, hold workshops for educators, and  have classroom activities to help students. Because of efforts like  these, Hall GROWS can continue to make an impact both in the lives of  students and on the future of the industry.   The Farm Bureau's willingness to support students attests to the  generosity of the American farmer. I am excited to see this program  make a positive difference in communities like my own in Hall County in  Gainesville, Georgia.   Again, congratulations to the Hall County Farm Bureau for their work  and effort and Hall GROWS.                            ____________________
