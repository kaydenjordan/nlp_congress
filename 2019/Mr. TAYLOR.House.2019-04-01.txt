 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Johnny  Keith Wallace, who passed away on March 30, 2019.   Johnny Wallace was born on July 7, 1950, in Farmersville, Texas, and  married his true love, Linda Ann Roland, on May 4, 1973. He valiantly  served his country in the United States Army and served in Vietnam.   He returned to Texas and served 26 years as a member of the McKinney  Fire Department, ultimately reaching the position of captain.   While I never had the privilege of knowing Johnny, his loved ones  remember his commitment to his country, involvement in his community,  and dedication to his family.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House spend a brief moment of silence in  memory of Johnny Keith Wallace and that my colleagues keep his family  and loved ones in their prayers during this difficult time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 34 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, April 2, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
