 Mr. Speaker, for 2 weeks now, the long-suffering  people of Iran have taken to the streets to confront the thugocracy  that has oppressed them for more than 40 years.   Today, America must stand with the people of Iran. H. Res. 118 has  257 cosponsors, representing both political parties, expressing its  support for the Iranian resistance. I urge the leadership to bring it  to the floor immediately for a vote.   It is time for the United States to step forward with material  support for the freedom movement. They need direct satellite access to  the internet that the regime has denied them on the ground. They need  us to restore economic sanctions against the regime.   This time, in this hour, let the United States stand with the people  of Iran and, by so doing, honor those proud words on our Liberty Bell:  ``Proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the inhabitants  thereof.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this bill imposes $1.4 billion in new  fees on large companies seeking mergers and makes it easier to block  those mergers.   Now, mergers only occur when they promote efficiency and  productivity. They only occur when they enhance a company's ability to  provide better goods and services at lower prices. Interfering in this  process harms the prosperity of every American.   Let's start with the simple fact that taxes and fees on businesses  aren't paid by businesses. They are paid by consumers through higher  prices, employees through lower wages, and investors through lower  earnings.   How does increasing consumer prices protect consumers?   Where will these fees go?   Well, they are going to go to increasingly corrupt bureaucracies like  the FTC. That agency is now led by a radical leftist who has declared  her intention to use the powers of government to replace consumer  decisions with her own, all to advance her brand of ideological  zealotry.   The worst damage this does is to make the marketplace less efficient,  which makes prices higher, consumer choices less satisfying, and  ultimately diminishes our prosperity as a society.   Markets are inherently democratic because they fundamentally are  regulated by consumer choices. Consumers vote every day with every  dollar they spend what the market will provide and at what prices.  Consumer choices reward companies that best meet their needs and punish  the companies that don't.   Now, the left seeks to substitute its judgment for yours. It seeks to  tell you what choices you may make to advance their political goals.  For example, personally I don't care for Jeff Bezos' political views,  but he has built a successful, gigantic company by satisfying his  consumers.   Americans have voted with their dollars every day that the services  that Amazon provides are better than the many other alternatives they  have to choose from. The moment they decide otherwise, Amazon will  shrink and competitors will emerge and grow to fill those gaps.   Substituting government's judgment for yours, as this bill does,  ultimately undermines your right to decide for yourself who is best at  providing for your own needs.   Mr. Speaker, we need to reject not only this bill, but the poisonous,  authoritarian, and destructive ideology behind it.
