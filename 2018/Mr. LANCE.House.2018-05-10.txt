 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3053, the Nuclear  Waste Policy Amendments Act. This is an enormous achievement for  Chairman Shimkus, who has worked so hard, and so long, to make this day  a reality.   The Nation needs a safe, environmentally conscious plan to dispose of  this waste. This plan is bipartisan and sensible.   New Jersey is home to four nuclear reactors at three generating  stations: Oyster Creek, Hope Creek, and Salem. Oyster Creek will be  closing this October.   In the congressional district I serve, these plants account for about  half of the power generation and 90 percent of the carbon-free  electricity. New Jersey's nuclear plants avoid 14 million tons of  carbon emissions each year.   The Public Service Enterprise Group, FirstEnergy, and Exelon are  doing their part in storing their station's spent nuclear fuel on-site,  but we need a permanent site. The expertise and know-how of the Federal  Government has a responsibility to my constituents and to the American  people. I want the 3,000 metric tons of nuclear waste out of New Jersey  and consolidated in a national protected facility.   New Jersey ratepayers have contributed nearly $2 billion to the  Department of Energy's Nuclear Waste Fund to dispose of nuclear waste  at a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. My constituents should see  a return on that investment. New Jersey is one of the top State  contributors to this fund. It is time for the government to hold up its  end of the bargain and permanently remove this waste from New Jersey  and other States.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
