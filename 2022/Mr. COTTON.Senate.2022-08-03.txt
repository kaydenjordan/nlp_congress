 Madam President, today, the Senate exercises one of our  unique and most important constitutional responsibilities: debate and  ratification of a treaty.   The NATO accession treaty for Sweden and Finland is the most  consequential kind of treaty because it commits America to the mutual  defense of another country. We commit, along with our NATO partners, to  come to Sweden's and Finland's defense if they are attacked, just as  Finland and Sweden will come to our defense if we are attacked. It is a  weighty matter, indeed.   I want to explain why, if one honestly considers all the  circumstances and weighs all the evidence, I don't believe this is a  close debate at all.   If Finland and Sweden join NATO, the alliance will unquestionably be  stronger. The risk of war and of America being dragged into war will  decrease in Europe, and Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war of aggression  against Ukraine will backfire in another significant, lasting way.   I note at the outset how unusual this moment is. Finland and Sweden  are historically neutral countries. Sweden has refrained from joining  military alliances since the days of Napoleon. Once Finland obtained  independence a century ago, it also charted a course of neutrality,  even after the Soviet Union invaded Finland during World War II.   Now these historically neutral countries have petitioned to join  NATO. Why? Sweden and, especially, Finland have always lived closer to  the bear's den, and thus had a different relationship with Moscow than  we do. But now the Russian bear is rampaging, mauling a sovereign  country on its borders that is not in the ranks of NATO. Finland and  Sweden naturally want to avoid Ukraine's fate. They concluded,  reasonably enough, that there is strength in numbers, and they are  right about that.   If I were sitting in Stockholm or Helsinki, I would want to join  NATO, too. But we are here in the United States Senate. What matters to  us--what should matter to us--is what is in it for us. Much as we may  esteem the Finns and the Swedes--and we should; they are great people-- we need allies who enhance our common defense, not ones  [[Page S3890]]  who detract from it, allies who can pull their own weight and then  some.   Military alliances are not charities, but Finland and Sweden aren't  charity cases. They bring into NATO their well-trained and well- equipped militaries, technologically advanced economies, and vital  geography.   In particular, Finland is a country of warriors, with a long and  proud tradition, to put it bluntly, of fighting and killing Russian  invaders. In 1939, Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression--odd  how Russia keeps doing that--against Finland, in what has become known  as the Winter War. Few observers gave small Finland a chance, but the  outnumbered and outgunned Finns shocked the world--not least Stalin and  the Russian communists--by matching the Red Army blow for blow.   Ever wonder where the term ``Molotov cocktail'' comes from? The Finns  gave it to us. What they lacked in anti-tank weapons, they made up in  grit and courage. Finnish soldiers rushed Soviet tanks and dropped the  bottle bombs inside them, and they named the cocktail after Russia's  deceitful Foreign Minister for good measure.   Then there is the legendary sniper Simo Hayha, who killed an  estimated 500 Russian soldiers, among the highest number of confirmed  sniper kills ever recorded in combat. He entered into the history books  better known by his well-earned nickname, ``White Death,'' which also  happens to be what every Russian general to this day fears from another  tangle with the Finns.   The Finns also haven't forgotten the lessons of the Winter War. Still  today, every adult Finnish man must fulfill a period of national  service. Almost all of them choose the military. Finland has a 900,000- man reserve it can draw on in times of crisis and can field an army of  280,000 when fully mobilized. Finland's reserves are larger than the  reserves of France, Germany, and Italy--combined.   Finland has firepower in addition to manpower. According to scholars  at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, Finland has one of  the strongest artillery forces in Europe, with more rocket launchers  and howitzers than France, Germany, or the United Kingdom. It has a  strong fleet of fighter jets and plans to buy 64 American-made F-35s by  the end of the decade.   For its part, Sweden is an economic and industrial powerhouse that  will add muscle to the alliance. The Swedish Navy is an effective force  with advanced warships and submarines. The Swedish firm Saab produces  some of the world's finest fighter aircraft, radar systems, and  weapons. In conjunction with the British, the Swedes manufacture the  NLAW anti-tank missile, which is second only to the Javelin in killing  Russian tanks in Ukraine. I would also add that the Swedish firm  Ericsson, along with the Finnish firm Nokia, are among the world's few  alternatives to China's Huawei for advanced 5G telecommunications  hardware.   Finally, I should note that Finland and Sweden, unlike too many of  our European allies, are putting their money where their mouths are  when it comes to their defense. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine,  Finland boosted defense spending by 70 percent and will spend more than  2 percent of its total economy on its military this year. Sweden is in  the middle of doubling its defense spending and plans to reach that 2- percent goal no later than 2028.   For these reasons alone, Finland and Sweden are not only worthy  additions to the alliance but, indeed, will become two of the strongest  members of the alliance from the moment they join.   But that is not all. They also add key geographic advantages to our  alliance.   First, the Swedish island of Gotland is an unsinkable aircraft  carrier in the middle of the Baltic Sea--fewer than 200 miles from the  Russian exclave and military base in Kaliningrad. He who controls  Gotland controls the Baltic, which is why Russia tried to seize Gotland  in the 19th century and why Sweden garrisoned the island during the  Cold War. In the event of a conflict with Russia, NATO forces on  Gotland could prevent the Russian Navy from transiting the Baltic Sea  freely or from resupplying Kaliningrad by sea. Gotland-based forces  would also make it easier to relieve the Baltic States by sea and air  in the event of a Russian invasion.   Second, Finland controls the northern shores of the Gulf of Finland,  through which Russian ships must pass to reach St. Petersburg, Russia's  second largest city. Our NATO ally Estonia already controls the  southern coastline of this long and narrow waterway that is not even 30  miles wide at its smallest point. By adding Finland to the alliance,  Russian naval operations through the gulf would become even more  difficult.    Third, the Danish Straits would also become, in effect, NATO waters.  Russia's Baltic Fleet must pass through this strategic chokepoint to  get in or out of the Baltic. Denmark, a NATO ally, controls the  southern and western portions of the straits. Sweden controls the  northern and eastern shores. By adding Sweden to the alliance, we  further complicate Russia's naval operations.   Fourth, the 800-mile border of Russia and Finland rightly complicates  Russia's war planning and defense in the event of conflict. In fact,  this border would more than double the amount of border that Russia  must defend. Finland will also threaten Russia's major military  installations in the Kola Peninsula, where Russia's largest and most  advanced naval forces are positioned to break out into the Atlantic and  threaten the United States.   So aside from their military strength and economic power, Finland and  Sweden also allow us to turn the Baltic into a NATO lake, bottle up  Russia's Baltic Fleet, cut off its isolated military base at  Kaliningrad, and expose Russia itself to much greater risk in the event  of a conflict.   All things considered, then, one might contend that Finland and  Sweden are the strongest candidates to join NATO since its origin in  1949. We will soon see that most Senators agree, when we vote later  today.   And, really, how can one disagree? After all, the last countries to  join NATO, Montenegro and North Macedonia, were each approved by the  Senate with only two ``no'' votes. Those countries brought their own  case for accession to NATO. But let's be honest. Who can deny the much  stronger cases for Finland and Sweden, countries that are far larger  and far more capable and far more strategically situated?   It would be strange indeed for any Senator who voted to allow  Montenegro or North Macedonia into NATO to turn around and deny  membership to Finland and Sweden. I would love to hear the defense of  such a curious vote.   But since some observers have criticized their bid for membership,  let me address those arguments now.   The most basic argument isn't really directed at Finland or Sweden,  but at NATO itself. Some critics say America shouldn't pledge to  protect countries halfway around the world, but these critics are seven  decades too late. We are already treaty-bound to defend more than two  dozen nations in Europe. Whether we support this treaty today or not,  we will still be treaty-bound to defend those nations. So the real  question today is whether adding two capable and strong nations to our  mutual defense pact will make us stronger or weaker. The evidence I  have shared demonstrates that adding Finland and Sweden will indeed  make it stronger, more likely to deter Russian aggression and to defeat  Russian aggression, should it come.   Next, some opponents contend that admitting Finland, in particular,  is a liability because the United States would be committing to the  defense of its 800-mile border with Russia. This argument is both  alarmist and backward. It is alarmist because Russia hasn't attacked a  NATO member in its more than 70-year history, even as it has attacked  many non-NATO countries. Given the Russian Army's pitiful performance  in Ukraine, they will be in no shape to break with that record any time  soon. And of all European nations, Finland is probably the least likely  to be attacked by Russia after the searing trauma of the Winter War.  ``White death'' is a strong deterrent.   Moreover, these critics are thinking about this issue backward. As I  said earlier, it is Russia that has to worry about its long border  should it attack our allies. NATO is a defensive alliance. It always  has been, always will be. Neither Finland nor any other NATO country  has any plan or desire  [[Page S3891]]  to invade Russia. But should Russia ever be tempted to attack NATO, the  Finnish border creates nearly insurmountable war-planning dilemmas for  the Russian general staff. To borrow what U.S. Grant told his  commanders about Robert E. Lee, rather than worrying about what Russia  might do at Finland's border, Russia should be worried about what NATO  would do if Russia attacks us. Putin seems worried, after all. He  blustered and threatened consequences if Sweden and Finland sought NATO  membership, but he meekly acquiesced once they did.   Still, other critics say our main strategic focus should be on China,  not Russia. I agree. China is the greatest long-term threat to the  United States, but admitting Finland and Sweden to NATO enhances our  common defense, especially our defenses in Europe. A NATO that is  stronger militarily, economically, and geographically in Europe is a  NATO that needs to lean less on American power. We ought to welcome  strong, capable allies in Europe who can free up the American military  to focus more on the Pacific theater. That is doubly true when those  allies have key companies, like Ericsson and Nokia, that can also help  us beat China in the global technology race.   Others have objected that the majority of NATO members are currently  failing to pay their fair share toward our common defense. I agree here  too. I am tired of freeloading, grandstanding friends. But how is that  a criticism of Sweden or Finland? As I said, Finland already pays its  fair share, and Sweden has charted a clearer path there than have many  current NATO members, and both nations are doing so for a reason more  durable than diplomatic sweet talk--perceived danger.   Some claim that expanding NATO will provoke Russian aggression, but  the fact is, NATO expansion is the result, not the cause, of Russian  aggression. Countries are banging on NATO's door because of Russia's  behavior. Indeed, Russian aggression is the cause of today's debate. As  I mentioned earlier, Sweden and Finland have long histories of  neutrality. Vladimir Putin's violence toward his neighbors has now made  that neutrality untenable in their minds.    Finally, a few critics of NATO expansion love to quote the words of  George Washington's Farewell Address. It is true our first President  warned against ``permanent alliances,'' and he recommended ``as little  political connection as possible'' with other nations. That advice was  well-suited for a young, weak Republic in 1796. Yet Washington didn't  stop writing where these critics stopped reading. That great statesman  foresaw a future when America would gain strength, stand up, and assert  itself.   Washington continued:         With me, a predominant motive has been to endeavor to gain       time to our country to settle and mature its yet recent       institutions, and to progress without interruption to that       degree of strength and consistency, which is necessary to       give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.    We have gained, since Washington's time, the command of our own  fortunes. One of the pillars of our strength in modern times is our  network of allies and partners in the Old World. These beachheads and  lodgments of freedom help us keep the awful power of modern war at a  distance. Finland and Sweden are two such nations. They have asked to  join our mutual defense alliance, and they are worthy partners.   I urge my colleagues to grant their request, ratify this treaty, and  welcome two more strong beachheads and lodgments into the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization.   I yield the floor.
