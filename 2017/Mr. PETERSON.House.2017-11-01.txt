 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2936 addresses some valid concerns regarding  forest management. The bill would simplify forest management activities  while also tamping down on overzealous regulations and policy decisions  made by activists and bureaucrats who have adopted a sue and settle  strategy to pursue their agenda. This is one of the main reasons why I  am a cosponsor of H.R. 2936.   While this bill isn't exactly what I would do if I was in charge of  putting the bill together, we need to do something to address forest  management concerns, and I believe that this bill seeks to do that and  moves us in the right direction. So I am supportive of moving the  process along so that we can negotiate with our Senate colleagues and  find a workable solution to address these issues.
