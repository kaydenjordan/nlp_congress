 Mr. President, I think everyone in this Chamber would  agree that free and fair elections are the bedrock of our democracy. We  know it has been under attack. We know, from the Mueller report, that  Russia, in 2016, used a systematic and comprehensive attack on our free  election system to try to undermine our democracy.   That attack occurred in the State of Maryland. Let me just quote, if  I might, from the Washington Post article that said:         Maryland was never in play in 2016. The Russians targeted       it anyway.    The article states:         Russia's Twitter campaign to influence the 2016       presidential election in Maryland began in June 2015, 17       months before Election Day, when the St. Petersburg-based       Internet Research Agency opened an account it called       @BaltimoreOnline and began tweeting about local news events.        Yet, the IRA, the Russian troll factory that U.S.       prosecutors blame for the massive disinformation efforts       during the 2016 campaign, devoted enormous attention and       preparation to its Maryland operation, all in a likely       effort, experts say, to widen racial divisions and demoralize       African American voters.    That is what happened in 2016. Our intelligence community tells us  that Russia is active today trying to influence our 2020 elections, and  they are using technology to try to undermine our free election system.  We must do more to protect our system.   It was for that reason and many others that I introduced S. 1834, the  Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2019. It  is cosponsored by Senator Klobuchar, Senator Leahy, Senator Feinstein,  and others. This bill is an effort to try to protect us from this type  of international interference in our elections, as well as local  efforts that are aimed at trying to intimidate voters targeted at  minority voters. That should have no place in American politics.   This bill did pass the House of Representatives in March of this year  in H.R. 1.   Very quickly, let me tell you what this bill does. It prohibits  individuals from knowingly deceiving others about the time, place,  eligibility, or procedures for participating in a Federal election;  addresses new digital challenges that pose a threat to citizens  exercising their right to vote, particularly the use of digital  platforms to disseminate false information regarding Federal elections;  and combating voter intimidation, especially efforts aimed at  suppressing voter rights.   I would hope every Member of this Chamber would support these  efforts. Unfortunately, the majority leader has failed to bring any of  these issues to the floor or give us any time to take up legislation in  order to protect our free election system. Time is running out. The  election primaries will start early next year. We need to take action  now.   That is why I am going to make this unanimous consent request. I hope  we can agree to it.   I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged  from further consideration of S. 1834, the Deceptive Practices and  Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2019; that the Senate proceed to  its immediate consideration; that the bill be read a third time and  passed; and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I regret that my colleague has raised the  objection. Let me point out that this bill has been pending in previous  Congresses. We have gone through all of the challenges my friend has  already talked about. There are real problems that are occurring in our  States.   We had billboards in minority communities highlighting voter fraud in  an effort to intimidate African-American voters. We have seen  information sent out with wrong dates of elections. We have seen  robocalls pretending to be from a particular campaign when they are  from the opposite campaign in an effort to intimidate voters from  participating.  [[Page S6081]]    We can always find reasons why we shouldn't consider legislation, but  the truth of the matter is that we have given the OK in our system for  some to say it is all right to try to intimidate voters from voting-- something I would hope this Congress would want to go on record to say  it should have no place in America, particularly when it is targeted at  minority communities in an effort to reduce their numbers.   I regret my colleague has objected, and I hope that we will have a  chance to take up election security legislation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
