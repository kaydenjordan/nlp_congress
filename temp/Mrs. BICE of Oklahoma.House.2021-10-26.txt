 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the  heat your home tax that Democrats are adding to the partisan  reconciliation package during our country's crippling economic crisis.   Americans are paying the most for a gallon of gas in 7 years, and now  the Federal Government is warning Americans that their home heating  bills could cost 54 percent more this winter compared to last.   This harmful provision authorizes the EPA to assess a $1,500 tax per  ton of methane emissions on energy producers, transmission, storage,  processors, import and export, and pipelines. As a result, gas prices  will continue to skyrocket, heating bills will increase up to $242 per  year, and thousands of jobs could be eliminated in the economy.   Madam Speaker, Americans will physically feel the effects of  Democrats' senseless tax hike when choosing whether they can afford to  heat their homes this winter. Instead of addressing our country's  energy crisis at hand, Democrats are actively working to make it worse.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to consider these chilling  effects and vote against the Democrats' reckless reconciliation  package.                            ____________________
