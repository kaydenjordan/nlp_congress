 Mr. President, while the House continues to be absent,  the Senate continues to be open for business. While taking smart  precautions, Senators have stood with all the other essential workers  who are continuing to man essential posts. So as our Nation continues  to work through medical, economic, and social challenges of historic  proportions, the Senate has been able to lead on serious action to help  our Nation heal.   The killings of Black Americans, such as Breonna Taylor and George  Floyd, have rightly accelerated the national conversation on policing  and racial justice. Large majorities of Americans support new steps  that would help the vast majority of good, decent, and brave law  enforcement officers re-earn the trust of Black Americans for their  vital institutions.   We need to be a country where communities of color feel confident  that the police are there to safeguard their rights to equal justice  and equal protection under law and not to infringe on those rights.   To that end, while the Constitution means many of the specifics of  police reform are primarily State and local issues, there is an  enormous appetite in the Senate to incentivize change and move toward  greater progress using Federal policy.   The junior Senator from South Carolina has led the development of a  strong new proposal. The JUSTICE Act is informed by data, by the facts,  by stories from across America, and, sadly, by his own lived  experience. It enjoys the support of 46 cosponsors already.   The legislation Senator Scott has put forward identifies productive  ways that Congress can encourage and incentivize smart police reform  efforts in communities all across our country.   Recognizing the urgent need for greater accountability, it supports  expanded use of body cameras and expanded review and disciplinary  measures to back them up.   Recognizing the need for more transparency, it steps up efforts to  establish the records of police activities and requires full Federal  reporting of all incidents involving the discharge of a service weapon.   The bill takes immediate action to help end departments' reliance on  choke holds and to facilitate enhanced training for deescalation. It  includes further steps to protect the physical safety of people in  custody and to finally--finally make lynching a Federal  [[Page S3114]]  crime. It lays out new requirements for departments to explain their  policies on how, when, and why no-knock warrants are used. On behalf of  the many people looking for answers in my hometown of Louisville, I am,  unfortunately, especially interested in that provision.   In recent weeks, the Democratic leader and many of our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle have insisted--insisted--over and over and  over again that they wanted to consider legislation on this subject  prior to the Fourth of July. My friend the Democratic leader repeatedly  expressed how eager--eager he was to consider these issues here on the  Senate floor, but now we read this: ``Senate Democrats are agonizing  over what to do about Senate Republicans' police reform proposal.''  What is there to agonize over?   And we read this: ``[The] Senate Democratic leader . . . faces a  tough call on whether to let a Republican-backed police reform bill  advance on the Senate floor.''   ``Agonizing''? ``Tough call''? It seems to me that proceeding to  consider Senator Scott's legislation, proceeding to take up the subject  on the Senate floor, would only be an agonizing prospect if Members  were more interested in making a point than in actually making a law.   For anyone who actually wants to legislate, it shouldn't be a  difficult call to vote to begin considering Senator Scott's  legislation. It will be exactly the vote which this moment demands.   Last week, I understand the Speaker of the House herself said: ``We'd  like to end up in conference'' on police reform legislation. The only  way to do that would be if the Senate passed a bill. Even the Speaker  does not seem to understand why Senate Democrats would block this  Chamber from even considering the JUSTICE Act.   Senator Scott and Senate Republicans are interested in making a law.  The President and the administration want to make a law, and even the  Democratic House leadership apparently would be happy to see a  conference committee. So maybe the only group left in Washington who  are reportedly agonizing over whether to block discussion of police  reform or to let it proceed seem to be our Senate Democratic  colleagues.   I hope that whatever strange political calculations are making this  difficult for our friends across the aisle will yield to common sense  and to the American people's hunger for progress. We are going to find  out when we vote later this week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 480,  S. 3985.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the motion to proceed.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
