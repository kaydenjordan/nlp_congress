 Mr. President, I come to the floor today in opposition  to a cruel and misguided attack on millions of student loan borrowers  in New Jersey and across the country. I understand that some of my  colleagues are intent on overturning President Biden's signature  policies no matter the cost or the consequence. But to overturn his  landmark student debt relief program just to score political points, to  force borrowers to pay back their loans with interest and stick it to  the administration, well, that, to me, is just cruelty for the sake of  cruelty.   How else can you describe a proposal that would strip away one of the  most important economic lifelines borrowers have relied on? Other than  cruel, what else can you call a resolution that rips away benefits for  up to 43 million Americans who stand to benefit from President Biden's  relief plan?   I remind my colleagues that the pause on student loan repayments has  saved borrowers an average of over $233 per month, an amount that is  particularly crucial for our Nation's teachers, nurses, police  officers, and firefighters who rely on the Public Service Loan  Forgiveness program.   For a moment, I would like to focus on the impact this resolution has  on them, because for these public service employees, $233 can mean the  difference between making it to the end of the month or not. Make no  mistake. Repealing this relief especially hurts public sector workers  all across the country--the very people who go to work every day to  care for us, protect us, educate our kids and keep us safe.   Is this body really trying to claw back benefits from thousands of  everyday heroes in our communities? Is this really what my colleagues  set out to do?   For years, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program has enjoyed  bipartisan support because it is essential to the promise of America.  After all, if you take out loans in support of an education for a  career benefiting others, then you deserve to see your balance forgiven  after 120 payments or 10 years, as outlined under the law.   For many individuals, the economic challenges of COVID and the  reforms that occurred as a result were the first time that they were  able to enjoy the program's benefits. This harmful proposal erases that  progress and, once again, imposes the burden of debt on hard-working  teachers, nurses, police officers, and firefighters. This proposal is a  slap in the face to them and to their shot at the American dream--full  stop.   It is a slap in the face for Public Service Loan Forgiveness  borrowers and for the full universe of Americans who stand to benefit  from student loan relief, which is why I encourage all of my colleagues  to ask themselves: Is this vote--this misguided proposal--the kind of  message you feel proud to send? When the history books are written  about this moment in time, do you want to stand on the side of the 43  million Americans who have played by the rules and stand to benefit  from long overdue student loan forgiveness, or do you want to stand on  the side of those who punish hard-working Americans for trying to get  ahead? That, to me, is the stark moral decision that is before this  Chamber.   With your vote, you can choose to support the borrowers you represent  by rejecting this plan, or you can blindside them, rolling back nearly  8 months of interest benefits they have earned and deserve.   In no uncertain terms, this resolution increases the yoke of student  loan debt and sets up borrowers to fail. That is not something that I  want to vote for, and it is not something that any Member of this  Chamber should want to vote for. I urge my colleagues to vote no.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, every year, Fairleigh Dickinson  University in my home State of New Jersey honors its heritage and  history by bringing together alumni, friends, and partners to celebrate  Charter Day. It is a wonderful tradition on campus, often requiring  months of planning in advance by a legion of dedicated staff, all to  recognize the people and the places that make FDU a shining beacon for  the Garden State.   Today, on this year's Charter Day, it brings me great pleasure to  join the Fairleigh Dickinson community as they recognize the esteemed  author, entrepreneur, and philanthropist: Ms. Micheline Nader. As a  member of the FDU board of trustees, Ms. Nader is tasked with providing  sage counsel to the university's leadership, including its president,  Dr. Michael Alvaltroni. However, in addition to her duties as a  trustee, Ms. Nader is a testament to the different ways that one can  answer the call to serve. Ms. Nader began her legendary career as a  trail-blazing hospital administrator who, in addition to her business  acumen, successfully translated her experience into a second calling as  a writer helping support others. In both of these roles, she has helped  individuals overcome obstacles, unlock their potential, and achieve  long-lasting wellness and success.   Ms. Nader is a visionary leader who has never let anything slow her  down. After all, it was her drive that led her to found the Blue  Dolphin Healthcare Group, a pioneering chain of nursing homes that give  seniors the care, support, and fulfillment they need to enjoy  retirement. Her best-selling books have also provided guidance for  others to leverage their passions to foster personal growth and create  social impact.   From founding and leading her own company to currently serving as  president of her family nonprofit, Ms. Nader is an inspiration for New  Jerseyans everywhere. In addition to serving on the Fairleigh Dickinson  University's board of trustees and on the advisory board of the  Silberman College of Business, Ms. Nader is a staunch advocate for the  next generation of leaders. Her mantra of LEAP--lean, execute, align,  and program--has been used countless times by leading figures to  transcend the past and create a new future.   I join her family, friends, loved ones and her devoted husband Dr.  Francois Nader, in thanking Micheline for her many years of service to  New Jersey and the communities who call it home. It is my distinct  honor to submit this recognition into the Congressional Record so that  it may stand the test of time alongside her numerous contributions and  accomplishments.                            ____________________
