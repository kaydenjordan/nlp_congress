 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1457, the Making Online Banking Initiation Legal  and Easy, or MOBILE, Act, permits financial institutions to copy or  scan a consumer's driver's license or personal ID card when a consumer  decides to obtain a financial product or service.   At a time when more Americans are conducting their business online  and through their phones, the MOBILE Act will help expand access to  banking products and financial services for those consumers who do not  have access to a traditional brick-and-mortar financial institution by  allowing consumers to utilize their smartphones to open a checking or  savings account.   While financial inclusion has increased significantly over the past  20 years, still, too many Americans do not get their basic financial  needs met by traditional financial service providers. For example, in  June 2016, the Obama administration released a report indicating that  about 7 percent of American households still lack access to a bank  account, and another 20 percent supplement their bank account with  nontraditional financial services like check cashing or payday loans.    Technological innovations in the financial industry and commonsense  proposals like the MOBILE Act here in Congress will continue to help us  close this gap. The bill will expand credit opportunities for consumers  who cannot easily get to a bank in person and provides them access to  innovative new products that can improve their overall financial  health.   An amendment in the nature of a substitute was adopted in committee  that makes the MOBILE Act even stronger, and I want to thank Mr. Tipton  for putting these improvements forward.   These improvements require financial institutions to permanently  delete copies of consumers' ID cards within a reasonable amount of time  after they have opened the account, made clarifying changes to better  harmonize the bill's requirements with Federal bank secrecy laws, and  recognized identification cards issued by federally recognized Indian  Tribes as an acceptable identification card.   Perhaps most importantly, the bill also prohibits financial  institutions from selling or otherwise sharing the personally  identifiable information they collect from consumers with unaffiliated  third parties.   The bill is supported by several financial technology and industry  groups, including the Innovative Lending Platform Association and the  Financial Services Roundtable.   Again, in a day and age when more and more Americans are conducting  their business online and through their smartphones but still continue  to lack access to traditional banking services and financial products,  we need to be doing all we can to simplify the process and encourage  account openings through these platforms.   The MOBILE Act is a strong step in that direction, and I have been  proud to join the bill as a cosponsor. I encourage Members to vote  ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, currently, the Home Owners' Loan Act imposes limitations  on the portfolio mix of loans and investments that a thrift institution  can make. Such limitations include the amount of commercial and  consumer loans that a thrift can hold and a requirement that they hold  a certain percentage of qualified thrift investments. These  restrictions are not currently faced by national banks and other  financial institutions.   If a thrift decides that it wants to engage in more commercial  lending or otherwise seeks to expand its product offerings beyond what  is allowed under current law, they have to undergo a time-consuming  process of converting the stock form of their organization in order to  apply for a national bank charter. For smaller thrifts in particular,  the charter conversion process can be costly.   H.R. 1426 solves this problem by amending the Home Owners' Loan Act  and creating an election process for thrifts to operate as a national  bank without having to convert their charter to a national bank.   This proposal originated from former Comptroller Curry in 2014 to  give thrifts flexibility with respect to the current limitations on the  amount of commercial and consumer loans that a thrift can hold.   While the terms and conditions of a charter are important, we should  be careful about blurring lines. Therefore, I am pleased that the OCC  can reject providing the flexibility to a particular thrift under this  bill and can take other supervisory actions to promote safety and  soundness.   According to the FDIC, there were 768 thrifts as of last September,  compared to nearly 5,000 State and national banks, and all but 15 of  these thrifts have less than $10 billion in assets, which underscores  that this bill will mostly help small institutions better serve their  communities.   Former Comptroller Curry described the proposal as a tool for  enabling ``Federal thrifts to diversify their loan portfolios, maintain  their Federal charter, and retain the OCC as their regulator.''   I thank Mr. Rothfus and Mr. Himes for introducing this bipartisan  bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Ms. Sinema).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Ms. Sinema).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Kihuen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Kihuen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2255, the HOME Act introduced by Mr.  Trott and Mr. Himes amends the Truth in Lending Act to allow fee  appraisers to voluntarily donate their appraisals to non-profit groups  without violating the requirement that lenders and their agents  compensate fee appraisers at a rate that is customary and reasonable.   Historically, appraisal services relating to no- or low-interest  mortgage loans that were provided by non-profit organizations or to  families often had to be donated by professional appraisers in the  community and considered permissible charitable donations for tax  purposes.   However, such non-profit organizations like Habitat for Humanity,  have raised concerns this provision reduced the number of families it  could serve because the voluntary donation of appraisal services could  now be interpreted as a violation of the TILA's ``customary and  reasonable'' fee requirement.   While the CFPB--under the direction of former-Director Richard  Cordray--has already provided non-profit organizations like Habitat  with informal guidance suggesting that the ``customary and reasonable''  provision does not apply to donated appraisals because the appraiser is  no longer a ``fee appraiser'' in this circumstance, these organizations  have continued to raise concerns and are seeking further clarity.   Specifically, non-profit organizations continue to raise concerns  that they remain vulnerable to enforcement actions because this  guidance appears to be inconsistent with the common industry usage of  the term ``fee appraiser''; they also contend that it remains unclear  whether or not other agencies would align with the CFPB's  interpretation.   Thus, this bill provides the non-profits with the certainty they are  seeking, and builds upon the great work already done by former Director  Cordray by clarifying appraisers can voluntarily donate their appraisal  services without violating TILA's ``customary and reasonable'' fee  provision.   The HOME Act passed our Committee earlier this month with broad  bipartisan support, and I was proud to support it.   Also included in H.R. 2255, are two other pieces of legislation that  passed our Committee with strong bipartisan support.   First, the Senior Safe Act, introduced by Ms. Sinema, which provides  employees at financial institutions with immunity when voluntarily  disclosing the possible financial abuse of elders to state and federal  regulators, law enforcement, and adult protective services agencies.   And second is H.R. 4281, introduced by Mr. Kihuen which would enhance  capital opportunities for our nation's rural small businesses by  requiring the SEC's Office of the Small Businesses Advocate to develop  policies and recommend steps Congress can take to drive private  investment to our nation's rural small businesses.   As Ranking Member of the House Small Business Committee, I have a  strong understanding of the capital challenges our nation's rural small  businesses face and I am proud to cosponsor Mr. Kihuen's legislation.   Mr. Speaker, the inclusion of both Ms. Sinema's and Mr. Kihuen's  legislation only enhances what was already a strong bipartisan measure.   Therefore, I recommend a ``Yes'' vote.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2255, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is straightforward, commonsense legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Zeldin for working with Democrats to make  improvements to the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my Democratic colleagues to support the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by thanking both Chairman Hensarling  and Ranking Member Waters for working with me on this legislation and  moving it onto the floor. This has truly been a bipartisan effort.   My bill, H.R. 4792, the Small Business Access to Capital After a  Natural Disaster Act, is simple and straightforward.   One of the most important functions of the SEC's Office of the  Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation is to develop proposals  and recommend changes to Congress that will promote the interests of  small businesses and their investors, mitigate their problems, and help  them secure access to credit.   When we created the Advocate's Office in 2016, we specifically  charged it with looking into the unique challenges facing minority- and  women-owned small businesses. My bill requires the advocate to now also  consider the unique challenges that small businesses affected by  hurricanes or other natural disasters have with securing access to  credit and work to promote their interests.   I developed this legislation because, as ranking member of the House  Small Business Committee, I understand that small businesses are the  lifeblood of many communities around the country, and I have witnessed  firsthand the terrible impact hurricanes and other natural disasters  can have on the economic outlook for small businesses.   For example, in 2012, Superstorm Sandy ripped through the tristate  area and decimated many communities along the New Jersey and New York  coasts. Toms River, New Jersey, was considered ground zero for the  storm.   Half a decade later, the Greater Toms River Chamber of Commerce  reports that the small businesses in that community are still trying to  recover at a cost of $600 million in lost ratables, even at this point.   For small businesses in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands trying to  recover from the effects of Hurricane Maria, the situation is much  worse.                                time  1915    2017 was the costliest year on record for weather and climate  disasters in the United States, and the effects of Hurricane Maria on  Puerto Rico's small businesses are unprecedented.   Nelson Ramirez, the president of the Centro Unido de Detallistas, a  small business advocacy group in San Juan, estimates two-thirds of the  island's roughly 45,000 small and midsize businesses have closed at  least temporarily, and as many as 10,000 will never reopen.   Small and midsized businesses represent 90 percent of the private  companies on the island and about one-third of the workforce. In  October, the Puerto Rican Retail Trade Association revealed that a  study conducted by economists estimated that the island's small  business sector will lose $8.9 billion in a period of 6 months due to a  lack of electricity on the island.   But while the situation in Puerto Rico is unprecedented, this  legislation is about more than just Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands.  This legislation will serve to drive capital to other areas of our  Nation impacted by hurricanes and other natural disasters this past  season including Texas; Florida; the U.S. Virgin Islands; and  California, which is facing the effects of devastating wildfires and  mudslides.   Ninety-nine percent of the companies in Houston are considered small  businesses, and most of them do not have the same economic resources as  the State's massive oil and medical industries. As a result, these  businesses face  [[Page H655]]  a long and expensive road to recovery. This legislation seeks to  shorten that distance for those businesses as well.   FEMA estimates that nearly 40 percent of small businesses never  reopen after a disaster. Therefore, developing strategies to drive  private capital to a community's small business is one of the most  efficient uses of private sector capital and one of the most effective  ways we in the Federal Government can help an area recover.   Nearly 4 months after Hurricane Maria, the Puerto Rican economy is at  a near standstill and thousands of the island's small businesses are  teetering towards insolvency. The businesses in southeast Texas,  Florida, the Virgin Islands, and California face tough situations as  well, and we must do all that we can to help them recover.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking  Member Waters for working with me on this important legislation, which  passed our committee earlier this month on a wide bipartisan basis, 57- 0. I also want to thank Representatives Green, Sinema, and Plaskett for  cosponsoring this legislation with me.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``yes'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.
