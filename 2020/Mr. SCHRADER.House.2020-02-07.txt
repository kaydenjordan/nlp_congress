 Mr. Speaker, last night during Roll Call No. 51, I was  inadvertently recorded as voting ``no'' on H. Res. 826, Expressing  Disapproval of the Trump Administration's Actions Towards Medicaid,  when it was my intention to vote ``yes.'' I respectfully request this  be officially reflected in the Record, and ask my full written  statement be entered in the Record as well.   Madam Speaker, last night during a long series of votes, I was  inadvertently recorded as voting ``no'' when it was my intention to  vote ``yes'' on rollcall No. 51. H. Res. 826, a resolution ``Expressing  disapproval of the Trump Administration's harmful actions towards  Medicaid.'' I rise today to correct the record and make it clear to my  constituents and colleagues that I unequivocally oppose the Trump  Administration's proposal to block grant Medicaid and gutting a  critically important piece of the Affordable Care Act.   The Trump Administration's proposal which will cap federal funding  and cut coverage and benefits, is exactly the opposite of what I've  championed during my time in congress. The proposal will harm low- income parents and children, people with disabilities, and many older  Americans. It would make it more difficult for states to finance their  Medicaid programs which would ultimately and inevitably lead to  reductions in benefits for our most vulnerable citizens.   The administration's proposal also turns its back on the commitment  Congress and the federal government made to states to cover 90 percent  of the cost of Medicaid if those states agreed to expanding the  program. As a steadfast supporter and defender of the Affordable Care  Act, it is undeniable that the expansion of Medicaid under that law has  provided us the greatest opportunity to provide  [[Page H963]]  tens of millions of uninsured Americans health coverage. This expansion  has resulted in the lowest uninsured rate in our country's history  leading to better coverage, access, and quality of care and I would  never do anything to undermine this important law.   Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the opportunity to address the House  and make clear my opposition to the Trump Administration's attacks on  our critically important Medicaid programs.                            ____________________
