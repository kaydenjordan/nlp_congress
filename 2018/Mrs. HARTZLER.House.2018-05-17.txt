 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of the 2018 farm  bill.    Missouri farmers work hard every day to feed the world, and they need  the certainty that this legislation provides. This bill strengthens  safeguards for our food supply and improves public-private risk  management programs that are vital to American agriculture.   In addition, the farm bill makes significant investments in broadband  infrastructure in rural America by setting a minimum speed for Federal  investment.   This bill contains historic improvements to SNAP which helps  recipients break the cycle of poverty by improving work opportunities  for able-bodied adults receiving Federal nutrition assistance. This  bill also promotes work and individual success while empowering those  dependent on government assistance.   These reforms will reduce unemployment and instill a sense of pride  and work ethic by helping people move from dependency to independence  and self-sufficiency. These are commonsense improvements that we are  discussing today.   The 2018 farm bill is a responsible and effective piece of  legislation which maintains safety net programs in crop insurance for  America's farmers while making investments in job training programs to  lift those in need out of poverty.   This bill has my full support, and I thank and commend Chairman  Conaway for his hard work on moving this legislation forward.
