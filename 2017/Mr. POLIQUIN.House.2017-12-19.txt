 Mr. Speaker, all businesses in America, large and  small, should be fairly and predictably regulated, including those  companies in the financial services industry.   Now, Mr. Speaker, when the real estate market collapsed in 2008,  Washington did what it does often. It overreacted by imposing  smothering layers of new regulations on small community banks, credit  unions, and retirement advisers, when it should, Mr. Speaker, have  focused its attention on eight or nine large, major money center banks  that have tentacles that run throughout our economy.   Mr. Speaker, the goal of Dodd-Frank was to increase regulations on  financial institutions that could bring down the economy if they got in  trouble.   Now, the problem, Mr. Speaker, is that this regulatory net was cast  so wide, it caught our small community banks and credit unions in  having to deal with costly, unnecessary, and redundant regulations.   I travel the State of Maine, Mr. Speaker, and meet with our small  financial institutions. They tell me: Bruce, we are spending so much  time and money hiring compliance officers to deal with these  regulations instead of loan officers to make sure we get money out to  our families and our small businesses can borrow and grow.   God forbid, Mr. Speaker, that the Bangor Savings Bank or the Maine  Family Federal Credit Union in Lewiston gets into trouble. If they do,  they will not bring down this economy.   Why in the world should they be imposing or have to deal with this  additional layer of regulations as they are designated as a SIFI?   Mr. Luetkemeyer's bill is a terrific bill. It is common sense. It is  bipartisan. It will require the Federal Reserve to finally factor in  the role and the function of these financial institutions in the  economy, instead of arbitrarily based on assets.   This means, Mr. Speaker, that our community banks and our pension  advisers, our retirement advisers and credit unions will be able to  focus on growing the economy and extending credit so our families can  get a home mortgage, maybe buy another automobile, or maybe one of the  lobstermen can get a new diesel put in their boat for the season.   The is a good bill, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful that Mr. Luetkemeyer  introduced H.R. 3312. I encourage everybody on both sides of the aisle  to help American businesses and families by supporting this bill.
