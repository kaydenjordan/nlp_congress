 Mr. President, I would like to recognize a  critical member of my staff, my former State Director Renee Limoge  Reeve, who left my office in June to become the vice president of  Government & Community Relations at Cruise Lines International  Association, or CLIA, Alaska. It is a big and important job for Alaska,  and all of us with Team Sullivan are confident she will do a great job.   As a student at the University of Vermont, Renee explored her  passions for government and English. After graduation, Renee left  Vermont to start a new journey in Alaska.   Renee's work in Alaska began over a decade ago as an aide for the  State legislature. In Juneau, Renee honed her skills for communication  and leadership--fostering a fun and collaborative team environment.   I was honored when Renee joined Team Sullivan in 2018. As the  director of my State office, Renee was the boots on the ground where  our presence matters most. Enthusiastic and sharp, Renee was the  ultimate liaison between Federal, State, and Tribal governments, and,  most importantly, the people of Alaska, to whom she was ultimately  committed.   Leadership is the measure of how we connect with people, empathize,  and make others feel welcome. Renee is an outstanding leader. She has a  keen political perspective and unrivaled wit.   Renee's talents for communication and humor culminated in her famous  get-togethers. Renee is known for gathering people from all walks of  life around good food, occasional adult prom parties, and always,  laughter.   We wish her the best as Renee sets sail on her new adventure.   While she is no longer on my staff, Renee will always be a member of  the Sullivan family. Please join me in wishing Renee success in her  future. She will be missed.                            ____________________
