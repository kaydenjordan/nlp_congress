 Senator Isakson--that feels a little formal saying it.  Johnny, as a constituent, is how I know you. I want to thank you so  much for your dedicated service to our State.   As others have talked about their first meeting with you, I remember  mine fondly. Not unlike my colleague, Mr. Graves, it was at the  University of Georgia. I was a freshman, sitting on the steps of a  fraternity house, completely clueless about the world, not having an  understanding, self-absorbed.   I remember sitting on the steps as you came--I had no idea who you  were--and you talked to us about a brighter future. You talked to us  about what it meant to be a Georgian.                                time  1630    I remember, when you left, thinking two things from that moment, the  first is: That is maybe the nicest person that I have ever heard from  in my entire life.   Secondly, I was pretty touched that someone was looking out for my  future that didn't even know me.   Over the years as I watched you and began to follow you, I saw that  play out firsthand. I saw how important the State of Georgia was to  you, and what made it important was the millions of Georgians that you  love and care about; the ones that you don't know; the ones that you do  know; and the ones that are yet to come.   Your unwavering commitment to make our State and this Nation a better  place for all of us is something that can never be forgotten.   You have set a standard for being a gentleman and a statesman that we  should all follow. It is pretty remarkable that we, as the Georgia  delegation, are getting to sit here today and not only speak to you,  but our dear colleague,   John Lewis, as well. Because many of those  same things that we say about you, we have to say about our colleague,  Mr. Lewis.   There is a genuine love for our Georgians, a sense of decency, a  sense of optimism, the desire for a bright future. All of those things  come through, not just in your words, but in your actions.   I want to thank you for your 40 years of service to making our lives  better. I am not exactly sure what piece of legislation you took up  shortly after you met me, and I had the chance to meet you and heard  from you on the steps of a fraternity house in Athens, Georgia, but I  feel confident that whatever it was, it made my life better many years  later. I thank the gentleman for that.   We ask that God continue to bless you and Dianne and know that we owe  you a debt of gratitude that we will never be able to repay. Thank you  and God bless you.
