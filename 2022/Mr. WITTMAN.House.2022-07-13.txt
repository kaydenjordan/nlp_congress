 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I will begin by saying that I do not agree with  everything in this bill, but the committee passed a bill worthy of  support.   I especially commend Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for  navigating a markup that was 16 hours and 12 minutes long, including  the debate of almost 900 amendments.   The House Armed Services Committee agreed on a bipartisan basis to  increase our national security topline by over $35 billion, accounting  for the damaging impacts of inflation or our military, and the rising  threats we face today. I am particularly proud of the decisive final  bipartisan vote of 57 to 1 that passed this bill out of committee.   Unfortunately, this bipartisan national security effort is in peril.  The Rules Committee has allowed a series of particularly harmful and  sometimes unrelated provisions that Speaker Pelosi would like to, once  again, tack to the backs of our servicemembers, endangering Congress'  support of their service and our national security. I specifically hope  during our floor debate we can move to exclude these harmful riders.   As to the committee mark, we started once again with an anemic budget  request from the Biden administration that in the Seapower portfolio  requested only 8 ships and proposed the retirement of 24 ships, many of  these ships well before the end of their expected service life.   Fortunately, with the additional topline funding provided, we  authorized 13 battle force ships and rebuffed the administration's  request to retire 12 ships early, committing ourselves to growing the  Navy instead of shrinking it. We also invested in our strategic  deterrence capabilities, providing funding for the Columbia-class  ballistic missile submarine and the B-21 bomber programs. In the end,  this is a strong Seapower statement.   Before I conclude, I specifically thank Chairman   Joe Courtney, and  thank him for his leadership in the Seapower Subcommittee. He is a  navalist. He is a teammate and a dear friend who has the vision to see  our national security perils and the political fortitude to respond to  our most serious threats.   My friends, this is good legislation that, in its current form, is  worthy of support. We must remain focused on delivering a bill that  provides the resources our servicemembers need to advance the common  defense of our Nation.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   Again, this is really about making sure that there is the proper  workforce placed in the right areas where the work is to be done.   We have heard time and time again today that the unavailability of  skilled workforce in many areas is causing delays in construction jobs.  The last thing we need is delays in military construction jobs because  of this inconsistency in the availability of a skilled workforce.   It also undermines competition. Competition is a good thing. Why  wouldn't we want to open it up and make sure that everybody who has the  capability to do this work is able to compete? I think those things are  incredibly important.   When we don't have competition, we know that that increases the cost  to the United States Government. Why would we want to increase costs on  these projects so we do fewer projects?   There is already a backlog of these military construction projects.  This will only add to the backlog. It will only make it more difficult  to complete these projects. It will add to the costs. It will add to  delays. All of these things are counter to what we need to be doing.   With a backlog of these projects, we need to be assuring that there  is competition reducing costs and reducing timeframes.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.   I have to speak in opposition to this amendment. The bottom line is  that the LCS does have capability. It has a mine-hunting capability. It  has a fast-attack capability. That is a capability that we would give  up at a time when we need that capability.   If you are going to do away with that capability, the question is,  with the savings that you accrue, which is about a half-billion  dollars, what are you going to do with those dollars to create  comparable capability today? The answer is, you can't do it.                                time  1745    It takes 6 years to build a destroyer to replace the capability that  the LCS has today. And if you take that half a billion dollars and you  put it in savings, the question is: Where would you spend it today?  Well, we see some of the places where the Navy would like to spend it.   They would like to spend almost a half a billion dollars in fixing a  building in Hawaii, one of the Pacific fleet command buildings. They  are also looking at--OSD would rather put $3 billion in climate change,  and for that matter, invest $2 billion into a $15 an hour minimum wage.   I would argue that getting rid of ships that have a capability that  does have an impact to counter the Chinese is what needs to be done  today rather than waiting 6 years to build a ship that in some way,  shape, or form could counter that--in turn, trying to spend these  dollars to repair a building, for climate change, or for minimum wage  increases. Folks, China is at our doorstep today. That is the threat  that we face today.   My opposition to this is about, Why are we giving away capability  that we need in the face of Chinese capability that is at our doorstep?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield a 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time both sides have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Mr. Speaker, I respect the chairman, but he is wrong.   This ship does have capability against China. It is capability that  is operable today. If you get rid of this ship, you have nothing. The  replacement for this ship is 6 years out. You can't fight something  with nothing.   Getting rid of this ship is the wrong thing to do. It has its  challenges--let's fix those challenges. Let's get this ship  operational. Let's get it out there. We know that it can do the job in  a variety of different ways.   Even if it is not in the Indo-Pacific in a direct role, it can be in  other ways that will free up ships to be in the Indo-Pacific to do  their role. This is the wrong effort to retire these ships--all nine of  these ships.   Let's make sure we stand by the agreement that we came to in the  committee and go to keeping the five ships.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
