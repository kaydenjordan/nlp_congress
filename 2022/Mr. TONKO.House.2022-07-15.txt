 Madam Speaker, I rise in resounding support of the Women's  Health Protection Act.   This bill will restore a fundamental constitutional right that has  been simply stripped away by a rogue rightwing Supreme Court.   While my Republican colleagues celebrate this injustice and cook up  plans for a nationwide abortion ban, Americans across the country are  already feeling the devastating effects of the decision to overturn Roe  v. Wade.   Stories of a 10-year-old child having to travel to neighboring States  to receive care, or women bleeding from ectopic pregnancies have  shocked the world--as red States, many with some of the highest  maternal mortality rates in the country, have rolled back abortion  access.   None of the courts, nor States, nor politicians should have a say in  women's ability to make their own decisions about their health, their  well-being, and their future. That rests with their loved ones, their  doctor, and their God.   If we claim to love freedom--to be a free and just society--we must  ensure that this basic human right is finally enshrined into law.
