 Mr. President, I rise to call on the President to stop  holding the government hostage and trying to force taxpayers to pay for  his border wall--a wall that would be ineffective and wasteful and that  is rejected by the American people.   President Trump said he is ``proud''--that is his word that he used-- to shut down the government. He is proud to force hundreds of thousands  of people across this country to miss their hard-earned paychecks. He  is proud to shutter critical services. He is proud to try and extort  the American people into paying for a wall they don't support. This  Trump shutdown is nothing to be proud of. It is a national disgrace,  and it is time to end this recklessness.   I join with my Democratic colleagues today in calling on the  Republican leaders to do their jobs and reopen the government right  now. The American people don't support Trump's border wall, and they  don't support this Trump shutdown. The funding bills that are being  held up and used by the President as a bargaining chip have broad  bipartisan support. The Democrats in both Chambers want to pass these  appropriations bills now. Yet, as the Democrats stand ready to reopen  the government, President Trump plans to address the Nation tonight to  tell us again why he is proud to keep the government shut down.   We will likely hear more bizarre talk tonight about what we need at  the border from a President who doesn't know the first thing about the  border. Once again, we will likely hear blatant lies about immigrants,  about our border, and about our border communities. The American people  are tired of this President's assault on the truth. They are tired of  having their lives and livelihoods caught up in this President's  inability to rise to the office he holds. No address from the Oval  Office will change that.   We need the Republican leadership in this Chamber to muster the  political will to stand up to the President and get Federal employees  back to work and critical services restored. We are now on day 18 of  this shutdown--the second longest period that the government has been  shuttered since 1980. We have already begun to see real-life  consequences for families all across the Nation, and my home State of  New Mexico is one of the States that is being hit the hardest by the  President's temper tantrum, by his act of political extortion.   In New Mexico, roughly 5,800 Federal workers are either furloughed or  are working without pay. These aren't just  [[Page S41]]  numbers, these are real people. They are real people who are wondering  how they will make their mortgages or rent payments or will feed their  families. A Federal employee in Albuquerque wrote to my office to tell  me how this shutdown is affecting her and her family.   She wrote to me to ``go on the record that I am not one of the  Federal employees the President is touting . . . as wanting to be out  of work, without a paycheck, until he gets his wall.''   She had an important message for the Republican leadership of the  Senate:         The Senate does not work for the President--it is supposed       to represent the citizens of the United States . . . .       Federal employees do not want to stay out of work; we want to       go back to work and get paid.    She ended:         This is not our fight--just his.    Economic anxiety is pervasive in all corners of the State. In fact,  New Mexico was recently ranked as the most vulnerable to the impacts of  the shutdown because of our significant Federal workforce and the  importance of the Federal Government to our economy. As the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related  Agencies, I am acutely aware of how the lapse in appropriations is  affecting the Agencies that are funded in our bill and the services  they provide. These include the Department of the Interior, the  Environmental Protection Agency, and the Indian Health Service.   As the ranking member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, I am  especially cognizant of how this shutdown is hurting Native  communities. For Tribes across Indian Country, the shutdown's  consequences are particularly dire after their going more than 2 weeks  without Federal funds. Simply put, Tribes report that Federal programs  that are critical to health and public safety are grinding to a halt  and that lives are in danger.   In New Mexico, the shutdown has left the Mescalero Apache Tribe's  reservation--larger in size than the entire city of Houston, TX--with  only one on-duty police officer, which would be unacceptable even under  normal circumstances. Yet, due to a huge winter storm that left my  State under heavy snowfall and subfreezing temperatures, that lone  officer is responsible for not only responding to domestic violence and  child welfare but also to snow-related accidents and emergencies across  720 square miles--all because furloughed road crews aren't clearing the  snow and ice from the reservation's roads. One elder already died  because he was unable to make it to dialysis. Sadly, Mescalero's  experiences are not uncommon.   The Yurok Tribe of California will soon have to close its courts,  curtailing the Tribe's efforts to rein in the opioid epidemic. Urban  Indian Health Programs in Baltimore and Boston are days away from  closing completely, leaving Native families in these cities without  support. The Yankton Sioux Tribe in South Dakota was just informed that  its Indian Health Service unit must begin reducing services.   The 276 Tribes that depend on the USDA's Food Distribution Programs  on Indian reservations--a program that feeds nearly 100,000 American  Indians and Alaska Natives--are also faced with reliving the 2013  shutdown crisis, when food rotted in locked warehouses while hungry  families gathered outside--all because the President and some extreme  Members of his party refuse to do their jobs and keep the government  open.   It is disgraceful, and it is dangerous. Every day that the President  continues to treat Tribal health and public safety programs like  hostages for political gain, it endangers families across Indian  Country. The United States has trust and treaty obligations that Tribes  obtained in exchange for ceding millions of acres of land. The  consequences of the President's outright disregard for treaty  obligations are real. The consequences of the Senate majority leader's  inaction are real. The consequences of the Republicans' unwillingness  to stand up for Tribes in their States--to stand up for basic humanity  and common sense--are also real.   We are talking about people's lives and the fundamental obligation of  our Nation to honor its commitment to Native Americans. It is really  that simple. We all know how pressing these problems are. The impacts  of the Trump shutdown are far and wide. There are thousands of stories  across the Nation. Let me tell you another from my home State of New  Mexico.   A local Santa Fe small business--a construction company, Sarcon  Construction Corporation--is ready to begin an $8.4 million project to  build two new hangars at the Santa Fe Municipal Airport. This 32,000- square-foot project will generate $650,000 in local tax revenue and  will employ 75 to 100 people. Many of those people are literally  unemployed now while waiting for this project to begin. This project is  a big deal for my home city of Santa Fe.   Do you know why the project is stalled? Sarcon can't get the  necessary approval from the Federal Aviation Administration because of  the Trump shutdown, as the FAA personnel who are responsible for its  approval are furloughed.   This shutdown has real consequences for real people, especially for  people like those unemployed New Mexicans who are ready and eager to  work but who are unable to because of our President's tantrum. The  President says he can ``relate'' to Federal workers who can't pay bills  during the shutdown, but in the next breath, he blithely assumes they  will ``make adjustments'' and be fine.   As he has demonstrated time and again, this President cannot and does  not relate to the struggles of everyday Americans who are hurt by his  policies. He cannot and does not relate to Federal employees who live  paycheck to paycheck or to Santa Fe construction workers who wait  anxiously to get back to work. He has shown us time and again that his  policies and behavior are heartless and that he is unfit for the office  he holds. I will say it again. The President told the American people  on camera that he is ``proud to shut down the government.'' The  responsibility falls squarely on him and now on his Republican  collaborators in the Senate.    The impacts reach every corner of our Nation. His shutdown has  already had real impacts on our Nation's public lands, including our  most iconic national parks.   Many national parks, such as Bandelier National Monument and Valles  Caldera National Preserve in New Mexico, remain closed. Restrooms have  been closed for 2 weeks, trash has accumulated, and roads have not been  plowed. For 2 weeks, we have heard horror stories of poor sanitation  and public safety issues at national parks because of the shutdown,  including overflowing toilets, vandalism, and other resource damage. In  Big Bend National Park, because of the lack of emergency services, Good  Samaritans had to rescue a hiker who fell and broke his leg while  hiking on Christmas Eve.   In fact, the effects have been so devastating that, in a legally  questionable move, this administration just made the unprecedented  decision to dip into the park's entrance fees to fund basic services at  a handful of parks across the country. These are fees that Congress  authorizes the Park Service to collect to pay for deferred maintenance  projects and other critical needs, not to take the place of  appropriated funds. We still don't know which parks will be affected by  the administration's decision, but I fully expect this bandaid approach  to fall far short of protecting our treasured national resources or  restoring services to the public in a meaningful way. It is merely a  cynical attempt to get the problems caused by the President's shutdown  off the front page of the newspaper.   If we want to reopen the parks, there is a simple solution: Pass the  Interior appropriations bill without delay, and we can reopen the  entire National Park System. In the meantime, reopening some park sites  but not others will not help many gateway communities that depend on  parks and public lands to provide needed revenue and that are facing  economic crisis as this shutdown wears on.   The National Parks Conservation Association estimates that in  January, visitors spent an average of $20 million per day in nearby  communities. That is real and vital revenue. In New Mexico alone,  national parks generated more than 1,700 jobs in 2017 and created more  than $140 million in economic output  [[Page S42]]  for my State. I can tell you that New Mexico can't afford for these  sites to be closed.   It is not just the parks that are at risk. Fire prevention programs  funded by the U.S. Forest Service are being deferred during the  shutdown, despite a recordbreaking fire season. Environmental  protection programs are suffering. EPA has halted most activities  related to hazardous waste cleanups under its national Superfund  Program. Enforcement activities against polluters have ground to a  halt, as have Federal permitting efforts. States aren't receiving funds  to operate their regulatory programs.   Even our Nation's cherished national museums are shuttered. On  January 2, the Smithsonian ran out of funds and closed its doors,  preventing more than 110,000 visitors a day from accessing its prized  collections. Its next-door neighbor, the National Gallery of Art, is  also closed, leaving school groups, families, and everyday citizens out  in the cold.   Again, there is a simple solution to stop this damage. All we have to  do is pass an appropriations bill and reopen the government.   I want to end where I began. The President has nothing to be  ``proud'' of here. President Trump needs to stop holding Federal  programs hostage to his demands for a wasteful, ineffective, and  destructive wall and end this shutdown now. We can do it easily. The  Senate can immediately take up and pass H.R. 21--the appropriations  bill passed by the House last week. This should cause no controversy.  These are bills drafted by Republicans with broad bipartisan support.  In fact, the Interior bill is the exact same legislation that was  passed by this Chamber by a vote of 92 to 6 last August--a margin that  would override a veto of the bill, I might add.   I call on Leader McConnell and Members of his party to let us get to  work. We need to do what is right and immediately take up and pass the  House bill today. There is no reason this shutdown must go on one day  longer. The lives and livelihoods of everyday Americans hang in the  balance.   As a final comment, I will say that I so much appreciate working with  Senator Leahy, who is vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee and  who I know feels, sees, and hears from all of his Appropriations  members how concerning this situation is.   With that, I yield the floor.
