 Mr. Speaker, as chair of the Railroads, Pipelines, and  Hazardous Materials Subcommittee and coauthor of H.R. 2, I am proud  that we have the robust road, rail, and transit bill that our country  needs to start fixing our transportation system and put Americans back  to work.   I want to thank Chairman DeFazio for his strong leadership on this  bill.   H.R. 2 is a historic bill for rail infrastructure, containing a  record $60 billion investment, a 400 percent increase. It was a  priority for me to include, for the first time ever, in a surface  reauthorization, a commuter rail policy section.    In addition to the 57 percent increase in funding for public transit,  commuter railroads are made eligible for the significantly increased $7  billion CRISI grant program, and the top Amtrak stations used by  commuter railroads have special access to these funds.   In another first, we established a grade separation funding program  at $2.5 billion, which will help alleviate the problem of blocked rail  crossings across our Nation. For Amtrak, we are making a record  investment of almost $30 billion.   In the highway and transit division, I want to highlight the 37  percent increase in funding to our States for  [[Page H2925]]  roads, a greater focus on improving safety for bicyclists and  pedestrians, and an increase in funding for University Transportation  Centers, including one on autonomous and connected vehicles.   In addition, a $9 billion grant program focused on advancing projects  of national and regional significance is included, which can help bring  the CREATE rail modernization program in northeastern Illinois to  completion, significantly improving the flow of freight across our  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2 will put hundreds of thousands of Americans to  work, make American businesses and workers more efficient, cut down  delays on our roads and rails, increase safety, and improve our  environment.   Let's get this done for the American people.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  1028, I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this en bloc amendment which  is comprised of 34 individual amendments touching upon various areas of  rail, aviation, water, and FEMA policy. This includes amendments that:   Increase safety precautions for transportation workers and passengers  during COVID-19;   Expand Buy America and offer higher incentives to the RRIF Federal  rail loan program;   Devote additional resources towards improving the ecological health  of the San Francisco Bay and the New River in California;   Direct the EPA to monitor local drug consumption through an  examination of traces of narcotics in wastewater;   Direct the U.S. GAO to study potential affordability and racial  disparities in providing water and wastewater rate assistance;   Direct the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to lead a multiagency effort  to address climate change concerns in the Ohio River Valley;   Increase, from 4.5 to 5 percent, the set-aside for supplemental  airport improvement grants to be used for environmental, noise, and  resiliency projects;   Create a new program to incentivize airlines' phaseout of inefficient  airplane types in exchange for newer, eco-friendly types, and require a  study of ultrafine airborne particles associated with flight operations  near airports;   Require airports that receive supplemental airport grants to set  aside 2 percent of those funds for fiscal year 2021 to assist  concessionaires experiencing economic hardship as a result of the  COVID-19 pandemic;   Direct GAO to conduct a comprehensive study of the building codes and  standards used by FEMA, including an assessment of the status of  building code adoption across States, Tribes, and territories; and   Direct GAO to conduct a study on the accessibility of FEMA's disaster  assistance programs and whether there are any barriers to access based  on race, ethnicity, language, and income level.   These are just some of the highlights of the amendments included. I  thank my colleagues for offering thoughtful amendments to improve the  transportation portions of the INVEST in America Act. I urge adoption  of the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Trone).

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc amendment.  Thirty-four good amendments added to this bill make this bill even  better on a number of topics: airports, rail, FEMA, and other areas. I  urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
