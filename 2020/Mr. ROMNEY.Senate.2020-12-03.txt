 Mr. President, we rise to congratulate John Paul  Christensen on his lifetime of service to the State of Utah and Sanpete  County and most recently his service as mayor of Mayfield, UT. John's  service also includes a career in law enforcement, as an emergency  medical responder and as a city councilman.   As a sixth-generation native of Sanpete County, John has dedicated  his life to the betterment of his community. By virtue of his  stewardship as mayor, the people of Mayfield have John to thank for  dramatic improvements to the city's infrastructure, including its  culinary water and drainage systems, streets, roadways, cemetery, and  Mayfield Park. Mayor Christensen's accomplishments are made possible in  large part by the industrious community of volunteers and spirit of  friendship that Mayfield boasts.   The residents of Mayfield know John as a man of great character and  compassion. In law enforcement and as an emergency medical responder,  the community trusted John with protecting their lives and livelihoods,  an often thankless duty that requires mental fortitude and dedication  to serving the greater good. His long tenure in public service is  evidence of his success.   Although he is leaving public office, we know that John will continue  to serve his community and family with heart. As a devoted husband to  Julie, a father of 9, and a grandfather of 19, John's legacy and  example will endure. The great people of Mayfield, Sanpete  [[Page S7210]]  County, and our fellow Americans ought to look to John's commitment to  public safety, duty, and service with gratitude.   Thank you, John.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we wish to congratulate State  Senator Ralph Okerlund on a remarkable career dedicated to the  relentless advancement of prosperity for the great State of Utah. For  the many Utahns lucky enough to know him personally--from the hills of  Monroe to the halls of the State legislature--it is no surprise that  Ralph has chosen to spend more time with his loving family following a  consequential tenure in public life. Even for the many Utahns to whom  Ralph is still unknown, his influence on civic life through his  statewide legislative achievements is significant and enduring.   Senator Okerlund's success can be measured in tangible improvements  in his district and across the State. His legislative efforts to  facilitate investment in Utah's infrastructure projects, with tax  credit incentives and coordination with the State energy and economic  development offices, have brought billions of dollars to Utah--a  massive boon to the State's economy and its rural counties. In  addition, his efforts through the legislative appropriations process  delivered Snow College a new building and higher pay for its employees.  As a member of the legislative leadership on Capitol Hill, Senator  Okerlund kept his commitment to allocate tax dollars wisely and  effectively.   Senator Okerlund's success can also be measured by his family and by  his fortitude. His professional journey began as a teacher, with  degrees from Dixie College and the University of Utah. Ralph then  returned to Monroe to help run his family farm and to be closer to his  father, whose injury compelled his return. Okerlund would acquire and  later sell the dairy but ran the farm for years until his election to  the Monroe City Council. Apace with his subsequent ascensions to the  mayor's office, Sevier County commission, State senate, and ultimately  senate majority leader, is his family of children and grandchildren  beside him, including his beloved wife Cindy, who call Monroe home.  Ralph has persisted through hardship with the support of his family.   A tireless champion for rural Utah, Senator Okerlund has represented  the unique challenges and opportunities facing farmers, ranchers, and  rural folks at the State and national level as president of the Council  of State Governments Western Association. In this role, he represented  Utah's interests among neighboring States with competing ideas on how  to manage critical issues like regional energy and land management. His  successes in these efforts is undoubtedly owed to his deep  understanding of the issues as a man raised in Monroe.   Few can boast the wealth of personal and professional experiences  amassed by Ralph Okerlund in his long and distinguished career--from  dairyman to senate majority leader--but every Utahn can admire and  follow his commitment to service. His record in government is not  marked by expedience but, rather, by a willingness to rise to the  occasion and answer the call of his neighbors and friends who seek his  reliable judgement and sound leadership. Ralph Okerlund has led for 36  years as an elected official and will continue to serve his family, his  friends, and his community with grace and humility.                            ____________________
