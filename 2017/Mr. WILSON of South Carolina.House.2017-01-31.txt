 Mr. Speaker, American families today  are at an increased risk of cyber attacks. Additional reports of cyber  vulnerability in cars threaten the safety of American families by  allowing a hacker to access a vehicle and take control from the driver.  Vehicle safety is of great importance to me because South Carolina is  America's leading exporter of automobiles and tires, with BMW, soon  Volvo, along with Michelin, Bridgestone, Continental, and Giti in  Singapore.   Last week, I was grateful to introduce the SPY Car Study Act of 2017  with Congressman Ted Lieu of California. This bipartisan legislation  directs government partners and private automobile manufacturers to  conduct a study on the security and privacy threats to our motor  vehicles.   In conclusion, God bless our troops; and may the President, by his  actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on  terrorism.   President Donald Trump has taken positive action to vet refugees who  ISIS has threatened to infiltrate so as to commit mass murder as they  did in France and Germany.                            ____________________
