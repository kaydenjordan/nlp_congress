 Paul Taylor. He  was a visionary leader who made a lasting impact on our community and  across the State.   When I think of public service and what it means to be a public  servant, I think of J. Paul Taylor. I think of his kindness, passion,  and dedication to our State. New Mexico is a better place because of  him.   J. Paul Taylor served in the New Mexico House of Representatives for  nearly 20 years. Many referred to him as the conscience of the  legislature. He led with his heart, found common ground through his  bipartisanship, and did everything with New Mexico in mind.   His service to New Mexico continued after he retired. A longtime  educator, serving as a teacher and principal, he served on the New  Mexico Education Association two times as president.   Last August, we celebrated his 102nd birthday with a visit to his  home in Las Cruces.   He had a reputation as a passionate educator and advocated for the  arts and culture, and was a leader in bilingual education in the State.   J. Paul Taylor was a true friend and mentor to many in New Mexico.  From the bottom of my heart, I thank him for being a true public  servant and dedicating his life to making a positive difference in our  State. Let's all remember his love for public service and for advancing  equitable education in New Mexico.                            ____________________
