 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory  of my good friend Danny ``Flapper'' Burgess from my home area of Monroe  County, Kentucky.   Flapper was a larger-than-life figure. If you ever met Flapper  Burgess, you left with a positive and memorable impression. He was an  effective, old-school, local politician, who owned a little country  store called Flapper's Market in Fountain Run, Kentucky. If you were a  candidate for local office and wanted to carry the Fountain Run  precinct, you had to have Flapper's support.   Here is the last picture I have of Flapper and I in his store eating  one of his signature baloney sandwiches.   Flapper served many years on the Monroe County Fiscal Court  representing the Gamaliel, White Oak Ridge, and Fountain Run precincts.  Flapper truly was a man of the people.   On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives and all the people of  south central Kentucky, I extend my deepest sympathies to the family of  Danny ``Flapper'' Burgess.                            ____________________
