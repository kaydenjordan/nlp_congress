 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Weber) for yielding and for organizing this tribute to my dear friend,  Louie Gohmert.   We will miss you in this Chamber, but I have nothing but great  memories of Louie. You expressed so many prayers for me in tough times,  but also, the things you would do, and I see on the poster the ribs  because that is what I think of when Louie Gohmert would offer to the  Members to cook ribs for them at the end of a long night.   We have gotten into a lot of heady debates here. We sometimes spar  with each other. At the end of that battle to bring people together and  say, you know what, we are going to eat some ribs--and, by the way,  they are really, really good. He has never given the recipe.    I think you ought to pass the recipe on, so we can keep  that tradition going, if nothing else--we won't enter it into the  Congressional Record--just the seasoning and rub you put on it the  night before.   But it is one of those things that helps bring Members together  because there are a lot of times where it is easy to get on different  sides and people are battling on different issues, but to come together  at the end of that, and that is something I will always remember  because at the end of those long evenings there would be 50 to 100  Members of Congress in those little offices enjoying that camaraderie.  It wasn't just the ribs and the Shiner Bock beer you brought, but it is  the camaraderie more than anything. That is one thing we need more of.  We are going to have disagreements; we always have since the founding  of our great Nation. But to be able to come together at the end of each  of those disagreements and remember the bond that joins us, that is  much more powerful.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, Louie Gohmert, for his service  here to the United States Congress.
