 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the abortion on  demand until birth act.   This Supreme Court ruled each individual State can decide the rights  for the unborn. This bill would override State laws to nationalize  abortion for any reason at any stage of pregnancy up until birth.   This does not merely ban pre-viability restrictions on abortion, as  supporters say that it does. This bill allows the person doing the  abortion to decide what qualifies as pre-viability. This is  unacceptable.   The majority of Americans do not support abortions with no limits. In  fact, 80 percent of the Americans say abortions should be illegal in  the third trimester. This is a radical bill, and I urge a ``no'' vote.
