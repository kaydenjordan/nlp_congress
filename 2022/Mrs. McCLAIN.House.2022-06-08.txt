 Mr. Speaker, today an armed man with the intent to kill  justice Kavanaugh was arrested near the Justice's home. The Senate  unanimously passed a bipartisan bill that would provide security to the  Justices and their families. Yet House Democrats have refused to act on  it.   Unlike the bills we voted on today, we actually have a bipartisan,  commonsense solution to protect one of our Nation's most sacred  institutions. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table S. 4160 and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.
