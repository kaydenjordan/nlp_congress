 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thornberry  and Ranking Member Smith and the professional and personal staff for  all of their hard work.   Mr. Speaker, this year's NDAA is multifaceted, and it is complex. It  contains many good things for our servicemembers, but it also contains  areas of concern.   I support this year's NDAA's new reforms designed to restore the  readiness, capability, and capacity of a force that has been asked to  do too much with too little. The conference report contains a number of  policy items focused on servicemembers' quality of life in a wide range  of areas, including healthcare for disabled veterans, care for  servicemembers' children, mental health services, sexual assault  prevention, maternity leave, and retention of women in the military.   This bill also contains language acknowledging the critical role  women play in the security of their country. It contains provisions  ensuring that Afghan and Syrian women are not overlooked as a critical  component in conflict resolution.   I would also like to reiterate an area of concern. Developing new  low-yield nuclear weapons when we currently have more nuclear weapons  than we can ever possibly use is not just a waste of money; it also  lowers the threshold required before a nuclear conflict begins. A  nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon, no matter what its size. Any  nuclear use would fundamentally change the rules of the game.   We do not follow the dangerous and reckless Russian doctrine of  escalate to deescalate. We shouldn't mirror their reckless strategy.  What do we hope to gain strategically by proliferating low-yield  weapons?   Mr. Speaker, this is a strong bipartisan bill which will help our  Nation protect itself in a changing world. I recommend a ``yes'' vote.
