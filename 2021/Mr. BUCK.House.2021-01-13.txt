 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time.   Madam Speaker, I have heard that President Trump radicalized the  group of the rioters who stormed this Capitol. I would say that we need  to look no further than ourselves to find out what happened and to look  at history.   Americans were frustrated when they learned that the FBI was  investigating the Trump campaign. They were frustrated to learn that  the Obama administration and the DNC had created this false campaign  against the Trump administration. They were frustrated, Madam Speaker,  when the inauguration of the President was boycotted by over 40  Democrat Members of this House.   They were frustrated to read in The Washington Post the day after the  inauguration: Let the impeachment begin.   They were frustrated when Members of this House spoke over and over  about impeaching the President days into his administration. And then  the Socialists in Hollywood joined their allies in Congress. Robert De  Niro said that he wanted to punch the President in the face. Madonna  thought about blowing up the White House. Kathy Lee Griffin held up a  likeness of the President's beheaded head, and nothing was said by my  colleagues at that point in time.   In fact, one Democrat colleague said that Trump supporters should be  harassed wherever they are, in restaurants, on the street, and in  supermarkets.   During this time, the President was under investigation by a special  counsel who found no collusion and no conspiracy with Russia.   The President's supporters were harassed. Ajit Pai, the head of the  FCC, was called a dirty, sneaky Indian. His children were harassed in  school. The press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was kicked out of a  restaurant for being a Trump employee. The DHS Secretary, Kirstjen  Nielsen, was harassed by her home, and Trump donors were publicly  shamed.
