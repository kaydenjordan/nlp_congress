 Mr. Speaker, yesterday our world lost the beloved Stephen  Hawking, a man who spent his life defying all obstacles and pursuing  the depths of human knowledge. He is the epitome of proving your  circumstances don't define you.   Hawking faced being told in his early twenties that he only had a few  years to live. Fearlessly, he went on to not only beat those odds, but,  along the way, demonstrated the beginning and the end of our universe  as we know it today.   Hawking taught us that, if you dare to dream and work hard, you can  succeed; and I know he is responsible for inspiring many of our  scientific minds, both young and old alike.   As we celebrate his life, let us remember not only his  accomplishments, academic and otherwise, but his fighting spirit. We  are grateful for all he taught us and the legacy he left our world. Let  us all remember him by embracing his steadfast determination and lead  lives of action, as he did.                            ____________________
