 Mr. President, shortly we will be voting on cloture on  the nomination of John Sullivan, the nominee to be Deputy Secretary of  State, and as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion and  support the nomination of John Sullivan to be the next Deputy Secretary  of State.
