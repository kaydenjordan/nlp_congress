 Madam Speaker, I stand here today in support of women.   I stand here today condemning the words of, unfortunately, a  colleague of mine.   I want to reflect on history.   The first African-American woman was elected in 1968, the first  Hispanic woman in 1989. Madam Speaker, we are here to stay. This year  is the 100th year that women have had the right to vote.   For far too long, women and people of color have been subjected to  being mistreated, humiliated, and trying desperately with words to  minimize us.   Women of color have traditionally been excluded from the Halls of  Congress, but I am here today saying, in a Congress where we have the  largest number of diversity in women in the history of this Congress,  our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power.   We will see, today, speakers coming to this mike. Yes, we are  standing up because of the words of one Member, but I am standing here  today after generations of assault, generations of abuse, and I stand  here proud, as a survivor.   Our constituents expect leadership, not schoolyard bullying, from  their elected colleagues.   Almost 100 years after the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the  Constitution and now, at a time when this body is the most diverse it  has ever been, this is the time we should be celebrating each other,  thanking God that we have opportunities to serve with legends like John  Lewis; but, instead, we are trying to roll back the clock with behavior  that is unacceptable.   I am the little Black girl from the east side of Detroit who was  raised by a woman who is the grandchild of an emancipated slave. I am  not scared of you. I will call you out. I demand respect, and I will  respect you.
