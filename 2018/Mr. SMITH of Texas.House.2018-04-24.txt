(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States, through existing authorization and       supervision mechanisms, satisfies and is in conformity with       its obligation under the Outer Space Treaty to authorize and       supervise nongovernmental space activities to assure such       activities are carried out in conformity with the       international obligations of the United States under the       Outer Space Treaty.        (2) The United States has a robust and innovative private       sector that is investing in, developing, and placing into       outer space, spacecraft and payloads.        (3) Authorization and supervision mechanisms as of the date       of enactment of this Act could be improved to relieve       administrative burdens on new and innovative nongovernmental       space actors.        (4) It serves the national interest to address       misperceptions of legal uncertainty through the establishment       of a general authorization and supervision certification       authority for nongovernmental outer space activities.        (5) The private exploration and use of outer space by       nongovernmental entities will further the national security,       foreign policy, and economic interests of the United States.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that--        (1) United States citizens and entities are free to explore       and use space, including the utilization of outer space and       resources contained therein, without conditions or       limitations;        (2) this freedom is only to be limited when necessary to       assure United States national security interests are met and       to authorize and supervise nongovernmental space activities       to assure such activities are carried out in conformity with       the international obligations of the United States under the       Outer Space Treaty;        (3) to the maximum extent practicable, the Federal       Government shall interpret and fulfill its international       obligations to minimize regulations and limitations on the       freedom of United States nongovernmental entities to explore       and use space;        (4) to the maximum extent practicable, the Federal       Government shall take steps to protect the physical safety of       space objects operated by the United States that do not       involve limitations on the freedoms of nongovernmental       entities of the United States; and        (5) nongovernmental activities in outer space shall only be       authorized and supervised in a transparent, timely, and       predictable manner, with minimal costs and burdens placed on       the entities authorized and supervised.        (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act and the amendments       made by this Act are--        (1) to enhance the existing outer space authorization and       supervision framework to provide greater transparency,       greater efficiency, and less administrative burden for       nongovernmental entities of the United States seeking to       conduct space activities; and        (2) to ensure that the United States remains the world       leader in commercial space activities.

SEC. 4. PERMITTING OF SPACE-BASED REMOTE SENSING SYSTEMS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The commercial market for space-based remote sensing       technologies and information has experienced significant       growth since the passage of the Land Remote Sensing Policy       Act of 1992.        (2) It is in the interest of the United States to foster       new and novel space-based remote sensing applications and       services and to help facilitate their continued domestic       growth.        (3) Since the passage of the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act       of 1992, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric       Administration's Office of Commercial Remote Sensing has       experienced a significant increase in applications for       private remote sensing space system licenses as authorized       under section 60121 of title 51, United States Code.        (4) Many of the applicants for commercial space-based       remote sensing licenses have encountered significant delays       and unnecessary obstacles in the application process.        (5) The current licensing paradigm must be updated as to       not discourage the continued growth of the United States       space-based remote sensing industry. It must be updated in a       way that satisfies the needs of commercial remote sensing       market as well as the national security of the United States.        (6) In order to protect United States leadership and       commercial viability in remote sensing technologies, the       Federal Government should not limit commercial entities from       providing remote sensing capabilities or data products that       are available or reasonably expected to be made available in       the next 3 years in the international or domestic       marketplace.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that, to       the maximum extent practicable, the Federal Government shall       take steps to protect the national security interests of the       United States that do not involve regulating or limiting the       freedoms of United States nongovernmental entities to explore       and use space. Federal Government agencies shall mitigate any       threat to national security posed by the exploration and use       of outer space by United States citizens and entities, to the       maximum extent practicable, changing Federal Government       activities and operations.

Such  [[Page H3484]]       opinion shall be submitted directly from the Chair of the       Advisory Committee to those Committees of Congress without       any review or change by the Administration.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 2809, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we give space exploration a booster rocket in the  form of H.R. 2809, the bipartisan American Space Commerce Free  Enterprise Act.   The commercial space industry is poised to begin a major new vehicle  for discoveries in space and national economic growth. It represents  hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and the creation of  thousands of jobs across the United States.   For years, there has been uncertainty about which Federal agency has  responsibility for approving nontraditional space activities and  ensuring conformity with the Outer Space Treaty. This uncertainty has  cramped capital formation and innovation and has driven American  companies overseas.   The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act remedies this  situation by establishing a new, novel, legal, and policy framework  that unleashes American free enterprise and businesses, assures  conformity with Outer Space Treaty obligations, and guarantees that the  U.S. will lead the world in commercial space activities throughout the  21st century.   H.R. 2809 increases American competitiveness and attracts companies,  talents, and money that would otherwise go to other countries. In  short, the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act ensures that  America and its workforce will benefit from the new space economy.   The need for this legislation became evident during the previous  administration when legal uncertainty arose after U.S. space  exploration companies sought payload approval from the Department of  Transportation for its nontraditional space activities. But the DOT  payload approval process is not designed to satisfy the requirements of  complying with the Outer Space Treaty, so the Federal Government has  been unable to assure the private sector that new and innovative space  activities would be approved for launch.   The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act uses a commonsense  approach to establish a sound legal foundation upon which U.S. industry  can rely and flourish. It creates a self-certification process for the  nongovernmental space activities that provides regulatory certainty for  the U.S. commercial space sector, it assures U.S. compliance with Outer  Space Treaty obligations, and it addresses national security concerns  in the least burdensome manner.   Existing regulatory authority is currently spread across three  Federal agencies, which has caused the review of commercial remote  sensing applications to grind to a halt. H.R. 2809 consolidates this  authority into one Federal agency, the Secretary of Commerce's Office  of Space Commerce. The result, America gets a one-stop-shop for  authorizing outer space activities.   Without H.R. 2809, America's space industry would continue to face  legal uncertainty. Innovation would be stifled by burdensome and open- ended regulatory processes.   Other policies and interests of the United States are affected by  private sector space activities, national security, in particular, but  the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act improves national  security by including remote sensing reform. By requiring a national  security risk assessment during the remote sensing permitting process,  this bill ensures that national security concerns are addressed.   H.R. 2809 improves the permitting process by creating a single  decision point, increasing transparency, avoiding unnecessary reviews  of technologies that have already been approved, and preventing the  interagency process from indefinitely delaying decisionmaking. These  changes allow our remote sensing industry to continue to lead the  world.   The bill also goes farther than current law in providing for the  physical safety of government assets in orbit. After operations are  certified, the government can conduct an assessment of physical safety  issues that will prevent disastrous collisions and help protect the  safety of government and private assets.   Cosponsors of the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act include  Space Subcommittee Chairman Brian Babin and recent Science, Space, and  Technology Committee member and now NASA Administrator,  Jim  Bridenstine. Both Chairman Babin and Administrator Bridenstine have  worked diligently to move this legislation forward. And Representatives  Perlmutter, Kilmer, and Soto also helped develop this commonsense,  bipartisan regulatory reform bill. Many thanks to all of them.   This transformative and ground-shaking legislation facilitates  commercial liftoff and declares that America is fully open for business  in space. American innovators, driven by ingenuity, competitive spirit,  and bold vision are the future of space exploration.

I encourage my colleagues  to support the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                    Washington, DC, April 23, 2018.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am in receipt of your letter to the       Speaker of April 20, 2018, regarding H.R. 2809, the       ``American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act.'' H.R. 2809       was referred solely to the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology. The Science Committee ordered H.R. 2809 reported       on June 8, 2017. Your assistance in ensuring its timely       consideration is greatly appreciated.        I agree provisions in the bill are within the jurisdiction       of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I       acknowledge that by withdrawing your request for a sequential       referral of H.R. 2809, your Committee is not relinquishing       its jurisdiction. A copy of our letters will be placed in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.        I value your cooperation and look forward to working with       you as we move ahead with this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                       Lamar Smith,      Chairman.                                   ____           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure House of             Representatives                                    Washington, DC, April 24, 2018.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: I am in receipt of your letter       concerning H.R. 2809, the American Space Commerce Free       Enterprise Act of 2017. Thank you for acknowledging that this       legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House of Representatives in an       expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure will forego action on the       bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual       understanding that foregoing consideration of the bill does       not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment       of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation       that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. Lastly,       should a conference on the bill be necessary, I request your       support for the appointment of conferees from the Committee       on Transportation and Infrastructure during any House-Senate       conference convened on this or related legislation.        Thank you for placing a copy of this letter and your       response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the       Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on       the House floor, to memorialize our understanding.        I look forward to working with the Committee on Science,       Space, and Technology as the bill moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California (Mr. Bera), the ranking member of the Space Subcommittee,  for the comments that he just delivered, and also for cosponsoring this  piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin), the chairman of the Space Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Perlmutter) for his enthusiasm about space.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Rohrabacher), who is a very active member of the Science, Space and  Technology Committee and of the Space Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank, publicly, Majority Leader Kevin  McCarthy for cosponsoring this legislation as well. I encourage my  colleagues to support it, and I appreciate the remarks by the gentleman  from California (Mr. Bera).   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Webster), a valued member of the Space, Science, and Technology  Committee for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5086, the Innovators to  Entrepreneurs Act. The bill extends the reach of the National Science  Foundation's Innovative Corps, or I-Corps, program, which trains and  prepares scientists and engineers to advance their research results  into entrepreneurial opportunities.   H.R. 5086 expands who is eligible to participate in I-Corps courses,  allowing a portion of small business innovation research grants and  small business technology transfer grants to be used to cover I-Corps  training expenses. The bill also allows any private citizen to apply to  participate and pay out-of-pocket.   H.R. 5086 authorizes a new I-Corps course for commercial-ready  research ventures that teaches skills involving company organization,  attracting investors, and hiring.   In research labs today lie the seeds for breakthroughs in new fields  like quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and bioengineering.  These breakthroughs will continue to transform our lives and the world  we live in.   Many scientists and engineers are not trained for commercializing  those ideas and did not go to business school or take any business  development classes. I-Corps gives researchers tools to maximize the  taxpayer investment in basic research and to spur innovation. H.R. 5086  builds on the success of the I-Corps program in building connections  between academia and the private sector to create more startups and  more jobs.   We thank the Research and Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member Dan  Lipinski and Representative  Daniel Webster for taking the lead on this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
