 Mr. Speaker, the absurd declaration of  Biden last month of ``zero inflation'' is an insult to intelligence.   Inflation is at 8.5 percent, the highest in 40 years. American  families know gasoline is up 44 percent; electricity, up 15.2 percent;  food, up 13.1 percent; and transportation, up 9.2 percent, destroying  jobs.   Americans are fortunate to have vibrant radio talk shows, modern Paul  Reveres, such as Columbia's Morning News (560 AM) with Gary David and  Christopher Thompson. Yesterday, they highlighted the Heritage  Foundation analysis that the average American worker has lost $3,400 in  annual income since Biden took office due to Bidenflation.   Gary revealed the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2021 that Americans  spent more on taxes than they did on food, clothing, and healthcare  combined. The Federal Reserve reported that household net worth fell  $6.1 trillion from March to June.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism moves from the safe  haven in Afghanistan to America.   God bless Ukraine victory.   Queen Elizabeth II will always be cherished in America.                            ____________________
