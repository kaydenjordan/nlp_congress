 Madam Speaker, I thank Chair DeLauro for yielding, and I  thank her for her leadership of this really great and historic  committee.   The Energy and Water division makes significant investments to secure  the imperative of U.S. energy independence in perpetuity to foster  world-class scientific innovation and address the crisis of climate  change. Not only does our bill meet the needs of the current moment, it  provides a firmer foundation to build back better.   Headlines tell a clear story. NBC News reported: ``The West catches  fire while the East goes underwater as climate change fuels both  extremes.'' As these extreme conditions spread across our country, our  goal must be to provide the necessary energy and water assets to help  sustain life on our corner of Mother Earth.   Our bill invests over $53 billion to provide strategic resources to  address these challenges while creating good-paying, middle-class jobs  in communities across this country, with a greater commitment to those  too often left behind.                                time  1530    Let me walk through key investments in this bill.   Madam Speaker, $45.1 billion is for the Department of Energy, $3.2  billion above enacted. Within the Department of Energy, the Office of  Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy--so much a part of our future-- receives record funding of $3.7 billion, $906 million above enacted.   In the weatherization programs, they received $398 million, $83  million above enacted. That means thousands more homes retrofitted.  ARPA-E receives $600 million, $173 million above enacted. The Office of  Science--world-class science--receives $7.32 billion, $294 million  above enacted. We responsibly fund our nuclear deterrent and increase  funding for nonproliferation programs.   The Army Corps receives $8.6 billion, $1.9 billion above the budget  request, to support our Nation's water infrastructure and dredge ports  and harbors.  [[Page H4048]]    The Bureau of Reclamation receives $1.9 billion, $413 million above  the budget request, including $191 million to address the western  drought.   Our bill increases funding for regional commissions which promote  economic development in distressed communities.   In short, this bill meets our responsibility to sustain life on Earth  by providing critical funding for water infrastructure, clean energy,  the highest level of scientific innovation, and a credible nuclear  deterrent while supporting the creation of good paying jobs in every  region of our country.   I also wish to, in closing, thank my dear staff for their very hard  work beginning with Jaime Shimek, our chief clerk; Angie Giancarlo,  serving the ranking member and the Republican side of the aisle; Mike  Brain; Scott McKee; Brian Smith; Will Ostertag; Lauren Leuck; and,  finally, Matt Kaplan of my own staff who will be going on to work with  the National Resources Defense Council, and we will miss him so very  much.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the tragic events of  January 6. The lawlessness of the mob that invaded the U.S. Capitol was  not solely directed against America's temple of democracy, it was also  a frontal assault that threatened the lives of hundreds upon hundreds  of heroic police officers, Capitol staff, and Members of Congress.   The rioters, some wearing paramilitary equipment, sought to block the  peaceful transition of executive power, which has been a hallmark of  our Republic for more than two centuries. The January 6 attack was no  vacation.   Members of Congress are sworn to protect and defend our Constitution.  Those who encouraged and white-washed political violence must be called  to full account.   As one Member who was among the last to be evacuated, I applaud Chair  Bennie Thompson and the members for their work investigating fully to  uncover the full truth of the savage brutality to which our Nation and  Constitution were subjected, and those who are sworn to uphold the law.   Let the facts lead our country to a judgment brought about through  justice, not mob rule.                            ____________________
