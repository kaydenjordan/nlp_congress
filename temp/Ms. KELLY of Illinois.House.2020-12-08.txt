 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate passage  of H. Res. 1250, recognizing the principles that should guide the  national artificial intelligence strategy of the United States.   In early 2018, Representative Hurd, as chair of the Oversight and  Government Reform Subcommittee on Information Technology, and myself,  as the ranking member, held the first congressional hearing on  artificial intelligence.   This resolution is born out of those hearings and the culmination of  over a year's work with the Bipartisan Policy Center, bringing together  experts from government, the private sector, and civil society to  outline priorities to ensure the United States remains a leader in AI.   AI has the potential to fundamentally change our society. The U.S.  needs a national strategy now to invest in our workforce, R&D, national  security, and oversight agencies to ensure AI is a positive tool that  will benefit all of society.   I am particularly pleased that this legislation was able to pass  before my friend and close IT partner for the past 6 years,  Representative Hurd, retires from this body.   This Chamber has been made better by his spirit of bipartisanship and  desire to protect our Nation and prepare  [[Page H6918]]  it to meet the challenges of the next century. Representative Hurd's  work will not be forgotten, and I will miss him dearly.                            ____________________
