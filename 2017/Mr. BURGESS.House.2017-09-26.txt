 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 533 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 533         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 2824) to amend title V of the Social Security       Act to extend the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home       Visiting Program. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Ways and Means. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means now printed in       the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original       bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule       an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-33. That amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. All       points of order against that amendment in the nature of a       substitute are waived. No amendment to that amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be in order  [[Page H7500]]       except those printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution. Each such amendment may be       offered only in the order printed in the report, may be       offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified       in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall       not be subject to a demand for division of the question in       the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of       order against such amendments are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a       separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the       Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the amendment in the       nature of a substitute made in order as original text. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2792) to amend       the Social Security Act to make certain revisions to       provisions limiting payment of benefits to fugitive felons       under titles II, VIII, and XVI of the Social Security Act.       All points of order against consideration of the bill are       waived. The amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means now printed in       the bill shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means;       and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 3.  In the engrossment of H.R. 2824 the Clerk shall--         (a) add the text of H.R. 2792, as passed by the House, as       new matter at the end of H.R. 2824;        (b) conform the title of H.R. 2824 to reflect the addition       of H.R. 2792, as passed by the House, to the engrossment;        (c) assign appropriate designations to provisions within       the engrossment; and        (d) conform cross-references and provisions for short       titles within the engrossment.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1  hour.

Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 533 provides for the  consideration of two bills which were reported by the House Ways and  Means Committee.   For the first bill, H.R. 2792, the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons  Act of 2017, the rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and  Means. The rule waives all points of order and makes in order no  further amendments to the legislation. However, the minority is  afforded the customary motion to recommit.   For H.R. 2824, the Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children  and Parents through Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act, the rule provides  for 1 hour of debate equally divided between the chair and ranking  member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The Rules Committee made in  order four amendments to H.R. 2824, one Republican amendment, two  Democratic amendments, and one bipartisan amendment. Finally, the rule  provides for the customary motion to recommit with or without  instructions.   H.R. 2792, the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017, amends  the Social Security Act to give the Social Security Administration the  necessary tools to prevent Federal benefits and payments from being  made to persons who are actually on the run from the law.   Many people might hear this and think: Why would the government ever  continue to pay someone who is actively fleeing from law enforcement?   It is a legitimate question, and it has an unfortunate answer.   In 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and  Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act into law. One major provision of  this reform bill was a restriction on the ability of fugitive felons  and probation and parole violators from receiving Social Security  benefits.                                time  1230    Similar provisions have been included in other Federal entitlement  programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and  the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. This policy was  expanded in 2004, with the passage of the Social Security Protection  Act.   However, subsequent to the passage of these commonsense reforms,  several judges in cases from the mid-2000s ruled that the Social  Security Administration's interpretation of these provisions was too  broad and limited the Social Security Administration's ability to  curtail payments to three narrow categories of fugitives, namely:  escape, flight to avoid prosecution or confinement, and flight escape.   The bill before the House today, H.R. 2792, would restore Congress'  original intent to the reforms passed under both Presidents Clinton and  George W. Bush. Specifically, H.R. 2792 would prohibit an individual  who is the subject of an outstanding arrest warrant for a felony or  parole violation from receiving monthly Social Security income  payments. This applies only to felony charges or a crime carrying a  minimum term of 1 year or more in prison.   This legislation would not punish individuals convicted of a  misdemeanor, such as outstanding parking tickets. In fact, some people  have falsely claimed that.   Individuals who have potentially committed a felony or a parole  violation should not be able to use taxpayer dollars to evade capture.  Providing the Social Security Administration with the tools in H.R.  2792 is a commonsense way to show that the Federal Government is  sincere in its commitment to being a good steward of Federal taxpayer  dollars. The Social Security benefits can be restored once the  individual resolves the outstanding issues related to his or her  warrant or parole violation.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota, Kristi Noem, for  her work on this legislation, and I urge Members of the House to  support this worthy bill.   The second bill in today's rule, H.R. 2824, the Increasing  Opportunity Through Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act, extends funding  for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program,  which is more commonly referred to as MIECHV.   The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program is an  important program that provides low-income families with opportunities  to receive home-visiting services to help support a child's first  years. These services range from prenatal care to early childhood  services and allow for children to grow up in healthy homes.   As not only a physician but a physician who specialized in obstetrics  and gynecology, I did spend 25 years working with pregnant women and  families to help ensure that all mothers could deliver and raise  healthy children. As an OB/GYN, I know the best way to ensure that a  child succeeds is to invest in long-term services and to ensure that  the child receives access to appropriate care.   Because of the Nurse-Family Partnership's work, 90 percent of all  babies who are supported by the organization are born full term, 95  percent of those babies receive all their immunizations by 24 months,  and nearly 89 percent of those mothers breastfeed their newborns.   These are important milestones for newborn children that can have  lasting impacts on their health for the rest of their lives, and it is  important that we support initiatives that support vital, lifesaving  programs like these.   Furthermore, the program succeeds by not only supporting the health  and well-being of children, but by supporting pregnant women and  mothers as well. In my home State of Texas, the reported incidence of  maternal mortality has increased in recent years, in part, as the State  has collected more comprehensive data on causes of death up to a year  after childbirth.  [[Page H7501]]    While no amount of maternal mortality is ever acceptable, the new  data has shown us that the causes for maternal mortality in the State  have shifted away from those traditional acute cases that I was  familiar with during my residency back in the 1970s. There were  illnesses such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, hemorrhage, and  infection during pregnancy. Now it is different. We have cardiac  disease, suicide, and opioid overdose, which oftentimes occurs in the  months after childbirth.   By supporting children in their first years, MIECHV can not only help  children live healthy lives, but help mothers live healthy lives as  well, so that they can continue to be there for their children.   The MIECHV Program and organizations like the Nurse-Family  Partnership succeed because they identify families in need that do not  have readily available care and work to provide services in home  settings.   Families cannot raise healthy children without access to care. When  families cannot find providers in their area, MIECHV grant recipients  are there to provide that support.   H.R. 2824 builds upon the successes of the MIECHV Program by  tailoring the program to ensure that it can continue to help families  that truly need the help.   For example, H.R. 2824 requires for States receiving MIECHV grants to  conduct statewide needs assessments by 2020, in order to reaffirm which  populations and communities should receive these services. The last  time such an assessment was required was in 2010.   As the needs of populations of States have evolved over these past 10  years, so should the program as well. It is important to ensure that  tax dollars continue to be invested efficiently, and this bill ensures  that MIECHV can continue to do so.   Additionally, H.R. 2824 provides additional opportunities for States  to promote quality and enhanced outcomes. The bill updates the program  by allowing for States to promote models that will have greater impact  on multiple sites and locations, thus expanding the reach of grants and  providing States with the opportunity to reimburse grant recipients  based on the quality and outcomes associated with their programs.    I certainly want to thank members of the Ways and Means Committee for  the work they have put into this bill. It is a smart bill that  continues a Federal program for low-income families that actually has  evidence of its effectiveness and, furthermore, links future funding to  the assurance of greater cost-effectiveness.   This program serves as a model for Federal programs to help low- income families and children. I want to thank Chairman Smith and  Chairman Brady for their efforts on this bill.   For these reasons, I encourage everyone in this body to support this  rule and the underlying bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk again just for a minute about the second  bill in today's rule, H.R. 2824, the Increasing Opportunity and Success  for Children and Parents through Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act, that  does extend funding for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home  Visiting Program.   I just wanted to talk for a minute about some of the results that we  have seen in these program grants and, at this point, reference my home  State of Texas to see how they have performed.   The Nurse-Family Partnership is a community-based home services group  that supports pregnant women and new mothers in the Dallas-Fort Worth  area. They have used grants from this program to support women through  both the promotion of preventive and prenatal services for pregnant  women, like connecting women to physicians, helping them get  medications, and through the utilization of risk reduction services  such as smoking cessation.   Again, I tell you this to reiterate that these are good programs.  This is a good program that we are reauthorizing today and it is worthy  of our attention and support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for consideration of two important  pieces of legislation to restore sanity to the administration of the  Social Security program and to provide critical tools for disadvantaged  homes in helping families raise their children with the best possible  practices.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady, Mrs. Noem, and Mr. Smith for the  work on each of their respective pieces of legislation, and I urge  Members of this body to support both bills and the rule which will  provide for their consideration.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 533 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 4 of rule XVI, I move  that  [[Page H7504]]  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 3 p.m. tomorrow.   The motion was agreed to.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 26, 2017, on page H7504, the following appeared: The  SPEAKER pro tempore.
