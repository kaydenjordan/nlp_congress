 Mr. Speaker, Ohio's jobs and trade message to our Nation  is as loud and clear as it always has been: trade must be about people,  not just goods.   The job and wage destruction due to the original NAFTA continues to  reverberate across our State and the  [[Page H9532]]  heartland. It undermines the economic security of hundreds of thousands  of workers within our State and millions more across our Nation.  Following the original NAFTA's implementation, town after town was  emptied out of good jobs with good wages and benefits as jobs were  outsourced south of our border.   America has borne witness to NAFTA's vast job outsourcing and wage  drag. Millions have suffered firsthand as dire predictions actualized  and the grandiose promises of job creation failed to materialize. Our  Nation has lost thousands of jobs to penny-wage environments where  workers cannot even afford to buy the goods they make. They toil in  sweatshops and maquiladoras, exposed to unimaginable toxins and unsafe  working conditions. The original NAFTA fueled massive peasant migration  from Mexico's countryside to our Nation as thousands of subsidized  farmers in Mexico had livelihoods extinguished. Mexico's white corn  industry disappeared. It was decimated.   What a humanitarian tragedy is NAFTA. If anyone cares about people,  not just goods, listen to my words: America must wake up to the impact  our trade deals impose on people when negotiating with unequal  economies.   Just look to the devastation levied when multinational corporate  interests dominate negotiations. Transnational banks and multinational  corporations put a heavy thumb on the scales of economic justice for  the poorest and for workers in our country as well as Third World  economies. They exploit powerless people. Trade with our closest  neighbors is never simply a zero-sum game.   In the nearly three decades since NAFTA's original passage, our  Nation has not even had 1 year of balanced trade accounts with Mexico  and Canada. It has always been in the red.                                time  1045    Indeed, the NAFTA deal has managed to add over $1 trillion to  America's trade deficits--red ink--and millions and millions of  outsourced U.S. jobs.   Mr. Speaker, NAFTA renegotiation is too important an opportunity to  hang on faulty assumptions. America fell for that back in 1993. We  cannot let it happen again.   The devil is in the details. Incremental progress to uplift North  American workers devastated by the original agreement will not be  enough.   With the release of text, which remains unfinished and unresolved,  comes the task to determine whether the job outsourcing bonanza that  has taken hold since NAFTA's passage in 1994 has truly been addressed.   Let me ask:   Have strong, enforceable labor standards been included, subject to  swift and certain enforcement?   Will transnational corporate interests retain the means to outsource  American jobs to take advantage of rock-bottom wages in Mexico?   Will we protect the rights of Americans to know what is in the  imported food they are feeding their families, or will trade  facilitation hold priority over food safety for people?   Will Americans have access to affordable prescription drugs, or will  the new NAFTA further rig the system to delay access to more  affordable, safe generic drugs and biosimilars?   Let me ask people who visit Ohio to witness vivid evidence of a trade  agreement that failed America's workers and communities as plant after  plant shuts down. Beyond just the NAFTA trade deficit, all our global  trade deficits have ballooned under this administration's erratic trade  agenda.   In this wake, a modern NAFTA agreement to correct these injustices is  long overdue. I have eagerly anticipated the release of specific text  and a strategic agenda from this administration on how President Trump  plans to bring living wage jobs back to America. Anything short of  specifics that will clearly improve job prospects for Americans will  fall short of the President's promises.   Congress must not rush any deal of such magnitude by only letting the  executive branch negotiate. Democrats have called on this  administration to work with Congress to reach necessary and substantive  achievements beneficial for all Americans. No more fast track. No more.   Any new North American trade agreement must raise wages. It must  create jobs in America and create a level playing field across the  board.   Mr. Speaker, after a quarter century of job hemorrhaging and the  upending of American workers and livelihoods, NAFTA must result in  rising standards of living and new jobs that create real wages and  benefits here in our country.                            ____________________
