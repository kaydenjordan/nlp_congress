 Mr. President, the Senate has before it today the result  of a compromise. The conference report that will result in the adoption  of the National Defense Authorization Act--NDAA--for fiscal year 2021  is neither the bill the Senate approved, nor the one the House passed.  I am pleased that this conference report cures many of the problems  that led to my vote to oppose the Senate bill. Specifically, the  conference report is void of the authority for funds to support testing  of a new nuclear device, which was included in the Senate bill. This  sends an important message to the world about Congress's support for  U.S. leadership in armed control.   Further, the conference report advances the progress we have made  with regard to Vietnam. This NDAA sends a clear message that Congress  believes in the importance of cooperation with Vietnam, both to advance  our shared security interests and to address some of the worst  consequences of that war. The conference report will extend the  authorization for the Department of Defense to help decontaminate the  Bien Hoa Airbase from the lingering poison of dioxin, and it includes  new authorization to help the Government of Vietnam locate and identify  some of its hundreds of thousands of MIAs, as they have helped us  locate our own MIAs over so many years.   The bill will also help the veterans of that war who were exposed to  dioxin. The expansion of presumption of exposure included in this bill  will mean that Americans suffering from a number of linked ailments can  spend their time seeking treatment, rather than jumping through  bureaucratic and legal hoops. For many veterans exposed to airborne  toxic substances through burn pits, this bill also includes a number of  provisions to make it easier to identify their exposure and for them to  make connections needed while seeking medical care. It continues the  march towards rectifying the Department of Defense's PFOS/PFOA usage.  While there is much to be done in both these areas, this is a positive  step forward.   This bill is imperfect, but of particular concern to me is the  addition in conference, without proper vetting or evaluation, of  several provisions that undermine the Freedom of Information Act, our  Nation's premier transparency law. Many of these provisions were in  neither the Senate nor the House bill. For a number of years, I have  worked in a bipartisan manner with other members of the Judiciary  Committee to consult with the Senate Armed Services Committee to  provide the feedback and expertise in FOIA matters, as it relates to  proposals within the NDAA. That inclusive process, where committees of  jurisdiction are consulted on their areas of expertise, has ensured  that the NDAA does not become a vehicle for unwise or harmful policies.    This time, however, a number of provisions needlessly piercing holes  in FOIA were inserted during conference negotiations without any  consultation with the Judiciary Committee. Unsurprisingly, a process  that took place behind closed doors resulted in policies undermining  the American people's ability to know what their government is doing.  Unfortunately, this is slowly becoming a routine practice, and it must  not happen again. I want to put everyone on notice: I will insist that  the Judiciary Committee and those of us who worked for many years on  these matters are consulted on provisions that fall within the purview  of our committee before they are included in the NDAA. That  consultation process has produced good outcomes for the American people  for years. Let's not change it now.   With these concerns in mind, on balance, this is a defense  authorization bill that I will support. It advances our efforts to  reconcile with our history and address the naming of our military bases  after Confederate generals, something over which the President  inexplicably threatened to veto the bill. It rejects the President's  demands to repeal section 230 of the Communications Decency Act,  something that advances his personal war, but which demands careful  consideration and should not be used as hostage bait.   This conference report authorizes over $740 billion in spending. The  defense of our Nation and our international role in providing security  and promoting stability demand significant investments. I hope,  however, that in future years, Congress will thoughtfully consider the  skewed balance of our defense investments against other critical  domestic needs. These are difficult questions, but ones that demand  debate and honest review.      Vote on National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021--                            Conference Report
