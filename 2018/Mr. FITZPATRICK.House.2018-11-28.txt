 Mr. Speaker, November is Pancreatic Cancer Awareness  Month, and I am pleased to recognize an organization in Bucks County,  Pennsylvania, that works to raise awareness and seeks to cure this  disease.   My constituent Christine Edmonds formed A Love for Life based in  Newtown, Bucks County, nearly 6 years ago in memory of her husband,  Kevin Edmonds. Kevin died in April 2012 at the young age of 51 after a  brave battle with pancreatic cancer, shortly after  [[Page H9671]]  his sister Nora died of the very same illness. The mission of A Love  for Life is to ensure that pancreatic cancer research is properly  funded.   Pancreatic cancer is a very, very devastating illness. The average  survival rate for stage IV pancreatic cancer averages around 6 months.  A Love for Life is looking to change that, partnering with the Abramson  Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania to promote advanced  research.   We offer our heartfelt thanks and gratitude to A Love for Life and  Christine Edmonds for their work to eradicate pancreatic cancer in our  community, in our country, and in our world.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of our constituents and everyone in our  community to follow her courageous lead in standing up for and serving  a cause bigger than herself.                            ____________________
