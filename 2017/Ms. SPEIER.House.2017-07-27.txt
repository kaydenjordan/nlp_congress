 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 426.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hill). The question is on the  resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 37, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $25,000,000) (increased by $25,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Speier) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Chairman, the American people are becoming more and  more aware of the degenerative disease known as chronic traumatic  encephalopathy, CTE, due to the crisis in the NFL. The NFL, of course,  has been trying to sweep this under the rug.   Very recently, the Journal of the American Medical Association, a  premier journal that is peer-reviewed, provided a study that found  severe neurological damage in the vast majority of former football  players' brains that were donated for research after they developed  mental symptoms during life. Eighty-seven percent of all football  players' brains showed CTE, but a truly horrible figure, 99 percent of  the brains of NFL players showed CTE.   However, the dangers of CTE are not confined to football. Our  servicemen and -women are subject to similar--or, oftentimes, even  worse--dangers in the line of duty for the service they provide to our  Nation.   Last year, I was honored to host Dr. Bennet Omalu for the State of  the Union. He is the doctor portrayed in the film ``Concussion,''  exposing the impact of CTE on professional football players. He began  his research covering his own expenses and exposing a coverup of the  suicides of former athletes. However, his research and the research of  others is limited by the funding, which is why I am offering this  amendment.   Today we have an opportunity to prevent a similar kind of coverup  among our service agencies. This amendment would dedicate $25 million  in funding as part of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research  Programs to award grants to medical researchers and universities to  support early detection of CTE.                                time  1515    This amendment would not increase spending, but take the funding  already allocated and put some of it--a very small part of it--towards  CTE.   Every hour, we lose another veteran to suicide. We have made great  strides towards supporting PTSD research, but the exposure to IEDs and  other blasts and blows to the head, may be doing similar damage, which  goes unseen until it is too late. By diagnosing CTE early among  servicemembers, perhaps we can begin to change the troubling trend of  suicides among our veterans.   You may hear arguments today that this amendment is not necessary,  since DOD is already spending $125 million on TBI research. But this  research is on short-term trauma, not on long-term effects of repeated  head injuries and, what are called, subconcussive blows. Servicemembers  at risk of CTE may not even have acute trauma. CTE can result from  minor events over a long period of time.   You may also hear that Congress shouldn't dictate the DOD research.  But it is absolutely Congress' role to have input into DOD spending,  and there is a huge need that is not being filled. And we already are  requiring that they do TBI research as it is.   Now, some have suggested: Well, there has been some projects funded.  Of the $125 million of funding, the amount of money going to CTE  projects has been, since 2012, only five projects, for a grand total  cost of $2.9 million. And not one dime has been spent since 2013.   It is time for us to accept that science is real here. JAMA has just  put out a stunning report that suggests that this is a very serious  problem, and it is time for us to combat this issue.   Creating dedicated grants for the early detection of CTE has the  potential to prevent suicides among our servicemembers and will have, I  think, a very important impact on how we look at CTE in the future and  how we make sure that our servicemembers are properly protected.  [[Page H6501]]    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank both of my colleagues for their  expression of support for the concept of making sure that CTE is  studied.   I am just hopeful that we can guarantee, through this amendment, that  of that $125 million, some portion of it is set aside for CTE research.  The fact that only $2.9 million has gone to CTE research since 2012,  and not a dime since 2013, makes me worry that it is not a high  priority within the Department.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
