 Madam Speaker, I rise today to reiterate my support for  the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, a commonsense deal  that supports farmers and workers.   However, USMCA sits unratified even as President Trump, Mexico, and  Canada signed the agreement over a year ago. Each day that the USMCA is  not ratified, we are losing out on valuable jobs and opportunities.  Speaker Pelosi must get serious about bringing this legislation to a  vote in Congress.   My Republican colleagues and I are ready to vote on the deal, but  House Democrats setting their sights on the baseless impeachment of the  President choose to neglect important opportunities like this.   I just voted against an impeachment resolution against the President  when I should be voting on issues like USMCA.   I implore Speaker Pelosi to bring USMCA for a vote so we can finally  deliver for American farmers and manufacturers. Let's get back to what  we promised the American people we would do.   I hope that my colleagues across the aisle can agree that expanding  access to markets, remaining competitive, and growing our economy is  what is best for Americans instead of engaging in political shams that  do nothing to move this country forward.                            ____________________
