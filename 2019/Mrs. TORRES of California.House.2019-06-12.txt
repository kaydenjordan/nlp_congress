 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee  on Rules, I call up House Resolution 436 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 436         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for further       consideration of the bill (H.R. 2740) making appropriations       for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and       Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending       September 30, 2020, and for other purposes.        Sec. 2.

(c) Each further amendment printed in part B of the report       of the Committee on Rules may be offered at any time during       the consideration of the bill for amendment, may be offered       only by a Member designated in the report, shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified       in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, may be withdrawn by the proponent at any       time before action thereon, shall not be subject to amendment       except amendments described in section 4 of House Resolution       431, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the       question in the House or in the Committee of the Whole.        (d) All points of order against further amendments printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules or against amendments       en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution are waived.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time for the chair of       the Committee on Appropriations or her designee to offer       amendments en bloc consisting of further amendments printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution not earlier disposed of. Amendments en bloc       offered pursuant to this section shall be considered as read,       shall be debatable for 20 minutes equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations or their respective designees,       shall not be subject to amendment except amendments described       in section 4 of House Resolution 431, and shall not be       subject to a demand for division of the question in the House       or in the Committee of the Whole.        Sec. 4.  At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill, as       amended, to the House with such further amendments as may       have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate  only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Woodall), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                time  1315                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules  Committee met and reported the rule, House Resolution 436, providing  for consideration of H.R. 2740, the Labor, Health and Human Services,  Education, Defense, State, Foreign Operations, and Energy and Water  Development Appropriations Act, 2020.   The rule provides for further consideration of H.R. 2740 under a  structured rule and makes in order 115 amendments. The rule provides no  further general debate.   The chair of the Appropriations Committee may also offer amendments  en bloc consisting of amendments made in order by the rule and not  earlier disposed of.   Finally, the rule includes one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, it was only a few months ago that we were standing here  voting to end the longest government shutdown in the history of the  United States, a shutdown that hurt so many of our constituents,  constituents like David Pesko, an FAA air traffic controller at Ontario  Airport.   He was in escrow to purchase a home, and, without a paycheck coming  in, he had to rely on his family and friends' generosity in order to  make ends meet.   We owe David and the American people much more, and that is why I am  especially proud of the timely introduction of these appropriations  bills. It exemplifies the hard work of my colleagues on the  Appropriations Committee and this majority's commitment to good  governance.   Mr. Speaker, in years past, we have relied strongly on omnibus  spending  [[Page H4446]]  bills to fund the government. But now, with the hard work done by  Members on both sides of the aisle, this majority is leading us in a  return to regular order.   As has often been said on this very floor, the primary job of  Congress is to fund the American government and keep it open and  operating. Our constituents deserve no less.   With this package under consideration today, the House will do just  that with respect to 4 of the 12 spending bills.   In passing this bill, we will provide crucial funding for services  across broad areas of the government and fulfill our promises to the  American people. That funding includes historic investments in programs  that provide opportunities for millions of people, including my  constituents in the Inland Empire.   Perhaps more important than what is included in this bill is what is  not included. This minibus rejects the President's draconian budget  cuts that would have hurt every American, but especially women and  children.   Instead, we have won increased funding for a number of important  priorities.   This bill boosts biomedical research at the National Institutes of  Health, expands opioid abuse treatment and prevention programs, and  launches new initiatives for maternal and child health.   I recently visited three health clinics in my district that provide  30,000 families with lifesaving care.   This bill provides $400 million for the Title X Family Planning  Program so that everyone in the Inland Empire and across America can  continue to have access to cancer screenings, STI tests, reproductive  care, and other lifesaving services.   It also protects against the administration's policies that prevent a  woman from making choices about her future, like when to have a child.   When women do decide to become mothers, this bill supports them by  investing in working families and our children with $7.8 billion for  the Childcare and Development Block Grant program.   Passing this bill will demonstrate our commitment to the ideal that  all students deserve a quality, safe, and affordable education, and  that commitment is realized in over $24 billion in funding for Federal  Student Aid programs, almost $2 billion more than the President's  insufficient request.   Just as important is this bill's acknowledgement of how far we have  to go in helping underserved communities, the bill provides $917  million to assist minority-serving institutions, including $150 million  for Hispanic-serving institutions like Cal Poly Pomona, Cal State San  Bernardino, and UC Riverside, which prepare thousands of students in my  district to be tomorrow's leaders.   Mr. Speaker, I am also happy to report that this legislation provides  the funding necessary for a 3.1 percent pay raise for our  servicemembers, who continue to serve our Nation around the world.   As the mother of an Air Force veteran, it is wonderful news to hear  that our servicemembers are being acknowledged for the hard work that  they do keeping our Nation safe, at home and abroad.   In addition to paying our servicemembers more, this bill will protect  our men and women in uniform from one of the most common harms that  they encounter: sexual assault.   The $38 million in additional funding for DOD'S sexual assault  prevention and response programs will ensure that survivors have  representation while navigating the complicated military justice  process, that they will not have to wait years for a resolution--years,  Mr. Speaker--as one of my constituents had to do.   This bill not only invests in our priorities at home; it advances our  priorities abroad. I am particularly pleased with increased investments  in certain areas, including global reproductive health and aid to  Central American countries.   This bill empowers countless women who are the backbone of their  families around the world by increasing funding for family planning  programs, reversing the President's disastrous global gag rule, and  contributing $55.5 million to the United Nations Population Fund.    Robust funding is included for counter-narcotics and law enforcement  efforts in Colombia, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.   This bill also ensures that the funding provided goes to the right  people--the right people, Mr. Speaker--instead of the corrupt officials  that undermine democracy and misuse U.S. aid. This is especially  important given the recent report regarding corruption in the Northern  Triangle countries of Guatemala and Honduras.   And, finally, the last part of this bill that I would like to  highlight is what we are doing to invest in our energy and water  infrastructure.   The bill rejects the President's shortsighted proposed cuts to key  energy and water programs and, instead, invests $46.6 billion to  rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, build the next generation of  clean energy technologies, and combat the urgent threat that is climate  change.   This is a good bill. This is a bill that should be signed into law,  and I urge my colleagues to vote for this rule so that we can get back  to regular order and avoid another costly shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I would like to remind my colleague that I also serve on the  Appropriations Committee, and we had a very open and transparent  process. Every subcommittee invited all Members to come before us to  present their ideas or their requests to the subcommittees of the  Appropriations Committee. We have also supported 95 percent of the  written requests from all Members.   So to say that it was not transparent and that Members did not have  an opportunity to come before and present their ideas is incorrect.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey  (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, it is tiring to hear from so  many * * * males on this floor talk about a woman's right to choose.    Mr. Speaker, if it pleases my colleague on  the other side, I will withdraw my statement about sex-starved males on  the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I will agree to withdraw my  statement regarding----    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  withdraw my statement.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will put it in different terms. It is tiring to be  here on this floor or in committee as a woman and to continue to be  counseled about what types of affordable planning, whether it is family  planning, conversations that rightfully I deserve to have with my own  doctor.   Choosing when women want to have a family and to avoid pregnancies  before they become pregnancies, it is unfortunate that that is  something that continues to be denied to American women day in and day  out on this floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, contraception for women is  not something that should be debated here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal- Allard) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD asked and was given permission to revise and  extend her remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I will not. I will not yield  for that purpose, and all time yielded is for the purpose of debate and  debate only.    Mr. Speaker, I will not yield.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I want to remind my colleagues why we are here today. We are  considering a bill that provides $7.97 billion in humanitarian  assistance, a 3.1 percent pay raise for our troops, $1.9 billion for  the Job Corps, $41.1 billion for mental health, for Alzheimer's  research, HIV/AIDS, cancer research, and others.   I agree that we need to address the humanitarian situation at the  border, and Democrats have been saying this for a very long time. We  said so when crying toddlers were being torn apart from their mother's  arms. We said so when children were being put in cages. We said so when  children were being drugged. We said so when children were being  sexually abused.   I visited those facilities. I saw the tragedy with my own eyes. HHS  needs an influx of funds, and we cannot wait until this bill is  enacted.   In the coming weeks, we will consider the administration's request  for a supplemental appropriations bill. That supplemental, not the  fiscal year 2020 appropriations bill, is the appropriate place to deal  with this year's ORR funding. That is not just because we can't wait  for the annual appropriations process to be completed; it is also  because we have concerns about how ORR is managing some of those  shelters.    With all the abuses that have come to light, I know that my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle agree with us that we need to  have more oversight, additional oversight over these facilities.   Most importantly, this amendment increases and decreases the same  account. It is not an actual effect. The children deserve more than a  messaging amendment. They deserve better than that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire if the  gentleman has any remaining speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.    Mr. Speaker, while we may not agree on everything, I do want to thank  my colleague from Georgia for his participation in this process. I hope  we can agree that getting back to regular order is the right thing to  do, not for Democrats and not for Republicans, but for the American  people.   Congress cannot write a blank check and allow children on our  southern border to continue to be abused while they are in our custody.  We need transparency, we need accountability. Members of Congress need  to be able to go and inspect these facilities without being denied  entry.   On the issue of participation among Members of Congress through this  process of appropriations, I want to state once again that ideas are  absolutely welcome. However, the Appropriations Committee chairwoman  cannot order Members to participate in the process. We can set up  meetings and we can invite them to come and participate, and many did.  They presented their ideas, they presented their requests for funding  for their districts, and, guess what, 95 percent of those requests were  agreed upon through a process of mitigating.   Now, if I was writing this appropriations bill myself, it would look  very different. If my colleague from Georgia was writing this  appropriations bill himself, it would look very different. He and I  both know that. But our commitment is not to our personal agendas. Our  commitment is to the rule of law, is to democracy, and is to the  American people, our constituents, who sent us here to represent them.   The underlying legislation is a strong bill that is the result of  good, hard work by Members of both sides of the aisle. It is about time  that the House of Representatives got back to doing the business of the  people in a timely manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:/n                    Amendment to House Resolution 436/n         At the end of the resolution, add the following:/n        Sec. 5. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution,       the House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House       on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3056) to provide supplemental appropriations relating to       border security, and for other purposes. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. Points of order against provisions in the       bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI are       waived. Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during       consideration of the bill. When the committee rises and       reports the bill back to the House with a recommendation that       the bill do pass, the previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill./n        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3056.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
