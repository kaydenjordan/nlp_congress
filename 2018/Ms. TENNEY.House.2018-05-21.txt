 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my bipartisan  bill, the Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act of  2018, which passed unanimously in the House Ways and Means Committee  last week.   As a member of the bipartisan Heroin Task Force, I am committed to  finding a comprehensive and compassionate solution to reverse the tide  of the growing opioid addiction plaguing our communities and families.   With 115 people dying each day--and 635 in my own district in 2016  alone--from an opioid overdose, we must find ways to prevent this abuse  from happening in the first place.   My bipartisan bill requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  to evaluate and report on adverse incentives that lead to the  overprescription of opioids and underutilization of nonopioid  alternatives for postsurgery recovery and the treatment of chronic  pain.   This is commonsense legislation that will enable Congress to identify  and eliminate perverse incentives that are fueling the opioid epidemic,  the epidemic that is destroying our families and our communities.   I have personally known individuals in the 22nd District whose lives  were taken too early because of this scourge.   This bipartisan bill is a step in the right direction to helping our  families and communities combat this crisis that is tearing families  apart.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my bipartisan cosponsors, Representative  [[Page H4271]]  Suzan DelBene and Representative  David McKinley, for joining me in  this important legislation.                            ____________________
