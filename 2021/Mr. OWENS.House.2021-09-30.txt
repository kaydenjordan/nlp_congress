 Madam Speaker, I rise today to continue sounding the alarm  on the Biden Administration's economic and spending crisis that is  hurting families in my district and killing American jobs.   This Big Government, ultra-inflation, and massive spending agenda has  a big problem: the economy. It is spiking the price of groceries, gas,  lumber, and everything in between.   Gasoline is up 42.7 percent. Chicken is up 7.2 percent. Eggs are up  9.9 percent. Public transportation is up 8.4 percent.   As I have heard from my families all across my district, Americans  cannot afford this.   Utahns say they are paying more for just about everything. In fact, a  recent statewide poll found that 85 percent of Utahns are very or  somewhat concerned about inflation and rising costs.   Inflation is a tax on every single American.   With consumer prices reaching a 13-year high, it is clear this  administration's agenda is bad for economic recovery and unsustainable  for working-class Americans trying to make ends meet.   The Democrats' solution? Rush through the most expensive piece of  legislation in the history of our country.   Another startling fact: This $3.5 trillion spending plan is more than  the GDP of Canada and Mexico combined.   While the White House continues to spread false realities to the  American people, let's talk about the facts: The true cost of the bill  is $5.5 trillion, not $3.5 trillion, and certainly not zero. It is  going to increase the national debt by $2.4 trillion. It will lead to  5.3 million jobs lost nationwide. The median family income will drop by  $12,000. Each American household will be burdened with $35,439 of debt.   Americans across the country and Utahns in the Fourth District want  to see fiscal responsibility restored at the Federal level. This out- of-control spending must stop.                            ____________________
