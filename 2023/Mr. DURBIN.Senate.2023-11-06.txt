 Madam President, 7 weeks ago, on September 21, the U.S.  Senate, on a bipartisan basis, gathered with Ukrainian President  Zelenskyy in the Old Senate Chamber. We don't often use that Chamber.  It is often used for incidents that become embedded in history, and  this was one of them. It was a historic moment.   Many things were said about the courage of the Ukrainian people and  the heroism of the troops fighting Russian President Vladimir Putin's  unjust war, but I recall one particular plea made by President  Zelenskyy--and he repeated it. So it was clear he wanted us to  remember. I will stress here what he said:         Without the continued financial support of the United       States and NATO, we will lose this war.    He was unequivocal.   Secretary of Defense Austin told me clearly at last week's Senate  Appropriations Committee hearing that he agreed with Zelenskyy.   Secretary of State Blinken added that such assistance is critical in  thwarting not just Putin but aggressors around the world who are  watching and gauging our sustained commitment.   I agree completely. Looking at the world today, I do not believe it  is a stretch to say that freedom is currently under siege and fighting  for its future. Right now, several democracies across the globe are  fighting against tyrannical powers--in some cases, autocratic  governments; in others, terrorist organizations--that seek to undermine  the global order. But this much is clear: Democratic values are under  siege, and the United States and our generation have a responsibility  to act.   Two weeks ago, President Biden requested $106 billion in supplemental  funding for national security. This includes money to help supply  Ukraine with weapons to continue its valiant fight against Russian  aggression. It includes money to help Israel defend itself against  Hamas, which, on October 7, perpetrated the largest attack against  Jewish people than on any single day since the Holocaust. And,  importantly, it also includes billions of dollars to support  humanitarian needs across those conflict zones around the world,  including the crisis in Gaza, because, as important as it is to support  nations like Ukraine in their struggle against tyranny, it is equally  as important to support innocent citizens who so often become  collateral damage and bear the brunt of suffering during periods of  conflict.   At the Appropriations Committee hearing last week, Secretaries  Blinken and Austin underscored the necessity of this funding request.  They made clear that it is critical to deliver the urgent national  security priorities as laid out in the President's request.   These challenges facing the world are interrelated. So it is  important that we deliver aid in one unified package that speaks to  America's values abroad.   I asked Secretaries Blinken and Austin about the recent visit by the  terrorist organization Hamas leadership to--believe it or not--Putin in  Moscow. Secretary Blinken was blunt: Putin is allied with any effort  that may distract the United States from the war in  [[Page S5349]]  Ukraine or that undermines democracy and the rule of law.   The Secretary added that other malign actors are watching closely to  assess America's reaction and resolve. That is why one comprehensive  supplemental that can address all of these interconnected global needs  is the only way forward.   When asked about the United States' role in the world, President  Biden explained that we have not only the financial responsibility but  the moral responsibility to support democracies worldwide.   I agree. Right now, the global community faces profound challenges,  the outcomes of which will reverberate to every corner of the world for  decades to come. As a global superpower, America has an essential role  to play in defending freedom. It is not only the right thing to do; it  is the smart thing to do.   Last week, the House provided a Republican-led plan to provide  billions of dollars only to Israel, tragically ignoring this call for  leadership.   Madam President, I just challenge everyone to take a look at how  Republicans put together this package--even this package of aid to  Israel. The House bill would cynically cut funding from the Internal  Revenue Service that is being used to help auditors catch wealthy tax  cheaters in America. The House Speaker wants to cut that.   The Presiding Officer and I represent thousands of Illinoisans, good  families who know their tax obligations. They are not happy about them,  but they face them and deal with them honestly. Only a handful of  people are misusing their power and money to avoid tax responsibility.  We need to stop that. They need to pay their fair share of taxes,  particularly the wealthy among us.   So how does the House Republican leadership pay for aid to Israel? It  eliminates auditors from the Internal Revenue Service who are trying to  catch these tax cheaters.   What are they thinking?   Incidentally, that means that the auditors are not recovering the  money for our Treasury that is owed to it, and they add to the deficit.  This bunch of fiscal hawks, given the chance for a first real act of  the new Speaker, decide to find a way to avoid holding tax cheaters  responsible and adding to the national deficit. They need some work  over there. That bill is a nonstarter that Putin must be enjoying.   Protecting our national security interests and defending American  values will take a bipartisan effort, not political games. As such, I  urge my colleagues to swiftly pass this funding package and help  reassure the global community, as long as there is a United States of  America, we will be standing for freedom across the world.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 373.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.

Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, November 6,  be waived.    I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fetterman), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff), and the Senator from  New York (Mr. Schumer) are necessarily absent.
