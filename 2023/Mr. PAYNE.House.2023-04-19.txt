 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to denounce the MAGA  Republicans' failure to support Americans. They want to remove an FDA- approved medication and control women's rights to their own healthcare  choices. They deny the freedom of speech and the freedom of assembly to  minority elected officials, and they support putting guns in the hands  of people with severe mental issues.   Thankfully, the Democrats put people over politics and address the  country's real issues. We are lowering inflation and protecting the  right to vote. We have created 12.6 million new jobs for hardworking  Americans in the last few years. We are lowering prescription drugs to  help American seniors. We are fixing highways and bridges nationwide to  help Americans travel.   Clearly, we are the party that cares about America.                            ____________________
