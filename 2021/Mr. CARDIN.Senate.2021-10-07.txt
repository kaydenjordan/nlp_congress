 Madam President, I rise today in recognition of Hispanic  Heritage Month to celebrate our Hispanic and Latino communities and  their immeasurable contributions to our Nation. Hispanic and Latinos  have been with our country since its very founding and have helped make  America exceptional. Hispanic and Latino Americans play vital roles in  our communities. They are our teachers, our heathcare heroes, our  entrepreneurs, our essential workers, our public servants and elected  officials, all vital to the fabric of our Nation.   Hispanic Heritage Month started as a commemorative week that Congress  established in 1968 and expanded to a full month in 1988 to recognize  the critical role the Latino community has played in the civil rights  movement. Celebrations start September 15, a significant date, as it is  the independence date for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Nicaragua, while Mexico celebrates its independence on September 16,  and Chile celebrates its independence on September 18.   This month, we celebrate the nearly 61 million Latino Americans  across the country and the more than 600,000 Hispanic or Latino  residents in Maryland. Maryland is proudly one of the most diverse  States in the Nation. We are home to people with origins in Central and  South America, with sizeable populations of Salvadorans, Guatemalans,  Puerto Ricans, and Mexicans.   America is a nation of immigrants; people from far and wide have  settled in the United States, the land of opportunity. Since the  Immigration Act of 1965, millions of individuals from Central and South  America have immigrated to the United States for numerous reasons,  including economic instability or violence in their native country.   We take this month to highlight the importance of the Hispanic and  Latino communities, including the election in 1822 of Joseph Marion  Hernandez, the first Hispanic in Congress, as Florida's Delegate.  Today, according to the Congressional Research Service, there are 54  Hispanic or Latino Members--a record number--serving: 47 in the House,  including two Delegates and the Resident Commissioner, and seven in the  Senate.   Though the Hispanic and Latino communities have been essential to  America's identity, from the scientific innovation to art, culture,  music, food, and so much more, we must still recognize the disparities  that these communities face. For the second year, we are celebrating  Hispanic Heritage Month during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has  affected people of color at disproportionate rates in terms of economic  distress and case severity. The Hispanic or Latino unemployment rate  soared to 18.9 percent in February of 2020. Hispanic or Latina women  took even larger losses compared to their male counterparts. The  unemployment disparity is due to the overrepresentation of Hispanic or  Latino workers in the food preparation or serving industry, as well as  building and grounds cleaning and maintenance. These sectors suffered  some of the harshest economic effects of the pandemic. Even though the  unemployment rate has decreased to 6.4 percent in Hispanic and Latino  communities--6.2 percent in Maryland--they still have not experienced  the same economic recoveries as their White counterparts.   For the immigrants who do not have a green card, their likelihood to  have lost a job is even higher. Many say that at least one family  member in their household has lost a job or wages. Families are  suffering; they are worried about putting food on the table or even  losing their homes. The financial toll of the last year and a half has  exacerbated the prepandemic inequalities that the Hispanic or Latino  communities were already facing.   Hispanic or Latino people are also more likely face the harshest  health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, Hispanic or Latino people are twice as  likely to catch COVID, 2.8 times more likely to be hospitalized, and  2.3 times more likely to die compared to their White counterparts. In  my own home State, Hispanic or Latino people are 14.3 percent of the  case rates when they only make up 10.6 percent of our population. With  the widening gaps of healthcare coverage, Hispanic or Latino families  face large hospital bills for their bouts of COVID. Twenty percent of  nonelderly Hispanic or Latino people are  [[Page S6996]]  uninsured. Although the Affordable Care Act and President Biden's  expansion of the Affordable Care Act have helped many receive  healthcare coverage, people of color remain less likely to have  healthcare coverage.   It is our duty in Congress to ensure that our Hispanic and Latino  communities have the resources and access to healthcare they need so we  can close the gap between them and their White counterparts. This comes  with educating these communities on how to sign up and receive  healthcare. It also comes with comprehensive immigration reform to  provide an easier pathway to citizenship so people can come out of the  shadows.   Regardless of the repercussions of the pandemic, Hispanic and Latino  Americans remain optimistic, filled with love and pride for their  families, communities, and the United States of America. I want to take  this opportunity to thank Hispanic and Latino Americans for their  contributions that have made the United States the country it is today.  I want to thank the hard-working Hispanic and Latino essential workers  who have put their lives at risk to keep our country running during the  pandemic. I want to thank the Hispanic and Latino communities who love  our Nation and strive to change it for the better. Thank you for being  an important part of the American story.                            ____________________     Madam President, I would like to bring to the attention  of colleagues the recent passing of long-time U.S. diplomat George  Southall Vest, III, a long-time resident of Bethesda, MD. He was 102  years old. His career with the State Department spanned the Cold War  era, from 1947 to 1989. As chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, I  want to draw particular attention to Ambassador Vest's representation  of the United States at the initial multilateral discussions of 35  countries that led to an historic summit in Helsinki, Finland, from  July 30 to August 1, 1975, where the Helsinki Final Act was signed.   An all-European summit was not a priority for the United States in  the early 1970s. Indeed, it was a long-standing Soviet proposal, and  Washington was wary of its use to confirm the division of Europe, give  added legitimacy to communist regimes in Eastern Europe, and provide an  opportunity for Moscow to divide the United States from its European  allies. Washington agreed to engage but saw little value in the effort.  As Ambassador Vest himself was quoted as saying, ``This was the first  time after World War II where all the Eastern European countries, all  the Western European countries, together with Canada and the United  States, sat down to talk about security and cooperation . . . I had  very, very few instructions. I was left pretty much to feel my own  way.''   The early work of Ambassador Vest and his team and that of his  immediate successors led to the Helsinki Final Act, which included 10  principles guiding relations between states that serve as a basis, to  this day, of our response to events in Europe, including Russia's  aggression against Ukraine and other neighbors. The Final Act provided  a comprehensive definition of security that includes respect for human  rights and fundamental freedoms, the basis for us to address today's  brutal crackdown on dissent in Belarus and authoritarianism elsewhere.  It also provided for a follow-up to the Final Act with regular reviews  of implementation and development of new norms, a multilateral effort  now represented by today's 57-country Organization for Security and  Cooperation in Europe, with its important institutions and field  missions.   Ambassador Vest, left pretty much to feel his own way, may not have  intended to make such an impact on European security. Keep in mind that  he represented the United States in these negotiations during the  tumultuous time of U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam, an oil crisis on the  horizon, the growing Watergate scandal at home, and a rising Soviet  threat across the globe. Nevertheless, his initial efforts contributed  to an end of the Cold War division of Europe rather than a confirmation  of it. That is quite a turnaround. I should add that the Congress later  played a major role in shaping the U.S. contribution to this result  when it created the Helsinki Commission in 1976. While things have  changed since then, the Commission does now what it did in the late  1970s: ensure that human rights considerations are central to U.S.  foreign policy and U.S. relations with other countries.   Given the challenges we face today, I hope it is useful to remind my  colleagues of Ambassador Vest's legacy as a diplomat. Both before and  after the negotiations, he served in positions in which he worked to  strengthen ties with Europe, including through the NATO alliance and  dialogue with a growing European Union. He was also a mentor to new  generations of American diplomats. All of this followed his combat  service as a forward artillery observer in Europe during World War II.   George Vest joined the Foreign Service in 1947, after using the G.I.  Bill to earn his master's degree in history from the University of  Virginia, where he had received his B.A. in 1941. He served as  Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs under President  Carter and as U.S. Ambassador to the European Union from 1981 to 1985.  His last assignment at the State Department was as Director General of  the Foreign Service. He retired in 1989 as a ``career ambassador,'' a  rank requiring a Presidential nomination and Senate confirmation.   George Vest's father was an Episcopal priest and Vest graduated from  the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, VA, before attending U-Va. He  was as dedicated to his church as he was to our Nation. He served on  the vestry at St. Albans Episcopal Church and volunteered in its  Opportunity (thrift) Shop, both located on the Close of Washington  National Cathedral. He also tutored students in DC public schools. Two  sons, George S. Vest, IV of Fairfax, VA, and Henry Vest of Broomfield,  CO, and two granddaughters survive him. I send my condolences to his  family and thank them for his life of service. Let us be inspired by  Ambassador George Vest and plant our own seeds for a better world  tomorrow.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to sound the alarm on the  national security threat that corruption represents and to echo the  determination made earlier this year by President Biden that corruption  constitutes a core national security threat to the United States.   Along with many colleagues in this body, I have worked long and hard  to fight corruption--which undermines democracy, human rights, and the  rule of law and is behind so many of the persistent problems that we  seek to solve.   The recently released Pandora Papers investigations--coordinated by  the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and involving  150 media outlets, including The Washington Post and the Organized  Crime and Corruption Reporting Project--reveal the astonishing extent  to which questionable financial flows are entering our country and  those of our allies. This warrants further review. Although we had  known that such a system of offshore finance exists, it is still  shocking to see the scale of the corruption, documented in great detail  by emails, contracts, and other documents. Foreign dictators, their  associates, and other foreign officials have stolen untold sums-- billions of dollars--and moved that dirty money into our democracies,  into real estate, bank accounts, trusts, and other financial  instruments.   This is a profound threat to our national security. It hollows out  the rule of law abroad and now it threatens to hollow out the rule of  law at home.   Foreign kleptocrats cannot do this alone. Although kleptocrats may  steal abroad, to taint our political system with that money requires  the assistance of enablers--American lawyers, accountants, trust, and  company service providers, real estate professionals, and the like--who  put aside any moral qualms they may have about working for the enemies  of democracy to obtain a small slice of the illgotten gains.   The Pandora Papers make clear that U.S. enablers apparently play an  outsized role in helping to move stolen assets from dictatorships and  struggling democracies into consolidated democracies--an appalling and  corrupt transference of wealth from those who need it most to those who  have no need at all.   All told, the papers include documents from 206 U.S. trusts in 15  States and Washington, DC, and 22 trustee companies. While there is  obviously much legitimate business to be done in creating and managing  trusts and investments--and we should be careful about overstating or  generalizing without careful examination of each case--it appears that  some Americans may have knowingly played a significant role in  facilitating corruption.   The papers include 300 politicians and public officials from more  than 90 countries and territories--though no Americans and exceedingly  few Western Europeans. This comes as no surprise. The movement of  corrupt money runs east to west, not west to east. It is the tragedy of  the post-Cold War world that corruption has come west along with dirty  money rather than democracy going east. There are names in the papers  that also come as no surprise--Putin cronies Konstantin Ernst and  Gennady Timchenko are both named. Both are included on Alexey Navalny's  list of 35 human rights abusers and kleptocrats. Timchenko is already  under U.S. sanctions, though Ernst is not. Now would be a good time to  consider sanctions on him.   The Aliyevs of Azerbaijan also make an appearance. They collectively  own a real estate empire in London worth $700 million. A Chinese  Communist Party official also was found to have used an offshore  company to trade in U.S. stocks.   However, there is good news. It does not have to be this way. The  triumph of global kleptocracy is not inevitable. We can fight back, and  we are. Never before has there been an American administration so  focused on the countering corruption or a Congress so creative and  aggressive in facing down the threat. President Biden is the first  President ever to declare countering corruption to be a ``core U.S.  national security interest.'' Congress has formed a Caucus against  Foreign Corruption and Kleptocracy. The House recently passed no fewer  than six different counterkleptocracy measures in the National Defense  Authorization Act, which included bills of mine. Now it is incumbent  upon us in the Senate to do the same.   First is the Combating Global Corruption Act that would create a  public and tiered country-by-country reporting requirement on  compliance with international anti-corruption norms and standards.  Those countries in the lowest tier of this report would have their  leadership evaluated for Global Magnitsky sanctions.   Then there is the Global Magnitsky reauthorization that would  reauthorize and enhance these critical sanctions for targeting global  kleptocrats and human rights abusers--exactly the sort of people  identified in the Pandora Papers. I am also proposing a new measure-- and I am introducing it today--that would mandate the administration  evaluate the ``Navalny 35'' for Global Magnitsky sanctions. Russian  opposition leader Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, in a  letter addressed to President Joe Biden earlier this year, called for  the United States to impose sanctions on dozens of Russian oligarchs  and government officials, whom it credibly accuses of political  persecution, human rights abuses, and corruption. I agree with the  Navalny team and urge the administration to move forward on this.   All three of these measures have been included in the House National  Defense Authorization Act, and I urge my colleagues to include them in  the Senate National Defense Authorization Act.   The Pandora Papers are a wake-up call to all who care about the  future of democracy. Thirty years after the end of the Cold War, it is  time for democracies to band together and demand an end to the  unprecedented corruption that has come to be the defining feature of  the global order. We must purge the dirty money from our systems and  deny kleptocrats safe haven.   It will take hard decisions and difficult reforms, but we can do it.  We already have the bipartisan momentum. Now we only have to see it  through.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to sound the alarm on the  national security threat that corruption represents and to echo the  determination made earlier this year by President Biden that corruption  constitutes a core national security threat to the United States.
