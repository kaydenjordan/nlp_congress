 Mr. President, I want to commend Mr. Hawley and Mr. Crapo  for the work they have done here and all of our colleagues and staff  who have contributed to telling this story and the support that I  expect to see today and that I hope will get this across the finish  line.   Almost 80 years ago, New Mexico became ground zero for the detonation  of the first nuclear bomb. Millions of people across the country  traveled to theaters this weekend, and they saw a blockbuster centered  around this infamous date. But not enough people have focused on the  collateral damage caused by our Nation's nuclear weapons testing.  People who sacrificed on behalf of our country for national security  purposes, working day in and day out, in States like Colorado, New  Mexico, Arizona, Missouri, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nevada, Texas,  Oregon, North Dakota, Idaho, Utah, Montana, and others--they deserve  our support.   Folks have traveled to Washington with lung cancer, oral cancer,  asthma, heart problems, begging us to extend and expand the Radiation  Exposure Compensation Act. A few years ago, an elder from the Navajo  Nation traveled here to testify, and she looked us all in the eye, and  she asked a simple question: Are you waiting for us all to die for the  problem to go away?   I ask this body to show these victims compassion, understand their  pain and suffering so that they know it has not gone unnoticed.   I respectfully ask for your vote.   I yield back.
