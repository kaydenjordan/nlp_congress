 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I would like to tell you a story about  North Platte, NE.   During World War II, this small, West Central Nebraska town was one  of the most famous cities in America, and it was the epitome of  homefront patriotism. From Christmas Day 1941 to April 1946, North  Platte was the site of one of the many community-based canteens that  offered hospitality to soldiers on their way to join the fight or on  their way back home.   There were nearly 120 of these canteens across the United States,  mostly along railways, like the Union Pacific line that still runs  through Nebraska. Of these 120 canteens, North Platte was by far the  biggest. It served more than 6 million servicemembers over the 4\1/2\  years it was open. The country's second busiest canteen in Ohio served  well under half that many soldiers over its lifetime.   As many as 24 different troop trains, carrying up to 8,000 uniformed  personnel overall, rolled through North Platte on any given day.   Here is a quote from a local newspaper about what the residents of  just two Nebraska towns, Merna and Anselmo, donated to the North Platte  Canteen on a single day in 1944: 53 birthdays cakes, 127 fried  chickens, 58 dozen homemade cookies, 32 dozen cupcakes, 73 pounds of  coffee, 163 dozen eggs, 68 dozen doughnuts, 41 quarts of pickles, 3  crates of oranges, 9 pounds of ham, 160 loaves of bread, 40 popcorn  balls, and 50 pounds of sandwich meat.   It took 22 cars and 3 pickup trucks to drive all those donations 70  miles west to the train station in North Platte.   Members of the community organized regular benefit dances, scrap  metal drives, and other events to support the canteen's operations. In  all, volunteers raised more than $137,000--worth more than $2 million  today--to support the canteen, and they did it all on their own.   As you might imagine, the soldiers who were fortunate enough to stop  at the North Platte Canteen didn't soon forget the hospitality that  they received.   Russ Fay, a Wisconsinite who was barely old enough to be drafted when  he was shipped off to basic training in California, was one of those  lucky soldiers. More than 60 years after his 10-minute stop in North  Platte, he told journalist Bob Greene, who wrote a book about the North  Platte Canteen called ``Once Upon a Tow'':         I can still taste it. I would say that a majority of the       men on the battlefield know exactly what North Platte was. .       . . They would talk about it like it was a dream. Out of       nowhere, [other soldiers would say]: How'd you like to have       some of that food from the North Platte Canteen right about       now?    The thought of the North Platte Canteen kept our soldiers going  during one of the darkest periods in world history. And more than  55,000 people, nearly all of them women from 125 different communities,  chipped in to help run it at one point or another. Most were  Nebraskans, but many were from our neighboring States of Colorado and  Kansas.   One of those Nebraska women was my mother, Florence Strobel. She  moved from Lincoln to teach kindergarten in North Platte in the fall of  1944, and she was proud to be among the volunteers at the canteen.   To honor everyone who helped give our soldiers a good memory to hold  onto while they were away from home, I recently introduced the North  Platte Canteen Congressional Gold Medal Act.   This bill would award a collective Congressional Gold Medal to all of  the individuals and communities that volunteered or donated food and  other items to the North Platte Canteen. This is the highest honor  Congress can give civilians, and the tens of thousands of people who  made America's busiest World War II canteen a success are certainly  deserving of it.   Under my bill, after the Treasury Department strikes this  Congressional Gold Medal, it would be on display at the Lincoln County  Historical Museum in North Platte, which has an outstanding exhibit  about the canteen.   This wouldn't be the first time that Congress has given the  volunteers at the North Platte Canteen the recognition they deserve.  Almost 20 years ago, the 108th Congress acknowledged their efforts with  a resolution introduced by Nebraska Representative Tom Osborne. I hope  the 117th Congress will do so, as well, by passing this bill.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
