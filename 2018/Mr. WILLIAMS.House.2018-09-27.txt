 Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to take a moment to  recognize a special group of veterans from Hays County in the 25th  District of Texas that will all board an Honor Flight to our Nation's  Capital today.   For those who don't know, the purpose of an Honor Flight is to  transport American veterans to Washington, D.C., to visit the memorials  dedicated to honor their service and their sacrifices.   On this particular flight, we will have 6 World War II veterans, 18  Korean war veterans, and 17 Vietnam war veterans from central Texas.  The flight is named in honor of Bill Kolbe, who was a World War II  veteran who served in the Army Air Corps.   As the representative of the veterans on this Honor Flight, I would  like to take this opportunity to simply say we thank them, and we love  them. We thank them for so selflessly serving this great Nation and for  being the heroes we so desperately need today.   Being able to serve these warfighters in Congress is one of my  greatest honors, and I will continue to do everything I can to support  our veterans in Hays County and around the Nation.   God bless our veterans, and God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I take this time to speak about a piece of  legislation on the floor tomorrow, H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and  Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018.  [[Page H9140]]    This is the third and final bill of the tax reform 2.0 package that  Republicans have been working so hard on. As the constituents of Texas'  25th District know, I have been fighting for a commonsense business  owners' perspective on tax reform since day one.   Less than a year ago, we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since  then, there are more jobs; Americans are seeing higher wages; and Main  Street can finally breathe again.   While all this is great, there has always been the uncertainty of  knowing that these cuts would expire in 2025, something I have been  fighting to change.   I am happy to report that with tax reform 2.0, tax cuts will be made  permanent for families, workers, and small-business owners across this  country.   Regrettably, Mr. Speaker, I will be unable to cast my vote in favor  for tax reform 2.0 tomorrow. My youngest daughter, Sabrina, is getting  married. While I have a duty as a United States Congressman, I first  have a duty as a father and would not miss her wedding day for anything  in the world. I hope everyone understands my decision back home and  here.   This vote is historic, and I am excited to watch this economy  flourish to grow because of it.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
