 Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, I held a Congress  on Your Corner in Tucson, Arizona. I met face-to-face with my  constituents at a supermarket. They shared their grave concerns over  the President's words and actions.   One woman had never attended an event like this, but she stopped by  to tell me she was terrified of losing her health insurance. Another  woman was concerned about how inaction on climate change would impact  her children.   No one President can solve every issue, but we need a President that  unifies and fights for America's future, not divides us by party,  economic status, or the country we were born in.   President Trump's address on Tuesday was more of the same. He doubled  down on his divisive and destructive agenda with blatant lies. Time and  again, he has failed the middle class and misinformed the public from  the power pulpit. The President didn't even utter a word about climate  change, and he mischaracterized activity at the border.   But I am listening, and I am here to work. I am focused on investing  in hardworking families and fighting for people, not corporations. We  will have votes on the floor this week that prove our investment in and  care for these issues.                            ____________________
