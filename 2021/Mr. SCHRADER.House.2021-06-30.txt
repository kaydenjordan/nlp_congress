 Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the energy and commerce  provisions in the INVEST in America Act.   I would like to speak briefly about the surface transportation side.  An amendment I have in there adds a goal to the Highway Bridge  Replacement and Rehabilitation Program that these investments increase  the resiliency of bridges, including the ability to withstand  disruptions from a seismic event.   The Pacific Northwest is due for a major seismic event, and our  communities need to be able to take the necessary steps to ensure our  infrastructure can withstand these disasters. This amendment will make  that a possibility and ensure that projects focusing on seismic  resiliency are prioritized by the U.S. Department of Transportation  when they submit applications.   In my district, Interstate 205 is set for a massive retrofitting to  improve the vital passenger and freight corridor and mitigate the awful  congestion many of our communities currently face.   One of the key components of this project is to retrofit the  Abernathy Bridge and make it seismically resilient. This bridge is a  critical span over the Willamette River and will be essential in the  event of a major disaster to coordinate first responders and supplies  to affected Oregonians.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to offer the amendment.
