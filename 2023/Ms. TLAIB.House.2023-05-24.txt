 Mr. Speaker, our profit-driven healthcare system is  killing us. It is outrageous that the wealthiest country in the history  of the world cannot guarantee healthcare for its people.   Our for-profit healthcare system, fueled by corporate greed, has  failed us while enriching Big Pharma at the direct expense of everyday  Americans.   Currently, more than 30 million Americans don't have health  insurance, and many live in constant fear of losing their jobs, and  along with it, their healthcare.   Every human being--every single one--has a basic fundamental right to  healthcare. That doesn't change if you are rich or if you are poor.  Healthcare, again, is a human right, not a privilege.   In the richest country on Earth, no family should ever face financial  ruin because they got sick. No one should be forced to choose between  putting food on the table or receiving lifesaving treatment. No one  should have to die because they are unable to afford care.   Congress must take bold action to transform our dysfunctional, broken  healthcare system from one based on exploitation to one that  prioritizes human dignity.    I am proud to join my colleagues in fighting to pass Medicare for  All.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I hope the American people are watching this  shameful act to halt assistance on student debt for millions of  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of people who will benefit from President  Biden's student relief make less than $75,000. To  [[Page H2569]]  my good colleague from Texas, as he says, these folks making all of  these difficult decisions, how about this: Why don't those folks who  took out PPP loans over there, who got it completely forgiven, give  that money back?   You are asking teachers, firefighters, all who are drowning in  education debt, who will benefit from a public service loan forgiveness  program, to pay it back while they are serving our country in all  different forms, reverse it all, and pay the interest back as well. Let  them struggle and suffer while, again, they are educating our children  and protecting our communities.   This is all happening, Mr. Speaker, while the far-right Republicans  have filed a sham lawsuit to take it before an unhinged, corrupt  Supreme Court that has secretly accepted lavish trips and payments from  billionaire Republican mega-donors while considering striking down  student debt relief.   Now, our Republican colleagues, including many who took out over $20  million in PPP loans during the pandemic when everybody was suffering-- that were completely forgiven--want to hurt fellow Americans who aren't  wealthy like they are. They want to repeal the President's student debt  relief program that has changed the lives of 43 million Americans for  the better.   Under President Biden's debt relief program alone, in Michigan over  1.3 million residents were helped with the burden of crushing student  debt.   I don't know, Mr. Speaker. Maybe they are doing this because student  relief is tied to racial justice. We know that more than 20 million  borrowers will be completely debt free and one in four of them are  Black borrowers.   Our communities have been denied the ability to build generational  wealth for far too long, targeted by police violence, systemic racism,  and an economic system that is fueled by corporate greed.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow the same Republicans who had millions of  dollars in PPP loans forgiven to repeal student debt relief. The  hypocrisy is disgusting.
