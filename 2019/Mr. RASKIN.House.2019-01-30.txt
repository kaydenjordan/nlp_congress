 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 87 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 87         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 790) to provide for a pay increase in 2019 for       certain civilian employees of the Federal Government, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Oversight and Reform. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. The amendment printed in part A of the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution shall be       considered as adopted in the House and in the Committee of       the Whole. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. No further amendment to the bill, as       amended, shall be in order except those printed in part B of       the report of the Committee on Rules.

All points of order against such further       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill, as amended, to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and       on any further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  It shall be in order at any time through the       legislative day of February 8, 2019, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or her designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or his designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 87, providing for consideration of  H.R. 790, the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of  2019.   The rule provides for consideration of the legislation under a  structured rule. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment, which  strikes section 3 of the bill and makes certain other technical  corrections to it.   The rule makes in order three amendments. The rule provides 1 hour of  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking  member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. Finally, the rule  provides suspension authority through the legislative day of February  8, 2019.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 790 will provide for a 2.6 percent pay increase for  Federal civilian workers in 2019, beginning with the date of passage,  and this brings the civilian pay increase in parity with the automatic  adjustment of pay for military servicemembers, which is also 2.6  percent.   The President's fiscal year 2019 budget requested a 2.6 percent  increase in basic pay for military servicemembers equivalent to the  statutory formula. This increase went into effect on January 1. But on  August 30 of last year, President Trump announced that he would issue a  downward adjustment of the pay increase for civilian employees because  of a national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the  general welfare. He proposed to set the civilian pay increase at zero,  no raise.   On December 28 of last year, he followed through on this announcement  by signing an executive order overriding the automatic 2.1 percent pay  increase civilian workers were set to receive and replacing it with  zero. Congress can override and Congress should override this executive  order with legislation providing for a pay increase for our hardworking  Federal civilian workers. H.R. 790 does just that with a reasonable 2.6  percent increase, matching the increase going into effect for military  servicemembers.   Mr. Speaker, if there is any redeeming feature to the sordid chaos of  the 35-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, surely, it  is that it reminded America that our Federal workforce is indispensable  to our commerce, to our economy, to our society, and to our way of  life.   We have been reminded that if you take away the air traffic  controllers, you take away air travel. If you take away the  Transportation Security Administration agents, you take away  transportation security.   If you take away the Park Service rangers and the Park Service  maintenance personnel, you take away our ability to enjoy the national  parks free of liter, garbage, backed-up sewage, and criminal activity.   If you take away the food safety inspectors from the FDA and other  agencies, you threaten the food supply with E. coli, salmonella, and  insect infestation.   If you shut down the EPA, you empower the polluters to foul the air  and dirty the waters.   If you shut down the Department of Justice, you throw a monkey wrench  into the ability of law enforcement to go after the Mafia, Medicare  fraud, white-collar crime, human trafficking, and all of the criminal  enterprises endangering public safety.   If you shut down the National Weather Service, you threaten  transportation, travel, and public safety.   If you stop paying Customs and Border Protection officers, you weaken  border security and you demoralize our Border Patrol.   If you shut down NOAA, you disable America's first responders in the  campaign to meet the challenges of climate change.   All of it has an effect on the private sector, too. If you furlough  the people writing checks for home mortgages, farm subsidies, State  Department personnel, and private contractor payments, you threaten to  ruin private contractors, home purchases, small farmers, and small  businesses.   If you were to cut off the VA, you would cut off the veterans.   And if you were to pull the plug on the Social Security  Administration, you would threaten tens of millions of Americans who  depend on Social Security.   The contribution that more than 2.1 million Federal employees make to  our country is indispensable; it is incalculable; and it is  irreplaceable.   Mr. Speaker, throughout the 35-day self-identified Donald Trump  shutdown, the American people not only witnessed the surpassing  dedication and patriotism of the Federal workforce, 30 percent of which  is made up of veterans, but we were reminded of the critical nature of  the work that they do for all of us. They deserve a raise, and we  should override President Trump's insulting and embarrassing 2019 pay  freeze for the Federal workforce.   To be clear, Federal workers deserved a raise before the shutdown.  The Federal Salary Council, an advisory body of the executive branch  established to provide recommendations on locality pay, found at the  end of last year that, ``Federal employee salaries on average lag  behind those of the private sector by almost 31 percent,'' a finding  based on U.S. Department of Labor data covering more than 250 different  occupational categories.  [[Page H1290]]    900,000 Federal workers earn less than $60,000 a year, and we have  seen in the soup kitchens and in the pantries, and the desperate pleas  of our constituents for their families, how many Federal workers are  just one or two paychecks away from disaster.    So Federal workers deserved a raise before the shutdown when 800,000  of them were furloughed or compelled to go to work without any pay and  they had to take out loans from family members or credit unions just to  pay their monthly bills.   They deserved a raise before President Trump imposed the Federal  hiring freeze in 2017 and before he froze Federal worker pay in 2019.   They deserved a raise before he tried to cut their health benefits  and before he issued three executive orders that would have made it  easier to fire Federal workers and destroy their collective bargaining  rights, orders that were promptly struck down in Federal court.   But if the Federal workers deserved a raise and needed one before  President Trump declared war on the workforce for the American  Government, before Steve Bannon defined the goal of the administration  as ``deconstruction of the administrative state,'' before they were  derided by the President as Democrats and vilified as the deep state,  surely, the economic and moral debacle of the shutdown makes this  modest 2.6 percent pay raise a powerful and inescapable imperative  today.   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government simply must do much better as an  employer of our own people. How many private employers would try to  retain their best workers and attract great new workers by attacking  and furloughing the workforce, by accusing the employees of disloyalty,  by freezing their pay, and then by compelling them to work for 35 days  with no salary at all? It would never work for the vast majority of  private-sector employers.   All over America, we read of workers demoralized and defeated,  thinking of leaving their Federal jobs because of the sheer folly and  cruelty of this most recent episode and because the President, I am  sorry to report, is again threatening another shutdown with nothing but  complicity from many of our friends across the aisle.   On top of all the anxiety induced by the shutdown, we know that  between 30 and 35 percent of the Federal workforce is eligible to  retire within the next 5 years. How will we replace them and replenish  the ranks of this embattled and besieged workforce?   These are our people, Mr. Speaker. These are our workers. These are  our constituents. These are the people who make America work.   Federal workers do not live the lifestyles of the rich and famous.  They don't jet down to Mar-a-Lago at personal or government expense.  And they can't afford the $36 cheeseburger at the Trump Hotel.   The Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, will never be able to figure  out why they can't just call up a friendly banker for a loan, just as  Lara Trump will not be able to see why the 35-day shutdown caused  something more than an eentsy-weentsy ``little bit of pain'' for them  as they are invited to suffer in service of the greater glory of the  Trump administration agenda.   Our public servants, civilian and military alike, deserve better from  us, whether they work as a civilian officer or uniformed officer at the  Pentagon; whether they are safeguarding air travel or the air or the  water or the climate or our food supply; whether they are taking care  of our treasured national parks; or treating breast cancer patients or  finding the cure for cystic fibrosis or multiple sclerosis; or running  our museums; or cutting Social Security checks; or preparing the  President's meals at the White House; or guarding the coastline with  the Coast Guard; or making the justice system work as judges,  prosecutors, defenders, clerks, and marshals. They deserve better from  us.   They need a pay raise, not a pay freeze. They deserve our respect,  not our contempt. They don't ask to be deified, but they don't deserve  to be demonized.   They have an important job to do. Let's pay them for it. Let's invest  in our Federal workforce. I urge all of our colleagues to come together  to pass H.R. 790, the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act  of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my dear friend from Georgia for his  thoughtful comments, especially for conceding that the Federal workers  do deserve a paycheck at the end of the week, and I am glad that we can  start off a new season here where we agree that Federal workers deserve  and need to be paid. I suppose we still have this difference about  whether or not they deserve a pay raise.   Yes, the substance is clear. We are fighting for a 2.6 percent pay  raise for the Federal civilian workforce to match the 2.6 percent pay  raise that has gone into effect for the military servicemembers who are  serving our country with their hard work and their sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, our message is clear. There is a message that is built  into there, because when you are deciding whether or not to give your  workers a raise or give them a pay freeze or you are deciding whether  or not to praise them or to compel them to work for free for 35 days or  to furlough them, there is a message built into that. So we are the  employer of these 2 million people who have come to work for the  Federal Government, and there is a message there.   It is not just the money for their families, it is not just the money  to pay the mortgage and to pay the rent and for the car bills and for  the food bills and for health insurance and so on. There is a message  there, and the message is simple: we stand with the Federal workers.   That is the message. We embrace that message that is built into the  pay raise here.   But I have to disagree with my friend if he says that all we are  doing is sending that message that we stand with the Federal workers.  That is not all we are doing, we are giving them a pay raise they  deserve. We have got tens of thousands of people who work at the  Pentagon who go dressed as military servicemembers every day, and we  have tens of thousands who go dressed as civilians, they work side by  side, and they work together for the country.   Shouldn't they all get a pay raise?   Don't all of them deserve a pay raise?   Now, Mr. Speaker, my friend invites us to believe that because we are  giving the workforce a pay raise, we can't continue to implement civil  service rules that are meant to get rid of the rare bad apple that you  get in the Federal workforce.   Why not?   Why can't we use the other mechanisms that are in place to reward  workers?   If we want to improve those, then I am so happy to work with my  friend on the Rules Committee to develop legislation to do that. But I  am afraid that is an irrelevant distraction from the matter at hand.  The matter at hand today is whether or not we are going to give the  same pay raise to civilian workers that we have given to military  workers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman from Georgia has given me a lot to think about here.   The very first thing that I need to clear up is that 85 percent of  the Federal workforce does not live in the national capital region. It  is true that the local delegations from Maryland and Virginia and the  District of Columbia are sensitive to these continuing assaults on the  Federal workforce because we have so many workers who live here, but,  again, 85 percent of the workforce lives all over the country.   I just learned that there are 100,000 civilian Federal workers in  Georgia who also were affected by this government shutdown and lockout  of the Federal workers, and I am sure the distinguished gentleman from  Georgia heard the same kinds of complaints from his constituents that I  heard from mine about not being able to balance their checkbooks, not  being able to pay the mortgage or pay the rent because of what took  place with the shutdown.   The President froze Federal worker pay without any hearings. The  President froze Federal worker pay without any markups, and he did it  without consulting any of us. That is something that he did.   Now, of course, we know that the 115th Congress, the last Congress,  became famous--or perhaps I should say infamous--for being the most  closed Congress in U.S. history, bringing us the most number of closed  rules on the floor, shutting down debate, bringing us so many bills  without hearings or markup.   We would have loved to have been able to have hearings and markup for  this bill, but the Committee on Oversight and Reform wasn't organized  until yesterday. We are all recovering from the shocks of the Federal  Government shutdown. We are all trying to catch our breath from what  has been imposed on the country. We have been consumed entirely with  the question of the government shutdown.   So when the new rules come into focus and are activated on March 1,  which is when they are supposed to come in, we have every intention of  being a dramatically more open Congress than what we saw in the last  Congress.   But we appreciate the push from our friends. They should give us the  push. Certainly, they know what it is like to close down debate because  they did it for so many years.   Now I understand they are suggesting, as a substitute resolution,  what they want instead is a prohibition on raises for Federal employees  with delinquent tax debt.   It is very clear that the Federal civilian workforce is graded on an  annual basis, and you can get five different kinds of rankings. These  are dealt with in the promotion process, in all kinds of personnel  actions, including exclusion and separation in cases of delinquency  where Federal workers are not performing. So the idea that the Federal  civil service has existed all of this time without the ability to have  incentives and disincentives and sanctions for nonperformance is, of  course, quite apart from reality.   I am amazed that my friends would be immodest enough to raise the  question of taxes in their opposition to this legislation. The first  problem, of course, is that they passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut for the  wealthiest corporations and people in America--$1.5 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, a trillion dollars is a thousand billion dollars.   So they piled what it is going to be a $1.9 trillion addition to our  national debt over the next decade, at least. The  [[Page H1293]]  Congressional Budget Office estimates that it adds at least $1.9  trillion to our debt, yet they come back and say that they don't want  to give a 2.6 percent pay increase to our Federal workers, who were  just furloughed or compelled to go to work with no pay for the last 35  days.    Prohibition on raises for Federal employees with delinquent tax debt,  that is their attempt to distract everybody from the pay raise that  America's Federal workforce needs.   What about the President of the United States? What about his taxes?  Are they finally going to support release of President Trump's taxes,  which is what the last four decades of Presidents, Republicans and  Democrats alike, have done?   No. They maintain a demure and respectful silence towards the  President on that one. They are not interested in the President  releasing his taxes, but they want to use the fact that maybe there is  a Federal worker who wasn't able to pay his or her taxes as  justification for not giving America's Federal workforce a pay raise.  That is quite remarkable to me, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My friend from Georgia eloquently calls us back to bipartisanship,  and I could not agree more. I would love nothing more than for him and  for all of our colleagues across the aisle to join us in supporting the  2.6 percent pay raise for America's Federal workforce.   I almost feel as though, if we were to add the names of our  distinguished colleagues on the other side to the bill, they might  support it. So I would reopen that offer and restate that offer: We  invite everybody to come on and to be cosponsors with us in giving  America's Federal workforce a pay raise right now.    But we do have to think about this in bipartisan-nonpartisan terms.   It was the President of the United States who maligned the Federal  workforce, apparently, from his perspective, by calling them Democrats,  and there are two problems with that.   One, it is not true. I have got lots of Republicans who work as  Federal employees. I have got lots of Independents who work as Federal  employees, as well as Democrats, as well as Greens, as well as people  who are not affiliated with any party at all and are probably sick of a  lot of the partisanship that goes on here in Washington.   Think about what the real problem with the President deriding Federal  workers as Democrats is. The real problem is that they are Americans.  We are all Americans. We stand together as Americans. That is why we  have got to stand behind our Federal workforce.   I want to just clear up one other thing that has been bugging me,  because the gentleman from Georgia is so persuasive in his tactics, and  he kind of mixed apples and oranges.   We are talking about a pay raise for the workforce, and he said:  Well, maybe most of the workers deserve one, but there might be some  who don't.   I just want to state generally what the procedure is for evaluating  Federal workers. Federal agencies use formal performance-rating  programs for almost all of their career employees, typically with five  different levels. The ratings are used in deciding on promotions, merit  pay increases, cash awards, or discipline.                                time  1000    In the most severe cases, low-performing employees can be disciplined  and removed from their jobs.   Now, the gentleman, I am sure, has some ideas for how we can improve  that system and make it better. By all means, let's discuss that, but  let's not cloud the issue of the fact that our workers need a raise.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, the amendment printed in section 4 shall be in       order as though printed as the last amendment in part B of       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution if offered by Representative Woodall of Georgia or       a designee.  [[Page H1294]]       That amendment shall be debatable for 10 minutes equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent.        Sec. 4. The amendment referred to in section 3 is as       follows:        At the end of the bill, add the following:       SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON RAISE FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEE WITH                     DELINQUENT TAX DEBT         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, including any other provision of this Act, during       calendar year 2019 any Federal employee with delinquent tax       debt may not receive a salary increase.        (b) Definition of Delinquent Tax Debt.--In this section,       the term ``delinquent tax debt''--        (1) means a Federal tax liability that--        (A) has been assessed by the Secretary of the Treasury       under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and        (B) may be collected by the Secretary by levy or by a       proceeding in court; and        (2) does not include a debt that is being paid in a timely       manner pursuant to an agreement under section 6159 or section       7122 of such Code.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
