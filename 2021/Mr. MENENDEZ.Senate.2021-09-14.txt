However, these articles are being provided from U.S.       Army stock. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       conjunction with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Georgia.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 21-48       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Javelin Weapon System is a medium-range, man       portable, shoulder-launched, fire and forget, anti-tank       system for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. It may       also be mounted on a variety of platforms including vehicles,       aircraft and watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds and       has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 meters. The system is       highly lethal against tanks and other systems with       conventional and reactive armors. The system possesses a       secondary capability against bunkers.        2. Javelin's key technical feature is the use of fire-and-      forget technology, which allows the gunner to fire and       immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special       features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an       advanced tandem warhead and imaging infrared seeker, target       lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or       covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a       minimum smoke motor, thus decreasing its detection on the       battlefield.        3. The Javelin Weapon System is comprised of two major       tactical components, which are a reusable Command Launch Unit       (CLU) and a round contained in a disposable launch tube       assembly. The CLU incorporates an integrated day-night sight       that provides a target engagement capability in adverse       weather and countermeasure environments. The CLU may also be       used in a stand-alone mode for battlefield surveillance and       target detection. The CLU's thermal sight is a second       generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor. To       facilitate initial loading and subsequent updating of       software, all on-board missile software is uploaded via the       CLU after mating and prior to launch.        4. The missile is autonomously guided to the target using       an imaging infrared seeker and adaptive correlation tracking       algorithms. This allows the gunner to take cover or reload       and engage another target after firing a missile. The missile       has an advanced tandem warhead and can be used in either the       top attack or direct fire modes (for target undercover). An       onboard flight computer guides the missile to the selected       target.        5. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that Georgia can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This       proposed sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Georgia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  [[Page S6486]]  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The       total estimated cost was $300 million. There was no Major       Defense Equipment (MDE) associated with this sale.        This transmittal reports the addition of non-MDE follow-on       support for the C-17 fleet to include aircraft and engine       hardware and software modification and support; contractor       logistics support, with further participation in the       Globemaster III Integrated Sustainment Program (GISP),       Globemaster III Sustainment Contract (G3SC), Material       Improvement Program (MIP), and Over and Above (O&A).        The total value of new non-MDE follow-on support is $170       million. This results in a revised total non-MDE value of       $470 million. The total case value will increase to $470       million.        (iv) Significance: This notification is provided as the       additional non-MDE follow-on support was not enumerated in       the original notification. The proposed articles and services       will support the NATO Support and Procurement Agency to       create appropriate line items to capture, execute, and easily       reconcile the anticipated price increase of the upcoming C-17       sustainment contract. This program flies missions in and       around Europe, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Levant, and North       Africa.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security of the United States by       helping to improve the security of NATO allies and partner       nations that are an important force for ensuring peace and       stability in Europe.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION               Greece--F-16 Sustainment Materiel and Services         The Government of Greece has requested to buy U.S.       Government and contractor engineering, technical, and       logistics support services for F-16 Aircraft Structural       Integrity Program (ASIP), F-16 Aircrew Training Device (ATD),       Low Altitude Targeting and Infrared for Night (LANTIRN), and       Reconnaissance (RECCE) Pods support programs; aircraft       classified and unclassified aircraft software and software       support; Multifunctional Information Distribution System       (MIDS) software support; Joint Mission Planning Software       (JMPS) support; participation in Electronic Combat       International Security Assistance Program (ECISAP),       International Engine Management Program (IEMP), and technical       coordination groups; other aircraft and engine hardware and       software modifications and support; spare and repair/return       parts and equipment; personnel training and training       equipment; publications, manuals, and technical       documentation; and other related elements of aircraft       maintenance and program support. The total estimated value is       $270 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the security of a NATO ally, which is an important       partner for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Greece's capability to meet       current and future threats by providing agile logistics       support to its F-16 program, encompassing aspects of aircrew       training and aircraft maintenance. The ability to provide       this level of support to the F-16 program will increase its       inter-operability with NATO forces and enhance its ability to       provide for security of its borders.  [[Page S6487]]       Greece has demonstrated a continued commitment to modernizing       its military and will have no difficultly absorbing this       additional sustainment support into its armed forces.

The principal contractors for this proposed sale are L3/      Harris International, Melbourne, Florida; Lockheed-Martin       Aero Corporation, Fort Worth, Texas; Collins Aerospace,       Charlotte, North Carolina; Northrop Grumman Corporation,       Falls Church, Virginia; Raytheon Company, Waltham,       Massachusetts; and Atec, Incorporated, Houston, Texas.

Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives outside the United States.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                    Japan--AEGIS Class Destroyer Support         The Government of Japan has requested to buy Follow-On       Technical Support (FOTS) of AEGIS Class Destroyers, to       include sustainment support and services; AEGIS computer       software updates, system integration and testing, in-country       and on-site engineering support; familiarization,       sustainment, and all necessary emergent support engineering       and technical support services; operational support; system       overhauls; system upgrades; on-the-job practical operations       and maintenance; combat systems integration; development,       testing, installation of program patches and adaptation data       and annual service agreements; technical inquiries by the       purchaser; operation; integration; maintenance; field service       engineering; problem investigation; technical assistance;       solutions to the technical problems arising from post       production, testing capabilities and support, U.S. Government       and contractor technical assistance, and other related       elements of logistics and program support. The total       estimated program cost is $134 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a major ally that is a force for       political stability and economic progress in the Asia-Pacific       region. It is vital to U.S. national interest to assist Japan       in developing and maintaining a strong and effective self-      defense capability.        The proposed sale is critical to ensure Japan Maritime Self       Defense Force's (JMSDF) Aegis Destroyer fleet and the       Japanese Computer Program Test Sites (JCPTS) remain ready to       provide capabilities in the defense of Japan. Specifically,       the requested CPM services will provide JMSDF with software       patches and adaptation data support that are vital to the       effective and safe operations of the Aegis Combat Systems       (ACS) suite. The in-country engineering and emergent support       will assist JMSDF to address any malfunctions or faults that       may arise with the ACS suite. Japan will have no difficulty       absorbing these services and support into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the       basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin       Corporation, Moorestown, NJ. There are no known offset       agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       temporary assignment of five (5) U.S. Government and two (2)       contractor representatives to Japan.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

Transmittal No. 21-44       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Paladin M109A6 howitzer is the fifth product       improvement to the original M109 self-propelled howitzer. It       features improvements in the areas of survivability;       reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM);       responsiveness; and terminal effects. The M109A6 is an       armored, full tracked howitzer carrying 37 complete       conventional rounds and two Copperhead projectiles and is       operated by a crew of four. It is designed with a new turret       structure that facilitates integration of the various turret       improvements and vulnerability reduction measures. It       improves overall crew compartment layout and space. The       howitzer can travel at a maximum speed of 38 miles per hour       and has a maximum cruising range of 186 miles. The M109A6 can       operate independently, on the move, it can receive a fire       mission, compute firing data, select and take up its firing       position, automatically unlock and point its cannon, fire and       move--all without external technical assistance. Firing the       first round following a move in under 60 seconds, a ``shoot       and scoot'' capability protects the crew from counterbattery       fire. The M109A6 is capable of firing up to four rounds per       minute to ranges of 30 kilometers. The M109A6 features       increased survivability characteristics such as day/night       operability, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) protection       with climate control and secure voice and digital       communications. The crew remains in the vehicle throughout       the mission.        2. The Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) component provides       the vehicle with its own position location utilizing sensors       that continuously calculates its direction and velocity       without the continuous dependency of a GPS; the INU receives       GPS data from an external GPS receiver as an input when       available to provide better precision. The INU allows the       vehicle to more precisely calculate its position to other       components in the vehicle to improve its functions and safety       of use; these functions include movement and maneuver of the       vehicle, movement of the turret, and pointing of the gun       tube.        3. The Electronic Fire Control System (EFCS) commonly       referred to as the Paladin Fire Control System (PFCS) is the       major change for the Paladin M109A6 Howitzer from the manual       fire control system used on the M109A5. This gives the       howitzer the ability to operate over a widely dispersed area       and to move and emplace using the on board fire control       navigation and GPS system. The MI09A6 can move and position       within an assigned position area, process technical firing       data, and fire a mission without relying on aiming circles       and wire lines. The M109A6 can change position more       frequently, an advantage against enemy fire. Such       advancements give new meaning to the artillery's ability to       move, shoot and communicate. In addition, the EFCS with       embedded electronic diagnostics improves maintenance and       repair functions by assisting in pinpointing faults.        4. The Defense Advanced GPS (Global Positioning System)       Receiver (DAGR) is a lightweight (less than 2 pounds) hand-      held or host platform-mounted, dual frequency (L1/L2),       Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) based,       Precise Positioning Service (PPS) device that receives and       decodes the L1 and L2 signals-in-space which are transmitted       by the NAVSTAR GPS satellite constellation. The DAGR provides       real-time positioning, velocity (ground speed), navigation,       and timing (PVNT) information, in standalone (dismounted) and       mounted (ground facilities, sea, air, and land vehicles)       configurations. The DAGR can support missions involving land-      based war-fighting and non-war fighting operations. The DAGR       can also be used as a secondary or supplemental aid to       aviation-based missions which involve operations in low-      dynamic aircraft, and as an aid to navigation in water-borne       operations.        5. The M1156 Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a Global       Positioning System (GPS) Guidance Kit with fuzing functions       for the M795 and M549A1 155mm High Explosive (HE) Artillery       Projectiles. The PGK corrects the ballistic trajectory of the       projectile to reduce delivery errors and thus improves       projectile accuracy. The PGK will effectively reduce target       delivery error of conventional artillery munitions and reduce       the number of projectiles required to execute a fire mission.        6. The 155mm M232Al Propelling Charge (DODIC DA13), will be       used in M109 series howitzers. The Modular Artillery Charge       System (MACS) consists of two propelling charge module types,       the M231 and the M232/M232A1, and their associated packaging.       The system is compatible with all current and planned 155mm       field artillery weapons.        7. The M82 Percussion Primer (DODIC N523) will be used in       M109 series howitzers.        8. The International Field Artillery Tactical Data System       is the international export version of the Army's Advanced       Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). It provides       networked and fully automated support for the planning,       coordination, control, and execution of fires and effects       such as mortars, field artillery, rockets and missiles, and       close air support. International versions are developed for       each customer unique to the weapon and targeting systems in       their inventory.        9. Field Artillery Ammunition Support Vehicle (FAASV)       M992A2 this ammunition vehicle has no turret, but has a       taller superstructure to store 95 rounds with a corresponding       number of powders and primers. Until recently, much of the       remaining internal crew space was taken up by a hydraulically       powered conveyor system designed to allow the quick uploading       of rounds or their transfer to the M109-series howitzer.        10. Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift and       Evacuation System (HERCULES) Improved Recovery Vehicle--M88A2       recovers tanks mired to different depths removes and replaces       tank turrets and power packs, and uprights overturned heavy       combat vehicles. The main winch of the M88A2 is capable of a       70-ton, single-line recovery, allowing the HERCULES to       provide recovery of the 70-Ton M1A2 Abrams Tank.        11. The A-frame boom and hoist winch of the M88A2 can lift       35 tons. The spade can be used to anchor the vehicle when       using the main winch and can be used for light earth moving       to prepare a recovery area. The M88A2 employs an auxiliary       power unit to provide auxiliary electrical and hydraulic       power when the main engine is not in operation. It can also       be used to slave start other vehicles, as well as a means to       refuel or defuel vehicles. The M88A2 can refuel Abrams tanks       from its own fuel tank.        12. The Browning M2 is an air-cooled, belt-fed machine gun.       The M2 fires from a closed bolt, operated on the short recoil       principle. The M2 fires the .50 BMG cartridge, which offers       long range, accuracy, and immense stopping power.        13. The highest level of classification of defense       articles, components, and services included in this potential       sale is SECRET.        14. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        15. A determination has been made that the recipient can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        16. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the recipient.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

Transmittal No. 21-54       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance       kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into an       accurate, adverse weather ``smart'' munition. The Guidance       Set consists of a Tail Kit, which contains the Inertial       Navigation System (INS) and a Global Positioning System       (GPS), a set of Aerosurfaces and an umbilical cover, which       allows the JDAM to improve the accuracy of unguided, General       Purpose bombs. The JDAM weapon can be delivered from modest       standoff ranges at high or low altitudes against a variety of       land and surface targets during the day or night. The JDAM is       capable of receiving target coordinates via preplanned       mission data from the delivery aircraft, by onboard aircraft       sensors (i.e., FLIR, Radar, etc.) during captive carry, or       from a third-party source via manual or automated aircrew       cockpit entry. The Guidance Set, when combined with a warhead       and appropriate fuze, forms a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit (GBU).        (a) The KMU-572 is the tail kit for a GBU-38 500LB JDAM.        (b) The KMU-556 is the tail kit for a GBU-31 2,000LB Mk-84       (General Purpose bomb body) JDAM.        (c) The KMU-557 is the tail kit for a GBU-31/-56 2,000LB       BLU-109 (General Purpose bomb body) JDAM.        2. The Laser JDAM (GBU-56) is a 2,000LB JDAM that       incorporates all the capabilities of the JDAM guidance tail       kit and adds a DSU-42/B precision laser guidance set. The       DSU-42/B sensor gives the weapon system an optional semi-      active laser seeker. The addition of the DSU-42/B laser       sensor combined with additional cabling and mounting hardware       turns a GBU-31 JDAM into a GBU-56 LJDAM. The DSU-42/B       consists of a laser spot tracker, a cable connecting the DSU-      42/B to the basic JDAM guidance set, a cable cover, cable       cover tie-down straps, modified tail kit door and wiring       harness, and associated modified JDAM software that       incorporates navigation and guidance flight software to       support both LJDAM and standard JDAM missions. The DSU-42/B       adds the flexibility to strike targets of opportunity,       including mobile and moving targets, to an already accurate       adverse weather GPS/INS guided JDAM.        3.

Transmittal No. 0S-21       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(A), AECA)        (i) Purchaser: Government of Spain.        (ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 10-60; Date:       September 29, 2010; Military Department: Navy.        (iii) Description: On September 29, 2010, Congress was       notified by Congressional certification transmittal number       10-60, of the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the       Arms Export Control Act of (6) SH-60F Multi-Mission Utility       Helicopters being offered as Excess Defense Articles, (13)       T700-GE-401C engines (12 installed and 1 spare), inspection       and modifications, spare and repairs parts, support       equipment, personnel training and training equipment,       publications and technical documentation, U.S. Government and       contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support       services, and other related logistics and program support.       The estimated total cost was $155 million. Major Defense       Equipment (MDE) constituted $47 million of this total.        On July 28, 2017, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 0K-17 of the inclusion of       four (4) Embedded Global Positioning Units/Inertial       Navigation Systems (EGI) with GPS Selective Availability       Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) and three (3) AN/AAR-47E(V)2       (one (1) for each aircraft and one (1) spare). The EGIs and       AN/AAR-47E(V)2 were MDE. Also included were two (2) CPS Anti-      Jam System (GAS-1), two (2) Missile Warning System sets with       certification and installation in each aircraft, and three       (3) AN/ALE-47 Countermeasure Dispensing Systems (one (1) for       each aircraft and one (1) spare) along with integration,       certification, and installation on each aircraft. These items       were to be used to equip two (2) of the six (6) total EDA SH-      60 helicopters. The inclusion of these MDE items did not       result in a change to the estimated MDE value of $47 million.       The total estimated case value remained $155 million.        On June 26, 2018, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 0J-18 of the inclusion of       eight (8) Embedded Global Positioning Units/Inertial       Navigation Systems (EGI) with GPS Selective Availability       Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) and four (4) AN/AAR-47E Missile       Warning Systems (MWS) (MDE items). Also included were four       (4) GPS Anti-Jam Systems (GAS-1), four (4) AN/ALE-47       Countermeasure Dispensing Systems and eight (8) AN/ARC-210(V)       RT-1990A(C) radios. These items were to be used to equip the       remaining four (4) of the original six (6) total EDA SH-60F       helicopters. The estimated value of the additional MDE items       was $4.26 million, but the addition did not result in a       change to the estimated MDE value of $47 million. The total       estimated case value remained $155 million.        On November 16, 2018, Congress was notified by       Congressional certification transmittal number 0T-18 of the       inclusion of four (4) additional EDA SH-60F helicopters (two       flyable/two spares non-flying), including eight (8) T700-GE-      401C engines (installed). Two (2) aircraft were to be       equipped with the following additional systems: four (4) EGIs       with GPS SAASM, two (2) AN/AAR-47E MWS (both items MDE); two       (2) GAS-1s, two (2) AN/ALE-47 Countermeasure Dispensing       Systems, and four (4) AN/ARC-210(V) RT-1990A(C) radios. The       estimated value of the additional MDE items was $11.6       million, but the addition did not result in a change to the       estimated MDE value of $47 million. The total estimated case       value remained $155 million.        On May 21, 2019, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 0K-19 of an increase in       total case value that had not been recently reevaluated. The       total case value increase was based on the following factors.       The previous value was calculated before the open and inspect       phase of the first aircraft. As retired aircraft stored at       the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG),       Spain's aircraft contained more damage that could be       discovered only during a full teardown and inspection, and       the last aircraft had been demilitarized and assessed in       overall poor condition with a planned date to be shredded.       Returning these aircraft to flight condition required       extensive work and greater expense than anticipated. There       was also a cost increase to provide for return-and-repair       services, engineering hours, and spare parts. No additional       MDE was added and the estimated MDE value remained $47       million. The estimated additional non-MDE value increased by       $61 million. The total estimated case value increased to $216       million.        On January 14, 2020, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 0A-20 of an additional four       (4) Embedded Global Positioning Units/Inertial Navigation       Systems (EGIs) with GPS Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing       Module (SAASM). The estimated MDE value was $1 million, for a       total estimated MDE value of $48 million. The total estimated       case value increased to $217 million.        This transmittal reports the inclusion of additional MDE       articles and services that were not previously notified:       Three (3) 7.62MM M240D Machine Guns. The total estimated MDE       value will increase to $48.7 million. The total estimated       case value will increase to $217.7 million.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided as       the additional MDE items were not enumerated in the original       notification. The inclusion of this MDE represents an       increase in capability over what was previously notified. The       proposed articles and services will augment the Spanish       Navy's multi-mission, multi-role helicopters to perform       humanitarian missions, search and rescue, medical       evacuations, firefighting, and anti-piracy efforts.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO ally which is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The 7.62MM M240D Machine       Gun is a belt-fed, gas operated medium machine gun that       chambers the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge. The M240D has two       configurations, both aircraft mounted and egress kit designed       to provide downed aircrew personnel with increased firepower.       The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       UNCLASSIFIED.
