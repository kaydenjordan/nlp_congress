 Madam President, I first thank Senator Sanders for his  passionate support for housing. He understands, having traveled the  country and connected with so many people, that there is almost nothing  more important--maybe nothing more important to people's lives, to  their material lives, than having a safe, accessible, affordable place  to live.   And Senator Sanders mentioned that 25 percent of renters in this  country pay half their income in rent, for housing costs. And one thing  goes bad in their lives--their car breaks down, their child gets sick,  they miss a few days of work because of a minor injury--and their whole  lives can turn upside down. Senator Sanders recognizes that.   And the legislation we begin later in the week is such an important  step, as the Presiding Officer knows as a member of the Banking and  Housing Committee, that we are going to take on housing. So I thank  Senator Sanders for that.                                  H.R. 3684    Madam President, I rise today with a longer speech than I normally  give, but in support of the legislation that will make the generational  investment in infrastructure for Ohio communities, for our Nation--the  infrastructure investment we should have been making for years.   We remember, 4 years ago, all of us on this floor--all three members  on this floor: the Presiding Officer and Senator Sanders and I--were  all ready to go with President Trump to move forward on infrastructure,  and the President and the majority changed its mind. Instead of  investing in jobs, investing in infrastructure, investing in people,  they used that trillion-dollar-plus in a huge tax cut, 70 percent of  which went to the wealthiest 1 percent.   So this time we didn't let that happen. I thank the 22 Members--11  Republicans and 11 Democrats--that held together and negotiated this  very complicated bill. This investment is about jobs--creating good- paying union jobs; rebuilding bridges; replacing lead pipes;  manufacturing next-generation, energy-efficient buses.   It is about better connecting people with jobs through transit and  bridges and highways.   It is about getting people in rural Kansas or western Mass. or  southeast Ohio or inner-city Cleveland the broadband they need to go to  school and prepare for the jobs of the future.   Supporting manufacturing jobs throughout my State, which this bill  does, including at Cleveland-Cliffs in Cleveland and AK Steel in  southwest Ohio and Nucor in central Ohio and other suppliers through  the strongest ever--the strongest ever, by America's standards-- negotiated, working with Senator Portman, legislation that we worked on  with Senator Baldwin, making steel and iron and other components in  Ohio for all these projects.   Taken together, these investments are a recipe for job creation in  communities large and small, rural and urban, in Ohio, from Appalachia  to the shores of Lake Erie.   For too long, Washington has ignored these places while Wall Street  has preyed upon them. That ends now. We invest in people and places  that make this country work.   I hear from mayors of both parties in towns all over Ohio about their  vision for their community and the projects they want to undertake.  They know the opportunities we can unleash. They need the investment.  It is time for all of our communities to share in this country's  prosperity. That is what this legislation does.   I want to focus on a few key provisions that will be central and  critical to Ohio. Right now, there are more than 3,200 bridges across  Ohio that need repairs to make them safer and to reduce congestion so  people can get to work, kids can get to school, farmers and businesses  can move their products and support Ohio jobs.   I remember, as a kid, I worked on a family farm just outside  Lexington, OH, in sort of north-central Ohio, and we used a tractor,  and I used to drive grain to the market, or we would take hay wagons to  the barn. We would cross some of these small, little culvert bridges or  bridges across creeks. Some of us called them cricks. And I know how  some of those bridges, even then, looked to be in some disrepair and  how important it is that we keep them up for farmers and for small  business all over my State.   Many know the Brent Spence Bridge--talked about in all kinds of  national infrastructure stories--between Ohio and Kentucky.  Unbelievably enough, it carries 3 percent of the country's GDP either  north to Ohio or south to Kentucky across the river--3 percent of the  country's GDP--every day. But it is dangerously outdated.   It was completed, I believe, in 1960. Many of us fought for years for  Federal investment   Many of us have fought for years for Federal investment. One of the  first news events, community events, I did when I came to the Senate in  2007 was go to the Brent Spence Bridge and express my commitment that  we needed to do something. It was not quite--it wasn't in the shape  then that it is now, but it clearly needed support and needed help.   Three and a half years ago, I introduced the Bridge Investment Act,  to put Ohioans to work, repairing and upgrading Ohio bridges, with  American iron and steel. This week, we are on the verge of getting it  done. It will provide a grant to pay for half of the cost of replacing  Brent Spence, and the additional funding in the package will support  the remainder of the project.   We expect Ohio to get at least $9.8 billion for Federal-aid highway  assistance, including $480 million of formula funds for bridge  replacement to supplement the Bridge Investment Act.   It is not just Brent Spence that needs help; it is the Western Hills  Viaduct in Hamilton County; it is I-70 over the Scioto River in  Columbus in Franklin County; it is U.S. 30 in Richland County in North  Central Ohio; it is the Broad Street Bridge in Columbus; it is major  projects and smaller bridges on rural farmlands that let farmers get  goods to market.   I talked this week with 81-year-old Howard Krueger. He lives in  Wyoming, OH, outside of Cincinnati. He is retired from Procter &  Gamble. A few years ago, as he was driving, a piece of the Western  Hills Viaduct fell on his windshield. He stopped his car and got out  and picked up the rock--about as big as his fist, a little bigger than  his fist--took it with him and talked about it on a radio news  conference we did.   It is a pretty visceral example of what we all know: Our Nation's  infrastructure is literally crumbling. We need this investment. Think  about the economic potential waiting to be unleashed when we fix these  crumbling bridges--the kinds of bottlenecks that frustrate commuters  and farmers and businesses in Ohio every day.  [[Page S6070]]    I want to thank our bipartisan cosponsors of the Bridge Investment  Act: Senators Wyden, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee; Senator  Whitehouse; Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma; Senator Whitehouse from Rhode  Island--early partners in this effort. I want to thank Chairman Carper  and Ranking Member Capito, just across the river from Southeast Ohio,  from West Virginia; the EPW Committee for their continued support.   The Banking and Housing Committee also provided a major part of this  infrastructure package that includes record record--record--investment  in public transportation. The Presiding Officer sits on this as a  prominent member of this committee. She knows, as I know, that through  her career and through my career--for almost a decade and a half, as  long as I remember--this committee is just referred to by the media and  by Senators as the ``Banking Committee.'' It was all about Wall Street.  It was little about community banks. It was almost nothing about  housing.   That has changed. This committee now we all refer to as the ``Banking  and Housing Committee.'' Some refer to it as the ``Housing and Banking  Committee.''   In this committee, we take our job with public transit seriously.  This package contains historic funding: $90 billion over the next 5  years, $40 billion increase for public transit--the largest ever. It  will connect people with better jobs. It will promote equity. It will  help our planet.   The Banking and Housing Committee held extensive hearings this spring  on infrastructure and transit. We heard from Ohioans like Darryl Haley,  who heads SORTA, Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority. We heard  from Mayor Horrigan of Akron. We heard over and over and over again  what we need to revitalize these essential systems, whether in  Cleveland, where I live, or Youngstown or Toledo or anywhere in our  State. We provide $1\1/2\ billion so that cities like Cleveland and  Ranking Member Toomey's biggest city in his State, Philadelphia, can  replace rail cars that, unbelievably, date back to the Reagan  administration or earlier.   This bill ensures that public transportation receives more than 20  percent of the new investment from the highway trust fund. Senator  Shelby, once chair of this committee--retiring after, I believe, 36, 37  years on this committee--talked to me about that 80-20 split that has  been here as long as he has been here, a tradition that both parties  have respected.   This bill takes a huge step toward electrifying the transit bus  fleet, providing over $5 billion for the low emission and no emission  program. It will mean modernizing the bus fleets in every city in  America.   These funds will also retrain workers who maintain our current diesel  fleet. Every electric bus purchase will keep and create good-paying  jobs.   This bill will support investments in flood mitigation, an important  issue that members of the Banking and Housing Committee, especially  Senator Menendez but a number of Senators in both parties who represent  coastal States from Massachusetts, the Presiding Officer's State, all  the way to Louisiana, Senator Kennedy's State.   I want to thank the members of the Banking and Housing Committee,  including Ranking Member Toomey, who worked to reauthorize Federal  transit programs.   I particularly want to thank our Housing and Transit Subcommittee  Chair Tina Smith, from Minnesota, and the subcommittee's ranking  member, Senator Rounds, from South Dakota. I have worked with both of  them. I have been to their subcommittee. Their efforts have been  especially important to improve rural transit, including in Indian  Country.   We are going to keep working to help rural transit agencies even  more. We had hearings under the leadership of Chairman Crapo 3 or 4  years ago where I heard stories from Senators in smaller States--mostly  Republicans--talking about the importance of rural transit, where  someone who lives out in the country, a bus--a paratransit bus--picks  her up, takes her to her dialysis treatment, and then takes her back.  That is kind of different from city-urban, big city bus transit but  equally important to families.   I thank our Democratic Members for their strong focus on transit.  Senator Menendez, from New Jersey, and Senator Reed, from Rhode Island,  continue to be leaders in fighting for a fair share of funds for  transit. Senator Tester, from Montana, and Senator Warner, from  Virginia, played a key role in ensuring the committee's transit title  moved forward in the bipartisan negotiations.   Our committee, the Banking and Housing Committee--we owe them special  thanks. Senator Warner and Senator Van Hollen, from Maryland, fought to  reauthorize funds for Ohio, for ``America's subway,'' the Washington,  DC Metro system, serving millions in this region; and Senator  Van Hollen's legislation to improve agency safety plans and give  workers a stronger voice in safety matters is a big victory for labor.    The chair of the Labor Committee just walked in, and her work on  these issues--in this case, bus safety, but safety of workers overall  is so very important. We know that busdrivers are often a special  target, and protecting them is essential.   Senators Warnock and Ossoff, our newest members on the committee from  Georgia, helped us fight for better bus rapid transit and better  planning, something that Metro Atlanta cries out for, and they have  been loud, strong voices on that.   Senator Cortez Masto contributed provisions to link transportation  planning with housing needs.   I want to thank the Presiding Officer, Senator Warren, and other  Members of our caucus who kept advocating for zero-emission buses, not  just for Boston but for the whole country. These buses help fight the  climate crisis. They help clean the air in neighborhoods plagued by air  pollution. People in inner cities, more often than not the quality of  the air they breathe is partly because there aren't many trees; it is  partly because of public transit. It is a whole host of issues, but  this takes a major step in dealing with that.   I want to thank Senator Duckworth. The Americans with Disabilities  Act became law 30 years ago, but some 20 percent of our rail stations  still--still--remain inaccessible. My friend Senator Casey, who sits  next to me on the floor--chair of the Aging Committee--he and I were  proud to cosponsor her proposal. Her bill provides almost $2 billion  for accessibility grants. Senators Duckworth, Casey, and I will  continue to push for more resources until every transit station is  accessible.   I want to thank Senator Sinema, also a member of our committee, and  Senator Portman and other Members of the bipartisan group for bringing  this momentous infrastructure package together.   It is obvious how some of the job creation in this package will  happen. You build a bridge. You lay down rail tracks. You hire American  workers to do it. None of these jobs ever, in an infrastructure plan,  can be shipped overseas. But this investment is different from those  that have come before it. For the first time, every single one of these  projects will come from the strongest-ever ``Buy America'' rules. It  means we get more job creation from Wichita to Seattle, to Boston, to  Cleveland. We get more job creation for every single dollar of taxpayer  investment.   Throughout my time in the Senate, I have worked to strengthen our  Nation's ``Buy America'' laws at every opportunity. And there have  always been interest groups in this town that have written loopholes  into these laws and weaken these laws. For instance, one of the most  expensive bridges in American history, the Bay Bridge, in Northern  California--a loophole enabled it to be made entirely of Chinese steel,  from a company owned by the Chinese Government.   Think about that. You know, we talk all the time about China. Our  corporations lobby to get tax breaks and trade agreements to outsource  jobs to China. We don't see the hypocrisy there. We don't see the  hypocrisy in letting China make the steel for the Bay Bridge. But  nonetheless, those days are behind us. We know how much steel can go  into a bridge and how many steelworkers in Cleveland or Middletown or  Gary, Indiana, can be employed to make the steel.   I have worked with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to  strengthen  [[Page S6071]]  ``Buy America'' laws in the highway bill, in the Defense Authorization  Act, and in the Water Resources and Development Act. These efforts have  been piecemeal. That is piecemeal. That is why I asked Senator Portman  to join me and Senator Baldwin in Build America, Buy America--a bill we  introduced on President Trump's Inauguration Day. We have worked with  other leaders on Buy America, and we will continue to. I especially  call out Senator Baldwin.   It took 4 years; we are finally getting it right. We are putting in  place a clear, comprehensive standard: American tax dollars should  support American jobs, period. American tax dollars should support  American jobs, period.    These historic investments will support Ohio manufacturers and not  their foreign competitors. With potential for hundreds of bridge repair  projects alone, this investment in Ohio combine with our strong ``Buy  America'' rules means job creation in every region of my manufacturing  State.   It keeps the promise I have made to Ohioans my entire career that I  would fight for the dignity of work. When you love your country, you  fight for the people who make it work, to ensure the industrial  heartland would be the engine of opportunity that drives us into a 21st  century economy.   Finally, while I am supporting this bill and am excited for all the  investments it will make in Ohio communities and Ohio jobs, I am  disappointed that a number of my colleagues rejected the idea that we  should pay for this bill by enforcing our country's tax laws.   I oppose the provision forcing home buyers to pay more each month to  help fund investments that wealthy tax cheats should pay for. The money  that home buyers pay should be going toward keeping our housing system  stable, making sure that everyone has an affordable home.   We can do more. We will do more in the coming months to address  affordable housing. Those that were in the Chamber heard Senator  Sanders talking about the importance of housing in the reconciliation  bill. I will come down to the floor later today and talk in some detail  about that.   Finally, I would be remiss if I did not thank my staff for their hard  work on this effort. Many of them had planned August vacations. It is  the only time of year where they really get sort of untrammeled,  unrestricted time with their families. And all of them have given up  something already this month and July. And they are public servants,  for sure. They understand commitment. They do this without complaining.  Their hard work has been so obvious to me and so obvious to people that  pay attention, not necessarily obvious to my constituents, and I want  to call them out.   Homer Carlisle was instrumental in helping negotiate and craft the  transit title and the bridge legislation. Ben Lockshin, a fellow from  the Federal transit Administration, assisted Homer in these efforts. I  want to thank Rebecca Higgins and Mary Frances Repko, with Chairman  Carper's staff. I have done conference calls with them. My staff works  closely with them. Robert Andres, with Chairman Wyden--Chairman Wyden  is chair of one of the most important committees in this Congress and  has been a leader in wanting the wealthy to pay their fair share and  wants to make sure it is large corporations that share the taxpayer  bill and the tax burden and pay their fair share and less burden on  small business. Aaron Goldner, formerly with Senator Whitehouse, and my  former aide Leah Hill--they all made the bridge legislation possible.   In my office, Beth Cooper provided technical assistance on the very  complicated flood mitigation portion of this bill. Megan Cheney and  Chad Bolt, Elisha Tuku, and Corey Frayer provided the analyses and  guidance on matters relating to the bill's pay for. Carolina Young--new  on my staff but already making her mark--and Abigail Duggan worked on  the ``Buy America'' provisions.   My staff has worked with others on ``Buy America'' over the years,  but Sam Mulopolus, with Senator Portman's staff; Brian Conlan with  Senator Baldwin have been particularly helpful. And I want to recognize  my former aide, Nora Todd, who led our efforts for much of a decade on  ``Buy America.''   Through all of this, joining me on the floor today, too, is Laura  Swanson, my staff director, who works unbelievable hours with a small  child and continues to be a terrific mother and wife and an amazing  staff director.   I say exactly the same about our legislative director, Jeremy  Hekhuis, who is not a terrific mother but a terrific father with a  family and has worked so very, very hard holding all this together for  over a decade. I thank my staff. I thank my colleagues.   This legislation--I remember saying to Senator Casey on March 6 when  we passed the American Rescue Plan--I turned to him because of the  child tax credit and what we did with pensions and so much else that  Senator Murray worked on too--I turned to Bob and said: This is the  best day of my legislative life with what we are able to do to cut  rates of child poverty and so much else. Well, this bill today is  almost as big in its scope and is so very important to this country. I  am pleased to add my support to it.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support  the budget resolution immediately after the infrastructure vote  tomorrow.   I particularly am glad to see the Presiding Officer in the Chair  today. Earlier I spoke on this floor about the infrastructure bill and  her efforts--Senator Duckworth from Illinois, her efforts--to ensure  disabled-access transit stops.   We still have far too many transit stops in this country in big  cities like hers in Chicago and mine in Cleveland and Philadelphia and  New York and all over that are not accessible, and that has got to be  our mission.   I chair the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Most  people call it just the Banking Committee. In reality, it is the  housing, banking, and transit committee. And that is our responsibility  to move in the right direction, and we are moving there rapidly. And I  thank Senator Duckworth for her work on that.   I want to talk not long. I know that Senator Cardin is awaiting and  has been patient, and I believe that Senator Inhofe might be here too.   This week we have moved forward a bill to provide critical  investments in transportation infrastructure. I am glad we are doing  that. The next step is to address housing.   Nothing is more important than housing. As chair of the Banking and  Housing Committee, I have held hearings about housing needs across the  country. This committee, called Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs-- most refer to it as ``Senate Banking''--has been mostly about Wall  Street in the past and not nearly enough about housing. Those issues  are changing.   I know Senator Cardin knows--and not just in Baltimore but in Western  Maryland and everywhere, as in urban Ohio and rural Ohio--how important  housing is. We hear repeatedly about the shortage of affordable  housing, about wide disparities in access to home ownership.   This isn't just about a few coastal cities. We heard from mayors in  Akron, OH; in Bozeman, MT, Senator Tester's State; in Tempe, AZ, about  their housing needs. Their markets vary. In Bozeman, home prices are up  50 percent. It is almost impossible for a young family to find a place  to live. In Akron, home values are sometimes too low to find financing,  and banks tell us they can't make a profit on selling a $60,000,  $70,000, $80,000 mortgage on a $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 house.   Their issues are different, but all three mayors told us they need  the Federal Government to be a better partner in helping to invest in  their housing and in their communities. Without housing investment,  there cannot be economic growth. That is because housing--by any real  definition, housing is infrastructure.   Where you live determines so much about your life: where your kids go  to school, how far you have to go to work, what kind of jobs you get.  It determines where you do your grocery shopping and whether you have  access to fresh fruits and vegetables; whether your kids are exposed,  as they are in far too many old neighborhoods--whether it is  Appalachia, Southern Illinois, or whether in Ohio or whether it is  Cleveland or Chicago--too often to hazardous lead or mold.   We saw over the past year that housing certainly affects our health.  People's paychecks have not kept up with the cost of living,  particularly the cost of rent.   Senator Sanders, earlier today--and this was before the pandemic,  what he was talking about, that 25 percent of American renters pay more  than half their income in rent. One thing goes wrong in their lives-- their car breaks down, their child gets sick, they miss 3 days of work  because of a minor injury--and everything turns upside down for them.  This is even more of a problem, of course, for Black and Latino  renters, with little left over each month for food and medication, let  alone saving.   It is not just renters. Today, more than one in five homeowners still  pay more than one-third of their income in rent. And the Black  ownership rate--this is pretty unbelievable. The Black ownership rate  is as low as it was when, in 1968, this body finally passed open  housing, finally passed fair housing.   The first Secretary of HUD, after we passed the fair housing law, was  Senator Romney's father, George Romney. As hard as he tried--partly  because the President, his boss, followed a southern strategy--he did  very little in the end, could accomplish very little for housing  equality.   We are the wealthiest country in the world. We have half a million  people, including 100,000 children, without a place to stay on a given  night.   The budget resolution on the floor tomorrow will finally make the  investment we need to help more families find and afford a place that  they can call home. Think of the word ``home.'   It helps us provide funding to make critical repairs to our Nation's  public housing, to make it more sustainable, to save families money, to  reduce harmful effects on our climate. It helps provide affordable  places for families and seniors to rent, including in rural areas, and  helps more families become first-time homeowners.   It will help communities invest in their neighborhoods, including  Brown and Black communities who have been left out of our Nation's  recovery. It will make their homes more resilient in the face of  changing climate. Communities will have housing and transit investments  that work together to bring down the cost of daily commutes, to reduce  harmful effects on our climate.   With the resolution before us tomorrow, we have an opportunity to  make people's lives better and to give local economies the chance to  grow. We can expand access to affordable rentals. We will make it  easier to purchase a home. We will put tradespeople to work in good- paying, often union jobs, building housing and making it safer and  making it resilient.   I urge my colleagues to support this long-overdue investment in our  homes, in our communities, and in our workers.   I yield the floor.    -Madam President, I am pleased to see language in the  State broadband grant program prioritizing employers with ``a  demonstrated record of and plans to be in compliance with Federal labor  and employment laws.'' It is unfortunately common for employers to  violate our Nation's labor laws, from the National Labor Relations Act  to the Occupational Safety and Health Act.   The broadband industry, sadly, is no exception.   In many industries, employers are engaging in rampant subcontracting  and outsourcing.   This situation is generally known as a ``fissured workplace,'' a  circumstance where a primary employer outsources noncore business  functions to subcontracted firms but still maintains tight control over  the outcomes of those subcontractors.   These arrangements impede enforcement of our Nation's labor laws.   At times, employers engage in these practices strategically to evade  accountability for labor law violations.   I have worked with several Senators on this problem in the past,  across the ideological spectrum and including with members who helped  craft the bipartisan infrastructure package.   It is my understanding that the language in the State broadband grant  program was written chiefly to ensure that American taxpayer dollars  prioritize projects with both past records of strict compliance with  Federal labor and employment laws and plans to continue compliance with  future projects.   American taxpayer dollars should create good-paying American jobs.   With its strong Buy America provisions, the bipartisan infrastructure  package works to do that.   We need to ensure that Federal dollars support good jobs and high  standards and limits the use of subcontractors.   There are many examples of ``high road'' employers who go above and  beyond the minimum standards we set with our labor laws.   That is the way it should be.   I expect to see this funding prioritize such ``high road'' employers  who use direct employees for projects.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ben Lockshin,  the detailee in the Banking and Housing Committee, be granted floor  privileges for the remainder of the session.
