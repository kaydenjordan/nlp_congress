 Mr. President, I am proud to stand before you today to  honor my dear friend and colleague, Senator Flake of Arizona, and to  pay tribute to his remarkable work here in the Senate as this  optimistic evangelist of democracy.   I have been asked a fair amount in recent weeks about my friendship  with Jeff--with Senator Flake--whose political beliefs differ very  widely from my own. Yes, Senator Flake is a staunch conservative, and  if you took a score card of the things on which we have voted the same  or believe the same, there would not be a ton of overlap.   But he is also a patriot. He is a patriot who deeply loves our  country and is willing to work across the aisle to stand up for the  values and principles that have made our Nation the greatest on this  Earth.   Our friendship stems from a foundation in similar experiences and  similar worldviews formed at the same time. We are almost exactly the  same age.   As you heard in his remarkable farewell address, time spent in  Namibia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa as a young man truly shaped him and  his view of the United States and our place in the world. At just about  the same time, I was spending time in Kenya and South Africa having  very similar experiences. This period in our young lives shaped our  sense that this democracy is special, is important, is worth fighting  for, and requires greater sacrifice of us than might be obvious here in  the comforts of the United States.   Because of these shared experiences, we understand the ways--when our  democracy is dysfunctional, when the world sees gridlock, especially  today, especially on the continent we have both come to know and love  in Africa--that there are competing models for how to organize a  society that is rising in their visibility and their confrontation and  their competition with our own. We know democracy matters, and believe  we have to fight for it.   We respect each other and listen to each other, and over the years, I  have been blessed to have the chance for us to work together. In a time  marked by division and partisanship, Senator Flake rightfully  recognizes that we need to get back to a time when compromise was  rewarded rather than punished, when we worked together to do what is  right rather than what is politically expedient.   Senator Flake has spent his career doing just that, unafraid to stand  up for what is right--even when it is hard, even when it is  inconvenient, even when it might go against President or party. He  deeply respects our rule of law and has been willing to take risks for  it.   He worked toward broad bipartisan immigration reform and stood up for  the independence of the Federal Reserve. He has helped to pass  legislation  [[Page S7552]]  to promote free and fair elections and political and economic reforms  in Zimbabwe, where we have both traveled together twice, as well as to  a dozen other countries.   He has come and stood on this floor time and again to demand a vote  on legislation to protect the special counsel and to prevent an  imminent constitutional crisis. He has taken risks and opened his heart  in a way determined to help us come together rather than be torn apart,  and for that, I am eternally grateful.   Whether meeting personally with world leaders or fighting for the  people of Arizona here on the Senate floor or advocating for new  policies in committee, Senator Flake's courage and his convictions have  always been evident. His service as a Senator stands as a model and a  challenge for many of us in this Chamber.   I look back fondly on our 6 years serving together. I was chair of  the Africa Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee when he  first arrived, and he succeeded me in that role. That has given us  opportunities to flee from elephants in Mozambique, to dine with  dictators in Zimbabwe and elsewhere, and to advance democracy on  continents we have come to know and love.   This year alone, we have been to nearly a dozen countries as we have  tried in a bipartisan way to advance America's interests in places  around the world where other models of governance are on the march. His  leadership, his engagement, his deep respect and admiration for the  people of Africa will be sorely missed in this Chamber and impossible  to replace.   For me, personally, I will miss his humor, his friendship, his  kindness, and his leadership. I know him as a decent, earnest, and kind  man and a great husband and father, who loves nothing more than his  talented wife Cheryl and his children, Tanner, Dallin, Austin, Alexis,  and Ryan. He has also been blessed with a very talented staff who have  worked tirelessly and been great partners in legislation and in  service. My high view of his character comes, I will remind you, in  this divided context, despite differences in our States and  backgrounds, divergent voting records and different specific faith  backgrounds. But all of that is wrapped up in a shared commitment to  evangelize for democracy.   Despite our differences, I believe Senator Flake has exemplified how  Washington and this Senate should work, particularly when it comes to  respecting each other, holding true to our core values and principles,  and defending them here and around the world, yet listening to each  other and being willing to trust each other.   I only wish I had the blessing of Senator Flake's partnership in this  Chamber for 6 more years, but it gives me hope thinking of the impact  he will undoubtedly have on our country and world in the years to come.  I know he has so much more good left to do, and I look forward to  supporting him in whatever path he chooses to accomplish that goal.   I want to close with some words Senator Flake spoke on this floor  more than 1 year ago in announcing his decision to retire rather than  seek reelection. He said:         [T]o have a healthy government, we must have healthy and       functioning parties. We must respect each other again in an       atmosphere of shared facts and shared values, comity, and       good faith. We must argue our positions fervently and never       be afraid to compromise. We must assume the best of our       fellow man and always look for the good. Until that day       comes, we must be unafraid to stand up and speak out as if       our country depends on it because it does.    Senator Flake, thank you. Thank you for being unafraid to speak out  for what is right, what is true, and what is just, and to risk  friendship with this junior Senator from a much smaller State on the  other side of the continent. Thank you for your service and your  friendship.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join my colleague  Senator Wicker in honoring Rex Buffington, a friend and public servant  who will soon retire from the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service  Leadership, where he has served as executive director for three  decades. Rex was present at the center's founding and has been  instrumental in the development and success of this important  legislative branch institution. He embodies the essence of its mission  which endeavors to inspire and train new generations of leaders who  seek out public service.   The late Senator John C. Stennis, who founded the center, embodied  this commitment to public service, not only in his relationships with  his colleagues, who called him a ``Senator's Senator,'' but to all who  admired the way he lived his life. Integrity, courage, commitment to  duty, and hard work are among the core principles that marked his time  in the Senate.   Given the late Senator's focus on public service, the Stennis  Center's congressional mandate became clear--to attract young people to  careers in public service, to provide training for leaders and future  leaders in public service, and to offer training and development  opportunities for senior congressional staff, Members of Congress, and  other public servants.   Rex has played a vital role in helping to realize Senator Stennis's  vision. Rex has said:         The Stennis Center believes that no government, regardless       of its history and structure, can be better than the people       who make it work. That is why our focus is on people over       policy. We are confident that if we can get the best possible       people in public service leadership, we will also get good       policy.    From the creation of the Stennis Center in 1988, Rex Buffington has  committed himself to memorializing those  [[Page S7572]]  ideals the late Senator Stennis embodied. At its core, the Stennis  Center operates a unique, bipartisan development program for 30 of the  most outstanding high-ranking congressional staff in the House and  Senate. Best known for the flagship Stennis Congressional Staff  Fellowship Program, Rex has ushered in nearly 400 senior-level  congressional staff members through this practical, bipartisan,  bicameral leadership development experience established in the 103rd  Congress. These veteran staff members have in turn started a mentoring  program for younger congressional staff, called Emerging Leaders.   Rex sought out many other ways to honor public service. He has been a  strong supporter of our Nation's military servicemembers. Honoring the  late Senator Stennis's relationship with the defense community, Rex has  cultivated a unique civilian-military relations portfolio of programs  at the Stennis Center. He was also instrumental in establishing  programs that have inspired leaders at every level--from high school to  newly elected Members of Congress. For example, over 300,000 high  school students from across the country annually compete for a spot at  the John C. Stennis National Student Congress.   Rex's hard work and dedication have been integral to the success of  the Stennis Center and to thousands of public servants who have  benefited from his counsel and leadership.   Prior to being appointed executive director, Rex served as Senator  Stennis's press secretary and chief spokesperson and played a major  role in shaping the Senator's legislative strategy. He has long been  active in his local community and his church, serving in a variety of  roles supporting youth, advocating for education, and participating in  organizations such as Scouting, the United Way, the Rotary Club, the  Boys and Girls Club, and many more.   Rex was born and raised in Meridian, MS, and graduated from  Mississippi State University with a degree in communication. He started  out as a news reporter for the Memphis Commercial Appeal before moving  to Washington to work for Senator Stennis.   Rex has long been a steady, thoughtful, and committed leader. He has  dedicated his professional life to the bipartisan work of promoting and  strengthening the highest ideals of public service leadership in  America and has provided vital services and resources to Members of  Congress and their staff for 30 years. I want to thank Rex and his  family for their commitment to public service, and I wish them all the  best in the future.
