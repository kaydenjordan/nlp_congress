 Madam President, yesterday the Senate voted to confirm  Andrew Saul of New York to serve as Commissioner of Social Security and  voted to advance several more highly qualified nominees.   Today we will vote to confirm three other executive branch nominees  to important posts at the Departments of State and Interior and at the  CFTC, and we will advance three more judicial nominees to fill seats on  the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and the  Court of Federal Claims.   So the Senate continues to clear the backlog left by more than 2  years of systematic delays and obstruction that extended even to  nominees with major bipartisan support--impressive, unobjectionable  individuals who had spent months and, in some cases, well over a year  on the Executive Calendar were finally granted straightforward votes.  The modest rules change the Senate adopted this spring is already  making a change.   In 48 session days, from January through April, we were able to  confirm just 23 nominees. But in the 20 days immediately following the  modest reform, we confirmed 45, about twice as many in less than half  the time, and, of course, the number of confirmations has continued to  climb in the weeks since then. We need to get these folks on the job  for the sake of the country. The President--any President--should be  able to stand up a government. The American people deserve to be  governed by the government they voted for.   Many of the jobs that have been needlessly held open are not  typically the highest profile positions, but they are still hugely  important. As I said yesterday, until we confirm David Schenker later  today, his confirmation to hold the top Middle East job at the State  Department will have been held up for more than a year. This is the  Middle East position at the State Department. Yet, as the cloture vote  indicated, this qualified nominee carries overwhelming support. The  nomination has been held by Democrats for political purposes. It had  nothing to do with the nominee or his qualifications for the position.  Given the crisis ranging from Libya to Yemen and almost everywhere in  between, it is past time to have an Assistant Secretary for Near East  Affairs confirmed and on the job.   Later today we will also confirm Susan Combs to serve as Assistant  Secretary of the Interior. Her noncontroversial nomination has been  pending in the Senate since July. Listen to this: since July of 2017--2  years, 700 days, just shy of 2 years. But starting tomorrow, she will  finally be on the job.   These are the kinds of nominees who once would have moved swiftly  through the Senate and certainly by voice vote. I wish we could  rediscover that tradition, but one way or another, we will continue to  make progress.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, in addition to  nominations, there are a number of other important items that Congress  ought to be able to tackle in the next several weeks. As I have  mentioned several times, we need continued negotiations in the Senate,  the House, and the White House toward a bipartisan government funding  agreement to set up the appropriations process. We will also need to  complete a National Defense Authorization Act to address critical  national security challenges, rebuild our military's readiness, and  modernize our Armed Forces to address the growing challenges posed by  great-power competitors like Russia and China.   The headlines remain filled with the unacceptable, unsustainable  security crisis and humanitarian crisis down on our southern border. By  now, I am confident that every Member of Congress has heard the  breathtaking numbers. We have all heard the chaos analyzed 1,000  different ways.  [[Page S3224]]    What we haven't seen is any appetite on the Democratic side for  actually getting an outcome. We haven't seen the Democrats put aside  their reflexive opposition to anything--anything--the President  requests and face the facts.   So allow me to repeat some of those facts yet again. We are all  hoping they will sink in some time soon. One week ago this morning,  border agents encountered the largest group of people attempting an  illegal crossing that they have ever, ever seen. They apprehended more  than 1,000 individuals--the largest group ever.   For consecutive months now, the men and women who guard our border  have apprehended more than 100,000 people--100,000. That is each  month--100,000 a month. We are talking about numbers not seen for more  than a decade. And, as we all know, in particular, the amount of  families and children are consistently record-breaking as well.   The officials whom we trust to protect our borders--not to mention  feed, clothe, and house these individuals--have been crying out for  months that their Agencies are stretched literally to the breaking  point. One processing center that was designed to hold 125 is said to  hold 900--900. The Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement has  predicted that the program for unaccompanied children may exhaust all  of its funding this month--this month--and need to reduce operations.   Here is one newspaper reporting on testimony from the head of the  Border Patrol:         The flood of migrants has overwhelmed Border Patrol       stations and other Federal facilities, forcing immigration       agents to release migrants directly into U.S. border       communities with only the hope that they will appear for       their immigration court hearings.    So this funding crisis is directly weakening our border security and  national security. It is directly worsening the conditions for these  men, women, and children, and the authorities are pleading for our  help.   I dare say there are not many occasions when the editorial board of  the New York Times has chosen to side with the Trump administration,  but this crisis is so bad and the next step is so obvious that it has  united President Trump, Republicans here in Congress, and the New York  Times editorial page. I doubt if we will see that again.   Here was the title of their editorial about a month ago: ``Congress,  Give Trump His Border Money.'' They described:         A humanitarian crisis of overcrowding, disease, and chaos.       . . . As resources are strained and the system buckles, the       misery grows.    They published that editorial while we were finalizing the disaster  funding legislation. There was no reason why the funds to alleviate the  humanitarian crisis at the border should not have been included in that  bill, and yet my friend, the Democratic leader, came to the floor  multiple times late last month to call the issue of border funding  ``extraneous.''   Addressing the security crisis and humanitarian crisis is not  extraneous. It is essential. Migrants are experiencing overcrowded and  underequipped facilities. Our law enforcement humanitarian  professionals are crying out for help.   Look, I understand our Democratic colleagues find it extremely  difficult to put partisanship aside and work with the President the  American people elected. I think the whole country sees very clearly  that Democrats in Congress seem to prefer picking fights with this  President to actually getting much done. Their partisan spite must not  prolong this misery any longer. As long as Democrats continue to drag  their feet on this crisis, as long as they keep slow-walking funding  that everyone from President Trump to the New York Times sees is  necessary, then, my colleagues across the aisle will continue to own  the consequences. It is on them.   I hope my Democratic colleagues will allow this legislation to move  forward--no more poison-pill policy riders, no more political  posturing. It is way past time for action.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule  XXII, it be in order to proceed to file cloture on executive  nominations during today's session of the Senate.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 41.

Mr. President, today is the last day of the session  for the Senate pages who served during the spring semester. I want to  thank them for their hard work and service to the Senate over the last  4 months. I wish you all well as you return to your home States with a  greater appreciation for the Senate and our work here.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of pages  graduating this week be printed in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Meg Balaji        Elizabeth Bates        Craig Birckhead-Morton        Jackson Cargill        Olivia Castilla        Michael Cathy        Brooke Culp        William Deaton        Gabe Fanning        Caroline Ferry        Cameron Fowler        Sophie Hart        Laura Hartman        Ruthie Kesri        Joe Lesser        Dan McDermott        George Moore        Virginia Pillion        Katerina Retzlaff        Bella Sandoval-Encinas        Matthew Shabino        Caleb Shriver        Hunter Steinlage        Kara Swain        Colby Switser        Teagan Thompson        John Wahlig III        Jamie Yoder     Mr. President, I might just add that, frequently, it  is difficult to go back to boring high school. So I hope you are all  able to acclimate yourselves to the real world again and always  remember your experience here in the greatest deliberative body in the  world.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 252; that the nomination  be confirmed; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further  motions be in order; that any statements related to the nomination be  printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action, and the Senate resume legislative session.
