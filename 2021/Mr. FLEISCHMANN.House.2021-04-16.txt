 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Technical  Sergeant Charles H. Coolidge of Signal Mountain, Tennessee, and  recognize a lifetime of service to our Nation.   Sergeant Coolidge passed away on April 6, 2022. Sergeant Coolidge was  the second-to-last surviving Congressional Medal of Honor recipient  from World War II and was the last surviving Medal of Honor recipient  from the European theater.   Born on August 4, 1921, Sergeant Coolidge is a national hero. During  the period of October 24 through October 27, 1944, Sergeant Coolidge  led a valiant repulsion of German infantry and tank units near the  French town of Belmont-sur-Buttant. Prior to that, he had received the  Silver Star for valiant combat in Italy.   Sergeant Coolidge's place in American history deserves the great  acclaim bestowed on him then with the Medal of Honor, and now. He is  truly an American hero and will be greatly missed.                            ____________________
