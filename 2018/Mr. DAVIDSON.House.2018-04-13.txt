 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of Ohio constituents who  have suffered reduced access to the banking system due to the loss of  community financial institutions in Ohio's Eighth District.   Like many things in Dodd-Frank that were intended to do good and  protect consumers, the Volcker rule is doing the exact opposite. The  Volcker rule was designed to protect depositors from having their  deposits placed at risk through proprietary trading. It was not  designed to discourage other forms of capital from flowing into our  banking system, from increasing competition, or from lowering prices  for a broad swath of customers.   This pragmatic, bipartisan compromise on Volcker is a great step  forward in enabling community banks to reach their compliance costs and  allow them to deploy more capital in the communities that serve.   My hope is we can move forward and pursue more commonsense solutions  like this, especially to help underserved communities where we have  seen local banking services dry up. I encourage support for this bill.                                time  1015
