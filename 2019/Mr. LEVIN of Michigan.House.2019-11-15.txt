 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment seeks to recognize  the role that workers everywhere play in supporting American exports  and to ensure that this vital constituency has a voice in projects that  impact them directly.   While the Export-Import Bank works to help grow American jobs, we  must not forget the impact American export projects have on workers and  their communities abroad.   International trade is crucial to a strong American economy, but it  must go beyond benefiting corporations only. It must raise the standard  of living for workers in all countries involved. Trade should not come  at the cost of foreign workers any more than it should come at the cost  of the American middle class.                                time  1030    In fact, only when we help raise the standard of living in other  countries will we end the hemorrhage of American jobs to countries with  rock-bottom wages and inadequate protections for workers' safety and  the environment.   This bill already requires consultation with communities potentially  impacted by the projects it finances, and my amendment simply makes  clear that the workers in these communities must be consulted as well.  This way workers will have a voice in the projects that directly affect  them.   My amendment also works to ensure that Congress has the best  information possible in determining how these policies are implemented.  The bedrock of good policy is good information, and the only way for us  to truly judge the quality of our actions today is to ensure that we  know how our ideas are carried out.   The law already includes robust reporting requirements, and my  amendment includes a simple addition to require an explanation of the  ways in which these potentially impacted communities, including  workers, are consulted.   Back in my district, I am consistently heartened to see the  solidarity among teachers, autoworkers, and so many others in Macomb  County and Oakland County, Michigan. By passing my amendment, we can  make clear that we, too, stand in solidarity with workers all around  the world.   I urge my colleagues to support this simple, yet necessary,  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's  words, and I look forward to continuing to work with him in the spirit  of bipartisanship.   I yield back the balance of my time.
