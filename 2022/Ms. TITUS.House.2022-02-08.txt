 Mr. Speaker, in efforts to control equine populations, the  BLM is directed to humanely capture wild, free-roaming horses and  burros and put them up for adoption.   BLM, however, uses helicopter companies to round up these animals,  leading to frightening and sometimes deadly situations. At $500 a head,  since 2011, the top three helicopter contractors have raked in some $37  million in taxpayer funding.   Last month, during a gathering at the Pancake Complex in central  Nevada, a young colt was chased for miles by a helicopter, despite  having a broken leg, and had to be put down when captured.   My Wild Horse and Burro Protection Act would outlaw the use of  helicopters in wild horse roundups, employ more traditional wranglers  for gathering efforts, and require the GAO to employ and explore humane  alternatives to protect these icons of the wild west.   Mr. Speaker, put simply, save a horse, hire a cowboy.                            ____________________
