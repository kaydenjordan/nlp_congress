 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues Earl  Blumenauer, Adrian Smith,  Dan Kildee, and Drew Ferguson for their work  on this bill. I especially thank Congresswoman DelBene for her tireless  leadership in advocating for this issue and bringing Members together  in a bipartisan manner.    For our listeners out there, that isn't as rare a thing as one might  think. But when you have exceptional leadership, and when you have the  grandmother-to-be of an infant on the way, you have a sense of urgency  that this Congress and this Nation desperately needs.   I can't thank her enough for her leadership on this, as well as my  colleagues across the aisle, because we all know that increasing access  and lowering costs for importing base powder is especially important,  as Congresswoman DelBene described, for WIC families because we know  that means lower costs for working families.   This is a prime example of what can happen when we all work together  for the common good. Nothing could be more important than making sure  that Suzan DelBene's future grandchild has appropriate baby formula.
