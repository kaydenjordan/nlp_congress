 Mr. President, if your car is a lemon, you don't sue  the bank; you sue the dealer. A college can be a lemon, just like a car  can be. A college could promise a potential student a job and then tell  them that 50 percent of their students scored perfectly on their SAT  tests. The potential student might use that information to take out  student loans and enroll in a college. Then, if the information turns  out to be false, the student may be stuck with student loans they can't  afford to repay. Unlike a car, if your college is a lemon, you do sue  the bank, and the bank is the taxpayer.   Today, Democrats are forcing the Senate to vote on a Congressional  Review Act that, if passed, would overturn the Trump administration's  borrower defense rule. This process allows a borrower of a Federal  student loan to have their loan forgiven if their institution misled  them and that misrepresentation led to financial harm.   First, if your college closes, it is important for you to know that  your loans are forgiven. Let me say that again. If your college closes,  it is important for you to know that your student loan is forgiven.   There are about 6,000 colleges and universities in our country, and  783 of them closed in 2018. For example, when Corinthian College  closed, that made a lot of news. Many students, though, transferred to  another college. But if they didn't transfer, they weren't stuck with  their student loans; their loans were forgiven.   We are not talking about that today when we vote. If your college  isn't closing but it does defraud or mislead you, then you can file a  claim. You can file a claim to have your loan forgiven, and you file it  with the U.S. Department of Education.   There are 42 million Americans with an outstanding Federal student  loan. In 2018, about 106,000 of those 42 million Americans filed what  we call borrower defense claims. They claimed they were misled by the  college when they used their student loan to go to that college.   In November 2016, the Obama administration issued a rule that  required a borrower to demonstrate only that they had been misled, not  that they had been financially harmed. The Trump administration fixes  that overly broad regulation, while still protecting borrowers and the  taxpayer.   Here is the difference. Under the Obama administration, if one  student had filed a claim and proved that he or she had been defrauded,  all the other students in that program had to do was attest they had  been misled in a similar way before having their loans forgiven as  well. It was sort of a class action.   It was unnecessary for the first student or subsequent students to  prove they had been financially harmed by that misrepresentation. What  this meant is, if you went to a school that had misled students, your  loan could be forgiven even if you had a job making $85,000 a year.   Under the Trump administration, each student needs to file a claim,  prove that they were defrauded and that they were financially harmed,  and then their loan would be forgiven by the taxpayer. Remember, the  bank is the taxpayer.   Secretary DeVos's borrower defense rule restores the original intent  of the law that a borrower must be misled and harmed.   The new rule establishes a fair and clear process as to what a  borrower must demonstrate: No. 1, that the school misled them; No. 2,  that the student relied on that information to enroll in the school;  and No. 3, that the student was financially harmed. The new rule gives  the borrower ample time to submit a claim and ensures that the  Department is basing their judgment on all available information.   The DeVos rule also protects the taxpayers who spend roughly $100  billion a year on Federal student loans. It continues to allow the  Secretary to recoup funds from an institution that has defrauded or  misled borrowers. It encourages borrowers and the institution to  resolve issues directly rather than involving the Federal Government.   And the new rule allows the Department to evaluate the level of harm  to each individual borrower filing the claim and forgives the  appropriate amount. For example, if you were told by the school that  you would make $45,000 a year when you graduated, but you are only  making $40,000, the Department could decide to forgive a part of your  loan.   The Obama administration's rules went too far and allowed borrowers  to have their loans forgiven whether or not they had actually suffered  financial harm. Secretary DeVos's new borrower defense rule restores  the original intent of the law that the borrower must be misled and  harmed.   I encourage Senators to vote against today's Congressional Review  Act.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to  meet  [[Page S1675]]  during today's session of the Senate.
