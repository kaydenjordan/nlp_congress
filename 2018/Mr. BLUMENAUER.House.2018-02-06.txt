 Mr. Speaker, with all that is going on in Washington,  D.C., these days, it is really hard to keep up with some things that  are amazingly consequential. One item that is flying below the radar  screen is the new Nuclear Posture Review from the Trump administration.  They are talking about expanding our nuclear arsenal, embarking us on a  path of spending $1.2 trillion.   Not only do we have more than we need already that we can't afford to  use and pay for; we are talking about other elements here that are  disturbing: developing new destabilizing nuclear weapons; being able to  use nuclear weapons in nonnuclear situations, for example, responding  to cyber attacks when you might not even know who did it.   We still have all these land based ballistic missiles in silos on  hair-trigger alert. We just saw the vulnerability there in Hawaii with  the recent mistaken threat of an attack send a whole state into panic.   We need to take a hard look at how to do this right before it is too  late.                            ____________________
