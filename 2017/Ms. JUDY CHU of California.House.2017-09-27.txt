 Mr. Speaker, it has been 3 weeks since  President Trump announced he would be ending DACA; 3 weeks of fear in  homes, classrooms, and offices where DREAMers wonder if they still have  a future here in the only home they have ever known; 3 weeks for  Congress to answer President Trump's request for a bill that would stop  him from executing his own cruel order.   Here is that bill. Members from both parties have said they want to  do something to protect DREAMers. Here is that something. Over 80  percent of Americans believe DREAMers who live, work, contribute, and  follow the law should stay here. Here is our chance to show we are  listening.   We must pass the Dream Act because of people like Jose Antonio  Vargas, an immigrant from the Philippines, who never knew he was  undocumented until he applied for his learner's permit. But being  undocumented didn't stop his pursuit of the American Dream. He worked  hard and became a journalist, ultimately winning the Pulitzer Prize for  his articles.   Let's act to bring DREAMers like Jose out of the shadows. Let act to  encourage more to achieve what he did. Let's right this wrong, stop the  cruel end of DACA, and finally pass the Dream Act today.
