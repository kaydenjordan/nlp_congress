 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Jose Serrano, the  distinguished gentleman from the Bronx, for his tremendous leadership  here in the Congress and in connection with this bill.   There is a growing culture of corruption that is festering within the  Department of Commerce that should trouble Americans regardless of  political affiliation. It is absolutely essential that we continue to  support the oversight that is independent and those who have the  responsibility to police bad actors and explore waste, fraud, and  abuse.   This amendment will increase support for the Office of the Inspector  General at the Department of Commerce. This office serves an incredibly  vital function. It provides independent and objective oversight for an  agency that is led by Secretary Wilbur Louis Ross, Jr., someone who has  from time to time found himself in hot water with ethics experts here  in this town. Meeting even the minimum ethical standards the government  sets for its executive branch officials seems to be a significant  challenge for our Secretary.   Last February, the Office of Government Ethics, which is run by a  Trump appointee, declined to certify Ross' 2018 financial disclosure  report `` . . . because that report was not accurate and he was not in  compliance with his ethics agreement at the time of the report.''   These kinds of disclosures are, of course, important. They allow the  U.S. government's ethics watchdogs, regardless of political  affiliation, to identify potential conflicts of interest.   One such conflict was alleged last summer in separate complaints by  the Campaign Legal Center and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in  Washington, who allege that Ross worked on the Trump administration's  steel tariffs and helped promote liquid natural gas exports at the same  time that he held financial interests in companies that were impacted  by these policies.   We don't have time to explore some of the other potential conflicts  and accusations that were recently detailed by Forbes magazine which  caused that publication to suggest that ``the current United States  Secretary of Commerce could rank among the biggest grifters in American  history.''   That is a tall order.   Secretary Ross is a public servant. He should be serving the public's  interests, not special interests or his own personal financial  interests, as appears to have been the case in his highly controversial  decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, and then be  deceptive about the motives.   With all of this obfuscation and fabrication and misrepresentation,  we need to make sure that the Department of Commerce's independent  inspector general's office has the resources and capacity to police the  bad behavior that may result in waste, fraud, and abuse of American  taxpayer dollars.   Apparently, the Trump administration doesn't necessarily see it that  [[Page H4895]]  way. Their fiscal year 2020 budget actually cuts funding for general  oversight operations by approximately $1 million, which will result in  a personnel reduction of at least seven positions.   At a time when oversight has never been more important, we must not  allow this cut to go into effect.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote to restore this funding and send a  message to this administration that we won't be grifted by anyone, even  the Secretary of Commerce.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                            Parliamentary Inquiry
