 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for getting a  transformative auto safety package into the INVEST in America Act. This  will save tens of thousands of lives if we can get this passed, and I  hope that we will see that happen.   We had a press conference this morning where we had people who have  suffered such great harm. We heard the story of a limousine with 18  people, 6 from one family, that went up in flames because of a drunk  driver.   We heard from a woman whose child died in a hot car. We have the Hot  Car Act that would make sure that there is a warning that there is a  child in the back seat, because 1,000 children, babies and toddlers,  have died since 1990 in hot cars. This was a press conference with  tears and anguish for preventable things, and I am so grateful that  this is in the legislation.   I also just want to say that the city of Chicago has the most water  lines with lead inside of them, and this legislation will deal with  water safety. And this is so important because the lead poisoning does  not go away. Children are affected for life because of that.   So the bills that I am talking about are lifesavers as part of this  whole package of the INVEST in America Act.   I also want to thank Representative Peter DeFazio for his great work  in putting this together.
