 Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the New  Hampshire congressional delegation, Senator Maggie Hassan and  Representatives Ann McLane Kuster and Chris Pappas, to salute the New  Hampshire Police Association Pipes and Drums on its 25th anniversary.  For a quarter century, NHPA Pipes and Drums have brought their distinct  sound to memorial services and community events in the Granite State  and across the country. They honor their brothers and sisters in  uniform with each performance.   The beginnings of NHPA Pipes and Drums are rooted in tragedy. In  October of 1994, Sergeant James Noyes of the New Hampshire State Police  SWAT Team responded to a barricaded subject in Gilford, NH. Trained in  hostage negotiations, he was trying to dissuade a clearly distraught  man from harming himself when the man suddenly opened fire. Sergeant  Noyes was struck by a bullet under his arm and succumbed to his injury,  leaving behind a wife, daughter, and two sons.   At his funeral days later, his fellow troopers and law enforcement  officers listened to the Boston Police Gaelic Column pay tribute to  Sergeant Noyes. Their bagpipes and drums gave expression to their  shared grief. A few officers quickly initiated a search for anyone  interested in a New Hampshire-based police pipes and drum band. Several  individuals from various departments answered the call, and they held  their first practice 2 months later. After 2 years of trainings and  rehearsals, the New Hampshire Police Association Pipes and Drums gave  its maiden performance at the New Hampshire Police Memorial in Concord.   The band's current roster has honed a difficult craft, and their  performances give special meaning to both somber police memorials as  well as more cheerful community events. They are frequent marchers in  Forth of July and holiday parades around the region. They are mainstays  at the New Hampshire Highland Games. They bring their talents to send- offs for Honor Flights, which flies veterans to Washington, DC, at no  cost to see war memorials. They have played at Fenway Park, as well as  in the Nation's Capital during National Police Week, and at our annual  Congressional Law Enforcement Awards, they play a crucial role in our  efforts to honor officers who go above and beyond the call of duty.   On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, we ask our colleagues and  all Americans to join us in congratulating NHPA Pipes and Drums on 25  years of service and wishing its pipers and drummers all the best in  the coming years.                            ____________________
