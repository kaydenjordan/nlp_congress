 Mr. Chairman, I join my colleagues today in strong  support of the Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug  Costs Act.   Healthcare is the number one issue I hear about from the families  that I represent, and we must do the right thing for the American  people and finally focus on lowering the cost of healthcare.   As a child, in my own family, we struggled at times to afford health  insurance. I know directly that, if healthcare isn't affordable, it  isn't accessible. That is why I have cosponsored bills in this package  to lower prescription drug costs and stabilize the Affordable Care Act.   It is unacceptable that 29 percent of Americans ration lifesaving  medicine because they cannot keep up with the cost. We need to stop  brand-name drug companies from keeping affordable generic alternatives  from the market and support efforts to develop lower cost options for  families. These efforts have bipartisan support, and I am proud to  support them.
