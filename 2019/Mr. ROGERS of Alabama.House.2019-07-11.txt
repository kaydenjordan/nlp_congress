 Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chairwoman, liberals and progressives have launched a concerted  attack on our defense authorization. They have attached a string of  partisan, progressive policy riders designed to gut DOD's assistance  along the southern border.   Every day, about half of all Customs and Border Protection officers  are pulled off the line for administrative duty, transportation, and  other work, taking them away from the border--mostly taking care of  children. The important job of caring for families and unaccompanied  children has been a tremendous challenge for these Border Patrol  agents.   Border Patrol stations and many HHS shelters have been at or above  capacity for months. In fact, the last 4 months, we have had over  100,000 apprehensions each of those months.   DHS has found 63,000 unaccompanied alien children along the southern  border so far this year. That is 13,000 more than all of last year. In  the past, DOD has been a trusted partner in housing thousands of  migrant children. This amendment bans all DOD assistance to housing  unaccompanied children.   Since 2012, DOD has provided DOD facilities and land for the  Department of Health and Human Services to shelter nearly 16,000  unaccompanied alien children who receive care, security,  transportation, and medical services. It would be irresponsible to cut  off DOD's ability to provide safe, secure, and accountable shelter for  these unaccompanied children in the middle of a border crisis.   I strongly oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the  same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I have no further speakers,  so I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Madam Chairwoman, I just want to remind people  that we don't want to have these unaccompanied children not have  appropriate places to stay and to get medical care, transportation, and  supervision that they need. That is all that we are providing for them,  because we don't have them in the CBP.   So I would urge people to reject this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First, I want to point out, when DOD assets are sent to the border,  it is in a support capacity. They don't serve in a law enforcement  capacity. They don't patrol the border.   Right now, we have half of our Border Patrol agents, on a daily  basis, being taken off the border and put into administrative  functions, not doing law enforcement.                                time  2200    When we send DOD assets down there, it is typically National Guard  personnel. They fill those back-end administrative functions so the  CBP-trained agents can go in and enforce the law.   Madam Chair, you never have seen and you are not going to see the DOD  assets being used to enforce the law.   The military has played an important role in securing our southern  border since the 1980s. Presidents Reagan, H.W. Bush, Clinton, W. Bush,  and Obama have authorized DOD assistance on the border in the form of  equipment or manpower on multiple occasions.   Every day, about half of all Customs and Border Protection officers  are pulled off the line for administrative duty, transportation, and  other work away from the border.   There were over 104,000 illegal aliens in June. That is a 380 percent  increase over June 2017. CBP is on track for over 1 million  apprehensions in this fiscal year.   DOD has been on site for months providing support. DOD medium-lift  air mobility support moves CBP agents to remote areas. Administrative  and transportation support puts CBP agents back in the field and off  bus duty. They provide camera and areal sensor operations to help  identify large groups of migrants and smuggler activity and to cut down  on response times.   This support is directly improving border apprehensions and response  times.   Again, DOD support on the border has been a bipartisan policy to  address migration surges for decades. Cutting off DOD assistance will  immediately and substantially worsen the crisis on our border.   Madam Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues  to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), who is my friend and colleague.    Madam Chair, I really take issue with the  characterization of militarization of our border. I just told the  gentlewoman a few minutes ago that these people don't work on the  border. When the military goes down there, they are in support  positions to allow the professional Border Patrol agents to do their  jobs so that we can provide better care for these individuals who are  trying to legally be processed.   There is no need for this. This is a wrongheaded amendment.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, the Border Patrol stations are at a breaking point.  Every station has been overcapacity for nearly all of 2019.   We have Border Patrol stations that were designed for a maximum  capacity of 4,000 individuals. On a regular basis, we have been having  20,000 people in these facilities.   DHS has already apprehended more than 390,000 illegal immigrant  family members in 2019, which is more than triple last year. This  explosion in families coming across the border is a key factor behind  the current crisis. Smugglers are intentionally dumping groups of over  100 people at a time in remote areas to overwhelm Border Patrol agents  and resources.   House Democrats stalled a supplemental for weeks as children and  families languished in overcrowded stations that were never designed  for this kind of crisis. Democrats are actively limiting DHS' ability  to detain migrants, which only fuels catch-and-release policies that  started the crisis to begin with.   DOD has provided safe, secure, and accountable housing for  unaccompanied alien children in the past and should absolutely have the  option to deal with them in the future.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, first, I do want to make a point  that we are not just talking about unaccompanied children here. The  gentlewoman's amendment is not just limited to that.   The gentlewoman does make a point that is correct, but I want to  emphasize why she is right. If they are not with their legal parent or  guardian, we don't know for sure whom that is they are traveling with.  They may say it is their grandmother, but for all we know, it is a sex  trafficker or a drug dealer who is just using the kid to get into the  States. We have on multiple occasions had CBP notice the same child  coming through five, six times with different ``families.''   If we are not sure that that is their legal guardian or parent, yes,  we are going to find a way to separate them until we can discern  whether or not that person should be traveling with them.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
