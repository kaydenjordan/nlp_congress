 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1435,  the Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act, of which I am an  original cosponsor.   Americans want choice. Consumers deserve it when they buy a vehicle.  It is one of the biggest purchases they will make other than their  home. Whether they choose an internal combustion vehicle or an electric  vehicle, that decision should be left up to the consumer, not Federal  bureaucrats. I amend that to say unelected bureaucrats.   This administration's rush to electrification has blinded their  ability to recognize the inevitable consequences and shortcomings of  such restrictive government mandates.   Take the Secretary of Energy's recent 4-day EV road trip debacle. Due  to the limited availability of EV chargers in America, including in  Grovetown in my district, the Secretary's advance team chose to use  non-EV vehicles to reserve working chargers for the Secretary's use at  the expense of my constituents. I didn't have a thing to do with that.   Mr. Speaker, my constituents do not have advance teams. Georgians who  don't wish to wait for working chargers on a family trip should not  have to do so. Demand for electric vehicles should be market driven,  not government manufactured. I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 1435.
