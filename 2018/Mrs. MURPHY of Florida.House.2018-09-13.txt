 Mr. Speaker, since coming to Congress, I have  made it a priority to ensure that our men and women in uniform are  prepared for success once their military service ends. The members of  our Armed Forces serve and sacrifice for this Nation. We have a moral  obligation to help them thrive when they transition to the civilian  world.   That is why I am so pleased the final version of this bill includes  the bipartisan amendment I coauthored to increase funding for the  Wounded Warrior Program. This initiative places disabled veterans in  paid, 2-year fellowships in House offices, providing them with  potentially life-changing opportunities for professional and personal  growth. It also enables Members of Congress to better serve the  American people, because veterans can use the unique skills they gain  in the military to improve public policy and help constituents.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill.
