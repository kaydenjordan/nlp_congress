 Mr. President, I would like to share a few words  today to honor an outstanding leader, veteran, and friend of mine who  recently passed away.   Tony Incashola was the director of the Selis-Qlispe Culture  Committee, where he spent 47 years preserving and perpetuating Salish  and Pend d'Oreille culture, language, and history. In his 27 years as  director of the committee, he earned the respect and trust of those he  represented, so much so that members of the Selis-Qlispe Elders  Cultural Advisory Council regarded him as the leader of the Tribe.  Apart from his work on the Selis-Qlispe Culture Committee, Tony was a  former Tribal councilman for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai  Tribes.   In partnership with his fellow CSKT elder Johnny Arlee, Tony  initiated the documentation and preservation of Salish language,  stories, lessons, important place names, and songs, among other  historical artifacts. Thanks to their work, the Selis-Qlispe Culture  Committee has produced one of the most comprehensive and extensive  tribal collections of oral history and culture in the Nation.   Tony's life's work was dedicated to passing Tribal knowledge onto  future generations, which he accomplished not only through his record- keeping, but also through projects like the Nkwusm Salish School in  Arlee, which teaches the Salish language and culture to kids from pre-K  through 8th grade.   Tony's knowledge and leadership also had a profound impact on Tribal  policy. As a member of the CSKT Tribal Council, he was instrumental in  the effort to expand the Tribe's natural resource department and  ultimately acquire ownership over the Salish Kootenai Dam. And as if  his dedication to the Tribes wasn't enough, Tony was also a Vietnam  vet, who served his country courageously in the U.S. Army. But to me,  and to many others, Tony was all these things and more. He was a  spiritual leader, a historian, a resource, and a friend.   I got to know him during my time in the Montana State Legislature,  and he quickly became someone I deeply respected for his character, his  wisdom, and his deep knowledge of the past.   But most of all, Tony was just a stand-up guy, a man who dedicated  his life to others, whether that was his family, his Tribe, or even  future generations of Tribal members he would never meet.   I extend my deepest sympathies to Tony's wife Denise; their children  Daren, Brian, Brandy, and Tony, Jr.; foster children Destry Henderson  and Marietta Meuli; ``special daughter'' Marlene Lafromboise; eight  grandchildren; two great-grandchildren; and all the other folks who  considered Tony family--and there were many.   Though he is no longer with us, Tony's presence will be felt for  generations. Tony's memory will live on, just like the CSKT history he  spent his life working to preserve.   Thank you, Tony, for all you gave to Montana. You will be sorely  missed.                            ____________________
