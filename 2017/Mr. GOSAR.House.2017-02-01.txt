 Mr. Speaker, there is no question that President Obama put  his own environmental legacy ahead of the well-being of the American  people. The Obama administration squandered taxpayer money for 8 years  attempting to force the stream protection rule down our throats.   The deception and lack of transparency utilized to implement this  rule were unprecedented. Along with manipulating job loss numbers, the  administration even changed the rule's name, thinking the American  people might forget about it. But the fact is, you can't put lipstick  on this pig. Whether you call it the stream buffer zone rule or the  stream protection rule, the rule still stinks.    The American people who want good-paying careers have missed out on  hundreds of thousands of jobs around the country as a result of  President Obama's ideologically-driven war on coal. But today is a new  dawn in America, and this job-killing, midnight regulation is now  directly in the crosshairs of the Trump administration and of this  Congress.   On behalf of all hardworking Americans, I urge my colleagues to vote  to support this commonsense legislation.
