 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and  legacy of Jim Manasco, who passed away at his home on Smith Lake in  Alabama on April 12, 2018.   Jim was a self-taught artist and sign painter who entered the trade  as an apprentice when he was just 16 years old. He was a successful  commercial artist for 65 years and possessed the rare ability to letter  and paint freehand. He was also a gifted creative artist in multiple  mediums, from carving to pottery to painting.   In the early 1970s, Jim, his wife, Ruth, and a small group of  naturalists were leaders in the fight to preserve and protect the land  along the Sipsey fork of the Black Warrior River in northwest Alabama.  Because of his  [[Page S2384]]  dedication, Jim was chosen to testify before Congress in support of the  Eastern Wilderness Act, which was signed into law in 1975, and the  Sipsey Wilderness, in the Bankhead National Forest, became the first  wilderness designated in the act. Thanks to Jim and that determined  group, generations to come will continue to enjoy pristine, undeveloped  lands east of the Mississippi River. Since passage of the act, more  than 140 Wilderness Areas and nearly 1.5 million acres have been  protected in the eastern United States.   Like FDR, who, following in the footsteps of his ``uncle'' Teddy  Roosevelt, left a great conservation legacy, Jim saw ``an America whose  rivers and valleys and lakes--hills and streams and plains--the  mountains over our land and nature's wealth deep under the earth--are  protected as the rightful heritage of all the people.'' Thanks to men  like Jim Manasco, more than half of the people who live in Alabama  enjoy outdoor recreation every year in the most biologically diverse  State east of the Mississippi River and one of the most biologically  diverse States in the entire country. Alabama boasts forests,  woodlands, wetlands, caves, glades, beaches, and prairies, not to  mention more than 4,500 documented species.   The importance of protecting and wisely managing this natural wealth  cannot be overstated. In Alabama, outdoor recreation generates 135,000  direct jobs--that is more than twice the number of auto manufacturing  jobs--it generates $3.9 billion in wages and salaries and $857 million  in State and local taxes.   I would be remiss if I did not mention Jim Manasco's other important  legacy, that of Cherokee wisdomkeeper. The Cherokee played a  significant role in the history of Alabama, and many Alabamians proudly  claim Cherokee ancestry. Jim was long honored as a Tribal elder for his  teachings about carvings on beech trees, native symbols, ceremonial  knowledge, and Tribal history and for his intimate knowledge of the  plants and animals that inhabit the landscape of the South. Some of  this wisdom was captured in his popular book, ``Walking Sipsey,''  published in 1992.   Jim always downplayed his accomplishments, often saying, ``Raw  talent's got nothing over dogged determination.'' Well, Jim Manasco was  right, and America needs more men with dogged determination to do the  right thing. I hope to be one of them.                            ____________________
