 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. I am always  proud to stand in the well. It is an honor to have the preeminent  privilege to speak to the Nation from this point, from this very place  in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call to the attention of the American  public, the American people, an article that was printed in The New  York Times yesterday. It is styled: ``I Am Part of the Resistance  Inside the Trump Administration.''   I cannot vouch for this article, but there is one passage that I can  speak of with some degree of credibility. It reads: `` . . . we believe  our first duty is to our country. . . . `'   Regardless as to what else in this article may or may not be true,  this is true: Our country should come first.   I love my country, and I stand here today because I do.   It goes on to say: ``and the President continues to act in a manner  that is detrimental to the health of our Republic.''   This is true. I think there is little debate about some aspects of  the things that the President has done that are detrimental to the  health of the Republic.   We know that it was detrimental to the health of the Republic for the  President to say there were some nice people among the racists and  bigots in Charlottesville where a person lost her life.   We know that it is detrimental to the Republic for the President to  institute a policy that separates babies from their mothers and not  find a way, to this day, to put them back together. We know that that  is detrimental to the Republic.   But what we also know is that there are great talking points about  what the President has done, great talking points about how he is  harming society, great talking points about how he is unfit to be  President--great talking points.   But here is the question: Where are the action items?   It is not enough to have great talking points. I hear them all the  time, if you will, on various shows on television. You hear people  talking about how this is not American; this is un-American--great  talking points.   But at some point, we have to go from talking points to action items.  At some point, we have to deal with the problem. It is not enough to  identify it. We have got to also identify the solution.   There is a solution to an unfit President. I thank God for giving me  this opportunity to be in Congress, and I will not let my record show  that I was here, and when there was a scourge, if you will, on the  country by virtue of the way the President is behaving, I will not let  my record show that I didn't take advantage of this opportunity to  stand in the well and denounce what this President has done.   There is a solution. Everybody knows it. And we are going to get  there. But I will say this to you. We cannot allow political expediency  to stand in the way of the moral imperative to remove a President who  is doing things that are detrimental to the country.  [[Page H7875]]    This is not about Democrats. This is about democracy. It is not about  Republicans. It is about the Republic. And if we are going to save this  Republic, we have got to remove this President from office.   I have filed Articles of Impeachment to do so. I stand on what I have  done, and I stand on this: I will not allow this to continue without a  challenge. I will challenge him again. I will challenge this House. I  will challenge us because this is our country that is in jeopardy, and  we are doing very little to stop it. And we have the power. The Framers  gave us the means.                                time  1015    It is not a question of whether there is a way. The question is, do  we have the will to stand up for justice and stand up for our country?   There is one solution. Article II, Section 4 speaks to it. There will  be an impeachment of this President, or at least an attempt to get him  out of office by way of impeachment. I stand on it.                            ____________________
