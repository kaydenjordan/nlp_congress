 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call out China for its  long history of predatory dumping and tariff avoidance.   We have seen China cheat on this game before on everything from steel  to autos to solar. It hurts American workers and American companies  that I represent in Ohio.   China is a nation that does not abide by global trading rules. Fair  trading nations must apply strict scrutiny and appropriate penalties in  response.   I welcome the administration's focus on boosting manufacturing of  critical solar components here in America. But we cannot encourage a  tilting of the playing field that favors a country whose sinister trade  practices have crushed the American middle class.   Ohio's workers make and build the products that make and build  America. Our Nation must respect them, as well as the innovative  companies that are working to deliver America's energy independence in  perpetuity.   Let's champion free trade among free people.                            ____________________
