 Mr. President, I have six requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They do not have the  approval of the Democratic leader; therefore, they will not be  permitted to meet, but I ask unanimous consent that a list of  committees requesting authority to meet be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry        Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs        Committee on Energy and Natural Resources        Committee on the Judiciary        Committee on Intelligence        Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast       Guard    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in  support of President Trump's nomination of Kristine Svinicki to  continue serving as a nuclear safety regulator.   Ms. Svinicki has served as a member of the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission for more than 9 years. In January, President Trump  designated Ms. Svinicki as the Chair of the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission. She is well qualified. In her time in office, she has  proven to be knowledgeable, dedicated, and an outstanding public  servant.   She also has been very responsive to Congress. Since becoming a  Commissioner, she has testified 18 times before the Senate Environment  and Public Works Committee. Before becoming a member of the NRC, she  served as staff in the U.S. Senate, as a nuclear engineer at the  Department of Energy, and as an energy engineer for the Wisconsin  Public Service Commission.   She has already been confirmed twice to serve on the NRC. In both  2008 and 2012, her nomination was approved by the Environment and  Public Works Committee and by the full Senate, each time by voice vote.  Earlier this month, the Environment and Public Works Committee approved  her nomination for a third time, again by voice vote.   Her nomination has garnered support from groups like Third Way, which  is a think tank once labeled as ``radical centrists'' by the New York  Times. Josh Freed, who is the vice president of the Clean Energy  Program at Third Way, said this: ``Svinicki's work at the NRC has  resulted in improved readiness to regulate small modular and advanced  reactors that could provide enormous benefits for climate, American  leadership, and domestic job creation.'' He went on to say that  Chairman Svinicki's continued leadership at the NRC is needed now more  than ever.   The Senate must act quickly to confirm Ms. Svinicki. Unless she is  confirmed by June 30, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will no longer  have a quorum of its members. We can't let that happen. The NRC has an  important mission of regulating America's nuclear industry. The  Commission serves to protect public health and the environment. The  Nuclear Regulatory Commission needs a quorum of its members in office  to meet its mission.   We need to confirm Kristine Svinicki, and I urge all Senators to vote  yes on her nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I yield back all time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Under the previous order, all postcloture time is expired and the  question occurs on the Billingslea nomination.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the  Billingslea nomination?    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.   The result was announced--yeas 65, nays 35, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 152 Ex.]                                  YEAS--65       Alexander      Baldwin      Barrasso      Bennet      Blunt      Boozman      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Coons      Corker      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Donnelly      Duckworth      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Flake      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hatch      Heitkamp      Heller      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kaine      Kennedy      King      Lankford      Lee      Manchin      McCain      McCaskill      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Nelson      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott      Shelby      Strange      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Warner      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--35       Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cortez Masto      Durbin      Feinstein      Franken      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Hirono      Klobuchar      Leahy      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen  [[Page S3713]]        Stabenow      Udall      Van Hollen      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden   The nomination was confirmed.                            ____________________
