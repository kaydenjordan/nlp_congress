 Mr. Chairman, today, I rise in strong support of H.R.  467, the HALT Fentanyl Act. To drive home why this bill is so  important, I want to emphasize that currently there is no permanent  scheduling of fentanyl, only a temporary emergency scheduling order.   That means when, not if, but when this temporary order on fentanyl  expires, fentanyl-related substances will become street legal.   Think about this: Over 300 people a day will die today from fentanyl  poisoning, 300 people died yesterday, and 300 people will die tomorrow  of fentanyl poisoning.                                time  1830    If an airliner carrying 300 people crashed every single day, within  the span of a week we would have declared a national emergency and  would have begun the work on solutions, but we haven't done that here.   If we don't pass this bill, when the emergency class-wide scheduling  order expires, law enforcement will no longer have the authority to  seize these extremely lethal drugs. Yes, you heard me right, they will  no longer have the authority.   As so many of my colleagues have said today, fentanyl is the leading  cause of death for individuals between the ages of 18 and 49,  surpassing COVID, cancer, heart disease, and even car accidents. In  fact, the DEA, Biden's DEA, you-all's DEA, says this is their number  one priority.   Every single one of us knows someone who has been affected by  fentanyl. Every single one of us in this Chamber knows who is  responsible for the fentanyl pouring into our country, and it is every  single one of our jobs to act and pass the HALT Fentanyl Act. Let's put  the politics aside, come together as Americans for our communities, for  this country.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
