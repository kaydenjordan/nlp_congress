 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Minnesota Farm  Bureau Federation President Kevin Paap, who will be retiring in  November.   Kevin has been president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau for 16 years,  during which time I and my team have been fortunate enough to work with  him very closely on many occasions.   In addition to being a selfless servant leader, Kevin Paap walks the  walk. He and his wife, Julie, own and operate a fourth-generation  family farm in Blue Earth County, Minnesota, where they grow corn and  soybeans.   Whenever I speak to Kevin, I am impressed by his commitment and focus  to improving the lives of Minnesota's farmers and advancing American  agriculture. He has been the advocate that our State's farm and ranch  community deserves, and we will be forever grateful for his work.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Kevin on his well-earned retirement. I  look forward to seeing him and his family again soon.                            ____________________
