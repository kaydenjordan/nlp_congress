 Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month,  I wish to recognize the extraordinary contributions of Cesar Millan.  Cesar has transformed the lives of countless people and dogs and has  also touched the hearts of people all over the world.   From humble beginnings in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico, working on his  grandfather Teodoro Millan Angulo's farm, Cesar came to the United  States undocumented and unable to speak English. He lives his dream  right here in America doing the job that he has always wanted to do, to  be the best dog and human trainer in the world.   Through his television series, ``The Dog Whisperer with Cesar  Millan,'' Cesar taught us how to understand our four-legged friends and  to better understand ourselves. He launched the Cesar Millan  Foundation, a nonprofit organization designed to support the rescue,  rehabilitation, and placement of abused and abandoned animals.   Cesar Millan has inspired us to become more compassionate, more  understanding, and more forgiving. As Cesar would say, better human,  better dog, better together.   Cesar is both a proud immigrant and a proud United States citizen.                            ____________________
