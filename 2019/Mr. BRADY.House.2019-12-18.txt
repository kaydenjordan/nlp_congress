 Madam Speaker, 21 years ago this week, I spoke here on  impeachment. Sadly, history will not treat Democrats well. They will  forever be remembered as the Senator Joe McCarthys of our time, so  blinded by their hatred of President Trump that they abandoned American  rights of due process, fairness, and just decency.   Reminiscent of Joe McCarthy, they assaulted the Constitution, took  glee in secret hearings, blocked evidence, and switched charges like  rogue prosecutors. Ultimately, they chose abuse of power because they  practice it so well.   President Trump committed no crime or impeachable offense--none. His  legacy won't be stained; Democrats' will. We will look back at these  days in shame because Trump haters in Congress, like red haters of the  past, are willing to plunge America into darkness for raw political  gain.   This impeachment betrays the Nation, the Constitution, and the  American people. I vote ``no.''                                time  1700
