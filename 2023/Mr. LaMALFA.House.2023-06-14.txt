 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and pay a  heartfelt tribute to Sergeant Cesar Sandoval of Willows, California.   Sergeant Sandoval's sudden and unexpected passing in April was a  devastating blow not only to his family but also to the communities of  Willows and Chico and all who knew him where he faithfully served as a  law enforcement officer for 29 years.   His loss reverberated through the hearts of all those who knew him,  leaving an indelible mark on his town, his neighbors, and the countless  lives he touched.   Throughout his career, he displayed an unwavering dedication to the  safety and well-being of the citizens he swore to protect. His  commitment to service was outstanding, and his love for his people  shone through every action he took as an officer and as an individual.   He worked diligently with Chico officials to tackle the issue of  homelessness in northern California, helping lead the Chico Police  Department's TARGET TEAM that worked closely with local resources to  assist those with mental illness, drug, and alcohol issues.   While Sergeant Sandoval's life was tragically cut short, his legacy  lives on in the hearts of his family, friends, colleagues, and the  countless lives he touched in his years of service.   As we mark his 51st birthday today, June 14, Flag Day, we honor his  memory and celebrate the legacy he left for the people in northern  California with his service. God bless him and his family.                            ____________________
