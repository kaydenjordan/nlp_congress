 Mr. President, the pending business in the U.S. Senate is  to set the stage procedurally so the Republican majority of 52 to 48  can repeal ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. That is what we are  about. That is the business of the day, the week, and probably the  weeks to come. So we are addressing that issue and others related to  the budget.   I would like to start by sharing a story that was told to me by a  family who I represent, Richard and Mary Laidman, who live in  Naperville, Illinois. They told me a story, and I will recount it to  you.         My 13-year-old son Sam was diagnosed with leukemia one day       after the ``no pre-existing conditions exclusions for       children''  [[Page S76]]       protection went into effect [under the Affordable Care Act.]       The good news is that the form of leukemia has, so far, been       effectively controlled by a magic-bullet drug. My son is       currently a very robust young man and in otherwise good       health (while the drug keeps him alive). The bad news is that       the drug, as I understand it, costs [Blue Cross Blue Shield]       about $10,000 a MONTH! Without even going into the issue of       ``Big Pharma'' pricing--    They wrote--       this means that it would take about $6 million to get my son       into his 60's. Obviously we are feeling dependent on all the       clauses of the [Affordable Care Act] right now--no pre-      existing conditions exclusions, no caps on benefits, allowing       Sam to stay on our health insurance plan till [he reaches]       age 26.    Mr. President, the bottom line according to the Laidman family of  Naperville, IL, is that the Affordable Care Act is critical to their  family's health and financial survival. That is what this debate is  about. It is not about talking about promises made in campaigns or  slogans one way or the other. It is about families like the Laidman  family in Naperville who understand that were it not for the provisions  in the Affordable Care Act, their son might not be here today or they  may be penniless.   That is what it was like in the old days. If you had a son with  leukemia and wanted to buy a family health insurance plan, good luck.  If they would sell it to you, you probably couldn't afford it. And  secondly, many policies had limits on how much they would pay. Listen  to what she tells us: $10,000 a month just for this drug that keeps her  son alive. There were policies that had $100,000 limits on the amount  they pay each year. Oh, they were affordable and cheap enough. What  would the Laidman family have done if that is all they had to turn to?   Sadly, we know thousands, perhaps millions, of families across  America face that. That is why the Affordable Care Act made a  difference. That is why it is inconceivable that the Republicans are  coming to the floor, saying they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act  without any replacement.   They have had 6 years to come up with a better idea, 6 years to come  up with a list of improvements, and they have failed and failed  miserably. Why? Because it is hard. It is difficult. We found that when  we wrote this law.   Let me concede a point to the Republican leader who was on the floor  this morning. I am ready to sit down. I think other Democrats are as  well. If you want to change and improve the Affordable Care Act to make  sure that American families like the Laidmans of Naperville have a  chance for these protections in a better situation, I want to be part  of it, and I have wanted to be part of it for 6 years. But the  Republican approach has been very simple: All we will propose is  repeal. We will not come up with an alternative.   It is catching up with them this week in Washington. Have you  noticed? Senators on the Republican side of the aisle and even some  House Republicans are saying publicly: You know, we really ought to  have a replacement.   It is not fair for us to say to America: We're going to repeal the  only protection you have. Trust us. Some day in the future we might  come up with a better plan.   The atmospherics have changed--maybe even changed with the President- elect. Remember a few weeks ago when he said he thought that provision  about the preexisting conditions was a good idea? Well, he is right,  and so is the provision to make sure you don't have limits under the  policy, the provision that allows the Laidmans to keep their son under  their family health insurance plan until he reaches the age of 26.   Yesterday, Mrs. Kellyanne Conway, Senior Advisor to President-Elect  Trump, was on a morning show, and she said: ``We don't want anyone who  currently has insurance to not have insurance.'' That is a good  statement. Then, when she was asked about whether the Republicans  should come up with a replacement, she went on to say: ``That would be  the ideal situation. Let's see what happens practically.''   Well, I don't know Mrs. Conway, but her observations square with what  we feel on this side of the aisle, and more and more Republicans are  starting to say publicly that it is irresponsible for us to repeal the  Affordable Care Act without an alternative. It invites chaos. We know  what is likely to occur. We know that if there is no replacement that  is as good or better, people are going to lose their health insurance.   Illinois' uninsured rate has dropped by 49 percent since the  Affordable Care Act was passed. A million residents in my State now  have health insurance who didn't have it before the Affordable Care  Act. Illinois seniors are saving on average $1,000 a piece on their  prescription drugs because we closed the doughnut hole in the  Affordable Care Act, which the Republicans now want to repeal. More  than 90,000 young people in Illinois have been able to stay on their  parents' health plan until age 26 under our current health care system,  and 4.7 million Illinoisans, such as the Laidman family, no longer have  annual or lifetime caps on benefits, and that protects them when there  is a sick member of their family and they need it the most. Under our  current health care system, 5.6 million Illinoisans with preexisting  conditions no longer have to fear denial of coverage or high premiums.   I am going to close with this brief reference. Remember the first  thing President-Elect Trump did when he went to visit the State where  they were going to keep 800 jobs and not transfer them overseas? He  took justifiable pride in the fact that he had jawboned the company  into deciding to keep at least some of the jobs in the United States-- 800 jobs. That is good. America needs companies to make the decision to  keep jobs here. We need all the good-paying jobs we can get,  particularly in manufacturing. But do you know what the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act means to jobs in Illinois? Well, the Illinois  Health and Hospital Care Association knows. They told us that it would  have a devastating impact on hospitals in Illinois. That includes many  rural downstate hospitals, the major employers in their community. They  estimate that we would lose between 84,000 and 95,000 jobs with the  repeal of the Affordable Care Act. We could have a press conference for  saving 800 jobs at Carrier, but are they going to have a press  conference and celebrate when they are killing 84,000 jobs in Illinois  with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act? They shouldn't. They should  do the responsible thing.   Let's work together. Let's make the Affordable Care Act better, more  affordable. We can do it, but the notion of repealing it first and then  promising to get around to a substitute later invites chaos. That is  going to make America sick again.   Mr. President, I yield.
