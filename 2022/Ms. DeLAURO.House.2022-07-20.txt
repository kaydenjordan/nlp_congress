 Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 1232, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The bipartisan en bloc amendment includes 29 proposals offered by my  Democratic and Republican colleagues. This bipartisan en bloc amendment  will make changes to the Financial Services bill, the Interior bill,  and the Military Construction bill.   For example, for the Financial Services bill, the amendment will  increase funding for entrepreneurial development programs by $6.7  million, increase funding for the Truman Foundation, and provide $5  million to help prevent fentanyl overdoses.   For Interior, the amendment will enhance activities for the  preservation of historically Black colleges and universities and civil  rights landmarks.   For military construction, the amendment will provide $1 million for  grants to assist States and Tribal organizations in establishing  veterans' cemeteries and support increased access to medical care for  veterans.   These are bipartisan proposals that we can all support, and I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).    Mr. Chairman, as I stated, this en bloc will make this  package stronger and meet the needs of the people who have entrusted in  us their faith that we can serve them and serve them well.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H6893]]         Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment offered by  Ms. Tlaib. Our Nation's policy toward Cuba over the past six decades  has proven to be ineffective and counterproductive. The Biden  administration has started to peel back some of these restrictive  policies in a manner that will both empower the Cuban people and  safeguard U.S. national security interests, and this amendment would  further these efforts.   This amendment would lift the longstanding restrictions on the  private financing of agricultural exports to Cuba, which harm U.S.  farmers and ranchers and their competitiveness. Cuba imports more than  $2 billion in agricultural exports per year.   Eliminating this longstanding prohibition would increase business for  our Nation's ranchers and farmers, and we would create jobs for  hardworking American families.   Let me give you an example. In 2021, the U.S. rice imports from  Vietnam were $12.6 million; Malaysia, $16 million; Thailand, $51  million; and Pakistan, $34 million. We are costing American taxpayers  dollars by importing  [[Page H6894]]  when we could be helping Alabama and Louisiana and be able to import  rice from Cuba at a lot lower cost.   Mr. Chair, I support the reforms that allow for better relationships  with Cuba, and I urge support for this amendment.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 1232, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), who is the chair of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman from Massachusetts an  additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who is the chairperson of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Ryan), the chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr.  Golden).    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey  (Ms. Sherrill).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, in the  engrossment of H.R. 8294, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-references, and to make such  other technical and conforming changes as may be necessary to reflect  the actions of the House.
