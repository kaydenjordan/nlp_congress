 Mr. Chair, I rise to share my concern regarding  potential budget reconciliation instructions to the House Oversight and  Government Reform Committee. These instructions could potentially  result in significant harm to federal employees and federal retirees,  many of whom I represent.   The national debt is a serious challenge that Congress must address,  but I urge members of this body to maintain the promises made to  federal employees at the time of their hiring. At a minimum, any  changes to federal employee retirement or benefits should only be made  on prospective employees, not current or former employees.
