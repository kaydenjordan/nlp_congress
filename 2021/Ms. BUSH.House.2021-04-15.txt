 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of YWCA USA, I include in the Record  a letter of support for H.R. 7.                                                           YWCA,                                                     April 13, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of YWCA USA, a network of       over 200 local associations in 45 states and the District of       Columbia, I write today to urge the Representative to support       the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) and vote no on harmful       amendments. As the economy continues to struggle under the       weight of the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affecting       women and marginalized communities, there is no better time       to take action to improve the economic security of women and       families and strengthen our economy. I urge you to pass this       bill without amendments that limit its scope or undermines       its critical protections.        For over 160 years, YWCA has been on a mission to eliminate       racism, empower women, and promote peace, justice, freedom,       and dignity for all. From our earliest days providing skills       and housing support to women entering the workforce in the       1850s, YWCA has been at the forefront of the most pressing       social movements--from voting rights to civil rights, from       affordable housing to pay equity, from violence prevention to       health care reform. Today, we serve over 2 million women,       girls and family members of all ages and backgrounds in more       than 1,200 communities each year.        Informed by our extensive history, the expertise of our       nationwide network, and our collective commitment to       advocating for the equity of women and families, we believe       that no one should have to choose between their livelihoods       and their health, family, or safety. Yet far too women and       families, including a disproportionate number of women and       families of color, must make this choice every day. This has       become more clear as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic       become more transparent. The impact of the pandemic has       fallen heavily on women and women of color. Women are       especially likely to be essential workers, but they are also       bearing the brunt of job losses, while shouldering increased       caregiving responsibilities that have pushed millions out of       the workforce entirely, resulting in an economic       ``Shesession''. Black women, Latinas, and other women of       color are especially likely to be on the front lines of the       crisis, risking their lives in jobs in health care, child       care, and grocery stores, all while being paid less than       their male counterparts.        The bipartisan Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) would help       close longstanding gender and racial wage gaps by updating       and strengthening the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and ensure robust       protections against sex-based pay discrimination. Today, on       average, women in the United States earn only 82 cents for       every dollar paid to men, amounting to an annual gender wage       gap of $10,157. Unfortunately, this gap is worse for women of       color. Among women who hold full-time, year-round jobs in the       United States, Black women are typically paid 63 cents,       Native American women 60 cents and Latinas just 55 cents for       every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. White, non-      Hispanic women are paid 79 cents and Asian American women 87       cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, and       Asian American and Pacific Islander women of some ethnic and       national backgrounds fare much worse. The COVID-19 global       pandemic has exposed deepening economic disparities, further       unveiling how the work performed primarily by women, and       particularly women of color, has long been and continues to       be undervalued and underpaid. It is time Congress addressed       these deepening disparities and take steps towards real       economic change for women by passing the Paycheck Fairness       Act. We cannot afford to shortchange women as a result of       persistent gender pay gaps and we urge the Representative to       pass this bill without delay.        YWCA USA urges the Representative to protect women's       economic security and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7)       and take critical steps towards strengthening women's       economic security, particularly at a time when the country       begins to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. At this pivotal       moment, Congress must take aggressive action to address the       economic disparities disproportionately affecting women and       women of color. We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act       (H.R. 7) without harmful amendments that weaken its critical       protections.        Thank you for your time and consideration.            Sincerely,                                                     Elisha Rhodes,                             Interim CEO & Chief Operating Officer.     Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise in full support of H.R.  7, the Paycheck Fairness Act.  [[Page H1816]]    As a nurse, I earned around 60 percent of what my White male  counterparts in the same position earned. I have often imagined how  many people in my district experienced the same burdens, like how much  overtime and missing wages we could have accrued every single month.   We have been chronically underpaid and chronically undervalued. I  have stood up to fight for underpaid nurses before and I stand here  today to fight for underpaid women, especially women of color  everywhere.   Pay Black, pay Brown, pay indigenous, pay AAPI women what we're  worth. Run us our money and run us our money now.    Madam Speaker, unfortunately, I missed today's vote on the  Fraud and Scam Reduction Act, as amended.   Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 104.
