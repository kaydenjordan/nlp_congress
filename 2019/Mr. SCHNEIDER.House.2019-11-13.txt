 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3537) to amend the Small Business Act to codify the Boots to  Business Program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3537           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives       of the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.           This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran Entrepreneurship       Training Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. BOOTS TO BUSINESS PROGRAM.           Section 32 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657b) is       amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:          ``(h) Boots to Business Program.--          ``(1) Covered individual defined.--In this subsection,       the term `covered individual' means--          ``(A) a member of the Armed Forces, including the       National Guard or Reserves;

and          ``(ii) include eligibility requirements for participating       in the Boots to Business Program.          ``(5) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this subsection and every year thereafter,       the Administrator shall submit to the Committee on Small       Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the Committee       on Small Business of the House of Representatives a report on       the performance and effectiveness of the Boots to Business       Program, which may be included as part of another report       submitted to such Committees by the Administrator, and which       shall include--          ``(A) information regarding grants awarded under       paragraph (4)(C);

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3537, the Veteran Entrepreneurship  Training Act of 2019, and I thank Mr. Spano for joining me in  introducing this legislation and helping lead this effort to improve  the program to ensure veterans can continue to take advantage of the  Boots to Business Program.   It is an honor to be here today to celebrate and honor our Nation's  veteran entrepreneurs. Just this week we celebrated Veterans Day and  last week we marked National Veterans Small Business Week.   Every member of the military has already demonstrated their love of  country by committing everything, including potentially their lives, in  the service of our Nation. When their service in uniform is completed,  many veterans direct their passion to starting a business. Such  dedication to Nation and community should be recognized every day. This  is patriotism and not a partisan issue.   That is why I am pleased that the Small Business Committee can once  again highlight how we put aside the differences we may have in some  areas and now bring these bipartisan bills to the floor today.   Entrepreneurship has always been a bedrock of the American economy,  particularly for our returning vets. That is why our committee is  focused on bipartisan solutions to repay our veterans through policies  designed to ease the risk of starting and running a business.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member Chabot,  as well as the committee staff, for working with us to increase the  opportunities and resources for veteran entrepreneurs.   H.R. 3537 bolsters the Small Business Administration's Boots to  Business Program to enhance our ability to ensure that it is  effectively serving aspiring veteran businessowners.   There are approximately 2.5 million veteran-owned businesses  generating $1 trillion in receipts. Such successes are a draw for many  of the men and women leaving the service today to become their own  bosses.   Entrepreneurship provides a promising opportunity to continue serving  their country, creating jobs in their local communities, while  supporting their families.   Empowering vets to succeed as entrepreneurs should be a viable option  for people trained to lead, inspire, and achieve remarkable things.  Their success spurs local economic development and demonstrates our  commitment to their aspirations of entrepreneurship.   But starting a business can be complex and sometimes daunting. The  process can seem overwhelming, but programs like Boots to Business  offer resources and assistance from experts, giving aspiring  entrepreneurs the lessons of others' previous experience.   Initially launched in 2012, the Boots to Business Program offers  transitioning servicemembers and military spouses insights into self- employment and business ownership. The Veterans Business Outreach  Centers are trained and empowered to deliver these services to over 180  military installations nationwide. In 2018, over 17,000 veterans,  servicemembers, and military spouses participated in the 2-day course.   Research has shown that servicemembers are distinctly qualified to  start and run their own businesses. While serving in the military, they  learn how to make good decisions in chaotic environments and are  natural, confident, and driven leaders.   Each year, more than 200,000 servicemembers make the transition from  military to civilian life. Transition assistance is critical to ensure  that those who serve in the military have opportunities for meaningful  employment.   H.R. 3537 addresses the many issues we have heard from veterans by  updating many aspects of the program and also offering certainty by  codifying it for the next 5 years.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Mr. Spano and the committee for their work  on this important bill. I urge Members to support this bipartisan piece  of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Again, I want to thank my colleague, the ranking member, from Ohio.   By developing new products, advancing research, and creating new  markets, entrepreneurs are a vital force in our economy. Over the  years, we have repeatedly seen the important role veterans play in this  process.   Due to their leadership, training, perseverance, knowledge of  procurement processes, and other skills acquired in the military,  veterans are often exceptionally well qualified to launch and manage  their own business. In fact, veterans own one in ten small firms in our  country and support more than 5 million jobs.   Despite being positioned to succeed as entrepreneurs, servicemembers  transitioning into civilian life face obstacles starting their own  small business.   The Boots to Business Program is designed to alleviate these  challenges by providing a path to entrepreneurship for veterans without  compelling them to attend business school, which could mean more time  away from their families.   Boots to Business is unlike any other entrepreneurial development  program offered by the SBA, because its curriculum focuses on educating  servicemembers about the basic concepts of business, SBA resources,  real world insight, and how to manage expectations, and it is directly  tied in to their transition programming.   The Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act not only codifies the  program for the next 5 years, but also ensures that the information is  accessible and readily available to all servicemembers wishing to test  the waters of entrepreneurship.                                time  1300    At our hearing on the bill, Retired Army Captain Scott Davidson  perhaps  [[Page H8800]]  put it best when he described Boots to Business as helping  servicemembers take a ``step in the direction of entrepreneurship and  foster and channel the warrior ethos that had them succeed in the  military to boost success in the boardroom.''   H.R. 3537 is a commonsense move and one supported by The American  Legion.   I, again, thank my colleague Mr. Spano for joining me in introducing  this legislation.   We all duly and respectfully observed Veterans Day on Monday. Every  day, we must reinforce our obligation to servicemembers by giving them  the education and tools to seize the opportunity of entrepreneurship.   Again, I thank the chairwoman and ranking member for their support,  and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3661) to support entrepreneurs serving in the National Guard  and Reserve, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3661         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Patriotic Employer       Protection Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF LOAN ASSISTANCE AND DEFERRAL ELIGIBILITY                     TO RESERVISTS BEYOND PERIODS OF MILITARY                     CONFLICT.         (a) Small Business Act Amendments.--Section 7 of the Small       Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)(3)--        (A) in subparagraph (A)--        (i) by striking clause (ii);        (ii) by redesignating clause (i) as clause (ii);        (iii) by inserting before clause (ii), as so redesignated,       the following:        ``(i) the term `active service' has the meaning given that       term in section 101(d)(3) of title 10, United States Code;'';       and        (iv) in clause (ii), as so redesignated, by adding ``and''       at the end;        (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``being ordered to       active military duty during a period of military conflict''       and inserting ``being ordered to perform active service for a       period of more than 30 consecutive days'';        (C) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``active duty'' each       place it appears and inserting ``active service''; and        (D) in subparagraph (G)(ii)(II), by striking ``active       duty'' and inserting ``active service''; and        (2) in subsection (n)--        (A) in the subsection heading, by striking ``Active Duty''       and inserting ``Active Service'';        (B) in paragraph (1)--        (i) by striking subparagraph (C);        (ii) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as       subparagraphs (B) and (C), respectively;        (iii) by inserting before subparagraph (B), as so       redesignated, the following:        ``(A) Active service.--The term `active service' has the       meaning given that term in section 101(d)(3) of title 10,       United States Code.'';        (iv) in subparagraph (B), as so redesignated, by striking       ``ordered to active duty during a period of military       conflict'' and inserting ``ordered to perform active service       for a period of more than 30 consecutive days''; and        (v) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``active duty'' each       place it appears and inserting ``active service''; and        (C) in paragraph (2)(B), by striking ``active duty'' each       place it appears and inserting ``active service''.        (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by subsection       (a)(1) shall apply to an economic injury suffered or likely       to be suffered as the result of an essential employee being       ordered to perform active service (as defined in section       101(d)(3) of title 10, United States Code) for a period of       more than 30 consecutive days who is discharged or released       from such active service on or after the date of enactment of       this Act.        (c) Semiannual Report.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of enactment of this Act, and semiannually thereafter,       the President shall submit to the Committee on Small Business       and Entrepreneurship and the Committee on Appropriations of       the Senate and the Committee on Small Business and the       Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives a       report on the number of loans made under the Military       Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan program and the       dollar volume of those loans. The report shall contain the       subsidy rate of the disaster loan program as authorized under       section 7(b) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(b))       with the loans made under the Military Reservist Economic       Injury Disaster Loan program and without those loans       included.        (d) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--Section 8(l) of       the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(l)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``The Administration'' and inserting the       following:        ``(1) In general.--The Administration'';        (2) by striking ``(as defined in section 7(n)(1))''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) Definition of period of military conflict.--In this       subsection, the term `period of military conflict' means--        ``(A) a period of war declared by the Congress;        ``(B) a period of national emergency declared by the       Congress or by the President; or        ``(C) a period of a contingency operation, as defined in       section 101(a) of title 10, United States Code.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3661, the Patriotic  Employer Protection Act of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, this commonsense legislation recognizes the service of  our reservists and the companies they work at by broadening the ability  of small business employers to access loans when a reservist is  deployed.   Across the country, small business owners are doing the right thing  by actively employing military reservists. Congress recognized the  strain a small business can be under when key employees are deployed on  missions. That is why this distinguished body created the SBA's  military reservist programs, which are the Military Reservist Economic  Injury Disaster Loan program and the Repayment Deferral for Active Duty  Reservists program. These two programs provide emergency working  capital and loan flexibility to small business owners who have an  essential employee who is an Active Duty reservist called into action.   Over the past decade, our Reserve Forces have experienced a shift  from a strategic reserve to an operational reserve. This bill addresses  that shift by expanding the pool of eligible reservists through a  restructuring of the programs so they are not limited to periods of  conflict.   This seemingly minor modification, in addition to increased  coordination between the SBA and the National Guard Bureau and State  Adjutants General, will lead to targeted outreach and education about  the programs while also modernizing them to meet the needs of today's  small employers.   I thank Congressman Kim and Congressman Burchett for working with me  to improve access to affordable capital for small businesses,  especially those owned by or who employ reservists.  [[Page H8801]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bipartisan piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield such time  as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Kim), my friend  and colleague who is a sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, commend and thank Representative Kim and  Representative Burchett for their leadership on this. The Small  Business Committee, as a whole, commends those small business owners  who support their employees serving in the National Guard and Reserves  and thereby support our national security.   Reservists can be called away at a moment's notice and fulfill their  duty in a variety of ways. For instance, we rely on them during our  most vulnerable times, like during natural disasters, and they can be  tapped to serve abroad when needed and necessary.   They protect us and our communities by leaving their lives and  communities behind. Though they may be called upon temporarily, their  absence is sorely noticed by their families and employers who rely upon  them.   The bill before us today, H.R. 3661, takes their absence into  consideration by reflecting how our Nation has changed the way we call  upon them. By making the SBA's Military Reservist Economic Injury  Disaster Loan and Repayment Deferral for Active Duty Reservists  programs more accessible to servicemembers and their employers, we are  helping to sustain small businesses, families, and local communities.   This legislation makes sure that the SBA can be a resource for when  employers support their workers while on deployment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  [[Page H8802]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 499) to amend the Small Business Act to clarify the  treatment of certain surviving spouses under the definition of small  business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 499         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Service-Disabled Veterans       Small Business Continuation Act''.       SEC. 2. TECHNICAL AMENDMENT REGARDING TREATMENT OF CERTAIN                     SURVIVING SPOUSES UNDER THE DEFINITION OF SMALL                     BUSINESS CONCERN OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY                     SERVICE-DISABLED VETERANS.         Effective on the date specified in subsection (e) of       section 1832 of the National Defense Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328; 130 Stat. 2660),       section 3(q)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(q))       is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (C)(i)(II), by striking ``rated as 100       percent'' and all that follows through ``service-connected       disability''; and        (2) by amending subparagraph (C)(ii)(III) to read as       follows:        ``(III) the date that--         ``(aa) in the case of a surviving spouse of a veteran with       a service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling       or who dies as a result of a service-connected disability, is       10 years after the date of the death of the veteran; or        ``(bb) in the case of a surviving spouse of a veteran with       a service-connected disability rated as less than 100 percent       disabling who does not die as a result of a service-connected       disability, is 3 years after the date of the death of the       veteran.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 499, the Service- Disabled Veterans Small Business Continuation Act, which protects small  businesses owned by disabled veterans by providing a transitionary  period to keep service-disabled veteran-owned small business status in  the event of the business owner's death. This bill codifies our  intention to bridge the differences between the SBA and VA by  establishing uniformity.   We know that running a small business often involves many members of  a family. By extending surviving spousal rights to the SDVOSB  definition, we are honoring the sacrifice a deceased veteran previously  made for our country. We are also providing stability for the business  and its employees to ensure that they can remain competitive, rather  than being effectively penalized by the death of the service-disabled  veteran business owner.   I thank Ranking Member Chabot and Mr. Delgado for working together to  ensure that when a disabled veteran business owner passes, the law does  not impose insult to injury by penalizing the surviving spouse.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bipartisan piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Delgado).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, both the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Small  Business Administration value the sacrifices of America's veterans and,  in particular, we note today, service-disabled veterans who remain  committed to their country by starting small firms.   In that vein, the VA and the SBA have contracting preferences for  service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Despite the success of  these programs, neither adequately address what happens when the  service-disabled veteran owner dies. The death of a loved one by  itself, an already devastating event, is compounded by needing to  attend to the duties of running his or her small business and it is  often debilitating.    The sudden death of a veteran whose small business relies upon a  contracting preference takes a toll on the spouse of the deceased  veteran, the business operations, and the business' employees.   H.R. 499 establishes much-needed certainty by rectifying inherently  critical oversight. Setting forth the rules by which a surviving spouse  can retain the service-disabled veteran-owned small business status  honors the dedication of the veteran, the surviving spouse, and their  business.   The government has a responsibility to ensure those who give so much  to their country have the opportunity for their small business passions  to survive and prosper, even upon death.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3734) to require the Comptroller General of the United  States to report on access to credit for small business concerns owned  and controlled by covered individuals, to require the Administrator of  the Small Business Administration to report on the veterans interagency  task force, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3734         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Successful Entrepreneurship       for Reservists and Veterans Act'' or the ``SERV Act''.       SEC. 2. REPORTING REQUIREMENT FOR VETERANS INTERAGENCY TASK                     FORCE.         Section 32(c) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657b(c))       is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(4) Report.--Along with the budget justification       documents for the Small Business Administration submitted to       Congress in connection with the budget for a fiscal year       submitted under 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the       Administrator shall submit a report--        ``(A) discussing the appointments made to and activities of       the task force; and        ``(B) identifying and outlining a plan for outreach and       promotion of the programs and services for veterans,       including Veteran Business Outreach Centers, Boots to       Business, Boots to Business Reboot, Service-Disabled       Entrepreneurship Development Training Program, Veteran       Institute for Procurement, Women Veteran Entrepreneurship       Training Program, and Veteran Women Igniting the Spirit of       Entrepreneurship.''.       SEC. 3. GAO REPORT ON ACCESS TO CREDIT.         (a) Report on Access to Credit.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the       United States shall submit a report on the ability of small       business concerns owned and controlled by covered individuals       to access credit to--        (A) the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Committee on       Small Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate; and        (B) the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Committee on       Small Business of the House of Representatives.        (2) Contents.--The report submitted under paragraph (1)       shall include, to the extent practicable, an analysis of--        (A) the sources of credit used by small business concerns       owned and controlled by covered individuals and the average       percentage of the credit obtained from each source by such       concerns;        (B) the default rate for small business concerns owned and       controlled by covered individuals, disaggregated by each       source of credit described in subparagraph (A), as compared       to the default rate for the source of credit for small       business concerns generally;        (C) the Federal lending programs available to provide       credit to small business concerns owned and controlled by       covered individuals;        (D) gaps, if any, in the availability of credit for small       business concerns owned and controlled by covered individuals       that are not being filled by the Federal Government or       private sources;        (E) obstacles faced by covered individuals in trying to       access credit;        (F) the extent to which deployment and other military       responsibilities affect the credit history of veterans and       Reservists; and        (G) the extent to which covered individuals are aware of       Federal programs targeted towards helping covered individuals       access credit.        (b) Definitions.--In this Act:        (1) Covered individual.--The term ``covered individual''       means--        (A) a veteran;        (B) a service-disabled veteran;        (C) a Reservist;        (D) the spouse of an individual described in subparagraph       (A), (B), or (C); or        (E) the spouse of a member of the Armed Forces.        (2) Reservist.--The term ``Reservist'' means a member of a       reserve component of the Armed Forces, as described in       section 10101 of title 10, United States Code.        (3) Small business act definitions.--The terms ``service-      disabled veteran'', ``small business concern'', and       ``veteran'' have the meanings given those terms,       respectively, under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 632).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3734, the Successful  Entrepreneurship for Reservists, or SERV Act.   The SBA offers several programs to help aspiring and existing veteran  entrepreneurs launch and grow their small businesses. But as valuable  as they are, more must be done to promote these programs to guarantee  that our veterans are aware of them and utilizing them.  [[Page H8804]]    The Interagency Task Force on Veterans Small Business Development was  established to do just that. The task force is chaired by the SBA and  is comprised of representatives appointed by the SBA's administrator  from a variety of agencies, including: the SBA's Office of Veterans  Business Development, Department of Defense, Department of Labor,  Department of the Treasury, Veterans' Affairs, General Services  Administration, Office of Management and Budget, and four  representatives from veterans service and military organizations.   The task force is charged with coordinating efforts to improve  capital access, business development, and contracting goals for  veterans. Unfortunately, it hasn't filed an annual report since fiscal  year 2015. This delay is wholly unacceptable on its face. Considering  we heard from veterans about the needs for more outreach and  coordination of business services, it only makes the delay more  painful.   Today's legislation requires the SBA administrator to report annually  on the appointments made, highlighting the activities of and plan for  outreach and engagement by the Interagency Task Force on Veterans Small  Business Development.   Annual reporting will give Congress the visibility over the task  force responsible for serving our veterans at SBA and the ability to  provide proper oversight. Gathering a regular snapshot of the program  will enable Congress to make modifications where they are needed in a  timely fashion.   I want to thank Ms. Davids and Ranking Member Chabot for their  collaboration on this bill. I urge Members to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Davids), my good friend and cosponsor  of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Assisting entrepreneurs requires integrated, comprehensive solutions  that leverage a combination of government and private efforts. Despite  progress we have made, hundreds of thousands of veterans and their  families continue to struggle, demonstrating how much more must be  done.   The interagency veterans task force is a critical part of this  effort, and we must hold agencies accountable for ensuring they are  meeting the duties placed upon them to maximize outreach to our  servicemembers. H.R. 3734 does just this by requiring regular reporting  by the task force to gather snapshots of programmatic outreach and  education to veterans.   It also asks the Government Accountability Office to study the many  issues raised by veteran entrepreneurs facing difficulty accessing  credit so that this body can better understand the financing needs of  veterans. Doing so enables us to take additional steps to ease the  burdens of not just transitioning back to civilian life, but also  risking more to start a business.   It is incumbent upon all of us to ensure that resources reach the  veterans  [[Page H8805]]  and servicemembers held in such high regard.   I sincerely thank Ms. Davids for spearheading this bill and working  with Ranking Member Chabot to make certain we hold agencies, through  the task force, accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1615) to transfer the responsibility of verifying small  business concerns owned and controlled by veterans or service-disabled  veterans to the Small Business Administration, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

SEC. 10. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1615, the Verification  Alignment and Service-Disabled Business Adjustment Act, or the VA-SBA  Act.   I want to first take this opportunity to thank Chairman Takano and  Ranking Member Roe of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. This bill is  a culmination of years of collaboration to ensure we are doing right by  our Nation's veteran business owners. I thank the gentlemen for their  cooperation and recognize the staff of our respective committees, both  majority and minority, for seeing this effort through.   Mr. Speaker, considering how veteran-owned businesses increase  competition and solidify our industrial base, Congress created the  SBA's Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, SDVOSB, program to  maximize their participation in the Federal marketplace.   In 2018, the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business  procurement program awarded $20.6 billion to over 180,000 contracts.  Such awards accounted for approximately 4.27 percent of all contracts,  exceeding the 3 percent statutory goal.   While this accomplishment should be applauded, the structure and  resources of the program have not kept pace with the growth. Currently,  the Department of Veterans Affairs requires all participants to go  through a rigorous certification process. In contrast, the SBA allows  businesses to self-certify that they meet the regulatory threshold.   The problem with two certification processes is simple: It creates  confusion for business owners and contracting officers alike.   This bill harmonizes the two conflicting contracting programs by  eliminating the VA certification and transferring it to the SBA. It  also institutes a certification process under the SBA program to  prevent concerns of fraud and abuse.   I thank all the members of the respective committees who have  sponsored this bill, because it is certainly a step in the right  direction to eliminate duplication and confusion between the two  agencies. This bipartisan legislation will make it easier for the  veteran-owned business to do business with our government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bipartisan piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, November 4, 2019.      Hon. Nydia M. Velazquez,      Chairwoman, Committee on Small Business, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Velazquez: I am writing with respect to       H.R. 1615, the Verification Alignment and Service-Disabled       Business Adjustment Act. Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs regarding the matters in H.R.       1615 that fall within the Committee's jurisdiction.        As a result of your consultation with us on this measure       and in order to expeditiously move the bill to the floor, I       forego further consideration of H.R. 1615. The Committee on       Veterans' Affairs takes this action with our mutual       understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       the bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues that fall within our       jurisdiction. Further, I request your support for the       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs during any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding regarding H.R. 1615 and would       ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Committee Report and the Congressional Record       during floor consideration of the measure. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                                       Mark Takano,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Small Business,                                   Washington, DC, November 5, 2019.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano: Thank you for your letter regarding       the Committee on Veterans' Affairs jurisdictional interest in       H.R. 1615, the ``Verification Alignment and Service-Disabled       Business Adjustment Act'' and your willingness to forego       consideration of H.R. 1615 by your committee. I agree that       the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has a valid jurisdictional       interest in certain provisions of H.R. 1615 and that the       Committee's jurisdiction will not be adversely affected by       your decision to forego consideration of H.R. 1615. As you       have requested, I will support your request for an       appropriate appointment of outside conferees from your       Committee in the event of a House-Senate conference on this       or similar legislation should such a conference be convened.        Finally, I will include a copy of your letter and this       response in the Committee Report and in the Congressional       Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you       again for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                Nydia M. Velazquez,                                                        Chairwoman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As the largest purchaser of goods and services in the world, the  Federal Government is in a unique position to support veteran-owned  businesses, yet navigating this process remains complicated to many  veteran entrepreneurs.   One of the most challenging obstacles for veteran-owned businesses is  getting certified. This first step toward contracting with the Federal  Government is the most important, but also the most complex. This is  largely due to the fact that the SBA established its own program, which  applies government-wide, and the VA administrators established their  own program as well.   Although the two programs share the same goal, each has its own  participation requirements. Creating more confusion is the fact that  firms can self-certify for the SBA programs, ones verified by the VA  may not necessarily be found eligible to receive an SBA set-aside  contract, and vice versa.   Coordinating certifications between the SBA and the VA can allow the  Federal Government to reap the benefits of goods and services provided  by veteran-owned businesses.   Again, I would like to thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Roe.  Finally, I commend the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly) for  leading this long effort and continuing to keep the needs of our  veteran business owners in mind, as well as my colleague from Colorado  (Mr. Crow).   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
