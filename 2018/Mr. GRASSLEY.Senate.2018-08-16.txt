 Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to update  and extend the Missing Children's Assistance Act. Senators Feinstein,  Hatch, Klobuchar, and Portman have joined as original cosponsors, and I  thank these colleagues for their support. I also want to thank  Congressman Brett Guthrie and the chairman of the House Education  Committee, Virginia Foxx, for championing a related companion measure  in the other chamber.   The purpose of this bipartisan bill, entitled the Missing Children's  Assistance Act of 2018, is to ensure the continued availability of  federal resources for the work of missing children's organizations such  as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Since its  inception in 1984, the National Center has served as the official  national resource center and clearinghouse on missing and exploited  children. The National Center works in partnership with State child  protective services agencies to help locate children who go missing  from foster care. It also works in partnership with families, schools,  corporate and nonprofit entities, the FBI, the Marshals Service, and  the Secret Service, as well as other federal state and local entities,  to prevent child abductions and facilitate the recovery of children who  may become victims of sex trafficking. Each year, thousands of children  run away or go missing in the United States, which is why this work is  so important.   The names Johnny Gosch, Eugene Martin and Jetseta Gage, for example,  still bring heartbreak to all Iowans. Johnny Gosch was a 12-year-old  paperboy delivering newspapers in West Des Moines, Iowa, when he  disappeared in 1982. Two years later, 13-year-old Eugene Martin  disappeared in Des Moines, Iowa--also while delivering newspapers. And  10-year-old Jetseta Gage was kidnapped, raped, and murdered by a  convicted sex offender in rural Johnson County, Iowa in 2005. Theirs  are not isolated cases. Too many other children across the country have  had to cope with the physical and emotional trauma of being abducted,  trafficked or sexually exploited.   Under the legislation that I have proposed, the Justice Department  will continue to play an important role in implementing the Missing  Children's Assistance Act. Through its Office of Juvenile Justice and  Delinquency Prevention, the Department will continue to annually award  grants to the National Center and other nonprofit organizations to  further their important work of preventing and responding to offenses  committed against vulnerable children. Extending this authorized  funding at $40 million annually for five more years, as proposed in  this bill, will ensure that the Office can continue to support these  nonprofit organizations in their important efforts in public-private  partnerships with families, private entities, and federal, state,  local, and international law enforcement agencies.   The bipartisan legislation I have sponsored also includes several  important updates to the Missing Children's Act, which Congress last  reauthorized in 2013. Some of these reforms already are included in  another bipartisan bill, known as the Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act, which I sponsored and the Senate passed last year.  Other changes would help increase public awareness of methods to  prevent abductions and support the recovery of missing children.   The activities authorized by the Missing Children's Assistance Act  will expire on September 30th unless Congress acts quickly to adopt a  reauthorization measure. As a parent, as a grandparent, I call on my  colleagues to join me in supporting the prompt passage of this bill.
