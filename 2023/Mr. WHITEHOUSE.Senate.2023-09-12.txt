 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I am very happy to be here and resolve  a--I guess, celebrate the resolution of a longstanding wrong done to  the American people. Senator Stabenow can correct me if I am wrong, but  my recollection is that the ban that Congress put on Medicare  negotiating with the pharmaceutical companies the way, say, the  Veterans' Administration already does was a magical appearance of  [[Page S4378]]  a tiny little bit of language, not in the Senate, not in the House, but  in the secret confines of the conference committee that merged the two  bills.   It just slipped in as a sentence. Nobody took credit for it. I still  can't identify who slipped that thing in there; but once it got slipped  in, the pharmaceutical industry defended it with all the venom and  power and money and muscle that they had. And we beat them. We took it  away.   Now, just like the Veterans' Administration, Medicare gets to  negotiate and drive prices down, and that is going to make a big  difference for Rhode Islanders with diabetes, with cancer, with blood  clots, with heart disease, with rheumatoid arthritis. This happened  because all of us--Senate Democrats--got together, stuck to our guns,  and made it happen through the Inflation Reduction Act which came out  of the Budget Committee, originally--the authorization. We are lowering  the prices of these 10 very expensive drugs; and even though the  pharmaceutical industry is going to try to wrassle around in court, it  is pretty hard to say that Medicare doesn't have the same authority  that its sister Agency, the Veterans' Administration, has to negotiate  for pharmaceuticals.   It shows how much they will try to try to get that little slippery  sentence that got slipped into that bill back to defend their price  gouging.   Vaccines are now free with Medicare. Insulin is capped at $35 a  month. Drug companies are penalized if they jack up their prices higher  than the rate of inflation. A $3,250 cap on out-of-pocket spending for  seniors is just about to go into effect, and the next year it drops to  a $2,000 limit. I think that will cover 11,000 Rhode Islanders who now  pay higher out-of-pocket costs than those.   These changes will save tens of thousands of Medicare Part D  enrollees in Rhode Island over $23 million. That is a big number in our  small State. I would like to think that the Inflation Reduction Act was  bipartisan. It would be great if this had passed with bipartisan  support. It didn't. Not a single Republican vote came. I regret that,  but we are going to continue. There is more progress to be made. We  have shown that it can be done.   And while we are at it, we need to strengthen Medicare--both Social  Security and Medicare, and we have a bill that has had its hearing in  the Budget Committee to strengthen Social Security and Medicare by  making people who are making over $400,000 a year and the superrich-- who hide their income through all sorts of tricks so it doesn't show up  as regular income--pay a fair share, support these essential programs.   So we can celebrate a win today, and we can go forward with  confidence to future wins.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of  2023--the FRA, by its initials--which Congress passed 3 months ago,  represented a bipartisan agreement. It resolved a manufactured default  crisis. It avoided an economic catastrophe that was threatened, and it  set funding levels for the upcoming year. Pursuant to section 121 of  that Act, I previously filed, on June 21, budgetary aggregates and  committee allocations for fiscal year 2024. Today, I am adjusting those  levels to account for Senate amendment No. 1092 to H.R. 4366, the  proposed package making appropriations for the fiscal year ending  September 30, 2024.   This first package includes the fiscal year 2024 Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies; Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies; and Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  appropriations bills.   Section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act  of 1985, as amended by the FRA, establishes statutory limits on  discretionary funding levels for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, and allows  for adjustments to those limits. Sections 302 and 314(a) of the  Congressional Budget Act allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  revise the allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those  adjustments. Senate amendment No. 1092 is eligible for an adjustment.  Division C, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and  Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2024, includes $10.8 billion of  budget authority and $8.3 billion of outlays that are designated as  emergency funding. The emergency funding in this division is consistent  with the bipartisan agreement tied to the enactment of the FRA.   In addition, the Senate Appropriations Committee has reported eight  other bills that include funding eligible for an adjustment. I am also  making those adjustments in today's filing.   In total, I am revising the allocation to the Appropriations  Committee by $62.2 billion of budget authority and $23.8 billion of  outlays. Excluding off-budget amounts, I am revising the budgetary  aggregates by $61.9 billion of budget authority and $23.5 billion of  outlays.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these accompanying  tables, which provide details about the adjustment filing, be printed  in the Record at the conclusion of these remarks.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:        REVISIONS TO BUDGET AGGREGATES--BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS   (Pursuant to Section 121 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and           Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974)                              ($ in billion) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            2024 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                4,878.570     Outlays....................................                5,056.741 Adjustment:     Budget Authority...........................                   61.854     Outlays....................................                   23.541 Revised Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                4,940.424     Outlays....................................                5,080.282 ------------------------------------------------------------------------      REVISIONS TO THE ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2024   (Pursuant to Section 121 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and           Section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974)                              ($ in billions) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Current                   Revised                                     Allocation  Adjustments   Allocation ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Revised Security Budget Authority      886.349        8.000      894.349 Revised Nonsecurity Budget             703.651       54.198      757.849  Authority.......................

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murray, I ask  unanimous consent that the following report from the Committee on  Appropriations be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Further Revised Allocation to Subcommittees of Budget Totals for Fiscal                                 Year 2024         The Committee on Appropriations submits the following       report revising the allocations to its subcommittees for       fiscal year 2024 set forth in Senate Report 118-45 (June 22,       2023) and revised in Senate Report 118-57 (July 12, 2023),       Senate Report 118-69 (July 19, 2023), and Senate Report 118-      78 (July 26, 2023).        Section 302(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as       amended, provides that at any time after a committee reports       its allocations, such committee may report to its House an       alteration of such allocations. This report is submitted       pursuant to this section.        Under the provisions of section 301(a) of the Congressional       Budget Act, the Congress shall complete action on a       concurrent resolution on the budget no later than April 15 of       each year. The Congressional Budget Act requires that, as       soon as practicable after a concurrent resolution on the       budget is agreed to, the Committee on Appropriations shall       submit to the Senate a report subdividing among its       subcommittees the new budget authority and total outlays       allocated to the Committee in the joint explanatory statement       accompanying the conference report on such a resolution.        On June 3, 2023, the President approved the Fiscal       Responsibility Act of 2023. Section 121 of that act provides       for the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget to file an       allocation, consistent with the terms of the Fiscal  [[Page S4419]]       Responsibility Act, to serve as a section 302(a) allocation       for purposes of budget enforcement in the Senate. The       allocation was filed by the Chairman of the Budget Committee       on June 21, 2023 (Congressional Record pp. S2180-S2181).        The Committee notes that, under the terms of section 251 of       the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of       1985, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget may       increase the 302(a) allocation of the Committee on       Appropriations if certain conditions relating to funding of       specific programs are met. These provisions address such       programs as the costs of emergencies (sec. 251(b)(2)(A)(i)),       continuing disability reviews and redeterminations (sec.       251(b)(2)(B)), healthcare fraud and abuse control (sec.       251(b)(2)(C)), disaster funding (sec. 251(b)(2)(D)),       reemployment services and eligibility assessments (sec.       251(b)(2)(E)), and wildfire suppression (sec. 251(b)(2)(F)).
