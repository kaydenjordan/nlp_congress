 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to  address the House and people across the country.   I am joined today by two of my friends, Jared Huffman, Congressman  from northern California; and Dan Kildee, Congressman from Flint,  Michigan.   We are here on another very important topic. We just heard our  friend, Jamie Raskin from Maryland, talking about gun violence and the  need to try to limit that and bring it under control, but today we have  another very important topic, a very troubling topic, and it has to do  with the sovereignty of our Nation.                                time  1730    It has to do with our freedom, and it is really as pretty simple as  that.   This country separated from England so that we could be a sovereign  nation, so that we could rule ourselves, and right now that is a real  big question as to whether or not that is happening, because it is  clear that the Russians interfered with our elections last year.   The investigation into that interference now has resulted in at least  13 indictments of Russians, coupled with indictments of 5 or 6 people,  5 of whom have pled guilty to some crime or another based upon the  investigation conducted by Robert Mueller. There seems to be something  going on between the Trump administration and Russia, and we want to  know what it is. The investigation is directed at that.   Mr. Speaker, it starts with something that we asked for last year. We  asked to see the President's tax returns. We asked for it on a number  of occasions. But unlike anybody else who has run for President or who  has been President, our President has refused to turn over his tax  returns.   So the question we ask is: Why? What is in there that would stop him  from producing his tax returns? Is it a relationship that shows some  kind of financial connection to Russia or the like? What is in there?  Is he hiding something? What is it?   As time has gone on, starting with that question, we have some more  questions. There has been this effort, beginning last summer, to  question the integrity of the FBI and to question Mr. Mueller and this  investigation to the point there was word that Mr. Mueller was going to  be fired from his job last summer, and that question seems to percolate  to the surface every so often.   And the question is: Why? What are they afraid of that he might find?  What connections are they worried about that Mr. Mueller may uncover  that really are hurting our Nation? So what is it that they are hiding?  What are they afraid of?   These are very simple questions that need to be answered. This is  important because this goes back to the heart of why our Nation was  founded and the heart of all of us as Americans. It is our sovereignty,  and it is our freedom. And if, in fact, we are being directed, our  government is being directed by a foreign entity, by Vladimir Putin or  Russia, generally, then this country has been undermined to a degree  none of us could have ever seen coming.   Now, hopefully, that is not the case, but let's get this  investigation going.  [[Page H1473]]  Let's keep it going. Let's not impugn the integrity of our detectives,  the FBI, or the prosecutors who are trying to just find out what the  truth is. And any kinds of actions to really undermine that, whether it  is from here in the Congress or from the executive branch, it is like:  What are you afraid of? What are you hiding?   So just to kind of connect a couple more dots, something that I am  concerned about, and I know my friends are, too, is you go back to our  sovereignty, our freedom--and this Congress, Mr. Speaker--particularly  concerned about the interference by the Russians in our elections.  There is not any question that there has been some interference.   We know that the Russians are flexing their muscle around the world.  In fact, Putin, the other day, said: I have got nuclear weapons you  can't detect.   So they are flexing their muscles.   We as a Congress--419-3 in this House, and 98-2 in the Senate,  virtually unanimously--said: We want you to be imposing sanctions  against this Russian interference, against some things that they have  been doing around the world.   Not one sanction has been added by the Trump administration. Why not?   Even more perplexing, the State Department has been appropriated, Mr.  Speaker, $120 million to prevent further espionage and interference by  the Russians in our elections. Do you know how much money has been  spent by them, by the State Department under this White House, to stop  this interference, to stop this espionage? Not one dollar.   These departments generally say we need more money to do X, Y, or Z.  Here, something so important as to the integrity of our elections, not  $1 spent by the State Department, despite the fact that this Congress  appropriated $120 million. Why not?   So a lot of questions are out there. I think it is time, and I think  my friends will make some comments and statements similar to mine: What  are you afraid of? What are you hiding? Let the detectives in the FBI,  let the prosecutors do their job.   Why aren't sanctions being imposed? And why aren't we using the money  we have appropriated to spend against this espionage and interference?  Why aren't you spending it?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman)  to see if he has any answers or if he only has questions about what is  going on.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Kildee), and he will make some comments about how he perceives all  of this, and then I am going to open it up to a little conversation  among the three of us.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan for his  comments. And he was talking about the 17 indictments. We have a poster  here. Starting over on the far side of this poster to my right is Paul  Manafort, the campaign chairman. Then we have 13 Russians who have been  indicted, plus three Russian companies that interfered with our  elections, and we will see how these indictments and the cases unfold,  but Bob Mueller and the team have said those people should be indicted.   This side, we have guilty pleas by Michael Flynn, National Security  Advisor; Rick Gates, assistant campaign manager; George Papadopoulos,  campaign adviser; Richard Pinedo, apparently he did some kind of--stole  identity from somebody; and a lawyer, Alex van der Zwaan, from--he is a  foreign lawyer who worked for a firm here in the United States. We have  five guilty pleas. We have 14, 15, 16 indictments. There is a lot of  smoke. Where there is smoke, there is fire.   Mr. Kildee talked about sort of the bread-and-butter issues: Do I  have a good job? Am I ready as the economy changes and innovation kicks  in; am I going to be ready for the next job? You know, do we have the  proper infrastructure for this country so that for the next 50 years we  can compete with anybody at any time?   I mean, those are the conversations we really want to have. But when  you get down to it, at the very heart of why we are America, why we are  the United States of America, it is about our freedom. It is about the  sovereignty of this Nation to conduct its own affairs without  interference by another entity: Russia, England, Japan, North Korea, it  doesn't matter. We want to take care of ourselves and not be told what  to do by others.   That interference from outside of this country, despite these big  questions we have as to our infrastructure, our future of our  workplace, our education, when it comes to freedom, you don't step  away. You don't ignore attacks on our freedom.   And we are not going to let that happen. I am just very pleased that  these two men joining me today, and Democrats, really, throughout this  Chamber, and I know some Republicans, are very concerned about what is  unfolding. And all of us are asking: What is the problem here? What are  you hiding? What are you afraid of? Why won't you let the detectives do  their work?   Sam Nunberg, he was going to--last night, he was on all the TV  stations: I am not going to honor that subpoena. What is he afraid of?   We have been joined by our friend Jamie Raskin, but, first, let me  give him a second to catch his breath.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from northern California (Mr.  Huffman) for a comment or two, and then I will yield to Mr. Raskin.    Mr. Speaker, you know, we have got to say to the  Speaker and to the other Republicans in this Chamber, you know, they  need to do their job on this thing. This isn't just something that is  peanuts. This goes to the heart of what America is all about: our  freedom and our sovereignty.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Maryland for  participating with us. We are going to be doing this because we want  people asking this question all across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield now to my friend from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) to  let him close us out.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, I thank Mr.  Huffman, and I thank Mr. Raskin for their comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 5 o'clock and 57 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, March 8, 2018, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
