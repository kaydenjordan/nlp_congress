 Madam Speaker, this bill, the Equality Act, is nothing  more than an identity politic sellout, a thinly veiled attempt to  attack and coerce individuals who hold serious and legitimate concerns  or objections to things like parental rights to make healthcare  decisions for their children; the ability of women to compete on an  equal athletic playing field; and even medical procedures like  sterilization and abortion.   I am a physician and I have been practicing medicine for over 35  years. This bill, if enacted, would mandate that healthcare  practitioners and even facilities like Catholic hospitals would be  forced to provide and participate in procedures like abortion, which  ends a human life.   We should all be able to agree that a Catholic hospital should never  be compelled by the government to offer procedures like abortion that  they morally object to in the strongest possible terms.   Furthermore, if society continues to support politically correct  gender identity politics, the science is becoming clearer that gender  dysphoria, especially in children, is a psychiatric condition that in  most cases will resolve itself with time.   Instead, however, this bill would require parents to allow  irreversible medical interventions for their children, children who may  even be prepubescent, resulting in sterilization, and oftentimes later  regret.                                time  2015    Scientific data confirms that many who undergo gender transition  continue to deal with serious depression, even after full transition.  And the poorly named ``Equality Act'' would mandate that medical  professionals accept and support the desire of their patients to  undergo these invasive procedures, even if they have professional or  conscience objections.   Madam Speaker, in response, I will be reintroducing the Conscience  Protection Act this week. My bill will protect healthcare providers  from being required to perform abortions or sterilizations and allow  them to continue practicing medicine without duress or coercion from  their employer or perhaps even their patients.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor my bill, and I  oppose the so-called Equality Act on the floor this week.
