 Madam Speaker, I rise to demand, insist, and  beseech President Trump to end this shutdown now and open the Federal  Government.   I represent the fifth largest number of Federal Government employees.  Every day I see, I hear, and I feel the pain and suffering of the  Federal Government employees and contractors in my neighborhoods and my  communities. One out of every ten residents in my Maryland district  live in a household headed by a Federal Government employee or  contractor.   This Monday at a community event supporting our Federal employees, I  met a woman with her 2-month-old infant child. She is an essential  employee at the Food and Drug Administration. She needs to be and wants  to be on the job, but she simply can't. She can't because she can't  afford to pay for childcare for her infant daughter.   She is having difficulty paying for groceries, providing lunch money  for her two elementary school-aged boys, and is on the verge of not  being able to pay either her rent or her car note.   She was sobbing uncontrollably. She was weeping painfully, and  pleading for you, Mr. President, to open the government, to let her  work with dignity, to support her children, and to do her job.  [[Page H1196]]    President Trump, end this shutdown now.
