 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I know that your committee, Energy and Commerce, has a full  legislative load, and you prioritized this and made the time so that we  could bring this to the floor in a timely fashion because it means so  much.   As our distinguished colleague from Florida, Congresswoman Frankel,  said, my, my. Here we are.   I rise today in strong support of the Right to Contraception Act,  which is to defend access to birth control from the radical rightwing  assault on reproductive rights.   It is outrageous that nearly 60 years after Griswold was decided,  women must, once again, fight for fundamental freedom to determine the  size and timing of their families or if they even want young people  having contraception in their exercise of freedom.   But as Republicans turn back the clock on contraception, Democrats  today are making it clear we are not going back.   I wonder if some of our colleagues, or even people who are advocating  to prevent contraception, know what is going on in their own families,  with their spouses or with their children, and the rest. Could it be  that they are all just not using contraception?   Again, thank you to Kathy Manning, our lead sponsor. She has been so  courageous so early on this subject, and I congratulate her and her  staff for being so ready, as I commend the chairman, for accommodating  the legislation.   I also join in thanking Sara Jacobs, Angie Craig, and Nikema  Williams, her cosponsors, on this legislation. Again, thank you,  Chairman Pallone for your support.   Let's be clear, that punishing and controlling women for using birth  control is just another plank in the Republican extreme agenda for  America, but House Democrats are fighting back.   Our Right to Contraception Act enshrines into law the unequivocal  statutory right to obtain and use contraception, and it protects  against any extremist State laws that would seek to restrict that  access.   That way, even if the radical Republican supermajority on the Supreme  Court succeeds in its mission to overturn Griswold, no American can be  denied the basic right to birth control through contraception.   This is a matter of women's health to prevent unintended pregnancies  and to treat or prevent many medical conditions.   Contraception is a medical tool beyond contraception. This is a  matter of economic justice. This is a kitchen-table issue for America's  families, as access to contraception is linked to higher rates of  education and employment, while reducing poverty.                                time  1030    This is an assault on lower-income people in our country, many of  them people of color. This is an economic justice assault, as well.   Importantly, this is a matter of fundamental freedom to make your own  [[Page H6937]]  decisions about your own body and your own life. Proudly, the people  are with us: 96 percent of voters agree that Americans should have  access to contraception.   By passing the Right to Contraception Act, House Democrats take  another strong step to protect freedom for women and for every  American.   Last week, our proud pro-choice, pro-women Democratic majority passed  two major bills to restore and protect health freedom.   Our Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act will protect  the fundamental right to travel and obtain needed healthcare. That  passed the House last week.   Our Women's Health Protection Act will restore the essential  protections of Roe v. Wade all across the country.   Republicans have been clear, Madam Speaker, and the Republican leader  in the Senate has been clear: The goal is to ban abortion in our  country. The Associate Justice of the Court has been clear; we have  only just begun to overturn women's rights and individual freedom and  privacy when it comes to interaction among us all.   Earlier this week, the House passed the landmark Respect for Marriage  Act to ensure that marriage equality remains the law of the land now  and for generations to come, whether it is interracial marriage,  whatever.   Let's be clear. Those who have opposed this vital legislation are  only revealing their dark desire to punish and control Americans' most  intimate and personal decisions.   Madam Speaker, those of us who have served here for a while can tell  you that House Republicans have been against contraception for decades.  I couldn't even get our colleagues to vote for natural family planning.   When the Catholic Church came to us and said we need a correction in  the law so that funds for natural family planning can go forth,  Republican colleagues said: Let us be clear. We are against family  planning domestically or internationally, globally.   We had one Republican vote with us and were able to pass the  legislation, as requested by the Catholic Church.   What is this about? They are against birth control, but they are for  controlling women. This is about servitude. This is about servitude.   We couldn't convince people. I would say to people that this isn't  just about abortion. I understand people's position on that. I come  from a pro-life family. I respect people's views. But this is about  more than that. This is about contraception, birth control, family  planning. But now it is clear.   Today, we will have a vote on the right to contraception, and we will  see where our Republican friends are. I hope they will be with us. We  don't put this bill forth to put you on the spot. We put this forth to  put women in control of their situation.   I ask those who oppose contraception, again, do you even know what is  going on in your own families? Why don't you ask? Do we need a session  on the birds and the bees to talk about why this is important? What is  going on here? Is the blind desire to have women controlled and in  servitude such that they don't even want to know the truth about family  planning and contraception?   It is never too late, even though you may have opposed this in the  past, to stand up for the rights of your wives, your daughters, your  granddaughters, and all of America's women.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong, hopefully bipartisan vote for the  Right to Contraception Act. I thank the makers of this motion; I thank  the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Manning) for her leadership,  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Jacobs), the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Ms. Williams), the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Craig), and  so many other cosponsors for their leadership. There is a long list of  cosponsors, over 150 immediately. I very much thank the chairman for  making this possible today.   Madam Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.
