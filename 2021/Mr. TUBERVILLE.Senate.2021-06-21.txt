 Madam President, before I begin, I want to first take  a moment and remember those that lost their lives in a horrific car  accident in Butler County, AL, this past weekend.   Ten people lost their lives. Nine of those were between the ages 9  months and 17 years old. A majority of those killed were in a  Tallapoosa County Girls Ranch bus. The girls ranch is an organization  that I have been involved with for 20 years. It handles young kids who  have been abused, young kids who have no parents. They start at this  ranch at most any age, and everything is paid for all the way through  graduation of college.   These kids were on a field trip coming from Baldwin County, AL, this  past weekend and were involved in this horrific crash. There are no  words that can bring comfort to these families or these children, but  my family and my staff and the people of Alabama are praying for peace  for all those affected during this unimaginable time.                          For the People Act of 2021    Madam President, as I and others have noted, Democrats call their  flagship voting bill For the People Act, but a better and more fitting  title is the ``Nancy Pelosi Power Grab Act.''   My Republican colleagues have done a good job of highlighting the  many flaws of this legislation in the last couple of weeks, including  doing away with commonsense fraud protection like voter ID, forcing  mandatory same-day registration on every State, allowing paid political  operatives to harvest voter ballots, and directing taxpayer dollars to  the campaigns of progressive politicians. Sadly, there is plenty more.   But let me also note that this recent ``compromise'' is anything but.  A compromise among Democrats should have been their starting offer to  Republicans, not their final offer.   The most recent versions still run afoul of the Constitution by  trampling on First Amendment rights of free speech and taking away  redistricting from the States. While ID is still required to vote, the  bill expands what kind of ID meets that requirement, such as a utility  bill. But the last time I looked, there was not a photo on our utility  bill. The most secure form of identification is a government-issued  photo ID. States shouldn't be forced to water that down.   Americans want faith and trust in the integrity of their election  process. This bill does not provide solutions to strengthen these  processes, and once Americans learn what is in this bill, they will  agree.   The Pelosi power grab yanks power from the States. The Pelosi power  grab lets politicians stuff their pockets with taxpayers' dollars. And  guess what, folks. A slightly different version of a Federal takeover  of elections is still a Federal takeover of elections. That is exactly  what this new version of S. 1 is. It is hard to even call this version  of S. 1 a compromise when the Democrats only compromise with Members of  their own party. This was not a bipartisan negotiation to get an end  product that both sides of the aisle could support. The last time I  checked, we still have a 50-50 Senate. There has been no negotiation  with our side.   But regardless of its form, this bill does not solve the problems  currently facing our election system; it makes the problems worse.   You know, in sports, one team changing the rules by themselves is  called cheating. It is seen for what it is--a power grab. It is  stacking the rules to win the game instead of doing the hard work  necessary to get the job done.   Folks may be scratching their heads as to why one political party  thinks they can completely change the rules of elections all by  themselves, but if you have been paying attention to what the  progressives have been up to recently, it won't come as a big surprise.  Changing our country as we know it is the end game. That is why they  want to pass this Pelosi power grab--so those who disagree with them  have a harder time winning at the ballot box.   But it is not just elections. Remember when they tried to hoodwink us  with defund the police last year? Remember when they tried to walk that  back? But they had made their position very clear. Now we are seeing  the same thing with education, as critical race theory is pushed on  school districts across the country. Simply put, critical race theory  reinforces divisions on strict racial lines. It doesn't teach kids  moral values, like treating everyone with respect regardless of race;  it is just the opposite. Critical race theory teaches kids to hate one  another. That is one thing schools should absolutely--absolutely--not  be teaching. But, again, for Democrats, it is about changing the way we  view our country.  [[Page S4646]]    What we should be focusing on is actually improving education all  over this country. The American people need to realize how far we have  fallen behind.   As columnist Mark Steyn wrote, ``Education is the biggest structural  defect in our society. We have an almost entirely corrupt and abusive  education establishment.''   Here is where that education establishment has gotten us: We are 37th  in the world in math, 13th in reading, and 18th in science. In 2019,  only 35 percent of our fourth graders were able to read at the fourth- grade reading level--35 percent. Embarrassing. That was lower than 2  years before, and it was before the teachers unions kept kids out of  school all of this past year. You can imagine how it is today. It is  unacceptable. It should be unacceptable to every Member of this body.   We have got China outpacing us in every industry and at every level  of our economy. But Democrats are too busy painting the United States  as the world's villain. How can we expect our young people to defend  the United States abroad if they don't learn about the things that make  America the greatest country in the history of the world?    We, as elected representatives of Americans across the country,  should be doing everything--and I mean everything--we can to create  opportunity and to protect the freedoms that make this country great.  It seems like folks across the aisle aren't interested in that. They  have a completely different vision of and for our country--one that  most Americans don't agree with at all.   I bet if you ask folks back home if they want a bigger government and  less State and local power, they would say no way. I bet if you asked  them if a Federal power grab sounds like a good idea, they would say  no. I bet if you ask them if they want their kids to learn to be more  divided by race, they would also say no. They would tell you they want  their freedoms protected. They would tell you they want the Federal  Government out of the way. They want an education for children that  provides opportunity because education is the key to freedom and  success. Education can unlock every student's God-given potential, but  critical race theory swallows that key. The Pelosi power grab just  fills the lock with cement.   Ladies and gentlemen, this For the People Act is one party's attempt  to rewrite the rules--rewrite the rules of the game in hope that they  will get a permanent advantage, plain and simple.   It is really a shame. We are spending so much time on bills that the  American people don't want, bills that don't have bipartisan support.  So I urge my colleagues to come together and find solutions that will  unite us as Americans, not divide us further as a country.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
