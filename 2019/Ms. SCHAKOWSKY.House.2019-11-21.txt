 Madam Chair, I thank Mr. Courtney for yielding, and I  proudly rise today in support of his legislation.   The frequency and scale of workplace violence are alarmingly high,  but no statistic, even the startling ones that we have learned about,  can fully reflect the pain, loss, and suffering that these incidents  can cause.   As we consider the bill before us today, I ask that you remember and  honor Pamela Knight.   Pamela was an AFSCME Council 31, Local 448 member. She worked for the  Illinois Department of Children and Family Services as a child  protection specialist.   She had been sent to take a 2-year-old child into protective custody  from an abusive father. As she got out of her car, Pamela was attacked  by the boy's father. Brutally beaten, Ms. Knight suffered blunt force  trauma to her head.   After 11 years on the job, she succumbed to her injuries, paying the  ultimate price for protecting children from abuse and neglect.   Pamela and her fellow DCFS employees are the front line of defense in  protecting children in Illinois and around the country. In this vital  work, they can encounter families in crisis stemming from poverty,  substance abuse, mental illness, and domestic violence.   For two decades, OSHA has worked with employers on voluntary  guidelines to address workplace violence, yet the rate of violence has  gone up.   Enough is enough. Today, we can do the right thing by Pamela Knight  and the unsung heroes in healthcare and social services by passing this  important, critical, and necessary piece of legislation.
