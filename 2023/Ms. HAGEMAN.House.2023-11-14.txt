 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment No.  105, which prohibits the Department of Labor from providing so-called  climate literacy training.   In September 2022, the Department of Labor released a ``Climate  Adaptation Plan.'' This plan identifies the Department as the agency  that developed the climate training and discloses that it is exploring  collaboration with other agencies for the purpose of promoting climate  literacy training.   Madam Chair, this climate literacy training is yet another example of  the extent to which radical climate hysteria has permeated every agency  and subagency within the Biden administration.   The Department of Labor's mission statement actually says that it is  responsible ``To foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage  earners, jobseekers, and retirees of the United States; improve working  conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and assure  work-related benefits and rights.''   Perhaps it would be a surprise to the Department of Labor, but  creating a Climate Adaptation Plan is not listed as either part of the  agency's mission or priorities, yet here we are.   It is time for the Biden administration to stop catering to a  politically radical agenda and actually focus on governing.   It is time for the Department of Labor to focus on its mission of  fostering, promoting, and developing the welfare of the wage earners,  jobseekers, and retirees.   The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the Department of Labor  does just that, that it focuses on its true mission and leaves the  politics of global warming out of it.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to send a message to the  DOL that we will no longer tolerate its foray into this nonsense.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, since President Biden took office, the  American worker has suffered a 3.1 percent pay cut caused in large part  by this administration's obsession with all things climate change and  its war on affordable energy. The dramatic increases in energy costs  have translated into higher costs for everything else, including food,  housing, clothing, entertainment, and travel.   This administration's war on affordable, domestic energy has thus  dramatically and negatively affected the very people that the DOL was  created to serve--the American worker.   In short, American energy independence is good for the American  worker, but the converse is also true; dependence on foreign-produced  energy is bad for the American worker. Yet, that is the very outcome of  these wrongheaded programs such as the DOL's climate literacy training.  Such training won't improve the lot of the American worker, it will  hurt it.   Last year, U.S. inflation-adjusted household income fell by the most  in over a decade. This reduction in income is the direct result of the  inflationary pressures caused by the Biden administration's energy and  climate policies.   These policies have also impacted our labor force participation rate,  which remains low and has never fully recovered since the pandemic.   There are serious labor issues to address in this country, and while  I would argue workforce development and job creation are not a role of  the Federal Government at all, so long as the Department of Labor  exists, it should be focused on how it will work with American  industries to foster a strong labor market.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment 106,  which prevents the Department of Labor from carrying out the  Environmental Justice grant activities described in its 2022 Climate  Adaptation Plan.   Similar to my previous amendment on climate literacy training, this  is climate change political capture inside the agencies of the Federal  Government.   Since taking office, President Biden has issued several executive  orders directing Federal agencies to address climate change and  environmental justice--whatever that means.   The DOL has been very busy in implementing that directive, and in the  process it has deflected resources away from its mission and wasted  taxpayer dollars on trying to implement the Green New Deal--with its  Climate Adaptation Plan and Environmental Justice grant activities just  being part of those efforts.   The fact is that we don't need any such plan, and the justice that  the DOL is peddling isn't justice at all. It is government-imposed  wretchedness dressed up with nonsensical language, the very purpose of  which is to pursue an agenda that has never been approved by this body.   Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote for my amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, while the Workforce Opportunity for Rural  Communities does fund rural grant opportunities, this amendment would  simply prevent the Department of Labor from infusing environmental  justice priorities into the program and return its focus to building  economic opportunity for rural Americans. In other words, it uses the  money the way that it should.   My amendment would block using money for things that it should not be  using it for. While the YouthBuild program does on face value sound  like a beneficial program for development of vocational skills, the  2022 climate plan outlines how skills can be developed for demand in  industries, including the clean energy sector.   The reality is that it is a misapplication of funds, and it is being  used inappropriately. When outlining its so-called environmental  justice work, the DOL's climate plan references a strategic investment,  but such a waste of resources isn't an investment at all. It is a  colossal waste of taxpayer money.   Madam Chair, the Department of Labor is dedicating limited resources,  manpower, and money towards implementing the left's climate change  agenda while the very American citizens on whose behalf it is supposed  to be advocating--the working man--lose ground every day, with  inflation eating away at their buying power, individuals having to give  up on work, and intergenerational government dependency being some of  the fallout related to those policies.   A vote for my amendment is a vote for sending a message to the  Department of Labor and any Federal agency engaged in pushing radical  climate change initiatives. It is time for the DOL to focus on the job  the American people expect it to do.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment No.  107, which prohibits the Department of Education from carrying out  strategies listed in the Department's report titled: ``Strategies for  Increasing Diversity and Opportunity in Higher Education.''   In June 2023, the Supreme Court through the decision in Students for  Fair Admissions v. Harvard rightfully ended affirmative action and  processes related to the admission of students into higher educational  institutions based upon racial factors.   This landmark case has finally ended affirmative action, an agenda  that its supporters lauded for maintaining equity and inclusion, was  actually founded upon, implemented, and pursued for the purpose of  furthering racial discrimination.                                time  2045    As Justice Roberts has previously said: ``The way to stop  discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the  basis of race.'' I agree. That, however, is not the way that the Biden  administration sees it. The Biden administration and the Federal  Department of Education don't seem to care what the Supreme Court says  and have every intention to continue implementing programs that  directly violate the Fair Admissions decision.   The current Federal Department of Education has done what agencies  like this do best: They release a report that, while having no force or  effect of law, provides a roadmap for colleges and universities to  effectively continue their race-based admission practices. The Federal  Department of Education, in other words, is simply continuing with its  race-based discrimination, just calling it by another name.   My amendment is designed to block the Department of Education's  efforts in that regard, and I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, this report, released in September of 2023,  describes the strategies that colleges and universities may use to  continue their discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda  by suggesting admission procedures including a holistic review of  student candidates emphasizing such factors related to their  experiences with hardship, including racial discrimination, sources of  inspiration or demonstration of resiliency, and other qualities with  clear racial undertones.   Let me be clear. Admission practices and professional recruiting  standards are areas in which merit should be the sole and primary focus  when selecting new candidates.   My amendment prohibits the Department of Education from carrying out  its strategies listed in the Department's report and ensures compliance  with the Supreme Court's decision.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment 108 which  prevents the Department of Education from carrying out its ``American  History and Civics Education'' priorities referenced in the Federal  Register titled: ``Proposed Priorities-American History and Civics  Education.''   Under this 2021 proposed rule, the Department of Education sought to  institute a variety of priorities under the National Activities program  and within American History and Civics Academies seeking to promote a  divisive educational curriculum. The real agenda behind these  priorities is to attack our Nation's history and pursue an agenda to  allegedly address what it refers to as systemic marginalization,  biases, inequities, and discriminatory policy and practice to allegedly  help students understand their own biases when reviewing information.  What complete and total hogwash and drivel.   While the Department was forced to abandon its efforts to institute  its offensive agenda, it has also disclosed its intent to maintain what  it refers to as invitational priorities, meaning it will encourage  others to do what it cannot.   Madam Chair, our children deserve to be educated on history,  mathematics, English, science, and other programs that are accurate,  robust, educational, and that will prepare them to join the workforce  and be productive members of society. They do not deserve to be  indoctrinated into far-left hatred of America.   My amendment would block the Department of Education from instituting  these insidious priorities. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor  of it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, as I have said numerous times before,  critical race theory and related programs are simply a mechanism  utilized by the radical left to assert their control and to further  divide Americans.   Madam Chair, my amendment is one small effort in combating the left's  effort to turn our educational system into indoctrination camps,  pushing racist policies that are not grounded in reality.   Once again, my constituents are fed up with the failures of the  Department of Education in actually educating our children while using  our taxpayer dollars to destroy America from within.   Support for my amendment will send a message to the Department of  Education and other Federal agencies who pursue implementation of  critical race theory initiatives that their time is up; that we are no  longer going to allow them to use our educational system to implement  policies that are not only based on lies but that put Americans against  Americans.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
