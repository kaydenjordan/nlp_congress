 Mr. Speaker, when Vladimir Putin and his autocratic regime  launched their brutal criminal invasion of Ukraine in February of last  year, many people predicted that the Ukrainians would throw down their  arms and surrender within days.   Mr. Speaker, 18 months later, however, burnt-out husks of Russian  tanks litter the Ukrainian countryside. Blue and gold flags fly proudly  over Kyiv, Kherson, Lyman, and other towns held or liberated by  Ukrainian forces. Russian soldiers surrender, desert, and dodge  conscription in droves.   Meanwhile, defenders of democracy stand firm with Ukrainian courage  in their hearts and Western weapons in their hands. Ukrainians stand  strong because Americans and Brits and Danes and Germans and French and  other freedom-loving peoples around the world stand united behind them.  That unity is crucial now more than ever as the warmongering dictators  of the world--Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, and Xi Jinping--have all  come together.   We are locked in a struggle between freedom and fascism, democracy  and despotism, might and right. The war in Ukraine is that struggle  manifest.   President Zelenskyy returns to our Capitol this week, tomorrow, to  remind us that the fate not only of this sovereign, democratic nation  but of the free world hinges on this conflict. He recognizes that our  international cooperation to preserve democracy depends on our  cooperation here in the Congress of the United States.   Democrats and Republicans have found consensus on the issue in the  past, securing vital military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. We must  keep working in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that Ukrainians receive  whatever tools and resources they need to succeed on the battlefield  because only the great arsenal of democracy, as we said during World  War II, can vanquish an axis of evil.   I echo what President Truman said to the Congress in 1952 when trying  to secure further aid for war-torn Europe. He said this: ``If through  inaction we desert the cause of democracy, the democratic hope may be  exterminated in broad areas of the Earth.'' We must not let that  happen.   President Truman called on Congress, as I urge you now, to add  powerful momentum to the democratic counteroffensive, which inspires in  the people of the world a sense of their own destiny as free men and  women.   We have built up that momentum steadily over the last year and a  half. Imagine how much more it will grow in the months ahead if the  free world maintains its resolve, if this Congress maintains its  resolve.   When President Zelenskyy arrives in our Capitol corridors tomorrow,  he should not have to plead for more support. Instead, we ought to show  him that we are committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure that  action prevails over inaction, that democracy triumphs over autocracy,  and that Ukraine emerges victorious over Russia.   Like the martyrs who gave their lives on the Lexington Common in 1775  and Kyiv's Maidan in 2014, we will show the world that we will do  everything to protect our democratic principles.   If we are to defend democracy at home and around the world, if we are  to defeat the despots, dictators, and dealers of destruction, then we,  Ukraine, and the free world must stand as one.   Our words supporting freedom will ring very hollow if not coupled  with our actions to defend freedom, as President Kennedy said, ``here  and around the world.'' Let us defend the democracy that we hold so  dear.                            ____________________
