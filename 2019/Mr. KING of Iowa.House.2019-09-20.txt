 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the privilege to be  recognized to address you here on the floor of the United States House  of Representatives.   And I come to this floor to talk a little bit today about what is  happening to our Nation, our society, our culture, our Constitution.  And these are topics that have been debated in this Chamber for a long  time, but some things have happened that never happened before.   And so I would start first with: It seems to me our leader seems to  be a high respecter of the credibility of the New York Times. So I put  together a document here that I thought might be interesting to him,  and I would go through just a few of them, the articles that have come  up in the New York Times, that have had to be retracted.   Let's see: There are the articles about Russian meddling in the  election that had to be retracted.   They had to apologize for ruining Wen Ho Lee's career and life.   And the New York Times admits that one of the reporters engaged in  frequent acts of journalistic fraud, widespread fabrication and  plagiarism, and found problems in at least 36 of the 73 articles  written by a single individual since he had started.   Further, the Times admits--that is the New York Times--that Judith  Miller took journalistic shortcuts, and that New York Times' editors,  ``failed to dig into problems before they became a mess.''   They did become a tremendous mess. Remember, that was the allegation  that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. Well, we got  into a war over that one, didn't we, over the New York Times--at least  in part.   Most of us will remember in 2006, when the New York Times covered an  alleged rape by Duke--or multiple rapes, I should say, by the Duke  University Lacrosse team. The Times coverage was biased towards the  accuser, despite the fact that it ended up being a hoax and there was  little evidence supporting the accuser's case.   And those young men on the Duke Lacrosse team were run through the  wringer. They were excoriated; they were pounded on by the national  media, not only the New York Times, but that is one of the things that  triggers it.   Then, again, there is a New York Times article that questioned John  McCain's relationship with a lobbyist. And that faced widespread  criticism to the article implying that McCain had a romantic  relationship with a lobbyist. They had to issue a correction, that they  did not intend for the article to imply a romantic relationship. Well,  they did imply that. They just said they didn't ``intend'' that.    And so somehow, the Times thinks they should have a pass for their  own definition of intent, even though time after time after time, the  Times has been found to be less than credible.   The President of the United States has poured forth his ire against  the New York Times, and called them the ``lying New York Times,'' ``the  fake news New York Times,'' ``the failing New York Times,'' and  probably a number of descriptions that I haven't uncovered here, Mr.  Speaker.   But in 2009, the New York Times' appraisal on Walter Cronkite had to  have eight different corrections due to just factual inaccuracies. And  this is a newspaper, of course, that America used to depend upon.   And then in 2015, the New York Times published an article claiming  that new figures surrounding China's rate of coal usage could affect  U.N. climate talks when, in fact, those figures were so outdated that  the U.N. was already aware of that particular uptick. So, again,  distorted information.   But what is consistent with this? What are the common denominators?  And that is, their misinformation in the New York Times almost always  fits their narrative.   And then in 2017, the New York Times incorrectly stated that China  [[Page H7861]]  was in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Well, that starts a whole  national debate of what is going on. If China is in the TPP, and we are  not in the TPP, and then the debate churns along, well, how are we ever  going to get back into the TPP? And we have to take China in with us,  if they will let us in. China wasn't part of the TPP--just  misinformation. And that was an obvious one that it would have failed  even the most rudimentary of fact-checks.   I would go further, in 2017 the Times, because of a--their words-- ``because of an editing error,'' quoted three tweets from General  Michael Flynn's parody account attributing the quotes to General Flynn,  further damaging General Flynn's reputation, and probably contributing  to the difficulties that the proud patriot has had as he wound up his  career serving our country. An editing error caused these three tweets.  They weren't editing errors. They were just picking up--because the  parody account fit the Times narrative, they accepted the narrative  without checking on it. That is my assertion here, and I believe it is  true.   Again, in 2017, the New York Times claims that Trump visited Israel  during the campaign, which actually it was planned, but it was canceled  for political reasons, I presume. And to be relatively astute on  allowing then-President Barack Obama to be in charge of foreign policy.   In fact, I have a personal experience with that, when I thought  during the campaign it would be wise for then-candidate Trump to have a  meeting or two with some key players around the world. But when I  raised that issue, I got the straight answer back, which was, No, we  don't want to have any kind of implication that we are conducting  foreign policy as a candidate for the President of the United States.  That is up to the current Commander-in-Chief, and that transition after  the election can take place in due course.   They were exactly correct in that and conducted themselves  accordingly, but the allegations that were in the paper would indicate  the opposite of that.   I have a number of other stories in here. In fact, I have only gone  to the top of page 2, and there is about seven pages, maybe eight pages  in here, Mr. Speaker. But I think it is clear that if anybody is going  to hang their hat on something that they see printed in the New York  Times, they are going to find themselves--if that narrative happens to  fit the narrative that the New York Times pushes and promotes--you  ought to be very suspicious of the facts and the allegations around  that.   I would go through a few cases that come to mind. Also, in America  where misinformation came out, it happened to fit the narrative of the  left, and so the New York Times, The Washington Post, MSNBC, CNN, on  and on--Huffington Post--they pick up that narrative, embellish the  narrative, and they look for another way to add to that narrative, if  it is a narrative that fits their ideology and their preconceived  notions of what they think of their political opposition.   We think back to the best example we have is now-Justice Brett  Kavanaugh, who was put through a confirmation wringer that only had  been matched, perhaps, by Justice Clarence Thomas.   What do they have in common? They are both constitutionalists. They  are both originalists. They are both textualists. And they are both in  the process of moving America back to the Constitution, its original  intent. And understanding the text of the Constitution has to mean what  it was understood to mean at the time of ratification.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask you just to think about that. If the  Constitution is a living and breathing document, and this definition  can change on the fly, then what kind of a deal do we have at all with  our Founding Fathers and with our posterity?   Can you imagine signing a contract--I have spent my life in the  construction business--and can you imagine signing a contract, and  during the course of that contract, the words in that contract have to  mean a defined, precise, black-and-white meaning. And those words are  on paper so that the deal doesn't change. That is what a contract is.   You put words on paper, you sign that document, and that says, I am  committed to the language in this Constitution--or the contract--and  the intent of this language in the contract, or the Constitution, and I  will follow through on that, and I will complete my side of this  agreement. That is a contract.   The Constitution is a written contract that lays down the foundation  of our government, and it is the supreme law of the land. And it went  on paper, on parchment. It went on parchment and was signed and  ratified by the Thirteen Colonies so that they said, We are going to  keep our part of this bargain. This is the deal.    You would have never ratified that Constitution back in the day if  somebody would have said, well, it is a living, breathing document. We  can redefine these words in here and ignore others and be able to just  work our way around it, and we will get some activist justices that  will work with us on this and give us precedent cases that undermine  the original intent of the Constitution.   That is what has been going on in this modern era, probably longer  than I recall, but I would say at least back to the Warren Court. And  yet today, we have Justice Clarence Thomas, who is an originalist, a  textualist, and he believes the Constitution has to mean what it was  understood to mean at the time of ratification.   And if we don't like that, that is why we have the amendment process,  Mr. Speaker. And that is the nominee Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and that  is nominee Justice Neil Gorsuch. And I believe that is the case also  for Justice Alito, and most of the time, I think it is also true for  Chief Justice John Roberts. But if we don't have a guaranty from our  Constitution, we don't have a foundation for America and our  government.   And then that puts it into the hands of the willy-nilly attitudes of  what might be a majority in the Supreme Court or the will of the people  here on the floor of the House of Representatives, who sometimes just  turn our back on the Constitution. That contract of our Constitution  has to mean what it was understood to mean at the time that it was  ratified.   And so why was the big fight then pushing back against Brett  Kavanaugh when he was before the United States Senate to be confirmed?   And the reasons for that are the other side--the left, the radical  left, that is sometimes supported by the militant left--doesn't want to  live under our Constitution. They want to change it. They want to move  America. They want to attack the pillars of American exceptionalism.  And they have much of the news media as their allies.   So as the news media pours forth these erroneous stories and they put  misinformation into the eyes and ears of the American people, while  they are doing that, they are pitting the American people against the  American people. And you saw that during the confirmation process of  Justice Kavanaugh.   And he faced--this is just my memory, but I believe there were  something like six different accusers that they accumulated over time.  And these accusers, one of them was Christine Blasey Ford, who sat over  there with her hair inside of her glasses and told us how bad this was.   But her testimony could not be corroborated, and that was actually  the verdict that came down when Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed before  the United States Senate. Neither could the testimony or the affidavits  or the narratives of the others be corroborated.   And so of those five or six accusers then, none of them held up under  the scrutiny, under the light of day, even though the New York Times  and The Washington Post, and all these publications I have listed, and  many more, came at it as if Christine Blasey Ford was the gold standard  for a witness with integrity. And it is clear she was not.                                time  1230    Well, they beat up so badly on Justice Kavanaugh that, at one point,  one of the Democrat Senators asked him the question: You have gone  through a lot. You have been faced with all this criticism.   Essentially, I will paraphrase and summarize how I understood that,  and  [[Page H7862]]  it is not a quote from the Senator, but it was essentially this: We  have beaten you up so badly and mercilessly. We damaged your reputation  so badly. We destroyed your character. You have to be personally just  crushed. So, how, if you are confirmed as a Justice on the Supreme  Court, can you sit in impartial judgment on ruling on the Constitution  and the rule of law? Aren't you going to be tempted to retaliate  because of what all you have been through?   Those are not the exact words, but that was the theme.   Now, think of this. If somebody is put forward before the public in a  nomination process or some other type of scrutiny and they are so  mercilessly pounded by the leftist media--and, in some cases,  collaboration from Republican leadership--that their reputation is so  badly damaged, the question comes up: Well, can Justice Kavanaugh do  his job now that we have eviscerated him through this confirmation  process?   Oh, I think he can do his job all right, and I think he can do it  clearly and with a cool hand and a cool head and an analytical mind.  And I think Justice Kavanaugh is doing and will continue to do this:  bring America back to the Constitution, bring America back to the  original intent, bring America back to the text of the language that is  in the Constitution.   And, if Americans don't like the results of those decisions, we have  a method to amend the Constitution rather than simply distort it by  judicial activism. And that is about the best way to get revenge on  people who put our Constitution under threat by the tactics that they  are using in the confirmation process.   Well, that process that they were trying to deny the confirmation of  Justice Kavanaugh failed, and he is confirmed, and he is serving with  dignity and honor. And he should be allowed to do that for life if he  chooses.   But they mounted another effort at him a week or so ago, and it  turned out to be another false story. The New York Times, in  particular, didn't bother to write into the story that the woman who  allegedly had experienced some type of harassment, and maybe even  physical harassment--and I say ``allegedly''; allegedly, in case The  New York Times missed it the first time I said it--that she didn't have  any recollection of the incident whatsoever. They knew that, and it is  reported that the reporters who wrote the story had that line in their  story and that it was taken out by the editors.   So, think of that. The editors at The New York Times are redacting  language, but disappearing language, so that the meaning of the story  is different and it can be as pejorative as possible against a seated  Justice on the United States Supreme Court. That is appalling.   And is it willful? Well, that question hangs out there: Is it  willful?   I will say this. There is a Supreme Court precedent case out there  from about 1964 called The New York Times--excuse me. It is Sullivan v.  The New York Times Company.   That was a case where, in Alabama, during the civil rights  disruptions of the sixties, there was a story that had multiple  falsehoods in it that was designed to be pejorative against the law  enforcement and the people in Alabama near the Selma area.   And I am not actually sure that was Selma, but it was in Alabama.   In any case, the story that came out in The New York Times was  inaccurate on step after step. They argued that they locked the  cafeteria shut so that they could starve the students out. Or they  reported that. They reported that students were refusing to register  and, essentially, leaving college. Neither one of those things were  true.   They argued that they circled the building with law enforcement  officers essentially arm in arm. That wasn't true. There were about  four other falsehoods. They had to be manufactured because what would  they be based on, things like that.   Yet, when they went before the Supreme Court in the middle of the  1960s, Sullivan v. The New York Times Company, the Supreme Court came  down with a decision, which is, well, The Times is protected because  they are a print publication, and we have to allow them their First  Amendment right--freedom of the press--even if it is false, even if it  is blatantly false, even if it is obviously false. It just has to be  willfully and maliciously false in order for them to be liable.   That case needs to come back before the United States Supreme Court  and be reconsidered. And I am told that there are one or more Justices  on that bench who would welcome such a case to make it to the Supreme  Court, and I think I have named those two most likely to welcome that  case here already.   So I am frustrated by this. I am glad that this case, this second  round, Kavanaugh 2.0 in malicious media meddling, is pretty much now in  the rearview mirror now that the truth has been applied to the story a  little bit better.   But this country is not off of this hook by any means. We have a  long, long ways to go before we can get down to what is true. And I  think Congress is going to have to act at some point. I don't think it  is going to happen in this Congress. There has to be a majority change  in this Congress. But we are going to have to act.   And the stories that have been served up to the American people--I  brought up the Kavanaugh story as the first one. Then you can move  along a little bit, and I will take you to--let's see. Let's do  Covington Catholic.   The Covington Catholics were here during the March for Life. That  would be around January 22. A lot of young men, and, also, at least one  of them was wearing a MAGA hat, a ``Make America Great'' cap, a red  one.   They were down by the Lincoln Memorial, and there was a story that  there was a Native American who was beating a drum in the face of this  young man, and the young man just stood there and maintained his  posture, his composure, his expression.    And that just seemed to be what all the media would pile on, that  they had been disrespecting a Native American who was beating a drum in  his face, and that clip of the close-up seemed to be enough just to  reinforce a lot of critics that the young man from Covington Catholic  somehow carried an attitude that should be punished.   So they excoriated him through every media that I can think of, and  that young man and the school went through days and days and days of a  lot of public criticism, grief that was poured forth upon them.   And I can say with experience that, if you don't have experience with  public grief being poured on you, it hurts a lot more the 1st time than  it does the 2nd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 50th, or 100th time.   You do build scar tissue to this, but you can't imagine that a young  man from Covington Catholic has scar tissue built up at all. Who could  imagine that this would be the case?   So, they took that heat and that beating--the whole school, but he in  particular--for over a week until there was a video that emerged that  panned back and showed what really went on. There was no antagonism  from the Covington Catholics.   There were bad words being hurled back and forth, but I don't think  anybody picked up any bad words coming from those young people from  Covington Catholic. Yet they got the blame for all of this when they  were standing there innocently and probably stunned at the environment  they were in.   I can't imagine they came out of their home State and went into the  middle of that, I would say, semi-demonstration environment when they  were being intimidated by groups shouting back and forth at them and a  drum being beaten in their face.   You would be amazed. I recall my first experience with these things  in this town. It was March 18 of 2003 when there was an antiwar  demonstration that took place. I thought: I need to see this.   So I went over there near the Washington Monument where they were  ginning up, the antiwar demonstrators. They had two great, big speakers  up on a stage that were about the size of refrigerators, microphones,  and they were ginning up the crowd.   As I walked around through that crowd--I went incognito, by the way,  too, Mr. Speaker. I put on my old, vintage Washington Redskins  sweatshirt and a cap so I could just, hopefully, blend into the crowd.   I saw every variety of anti-Americanism that I had ever seen. A lot  of it was profane. They ginned them up, and then they marched off over  to the west,  [[Page H7863]]  around the west side of the White House, and then came back down  through Pennsylvania Avenue.   I sat there, in the middle there, what I call the grassy knoll, and  watched them go by for an hour and three-quarters, a human river of  discontent and anger and anti-Americanism.   I saw a young lady, maybe 16 or 17 years old, run over and spit in  the face of an officer who was standing there.   I saw two marines standing on the side of the street. They were  holding their American flag up, and a young man from the demonstrating  crowd ran over there, grabbed a hold of that flag. They held their  flag, but he ripped the top half of the flag off, and he danced around  the street tearing it up in strips and wearing it around his neck and  others' necks as if it were some kind of a trophy to tear up the  American flag and then demonstrate.   I saw a photographer there who had a camera and who was going to  clean the lens on his camera. He reached in his jacket pocket and  pulled out a crumpled American flag, a small, silk flag, and used it to  clean that lens. You could tell by the habits of the way he handled it  that that is just what he did; he kept the American flag for a rag to  clean the lens on his camera while he took pictures of anti- Americanism, hatred of America, and every kind of countercultural thing  that you can think of.   That is what we are faced with, the kind of people in that  demonstration, the kind of people who were down here at the Lincoln  Memorial who were trying to intimidate the Covington Catholics.   So, you know how that one ended, Mr. Speaker. I will say another one.   Now, remember, this one also fit the narrative. Justice Kavanaugh,  the stories against him, they picked the ones that fit the narrative  and drove them.   Their narrative on Covington Catholics was these must be conservative  pro-lifers--and they are--so we have got to find a way to actually  expose something that is in their heart, which is, by the way, faith  and love. They didn't expose that. That was the Covington Catholics.   Jussie Smollett alleged that he was the subject of, at least, a lynch  threat and that they had, what, poured bleach on him and whatnot. That  went on for awhile. That story was all ginned up because these were  supposedly racists who were going to lynch Jussie Smollett in Chicago.   But I saw the video of the two men who went into the convenience  store to buy those items that he had put on top of him, that little bit  of a kind of a scrawny rope that didn't look to me that it was a rope  you would use for that. But that and the other items that were there,  all of it was on video, purchased at the convenience store.   It was reported, at least--now I don't know if it is true--that they  were paid something like $3,500 to do their part in this.   And Jussie managed to wear that rope all the way back to his  apartment before he was interviewed by the police.   Yet, still, the story went through and through, and now the Federal  Government needs to get involved in it. I believe they are doing a full  investigation of what looks like, let's say, a less than enthusiastic  local prosecutor there in Chicago.    But that is another story that fit the narrative. Surely, there are  people out there who are racist who would go out and get rope and  bleach and whatever and wait in the middle of a 20-below-zero night to  waylay Jussie Smollett at a place like that.   It happened to be about the only location where there were not  surveillance cameras. Carefully thought out? Only partly.   But that fit the narrative. That was published. It was The New York  Times, too, but it was many others, Mr. Speaker.   Who am I forgetting now? There are a number of others. I happen to be  one. So, I am waiting for a report to come down that would lay out what  is going on in this Congress.   But I revere this Constitution. I carry one in my jacket pocket every  day. When I say the Pledge, my hand is inside my jacket because my hand  is on that Constitution, which is as close to my heart as I can get it.  I believe in it, and I believe our job is to restore this Constitution  back to its original meaning and intent.   The pillars of American exceptionalism are identified, most all of  them, in the Bill of Rights itself. The central pillar of American  exceptionalism is the rule of law. There are a number of things around  that rule of law that we need to remember: innocent until proven  guilty, a right to face your accusers, you get to face a jury of your  peers. All of that is there.   We have other pillars of American exceptionalism. Freedom of speech  is a pillar. Freedom of religion. Freedom of the press. Freedom of  assembly--peaceable assembly, I might add. All of those are pillars  that this shining city that Ronald Reagan described to be on the hill,  I say, is supported and held up and built upon those pillars of  American exceptionalism.   And I mentioned the rule of law, the central pillar, without which  the rest of this collapses. Without freedom of the press, the rest of  this collapses because corruption has, then, a free rein.   But when the media gets corrupt and the government gets corrupt, as  we saw in the fall of 2016 and on into the beginnings of the Trump  administration, when the major branches, major divisions, departments  within our government are weaponized against a candidate for the  Presidency, a President-elect Donald Trump and then an inaugurated  President Donald Trump, when those branches of government are  weaponized against him, that is weaponization against we, the people,  against our Constitution, and it undermines our freedom.                                time  1245    And when the abuse of those constitutional rights empowers media  outlets to turn their targets, unjustly and dishonestly, against a  duly-elected President of the United States, or a duly-elected Member  of the United States Congress, that--meaning me, in case you are  wondering, Mr. Speaker--threatens our republic. And this republic will  eventually collapse if we continue down this path.   We must preserve those rights that are in our Constitution, including  innocent until proven guilty; the right to face your accusers; a jury  of your peers; due process. That has to all be there.   The President hasn't had due process. I haven't had due process. But  I have added up a few things. There are currently four Members of this  Congress, Mr. Speaker, that don't have committee assignments; four.   One of them resigned from the Republican Party and from his committee  assignments; so that takes it down to three.   Two of them are indicted for Federal charges. That takes it down to  one.   Then, the one in this Congress--being me, Mr. Speaker--and we look  back through history all the way back to 1900, and we find one other  Member of Congress that didn't have committee assignments since 1900.  That happened to be James Traficant in about 2001. He happened to be  one that was removed from his committee assignments shortly after he  voted for Dennis Hastert, a Member of the opposite party, and went  against many of the platform positions of the Democratic party. They  decided he wasn't a Democrat any longer and removed him from his  committees.   But in 120 years, there has only been one, other than those that I  mentioned; that is James Traficant. And he was, later on, indicted and  convicted on nine or ten Federal charges of fraud, corruption, taking  bribes and racketeering, and those kinds of things. He was found guilty  of all of them and served some time in prison.   So these are very serious charges when you are convicted of Federal  felonies and removed from your committees. I don't think it is right to  remove someone from a committee when they are charged because if they  are indicted, they are innocent until proven guilty. So why would you  punish somebody if they are innocent until proven guilty?   That defies a foundational principle of our government.   But, nonetheless, the charges, at least, are serious Federal felony  charges for two seated Members today. Charges were certainly serious  for James Traficant, who spent time in prison.   Why does   Steve King not have committees? Because of a misquote in  the  [[Page H7864]]  New York Times for the simple purpose of an allegation of politically  incorrect speech.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 12 o'clock and 48 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday,  September 24, 2019, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
