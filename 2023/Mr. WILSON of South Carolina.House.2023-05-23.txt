 Madam Speaker, failed tax and spending  policies by Biden and liberal Democrats hurt families.   Since Biden took office, the 10-year spending levels have increased  by $10 trillion. Sadly, this includes the $2 trillion American Rescue  Plan, which ignited the highest inflation in 40 years, destroying jobs.   I was grateful to join House Republicans in passing the Limit, Save,  Grow Act, which will limit government spending, reduce Federal  regulations, and promote pro-growth energy policies.   House Republicans are the only ones who have passed legislation that  responsibly addresses the debt ceiling by limiting irresponsible  spending, saving taxpayer dollars, and creating jobs.   Democrats own this debt crisis, and they own default if they do not  come to the table with a serious proposal.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   South Carolina appreciates Senator Tim Scott and Ambassador Nikki  Haley.                            ____________________
