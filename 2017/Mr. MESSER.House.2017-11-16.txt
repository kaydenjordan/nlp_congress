 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for his leadership.   Today is a huge victory for working Americans. Today, we take a giant  step forward to deliver more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks  for working Hoosiers. This bill will create thousands of jobs in  Indiana, and it will give the typical working family a $1,500 tax cut.   The Trump tax plan also includes a provision that I authored to stop  $4 billion to $7 billion in refundable child tax credits paid out to  illegal immigrants each year. These savings help expand the child tax  credit for working American families by $600 per child.   Hoosiers get it: no one should get a tax incentive to violate the  law.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this plan. It will give  working Hoosiers a pay raise, bring back jobs from overseas, and get  our economy moving again.   I also urge the Senate to act and keep their promise to the American  people.
