 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as you know, this  past September we played the Congressional Baseball Game. We had  another record crowd and raised over a million dollars for our  charities. It was a great game, 13-12.   I am here today to congratulate our Republican players on their  victory, a hard-fought victory. They played hard. The lead went back  and forth all the way to the last inning when they scored enough runs  to get that extra run and beat us.   Congratulations. We will see you next year. I think the game has been  set for July 28, and we are looking forward to playing it then.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. I yield to the gentleman from  Texas.
