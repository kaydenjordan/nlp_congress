 Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, we are not even a full month into the new Presidency.  Yet, the President and the Republicans in Congress have already  launched numerous attacks on women's health and access to care. Here's  just a few of the examples aside from today.   They are charging ahead to dismantle the Affordable Care Act without  making any promises to preserve the vital protections for women that  are in that bill.   They imposed and dramatically expanded the global gag rule, which  harms women's access to health care around the world.   And just after the historic Women's March, House Republicans passed  H.R. 7, an extreme bill that effectively bans private insurance  companies from covering comprehensive healthcare services.   But here we are again today, with another bill that threatens access  to family planning care for millions of our most vulnerable citizens by  attacking title X. Title X is the only Federal program dedicated solely  to family planning, which includes a range of services that help women  and their partners prepare for pregnancy and ensure healthy spacing  between births.   Title X helps 4 million people who are uninsured. Title X centers  also play an important role in reducing unintended pregnancy, and title  X centers are also major points of access in our safety net.   Six in 10 women who go to a title X center consider it their major  source of health care. What this rule that Republicans want to roll  back does is it simply reinforces longstanding requirements that say  that States cannot discriminate against providers for reasons that are  unrelated to their qualifications to perform family planning services  when distributing title X funding. In other words, if an organization  provides abortions with its own private money but it qualifies for  title X, it can still get that funding.   Now I keep hearing from my colleagues that this violates states'  rights, but that completely ignores how Federal programs work.  Virtually all Federal funding opportunities require a State to adhere  to certain standards to ensure policy goals are met, and that is  exactly what this rule did.   Republicans will also argue that community health centers can fill  all the gaps created and accessed by denying these centers title X  funding. This claim has been debunked on numerous occasions.   For example, in 21 percent of counties with a Planned Parenthood  center, Planned Parenthood is the only safety net provider in the area.  That is why the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated, if  Planned Parenthood were defunded, as many as 390,000 women would lose  access to care, and 650,000 women would have reduced access. That is  why repealing this rule is a serious problem.    Just this afternoon I read a quote, and here's what it said:  ``Patients and doctors should be making the big decisions--not  government bureaucrats.''    Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.   Let me say that again. ``Patients and doctors should be making the  big decisions--not government bureaucrats.''   Who said this?   Margaret Sanger? No.   Cecile Richards? No.   Hillary Clinton? No.   The person who said this this afternoon is the Speaker of the House,  Paul Ryan. I couldn't agree with him any more when it comes to title X  family planning money. This should be made by patients and their  doctors, not by bureaucrats in Washington.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the House Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Lowey).    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 16, 2017, on page H1270, the following appeared: . . .  yield 1 minute to gentlewoman from      The online version has been corrected to read: . . . yield 1  minute to the gentlewoman from    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from the State of Washington (Ms. DelBene).

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel), the chair of the Democratic Women's Working  Group.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on  each side?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington State (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Bera).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Maine (Ms. Pingree).

Madam Speaker, it is my understanding that the other  side is reserving its time to close. Is that correct?    I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts  (Ms. Clark).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel), a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, we hear today this really isn't about denying women  and families access to family planning and birth control because States  would just simply take that title X money and put it somewhere else.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a bit of magical thinking. Even the  Congressional Budget Office said that as many as 390,000 women would  lose access to care and 650,000 women would have reduced access if  legislation like this passed.   The fact of the matter is you can't simply shift all of these people  from title X family planning centers like Planned Parenthood to  community health centers, as the other side asserts. For one thing, 69  percent of the community health centers actually refer patients to  family planning providers like Planned Parenthood, and only 19 percent  of community health centers report that their largest sites both  prescribe and dispense all types of contraceptive methods. Only half of  community health centers that received title X funding provide IUDs and  other types of long-acting birth control, the most effective type of  birth control, so you can't just shift everybody else someplace else.   In fact, the National Association of Community Health Centers itself  said that they could not treat all of the patients that Planned  Parenthood now has if this legislation went through. Let's just call  this joint resolution what it is. It is an attempt to take away  important family planning resources from the women and families of  America.   Now, I think if we all support title X when the annual appropriations  bill comes up this year, I would ask my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle to please join me and my colleagues in an effort to increase  title X funding. In all the years I have been in Congress, I have seen  attempt after attempt not only to reduce abortion availability, but  also to stop family planning services. I think that is something we  could agree with on, and I think we could do that.   So in the meantime, let's make sure that the women of America can get  access to the family planning they need, and let's continue to give  family planning money to all of these interests to do that.   Again, I would like to reiterate, we have no family funding for  abortions. That is the law. I don't like the law, but that is the law.  We are talking about family planning and title X. That needs to be  preserved and enhanced. Vote ``no'' on this joint resolution.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
