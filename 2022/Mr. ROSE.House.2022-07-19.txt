 Madam Speaker, today, I rise today to bring attention to  President Biden's Securities and Exchange Commission's proposed climate  change rule.   As Tennesseans suffer from the impacts of record-breaking inflation  that has driven the cost of almost everything through the roof,  President Biden and his SEC are trying to implement a regulation that  will make it harder and more expensive to produce the food and fiber  that feeds the world.   We saw just last week that inflation is showing no signs of slowing  down. The climate change rule proposed by Biden's SEC will only make it  worse, as the farmers and ranchers who work so hard to feed us will  spend copious amounts of time, effort, and money to comply with this  rule, if it is even possible.   Biden's SEC has clearly overstepped its bounds, as Congress has never  given them the authority to regulate carbon emissions. If President  Biden were serious about lower prices, he would immediately hit the  brakes on this proposed rule.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I would urge my colleagues to support my  amendment, amendment No. 133 of division D, a part of en bloc No. 5.   This amendment would prohibit the SEC from implementing provisions of  its proposal entitled Enhancement and Standardization of Climate- Related Disclosures for Investors that mandate disclosure of Scope 3  emissions.   Scope 3 emissions include emissions from activities in an  organization's supply chain. Public companies have no ownership--and  little to no control--of these emissions.   Recently, I led a bipartisan letter with 118 Members of Congress  expressing concern about the proposed rule's impact on farmers.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the letter.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, May 25, 2022.      Hon. Gary Gensler,      Chair, Securities and Exchange Commission,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Gensler: We write to express significant       concerns with the impact the Securities and Exchange       Commission's (SEC) proposed rule on ``Enhanced and       Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for       Investors'' will have on the agricultural community.        It is our strong belief that this proposed rule, if       promulgated, would be a significant and unworkable regulatory       burden, and a considerable departure from the SEC's mission       to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and       foster fair, orderly, and efficient markets. It is not within       the purview of the SEC to regulate farmers and ranchers,       which is what this rule would do by requiring public       companies to disclose their Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG)       emissions. To do business with public companies, small farms       would be required to disclose a significant amount of       climate-related information. But unlike large corporations,       small farms do not have full-scale compliance departments.       Imposing these additional reporting requirements could       disqualify small, family-owned farms from doing business with       companies which could lead to more consolidation in the       agriculture industry.        Farmers are already regulated by agencies at the local,       state, and federal levels. There are currently multiple       programs at the federal level to help farmers implement       conservation practices. Bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.--      specifically unelected SEC staff--who have no jurisdiction       over environmental policy and who have never stepped foot on       a farm should not have such influence over how farmers take       care of their land.        We also have concerns about the specific information from       each farm that would have to be reported under this proposal.       The time and energy put into complying with this new       regulation will divert American farmers away from their       primary goal of producing our nation's food, fuel, and fiber.       As this rule is written, it is also unclear how farmers will       be protected from privacy concerns as they, unlike       corporations, live at their places of business where they       would now have to disclose significant amounts of       information. In American Farm Bureau Federation v. EPA, the       8th U.S. Circuit Court for Appeals affirmed that public       disclosure of farmers' personal information would constitute       a ``substantial'' and ``clearly unwarranted invasion of       personal privacy.'' Similarly, the SEC should consider how       the disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions could have privacy       implications for farmers and scrap this rule entirely to       ensure their private property information would not end up on       any public disclosures.        Finally, we are concerned that the comment period, although       recently extended until June, is inadequate given the       magnitude of this proposed rule, which totals 510 pages and       has 1,068 technical footnotes. The Commission's use of       abbreviated comment periods for complex rules like this as       well as the lack of consistency across rulemakings is       troubling, as it will result in less, much-needed input from       the public on these important issues.        We appreciate your attention to our concerns and request a       response no later than June 24, 2022.            Sincerely,          John Rose, Member of Congress; Scott DesJarlais, M.D.,             Member of Congress; David Kustoff, Member of Congress;             French Hill, Member of Congress; Glenn ``GT'' Thompson,             Member of Congress; Mark E.

Mr. Chair, the proposal would drive capital away from  smaller suppliers that may not have the resources to measure their  greenhouse gas emissions. SEC Chair Gensler points to significant  investor demand for requiring this type of information, but the demand  is coming from large asset managers and climate activists, not retail  investors.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.
