 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul for  yielding and for his leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution condemning  the Chinese Communist Party's use of a high-altitude surveillance  balloon over U.S. territory as a brazen violation of U.S. sovereignty  and international norms.   The balloon has been shot down, and I thank those who bravely  completed the mission.   However, many questions remain, and intelligence reports show what we  all knew: This was neither a coincidence nor something to be taken  lightly.   This surveillance balloon was part of a larger program by the CCP  that has collected information on military assets in Indo-Pacific  countries like Taiwan, Japan, India, and the Philippines.   We all know that this balloon does not even scratch the surface of  the CCP's surveillance capabilities. Millions of Americans are spied  upon every single day through TikTok and other state-affiliated  applications and technologies.   Whether in airspace or cyberspace, we cannot allow the CCP to spy on  us. We cannot allow the CCP to threaten our way of life and the  American Dream.   The time to project strength is now. We must defend our airspace,  send a strong signal to the CCP that this behavior will not be  tolerated, and equip our allies with the tools they need to deter and  defend against CCP's aggression.   As the Indo-Pacific Subcommittee chair, I am committed to getting  answers from the Biden administration about when they knew the CCP's  balloon was entering the U.S. airspace and what they know about the CCP  balloon program.   We need to ensure the United States responds to this type of  aggression with strong, decisive action from our leaders.
