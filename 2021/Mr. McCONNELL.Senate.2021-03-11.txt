 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, a year ago, coronavirus cases were  beginning to climb on U.S. soil. Shutdown measures were starting to  take effect.   Americans have endured one of the strangest and most painful years in  living memory. Nearly 2 million Americans have been hospitalized with  serious cases of the virus. More than half a million have lost their  lives. Millions of students and workers have had their lives completely  thrown off course. But these dark times have also spotlighted some of  the best of America: heroism, selflessness, ingenuity.   Last March, the night we passed the CARES Act without a single  dissenting vote, I said we would see a new generation of American  heroes, and so we have. Doctors and nurses and first responders have  worked tirelessly to help their fellow Americans. Essential workers  kept manning their posts and prevented economic collapse. Neighbors  looked out for neighbors, and small businesses shifted gears almost  overnight. Children and parents have fought to adapt to extraordinary  disruptions, and incredible heroes in lab coats in America and  worldwide worked at light speed to decode this new enemy and create  lifesaving vaccines in record time.   Today, together, we are standing on the cusp of a new springtime for  our  [[Page S1479]]  country not like anything we have experienced in our lifetimes. More  than 95 million vaccine doses have reached American arms; another 2  million every single day. COVID-related deaths have plummeted, now less  than half of their high, particularly for the elderly and the  vulnerable. Science reaffirms kids can be safely in the classroom right  now. States are starting to lift blanket restrictions, freeing citizens  and small businesses to follow smart precautions themselves. For weeks,  every indicator has suggested our economy is poised to come roaring  back, with more job openings for Americans who need work.   None of these trends began on January 20. President Biden and his  Democratic government inherited a tide that had already begun to turn  toward decisive victory.   In 2020, Congress passed five historic bipartisan bills to save our  health system, protect our economic foundations, and fund Operation  Warp Speed to find vaccines. Senate Republicans led the bipartisan  CARES Act that got our country through the last year.   The American people already built the parade that has been marching  toward victory; Democrats just want to sprint in front of the parade  and claim credit.   So when 10 Republican Senators went to the White House to suggest  working together, the Democrats said: Uh, no. Both the Democratic  leader and the White House Chief of Staff now indicate they think  President Obama's problem was that he was too bipartisan.   This time, as one journalist put it, the situation was ``Democrats to  GOP: Take it or leave it.'' The ``it'' that we are talking about here  was a bill that only spent about 1 percent on vaccines and about 9  percent on the entire health fight. The rest of the tab went to things  like this: a $350 billion bailout for State and local budgets unrelated  to pandemic needs, with strings attached to stop States from cutting  taxes on their own citizens down the road--take the money, you don't  get to cut taxes; massive Federal school funding spread over several  years, without requiring quickly reopening; sweeping new government  benefits with no work requirements whatsoever--a time warp to the bad  times before bipartisan welfare reform--which Democrats already say  they want to make permanent; and agricultural assistance conditioned  not on specific financial need but solely on the demographics of the  farmer, which some liberal activists are celebrating as  ``reparations.'' Only about 20 percent of the spending went to $1,400  direct checks, to try to keep all of the unrelated socialism out of the  spotlight.   This wasn't a bill to finish off the pandemic; it was a  multitrillion-dollar Trojan horse full of bad, old liberal ideas.  President Biden's own staff keep calling this legislation ``the most  progressive bill in American history''--hardly the commonsense  bipartisanship that the President promised.   So we pause today at the 1-year mark to remember and to mourn, but we  also look with great optimism toward the future. Twenty twenty-one is  set to be a historic comeback year, not because of the far-left  legislation that was passed after the tide had already turned but  because of the resilience of the American people.   (Mr. PADILLA assumed the Chair.)                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on a completely different matter,  at noon today, the Senate will vote on whether to pluck the Becerra  nomination out of committee after it failed to garner enough support to  advance.   Every one of President Biden's nominations the Senate has considered  so far has received bipartisan support for confirmation. There is a  reason Mr. Becerra could not get one single Republican vote to move out  of committee. It is because he is such a thoroughly partisan actor with  so little subject-matter expertise and such a demonstrated history of  hostility toward basic values like the freedom of conscience. There is  nothing about Mr. Becerra's record in Congress or in California to  suggest he is the best possible person to run the Department of Health  and Human Services in the middle of a once-in-a-generation viral  pandemic--not even close.   This is too important a job at too important a time for this  administration to put raw partisanship ahead of qualifications. So I  would strongly urge all Senators to vote against rescuing this  nomination from committee. Let's give the President the opportunity to  make a better selection.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on one final matter, as I have  mentioned, it is customary for some top Senate staff positions to see  new faces when party control changes hands.   Today, it is my honor to pay tribute to Mary Suit Jones, a huge asset  to this institution who has become an institution herself.   Tomorrow, Mary will finish her second separate run as Assistant  Secretary of the Senate and conclude a Senate career that has spanned  more than a quarter of a century.   I first met Mary Jones in the mid-1990s when we brought her on board  to help manage my office. Neither I nor Mary's colleagues back then  could have predicted that nearly 30 years later, she would depart as  one of the most senior officers in the entire place. But the truth is,  if you had told us, nobody would have been even a little surprised  either.   I have entrusted Mary with a lot of different responsibilities over  the years. She served as our office manager just a few years out of  college. She came with me to the Rules Committee, first as deputy staff  director and then the top job. Senator Frist had the good judgment to  ask her to be Assistant Secretary in the early 2000s. Then she returned  to Rules and resumed serving as our staff director under Senators Bob  Bennett, Lamar Alexander, and then Pat Roberts. Finally, she generously  brought all of this expertise and institutional knowledge back to the  Assistant Secretary role 6 years ago.   In her first job in my office, Mary organized one team of people and  our infrastructure. In her current job, she has overseen 26 departments  and scores of Senate staff, pushing resources and guidance down and  pushing information up. In between, at Rules, she tackled things like  helping run Presidential inaugurations.   Through it all, I cannot name one time when Mary Jones did not  deliver. She is consistent, competent, and completely reliable. No  wonder her name has become a kind of catchphrase around the Senate when  anyone is trying to track down some key piece of wisdom or is puzzling  over how to get something done: ``Well, let's ask Mary Jones.'' ``Have  you checked with Mary Jones?'' ``I think Mary knows all about that.''   Everyone from junior staff to senior Senators, Republicans and  Democrats, have been able to count on Mary for expertise and execution.  On a million different subjects, she knows the answer to the question  you are going to ask before you even finish asking it. A rock-solid  administrator, a consummate professional--she is just that good.   So I am sorry to see Mary depart the Senate, but she has given  generously to this place. She has certainly earned the opportunity to  apply her many talents to some new challenges and perhaps knock a few  miles off of her famously epic commute while she is at it.   The whole Senate thanks Mary for her excellent service. We wish her,  her husband, and their kids all the best in the exciting new chapters  that lie ahead.                            ____________________
