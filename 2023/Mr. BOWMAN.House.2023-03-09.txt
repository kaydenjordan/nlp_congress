 Mr. Speaker, we must all do everything in our power to  organize and communicate with Mr. Biden to stop the Willow project.   We are living in a climate catastrophe. We have one human race; we  have one planet; and we have people organizing across the country to  make sure the Willow project doesn't happen and to make sure we invest  in the clean, green, renewable energy that is going to save the human  race and save the planet.   Mr. President, it was young people that organized across this country  to help you get into office. Their number one issue is climate change.   Mr. President, it was young people who organized across this country  to help us push back against the so-called red wave and maintain  balance in the House.   And it is going to be young people who organize to help us win back  the House in 2024 and help America to reach its ideals.   Stop the Willow project.                            ____________________
