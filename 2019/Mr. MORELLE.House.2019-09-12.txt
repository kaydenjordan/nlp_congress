 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my longtime friend  and Monroe County Board of Elections commissioner, Tom Ferrarese, as he  begins his retirement.   For more than two decades, Tom has served our community with  distinction at the Board of Elections, working tirelessly to expand  access to voters, safeguard our elections, and uphold the democratic  process.   Tom has been a passionate political and community activist, working  diligently to advance the ideals of the Democratic Party, not just  through his work at the board, but through his extensive volunteer and  community advocacy on behalf of LGBTQ individuals.   It has been a true privilege to work alongside Tom, and our entire  community is grateful for his many years of service. I wish him nothing  but a well-deserved rest, relaxation, and best wishes in retirement.                            ____________________
