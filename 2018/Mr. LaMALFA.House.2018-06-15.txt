 Mr. Speaker, I would like to just highlight an amazing  thing we saw last night at the Congressional Baseball Game: the power  of prayer and perseverance. Exactly 1 year after that horrific shooting  out in Virginia, we saw our Officers Griner and Bailey as well as our  friend here on the floor, our whip,  Steve Scalise, take the field, as  well as Mr. Scalise taking second base escorted out by our colleagues,  Mr. Richmond and Mr. Wenstrup.   It was amazing to see that happen. Again, it is the power of prayer  and perseverance with him taking the base and taking his position on  the field.   You couldn't write it better in a Hollywood script, in that the first  ball hit in the infield went right to Steve. He fielded it and threw  the runner out at first base.   What an amazing thing, and what an inspiration for all of us.   God bless you, Steve, as well as the officers who were hurt on the  field that day. A year later here we are seeing great things happen in  a bipartisan way, a nonpartisan way, and a miraculous way.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
