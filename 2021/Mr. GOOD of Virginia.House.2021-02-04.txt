 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have taken my oath  on that Bible, which I do follow and try to live my life after.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to object to the left's pattern of teaming  up with the mainstream media to try to stifle the voices of  conservatives.   First, it was 4 years of trying to remove President Trump. Today, it  is trying to strip my friend, Marjorie Taylor Greene, of her committee  assignments. It is only a matter of time until they start coming after  everyday Americans.   We travel down a dangerous road today when the majority party is  threatening to make committee assignments for the minority. Mr.  Speaker, my friends across the aisle, as we have seen and as we have  just heard from one, certainly have no shortage of members who have  expressed very offensive opinions after they were elected to this body.   Democrats are not looking to lower the temperature or deliver results  for the American people. Their goal is to cause chaos and divide our  country so  [[Page H354]]  they can continue to expand their radical left agenda until they have  silenced all opposing viewpoints.   Democrats control the House, the Senate, and the White House. If they  wanted to deliver results to the American people, they could do it. But  their agenda is clear: they don't want to govern. They want to rule and  clamp down on any dissent to their radical agenda.
