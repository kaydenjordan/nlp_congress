 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 33 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, Iranian proxies have attacked U.S.  forces in the Middle East 80 times since President Biden took office.  Deterrence is failing.   Many of us are deeply concerned that removing the 2002 AUMF will  further erode American deterrence relative to Iran, further  jeopardizing our troops in the region.   Why are we concerned about this?   First, the 2002 AUMF was, as recently as 2020, used to support the  very justified killing of the Iranian Quds Force leader Qasem  Soleimani.   And, second, even as we are debating removing the 2002 AUMF right  now, Iranian proxies have stepped up attacks on Americans.   My amendment is simple and prudent and common sense. It requires the  DNI to certify that the removal of the 2002 AUMF will not undermine  American deterrence against Iran. This is prudent, and it is due  diligence.   Why wouldn't every U.S. Senator want to know whether the actions we  are taking right now here in the Senate enhance or diminish deterrence  against Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism?   Under my amendment, the DNI has 30 days to do this analysis, and 30  days should not be considered an inconvenience when American lives are  literally at stake.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this prudent, commonsense  amendment.    Mr. President, do I have any time left?    Mr. President, I am not conflating Iran and Iraq. Iran  right now is the threat, and, again, I ask my colleagues--none of whom  have an answer--why wouldn't we do the due diligence, 30 additional  days, to ask the DNI if what we are doing on the Senate floor right now  undermines American deterrence relative to Iran?   It is a simple request. It shows that we are acting to make sure we  protect our troops in the region. And, again, 30 days is not a lot of  time----    To make sure our troops in the region are safe and  secure.                           Vote on Amendment No. 33     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
