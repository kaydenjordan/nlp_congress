 Madam President, as a senior member of the U.S. Senate  Finance Committee, which held more than 50 hearings, roundtables, and  walkthroughs on health care reform--we spent 8 days just marking up the  bill in committee, considered more than 130 amendments, and more than  two dozen Republican amendments were agreed to at that time in the  committee--a committee that posted their legislation online for 6 days  before the original committee markup; a committee that spent, with the  Senate, 25 consecutive days in session on health reform--the second  longest consecutive session in the history of the U.S. Senate. In  total, the Senate spent more than 160 hours considering the healthcare  reform legislation.   Based on that, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that no  amendments be considered in order to Calendar No. 120, H.R. 1628, the  American Health Care Act, until the bill is referred jointly to the  Committee on Finance and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions and reported favorably from the committees. This means no  hearings, no bill.    Mr. President, first, I want to thank the Senator from  Nevada. We are so pleased that she is here and her voice is so strong  for the citizens of Nevada and appreciate very much her comments this  evening.   I am rising this evening to talk about an issue that affects every  single person, every single family in Michigan and all across the  Nation, and that is healthcare. I feel very confident that I can say  that each one of the 48 members of the Democratic caucus--each and  every one of us would love to be on this floor working with Republican  colleagues across the aisle to lower the costs of prescription drugs,  to lower the out-of-pocket costs of healthcare, to create more  competition and more  [[Page S3583]]  insurance choices for people in the insurance pools than are there  now--to basically fix the problems.   I am proud to be with colleagues tonight because we are not willing  to support anything that unravels the healthcare system, raises costs,  takes away healthcare for people, and, on top of that, gives a tax cut  to the wealthiest Americans, insurance executives, and pharmaceutical  companies with the dollars that are cut.   So here we are. The House has passed a bill that, in fact, raises  costs, takes away healthcare, gives the tax cuts I talked about. Now we  are in the Senate. The Republicans have a healthcare bill, but they  will not let us see it.   I am the ranking Democrat on the Health Subcommittee of the Finance  Committee. You would think someone would have reached out to have  conversations with me and members of our subcommittee--members of our  whole committee--but that has not happened. They are letting the Trump  administration see it, but not the American public. They are letting K  Street lobbyists see it. That is probably where I will get a copy  first--through lobbyists--but not the American public, who will lose  their healthcare and pay more.   If you have cancer and you are not going to be able to get coverage,  if you are going to potentially be dropped or have preexisting  conditions or get caps put on the number of cancer treatments you can  receive, I believe you have a right to see this bill. If you have  epilepsy and will lose your insurance, you have a right to see this  bill. If you are a woman who will be charged more for insurance and be  considered to have a preexisting condition just because you are a  woman, you have a right to see this bill. If you are senior whose rates  are going to go skyrocketing upward, you have a right to see this bill.  But the sad fact is, Republicans don't think the American people have a  right to know or to see this bill or to review it or to comment on it-- to have a chance to give their opinion on it.   The difference in process couldn't be more clear between the way the  Affordable Care Act was originally worked on for about 18 months and  then passed and what is happening right now. In 2009, Republicans  called for a fair, collaborative, and deliberative legislative process.  I agree. In fact, we all agree.   From 2009 to 2010, the Senate Finance Committee held more than 53  hearings on health reform--hearings, open committee meetings, work  sessions. As a new member of Finance at that time, I was involved in  every single one of those, with hours and hours of listening,  deliberating, people sharing their opinions, and debating. Counting the  HELP Committee deliberations, there were 100 hearings and committee  meetings before the bill was finalized and debated to be reported out  of committee.   The Republicans have had no hearings--zero hearings. They have had no  public meetings--zero public meetings.   During the Finance Committee markup, when we were working through and  voting out the bill, we considered 135 amendments, often late into the  night. The final Senate bill included 147 Republican amendments. In the  end, we were trying to do everything we could to get bipartisan  support, when it was clear that politically there was not a desire-- even with 147 Republican amendments in the bill--to have a bipartisan  healthcare bill.   Republicans will not even allow us to see the bill, let alone amend  it. Our position is very clear. If there is no hearing, there is no  vote. We need them to show us the bill.   There is, I think, a really good reason they will not show us the  bill. They will not let us see it because it is a disaster for the  American people. It is a disaster for the people in Michigan whom I  represent.   From the House bill, we know that 14 million fewer people will be  insured after the first year; 23 million fewer people will be insured  after 10 years. This may change somewhat back and forth. We have no  idea. But we know the general framework the Senate is working in is the  same general framework as the House. We know that in 2026, according to  the Congressional Budget Office, 51 million people under the age of 65  will be uninsured--no insurance.   We are told that premiums would go up 20 percent next year, and  States would be allowed to opt out of key insurance laws that protect  consumers. To really understand what that means--that means all of the  decisions about your care go back to the insurance companies, not your  doctor. Laws that protect people with preexisting conditions are gone.  Rules that prevent women from being charged more are gone. Laws that  prevent seniors from being charged more are gone. And the way it used  to be is that if you got sick, the insurance company could decide to  drop you. It was the insurance company that said how many cancer  treatments you were able to receive or mental health visits, if any,  you would receive. You always paid more than for physical health--the  same with addiction.   This all goes away with what is being talked about here. In other  words, costs are going to go up, and care is going to go down. To add  insult to injury, all of this is going to go to tax cuts for  multimillionaires and billionaires, to drug companies and insurance  companies--while someone is losing nursing home care, cancer  treatments, maternity care, and children will be unable to go to the  doctor and parents forced to go back to using the emergency room.   I want to share with my colleagues what these changes would mean for  people in Michigan. There are so many people I have talked to, so many  stories I have heard. I received a letter from a woman named Amy who  owns a small retail business in Michigan. She has health insurance  through her husband's job--a small business owner. Amy has chronic  myeloid leukemia. It is managed with a medication that costs $20,000 a  month--not a year, a month. After her deductible and 10-percent copay,  she said she quickly reaches the maximum out-of-pocket expense on her  insurance each year. Amy wrote:         Preexisting conditions, maximum out-of-pocket costs and       lifetime cap costs are important to me. . . . [Without them]       I could never afford my health care. Without the ACA, I could       quickly bankrupt my family and still die. . . . Please       consider my situation when deciding your vote on any changes       to the ACA. I need your help. I want and need to stay alive       and raise my children.    Healthcare reform allows Amy to stay on her husband's insurance plan  and pay for the cancer treatments that are keeping her alive. The  Republican plan would put people with preexisting conditions like  cancer at the mercy of health insurance companies.   Here is another way the Republican plan would hurt American families.  Thanks to the Medicaid expansion, 650,000 people are newly covered  under what we call the Healthy Michigan Plan. The good news is, 97  percent of Michigan children can now go to the doctor. They don't have  to wait and go to the emergency room. If they have a cold, their mom or  dad can take them to a doctor. They can get preventive care, rather  than waiting until something awful happens and going to the emergency  room. What is the good news for the State of Michigan out of that?  Michigan will end up, this year going into next year, with $432 million  more in the treasury. Taxpayer dollars aren't going to have to be used  on healthcare because the right thing was done--creating a way for  children to see a doctor. What has happened? We have a 50-percent  reduction on folks who don't have insurance going into the emergency  room, and it saves money when you do that. The number of people treated  has gone down 50 percent--the number of people treated without  insurance.    The great thing about healthcare to understand is that if we ignore  it, it doesn't mean people don't get sick, that they don't get cancer,  that they don't need a nursing home or that their child doesn't get  sick. If you just ignore it, the costs go up because people ultimately  use the most expensive ways to get treated.   If you actually plan it out and do the right thing on the front end  and people can see a doctor and they can get the checkups and the care  they need and the treatments they need, you actually save money. That  is the example of the State of Michigan.   The Republican plan would end the Medicaid expansion. Healthy  Michigan would go away. One young man in Michigan only 19 years old  shared his story of living with his single mom when he was diagnosed  with testicular cancer. He was working, but his employer didn't offer  health insurance. He  [[Page S3584]]  didn't have transportation to get to his appointments or treatments.   Thanks to Healthy Michigan, he got insurance and treatment at Munson  Healthcare in Traverse City. He is now free from cancer, has a job with  benefits, and is engaged to be married, and we wish him well. Healthy  Michigan and the Medicaid expansion saved this young man's life.   The Republican plan would end the Healthy Michigan plan, ripping  coverage from 650,000 people in Michigan, including cancer patients.  And for what? And for what? To pay for tax breaks for drug companies  and the ultrawealthy one more time. This means Michigan families will  be unable to care for their loved ones when they need it most.   In January, I led a forum on Secretary Price's healthcare policies,  and a woman came from Michigan to tell her story. Ann was diagnosed  with multiple sclerosis when she was 40 years old, and she has very  limited use of her arms and legs. We are so grateful that she made the  trip to DC to share her story. Medicare and secondary insurance cover  most of the cost of her medication, which costs an astonishing $75,000  a year. That is nearly her entire household income, including Social  Security benefits.   Ann had been caring for her aging mom when her mom's dementia  worsened. Ann didn't know where she would find the $6,000 a month for  nursing home care. How many families are in that situation?   Fortunately, Ann's mom qualified for Medicaid. By the way, three out  of five seniors in Michigan are able to get their nursing home care  through Medicaid. Three out of five are getting nursing home care  because of Medicaid, including Ann's mom.   This nursing home care paid for the final 3 years of her life. Here  is what Ann said:         It was only because of Medicaid that she was able to get       the help that she needed at the end of her life. I don't know       how I could have cared for my mother on top of managing my       own care. My family would have lost our home and all our       savings in trying to keep up with their bills.    Medicaid helped Ann care for her mom at the end of her life. This is  a good thing.   Again, the Republican plan would cut Medicaid by $834 billion. That  is the House plan coming over. We don't know how much would be cut  here, but we know whatever will be cut will be used to pay for tax  breaks for drug companies, insurance CEOs, millionaires, and  billionaires. How does that reflect American values?   In conclusion, Republicans are hiding their bill because they know it  is a bad deal for American families. It is a bad deal. The President of  the United States called it ``mean.'' I agree with him. It is mean, and  it is definitely a bad deal for the people I represent in Michigan.  Costs go up and care goes down, all to cut taxes for millionaires and  billionaires. We are better than this as a country. Our Nation is  better than this.   It is time for Republicans to show us the bill so we can work on it  together. Give us a chance. Give the American people a chance to have  input, to say what they think before it is forced on them in a secret  process that is rammed through this floor. It is time to move beyond  partisanship to get something done for the American people.   Again, I know that the 48 Democratic Senators in this Chamber want to  work on lowering the cost of prescription drugs, reducing out-of-pocket  costs, helping small businesses that want to provide coverage for their  employees, and making the healthcare system better.   Let's stop this bad bill and work together on behalf of the American  people.   I yield the floor.
