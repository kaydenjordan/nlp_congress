 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one  remarkable leader, Sheriff E.J. ``Joe'' King, whose life and legacy I  hold with unwavering great respect.   He was and is an absolute legend in Brazoria County and will be  missed by not only Brazoria County, but by many, many more. Brazoria  County has lost an outstanding public servant whose contributions to  our community are immeasurable.   Sheriff King's journey of public service began with 2 years in the  United States Army, followed by a 12-year tenure as a trooper for the  Texas Department of Public Safety. He then went on to serve as a  lieutenant with the Brazoria Police Department for 2 years before being  elected as sheriff in 1980. For an impressive 24 years, he led with  dedication as the Brazoria County sheriff until December of 2004.   Even after his tenure as sheriff, he answered the call to serve yet  again once more becoming Brazoria County's judge in 2007 until his  retirement in 2014.   Throughout his distinguished career, Sheriff King exemplified the  true essence of a law enforcement officer. His courage, integrity, and  relentless pursuit of justice set a standard for others to follow.   Under his leadership, the sheriff's office underwent significant  reforms and embraced progressive initiatives, ensuring the safety and  security of all its citizens.   Beyond his official duties, Joe King was deeply involved in the  community. He actively supported charitable causes and community-driven  initiatives, understanding the importance of connecting with residents  and developing trust and cooperation. As county judge, he bridged the  gap between government and the people, tirelessly addressing the needs  of Brazoria County's population.   Sheriff King cherished his family most. His wife of 32 years, Jackie,  his son, his daughter, and four grandsons were the center of his  retirement years. He took immense pride in being a loving grandpa and a  cattle rancher.   As we mourn the loss of this extraordinary leader, we take comfort in  knowing that Joe King's legacy lives on through the lives he touched  and the positive changes he made in Brazoria County.   It is now our responsibility as a community to honor his memory by  carrying on his work, cherishing the values he embodied, and nurturing  the spirit of service that he instilled in us all.   Mr. Speaker, let us all come together to remember and celebrate  Sheriff King's remarkable life. Sheriff King may no longer be with us,  but his legacy will continue to inspire us to build a brighter future  for Brazoria County.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Constable Christopher Bates, Sr., of Jefferson County Precinct 2, for  being named the 2023 United States Constable of the Year by the  National Constables and Marshals Association.   Constable Bates is a mainstay in the Jefferson County community, a  leader in his precinct and in his church. He is truly an amazing  example of the best from Texas 14.   I could not be prouder representing Constable Bates, as he not only  represents Jefferson County, but the entire United States. With this  accomplishment behind him, I am very excited to see what Constable  Bates' future will hold for him and our community.   Please join me in recognizing the extraordinary service of Constable  Christopher Bates, Sr. We are extremely proud of him.                            ____________________
