 Mr. Speaker, slashing the corporate tax rate from 35  percent to 20 percent means one thing: a massive windfall for  investors. While the champagne flows at the Trump Hotel after-party,  middle class Americans would get nothing from this plan other than  their deductions taken away for medical expenses, housing, and college  loan interest payments. People won't even be able to deduct for most  State and local income taxes paid, while large corporations would  continue to do so.   Here is the real shocker: fully 35 percent of the windfall, between  $500 billion and $700 billion this decade, will go to foreign investors  who own 35 percent of American stock. That money will be lost to us  forever. It won't be there for Medicare or Medicaid or anything else.   Blowing up our deficit by $1.5 trillion while transferring that much  wealth to big corporations is a terrible idea. It is atrocious when you  realize that we won't just be spoiling superrich Americans with  billions of dollars, we will be spoiling superrich foreigners, too.   Let's stop this speeding train and come up with a bipartisan tax plan  that works for all Americans.                            ____________________
