 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Yeoman 3rd Class Irene G.  Norman, an American hero who served in World War II.   Irene Norman enlisted in the Navy WAVES on October 28, 1944. She  began her service in Bronx, New York, where she learned the trade of  sheet metal fabrication. She was then assigned to her permanent duty  station at Naval Air Station Miami in Florida, where she was  responsible for repairing damaged aircraft so that they could continue  to be used in the war effort.   Yeoman 3rd Class Norman was honorably discharged in 1946 after 2  years of service to her country. Mrs. Norman returned home and attended  Hiwassee College in Madisonville, Tennessee. She went to work for the  local newspaper after graduation and did everything, from writing  articles to selling ads. She wrote a column for the paper called  ``Heads and Hearts'' that she was very proud of.   Additionally, Mrs. Norman married and raised three wonderful children  after she completed her service.   Mr. Speaker, our country's heroes are the men and women of our Armed  Forces, like Mrs. Norman, who served and sacrificed for our freedom. It  is my honor to recognize Yeoman 3rd Class Irene G. Norman as the  Tennessee Second District's January 2020 Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
