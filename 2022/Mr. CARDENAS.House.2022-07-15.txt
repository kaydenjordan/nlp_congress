 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Women's  Health Protection Act and lend my voice to the chorus of calls across  the country for urgent action on abortion rights.   When I first heard the news of the Dobbs decision, I felt as if I  were thrown into another country--a country without our Constitution.   How is it that such a fundamental right to our autonomy over one's  body, over one's life, and over one's future can be stripped away so  callously?   We are talking about far-right Justices telling women that they  cannot get the care that they need and telling doctors that they cannot  treat their patients to the best of their ability. Yes, these five  Justices with no medical expertise stole the fundamental freedom of  controlling the health of one's own body and opened the floodgates to  criminalize doctors for doing their job.   Make no mistake, Madam Speaker: this is a stain on our healthcare  system and a flat-out assault on health equity, and it is a self- inflicted wound.   This resolution will leave women--especially women of color and low- income women, including White women--in the lurch. So in the absence of  any respect or compassion for reproductive health in this country, we,  as a body, must show our leadership. It is incumbent upon us elected  officials to ensure that the basic right is restored and finally  written into law.   The Women's Health Protection Act will do that. It would restore 50  years of precedent and right a deeply invasive wrong. History has its  eyes on us.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
