 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Dr. Carol Harter, the first female and longest serving president in the  history of the University of Las Vegas.   I was fortunate to teach at UNLV during her tenure, where I witnessed  firsthand her dedication to higher education, her student-centered  leadership style, and her passion for research and learning. She was a  recognized scholar, an able administrator, and one tough lady.   Carol served as president from 1995 to 2006 during one of the  university's most productive stages: creating 100 new programs,  overseeing construction of 17 new buildings, and cofounding the  internationally recognized Black Mountain Institute. It is in large  part thanks to her that UNLV is a leading institution today.   My condolences to Carol's family and the entire UNLV community. We  will remember her through the inimitable footprint she left on campus  and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article titled, ``Let Her  Record Prove Them Wrong.''                      Let Her Record Prove Them Wrong         President Emerita Carol C. Harter, who broke down barriers       while building up UNLV's status as a research institution,       passed away at age 82.                                EDITOR'S NOTE         UNLV President Emerita Carol C. Harter has passed away       Sept. 14, 2023, at age 82. She was UNLV's longest-serving       president and steered the university through a period of       rapid growth. Her work set the stage for its eventual rise as       a top research institution. This story was originally       published in September 2022.        Numerology insists that the number 711 is as lucky as luck       can get. Carol C. Harter was UNLV's seventh president. Her       tenure lasted 11 years. Do the math and you realize:       Numerology nailed it. The president emerita was lucky for       UNLV.                           LEAVING A LASTING LEGACY         ``In my very first speech I made to the faculty, I said,       `We need to be the kind of major urban university that UCLA,       or the other great institutions are--because we can do that,'       '' recalls Harter, who guided UNLV's impressive growth during       her 1995-2006 presidency.        That was an ambition the longest-serving UNLV president       pursued aggressively, with impressive results. To thumbnail       her list of accomplishments--not an easy task--consider just       a partial legacy list:        Overseeing unprecedented growth, with the construction of       17 new buildings, including the Lied Library.        Creating 100-plus new degree programs--most notably those       conferred by the School of Dental Medicine and the William S.       Boyd School of Law, championing the creation of both.        Putting the university on the path toward a Carnegie-      designated R1 research institution, a feat it would       accomplish in 2018.        Making UNLV more student-centered and responsive to       students' needs.        Spearheading funding to create the Greenspun College of       Urban Affairs.        Spurring the Invent the Future campaign, at the time the       most ambitious fundraising program in UNLV history.        Cofounding the international literary center, Beverly       Rogers, Carol C. Harter Black Mountain Institute, which she       continued to lead after departing the presidency.        Oh, and she also made history as the university's first       female president, a milestone she built upon by promoting       gender equality on campus and in the community, supporting       the creation of the Women's Research Institute of Nevada.        ``Just keep going--that's my number one piece of advice,''       Harter says she tells young women hoping to carve out       academic administration careers similar to hers. ``You know       who you are, you're in a position where your education is       likely to be at a high level, there's nothing you can't do.       And don't let anybody stop you or say, `That's not your job.'       ''        As she rose in her career, Harter often found herself the       only woman in a room of executives. ``You may feel       uncomfortable,'' she says, ``But, it's not a barrier.''                         A LOVE OF LITERATURE BLOOMS         No barriers deterred Harter, whose journey to the heights       of academia began humbly in Brooklyn, N.Y., where she was       born on June 1, 1941.        ``We were not rich at all, we lived modestly in a little       house,'' she says, fondly recalling the pleasures of a New       York upbringing and a working-class life. ``We would go to       Jones Beach regularly, where I worked as a clerk, a cashier,       and a lifeguard.''        Harter's dad was a businessman who had earned a degree in       finance from New York University, attending at night over       many years.        ``He hoped I would be interested in the business world one       way or the other, which in a way you are when you're a       president of a university,'' she says.``You're running a       major operation, it's a business life as well as an academic       one. So, he was very proud of what I did.''        Her mom, a typical homemaker of the period, took pleasure       in her daughter's penchant for reading and creativity.        ``She was just a darling thing,'' Harter says of her       mother. ``She was very supportive all the way and loved the       artistic side of me and the literary side.''        That literary side was apparent early on. First came a       classic of young female readership: The Nancy Drew mysteries.        ``I read every single one of them, one end to the other,''       says Harter, who later happily lost herself to serious       literature via a collection purchased by her mom. ``It was       beautifully bound in gold and brown and green leather. I read       Great Expectations and The Count of Monte Cristo and just       many of the classic books that she had collected. I realized       when I got to college that I had read many classics, that I       had been educating myself.''        Inspired by a high school teacher, Harter excelled in       honors English classes, but also nursed an interest in       chemistry, which might have forged her life's path--had she       not been discouraged.        ``When I went to what then was Harpur College (now       Binghamton University) and tried to enroll as a chemistry       major, the dean of students, who was a woman, said, `You       can't do that, women don't do chemistry, you have to do       something else.'        ``She shouldn't have discouraged me like that, she should       have encouraged me, but I took her advice and enrolled as a       literature major.''        Still, Harter saw literature as more of an avocation than       the launching pad for her eventual career until a faculty       member urged her toward graduate studies, eventually earning       her bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D in English and American       literature.        Along her collegiate journey, she also met Mike--her       husband of 61 years and counting--over a ping pong table in a       campus rec room.        ``I was dating a guy who liked to play, and I would beat       him. And Mike was in that rec room watching and he said he       wanted to play with me. And of course, he beat me.'' she       recalls.        It was love at first serve, more or less. And who wouldn't       trade a table tennis loss for a lifelong love? ``That's for       sure,'' she says. They married when she was 19.                             THE ROAD TO ACADEMIA         Academia as a career commenced for Harter when she served       as dean of students and vice president for administration at       Ohio University, a move she chalks up to serendipity.        While she was working as a faculty member and a campus       ombudsperson, the new president sought her out to inquire       about student and faculty grievances. After impressing him       with her savviness and her ability to work effectively with       students and professors, she rose in the administrative       ranks.        Next came a position as the president of SUNY Geneseo. But       after six years, job limitations caused her eyes to wander       toward other opportunities.        ``I felt a little trapped in it,'' she says, noting that       the system's chancellor at the time didn't make distinctions       among the state's institutions when budgets were handed out.       ``Being really good didn't have any effect on how much money       you got in the budget. Feeling constrained, there wasn't       really anything more I could do for the place without more       money. We just started looking at  [[Page H4430]]       what kind of place is likely to be a place where we can use       some creativity.''        Enter a city on the other side of the country, one known       for constant reinvention.        ``It's weird when you're at Geneseo as the president, a       little upstate New York liberal arts school and you wind up       in a major city that's just growing a major university. I       tell you, that is a big move,'' Harter says. ``I've been here       25 years and people still ask me, `How the heck did Carol       Harter wind up in Las Vegas?' ''        Here's how the heck she did:        ``Las Vegas was growing like crazy and the institution was       very young and was in competition with Reno to get started.       It just made it real attractive to me. It was just an       aspirational kind of feeling that we could make something       great out of UNLV. And I think it's happened. It's an       attractive place for faculty and students, I think.''        Not that her entrance into the campus community was easy.       She had to get past resistance all-too-common to anyone       breaking through a glass ceiling. Such issues would follow       her throughout her tenure, but Harter was determined to let       her record prove them wrong.        ``Several of the exact people who resisted terribly at the       beginning became good friends and supporters, who end up       saying, `This person is pretty good.' It helps a lot to       strengthen the institution and the presidency.''        Of all her storied accomplishments, she cites several that       stand out, including UNLV's status as an RI research       institution.        ``At that time (when she was named president), we were       barely research two, I think we might have even been research       three,'' she says. ``It is research one now, which is great,       a great accomplishment.''        Also on the pride list: The launching of professional       schools for law, dentistry, and architecture, as well as       laying the groundwork for the eventual opening of the Kirk       Kerkorian School of Medicine.        ``It took three years before I could persuade the (NSHE)       Board of Regents and the chancellor, that the law school was       something we should do,'' she says.        It is still the only law school in the state.        ``The architecture program was there as a small program. We       made it into a major school with its own faculty and its own       facilities. And, we launched 50 graduate programs in my years       there as president.''        Such a fruitful career couldn't end with her presidency--      and didn't. After leaving the administration, Harter, along       with English professor Richard Wiley, cofounded the Black       Mountain Institute, headquartered at UNLV, to promote       literacy around the globe.        ``When I knew I was leaving the presidency, I thought I       could do it then. So did (Southern Nevada business titan)       Glenn Schaeffer, who had been a real supporter of literary       activity at UNLV,'' Harter says. ``We felt there was no       school in Nevada that really had a literary center that could       be a shining light. He came to me and said, `I will invest in       it, if you can get something started that we can work on.' ''        And that brought Carol Harter back to the young girl from       Brooklyn who was first entranced by Nancy Drew mysteries. The       passion has not dimmed, even as she relaxes at her and her       husband's San Diego summer retreat, overlooking the sailboats       gliding over Mission Bay.        ``I'm in a book club,'' she says. ``It's always a novel of       one kind or another I read every day, and my husband does       too, so we're readers together. I'm the same ol' person.''        Carol Harter makes Las Vegas--and Brooklyn--justifiably       proud.                            ____________________
