 Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about  the battle between the jury system and a system in which regular  Americans are forced into arbitration, which has a terrible record.   I can remember years ago, when I was attorney general, the attorneys  general shut down one of the arbitration systems because it was so  corrupted and was throwing decisions to big corporate interests, and  you cannot really understand that unless you understand the importance  of the role of the jury in our country.   For centuries, the jury has served as a last sanctuary within our  constitutional structure for people who seek justice and fair treatment  under the law. It was designed for a specific purpose. When Big  Interests control our executive officials, as the Founding Fathers knew  they could, when lobbyists have the legislatures tied in knots, as our  Founding Fathers knew they could, and when media outlets steer public  opinion against individuals, as our Founding Fathers saw that they  could, the hard, square corners of the jury box stand firm against that  tide of influence and money.   There is a lot of history here. It was the earliest American settlers  who brought the jury to our country as precious cargo from England.   The Virginia Colony established the jury in 1624, roughly a year  before the Dutch even settled the island of Manhattan. Early Americans  created juries in 1628 in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, in 1677 in the  Colony of West New Jersey, and in 1682 in Pennsylvania. Indeed, in our  Declaration of Independence, our colonists put forward a list of  grievances and admonished King George III for--and I quote them in the  Declaration of Independence--``depriving us in many cases, of the  benefits of Trial by Jury.''   When the original Constitution was silent on the jury, Americans  sounded the alarm, and the Seventh Amendment was sent to the States in  the Bill of Rights.   Alexander Hamilton, a famous Revolutionary-era Founder, stated in  Federalist No. 83: ``The friends and adversaries in the plan of the  convention, if they agree in nothing else, concur at least in the value  they set upon the trial by jury; or, if there is any difference between  them, it consists in this: the former regard it as a valuable safeguard  to liberty; the latter represent it as the very palladium of free  government.''   Going on to the mid-19th century, when Alexis de Tocqueville wrote  his famous ``Democracy in America,'' he observed that the jury should  be understood in America as a ``political institution'' and ``one form  of the sovereignty of the people.'' What did he mean? How does the jury  protect the sovereignty of the people? Well, in two ways, as Sir  William Blackstone explained.   Sir William Blackstone was probably the most cited source in those  early days of the founding of our Republic and in the early days of the  development of our laws. Sir William Blackstone explained that trial by  jury ``preserves in the hands of the people that share which they ought  to have in the administration of public justice, and prevents the  encroachments of the more powerful and wealthy citizens.''   Those are two separate thoughts. First, the civil jury devolves a  share of government power--power which they ought to have--directly to  the people. But second and uniquely, in a Constitution otherwise  devoted to protecting the individual against the power of the State,  the civil jury is designed to protect the individual against other  individuals--more specifically, against other more powerful and wealthy  individuals.   Even former Chief Justice William Rehnquist observed about this era  that ``the Founders of our Nation considered the right of trial by jury  in civil cases an important bulwark against tyranny and corruption, a  safeguard too precious to be left to the whim of the sovereign.''   That is at heart what this fight is about. Remember Blackstone's  words: The jury ``prevents the encroachments of the more powerful and  wealthy'' citizens. That means the jury is intended to be a thorn in  the side of the powerful and wealthy. It is intended to make the  powerful and wealthy stand equal--annoyingly equal to them--before the  law with everyone else. The jury is intended to be the little branch of  government that the wealthy and powerful can't get to, can't fix, can't  control. That is why jury panels are new every time. If you had a  permanent panel of the same jurors over and over, the powerful and  wealthy would tend to influence the institution. The jury stands  against all that tide of influence. That is what it is there for. That  is how it was designed. Who is more powerful and wealthy today than  mighty corporations and big special interests? And guess what--big  corporations and special interests hate the jury. The small institution  has big enemies.   It would astound the Founding Fathers to see how far we have fallen  from the popular affection and loyalty for the jury trial in 1776.  Juries are indeed about dispute resolution and about making sure that  everybody can get a fair shake and that powerful and wealthy interests  can't put the fix in, but more than that, the civil jury helps check  power.   The American system of government is built on the premise that  divided government and separated powers--checks and balances--will best  protect individual liberty. The civil jury distributes authority of the  State directly to citizens, giving them direct power to resolve  disputes--sometimes very important disputes--and it gives them this  power in a way that makes it very hard for special interests to  control.   Well, if we look around today, the influence of wealth and power  suffuses the legislative and executive branches. Corporate lobbying and  corporate and billionaire election spending are at unprecedented  levels. In our political debate, dark money dollars drown out the  voices of average citizens in what has been called ``a tsunami of  slime,'' and all that money is not spent for nothing.   Powerful interests love a game that is rigged in their favor--always  have, always will. It is a tale as old as time. Well, rigging the game  doesn't go over well in the jury box. Special interests may seek  special influence with legislators and regulators all of the time. It  is their constant activity, licensed and regulated by lobbying and  campaign finance laws. Their every waking moment is devoted to  tampering with the legislative and executive branches, but tampering  with a jury is a crime, and it is a crime for a reason.   In a world where so many feel powerless, juries give regular citizens  real authority. In a world of fractious partisanship, juries make  citizens work together and decide together. And in a world in which  injustices pile up against barricades of well-kept indifference, a jury  can blow the status quo to smithereens. This is the vital  constitutional role of the civil jury. This is what mandatory  arbitration is designed to attack--to remove the access of regular  citizens to this institution of our government which was so important  to our Founding Fathers because it is an institution that the wealthy  and powerful cannot control. They can control mandatory arbitration.  Over and over again, it has been shown to be subject to corporate  favoritism and control. There is a reason that the big and powerful  special interests want to get rid of access to a jury and want to force  people into mandatory arbitration. They are not doing it for the sake  of having their adversaries and opponents get better access to justice;  they are doing it to shut off access to the civil jury. They want  everybody forced into rigged games.  [[Page S6748]]    We ought to be fighting to preserve and enhance the civil jury as an  element of the uniquely American system of self-government. Our  forefathers fought and bled and died to create and preserve this system  of government in which the civil jury has a vital role. From Alexander  Hamilton to Alexis de Tocqueville, to William Blackstone, to William  Rehnquist--you can go on and on in our history with people who have  pointed out the vital role of our jury. Squelching it is the task of  the wealthy and powerful, mighty corporations that seek to squelch it  and force everybody into corporate-friendly, mandatory arbitration.   We should think on this question in the long view--not who gets the  immediate benefit of not having to face trained lawyers, not having to  face people in an open forum, not having to be before a free and  independent jury. We should think of the message of our Founding  Fathers, who put the need for a civil jury right into the Declaration  of Independence, who demanded it as part of our Bill of Rights, and who  saw it as an essential element of our liberty.   With that, I yield.   I see my distinguished colleague from Maryland.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Thank you, Mr. President.   I want to start by thanking my friend and colleague from Rhode Island  for pointing out why we have a jury system, a system of our peers who  can listen to all sides of an argument in a fair way and render  justice.   What this resolution does is prohibits many consumers around the  country from having the choice of going before a jury as part of a  group of people who have been wronged.   For months, the American people had been hearing stories of how big  banks, big financial institutions, have engaged in various schemes that  harmed consumers and cheated consumers out of millions and millions of  dollars. The most notorious recently, of course, was the case of Wells  Fargo, which opened up a lot of fake accounts--meaning they opened  accounts without consumers asking them to open accounts--and then  charged consumers for those accounts. It is a fact that Wells Fargo in  many cases tried to use forced arbitration to prevent those people who  had been wronged from getting access to justice, from being compensated  for their harm.   We also heard about the Equifax case. Equifax is a credit reporting  agency. They collect gobs of information on all of us--on over 170  million Americans--without our permission. We don't say: Equifax, go  out and dig up as much information about us as you can and put it on  your computer system. They go out and do it. We all know that they were  subjected to a massive hack and that very confidential, highly personal  information on over 100 million Americans has now been compromised.   One of the things Equifax did after that was they said to consumers:  You know what, we know that your information may have been compromised  because of this hack on our system, and we want to help protect you,  but if you want our protection, you have to sign away your rights to be  part of a class action lawsuit against us.   That was their original plan and their original instinct. Well, there  was a big public outcry about that, and they backed off. But the former  CEO of Equifax, in a Banking Committee hearing just a few weeks ago,  said they backed off in response to the public outcry, but if they had  done business as usual, they would have prevented those consumers from  getting compensation for wrongs through the court system.   Even after we hear about Equifax and that scandal and the Wells Fargo  banking scandal, we are here on the floor of the Senate not to help  even the playing field for consumers but to take away a right that  consumers now have to help even the playing field against these big  banks and financial institutions. It is entirely backward.   I want to read from the statement that was issued by the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, the CFPB, on July 10 of this year when  they issued their new rule. Here was the headline: ``CFPB issues rule  to ban companies from using arbitration clauses to deny groups of  people their day in court.'' Simple as that. It went on to say that  financial companies can no longer block consumers from joining together  to sue over wrongdoing. It pointed out that companies use mandatory  arbitration clauses to deny groups of people their day in court. They  went on to say that many consumer financial products, like credit cards  and bank accounts, have arbitration clauses in their contracts that  prevent consumers from joining together to sue their bank or financial  company for wrongdoing. That is right. We all know that in the fine  print of a lot of credit card applications, in the fine print that  consumers get from a lot of big financial institutions, and in the fine  print of auto loans, they have buried these provisions that compel  those consumers to give up their rights.    This is not a question--I have heard conversations on the floor  today--about whether arbitration in and of itself is a good or a bad  way to resolve disputes. If I have been wronged or you have been  wronged and you agree voluntarily to enter into an arbitration dispute  mechanism, fine. Do it voluntarily. That is not what this is about. It  is not what it is about at all.   This is about forcing arbitration. We listened to the CEO of Wells  Fargo. We listened to the former CEO of Equifax. They all say they  value their consumers. They want to make sure they do right by their  consumers, but it turns out they don't trust their consumers at all  because they want to take away from those same consumers the right to  seek justice through the court system if that is what those consumers  choose to do. That is exactly why the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau took the action it did to protect consumers and to make sure  that they could not be compelled into arbitration. If they chose it  after they had been wronged, that is their decision, but this is about  mandatory arbitration and forcing consumers to give up their rights.   We have heard a lot about the Washington swamp. This resolution to  overturn this consumer protection provision is the Washington swamp at  its muckiest and at its smelliest.   Now, I have a letter I received today from the American Legion,  people who have represented men and women who have served our country.  Here is what it says. This is from the legislative director at the  American Legion:         Dear friends and colleagues, I write to reiterate the       American Legion's strong support for the Consumer Financial       Protection Bureau arbitration rule in light of reports that       the Senate could vote on the matter as early as this evening.    The alarm bells went up at the American Legion and other places.         You may recall that I emailed you about this on October 2.       That email is below, but today I want to share a couple of       additional points.    Point No. 1 is in bold.         A vote to overturn the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau       arbitration rule is a vote against our military and veterans.    That is from the American Legion.   I want to read some of the other veterans organizations that are  against this action that the Senate is headed toward tonight: Blue Star  Families, Military Order of the Purple Heart, the National Guard  Association of the United States, National Military Family Association,  Reserve Officers Association, and the list goes on and on. They are  joined by consumer protection groups.   Here is what the American Legion said in their October letter to  every Member of the Senate. It says that the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau's rule on arbitration agreements addresses the  widespread harm of forced arbitration by restoring the ability of  servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers to join together and seek  relief in class action lawsuits when financial institutions break the  law.   The American Legion summed it up just perfectly here. They pointed  out that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau put forward a rule  that said that veterans who have been wronged or cheated can join  together to seek justice in the court system and that other consumer  groups can as well. I have heard a lot of talk today about people  saying: You know what, we actually passed this law a little while ago  that would protect servicemembers and that would allow servicemembers  to band together to seek justice.  [[Page S6749]]    Well, I have two points. One is the American Legion and all of these  veterans groups, they don't think that was good enough, and they are  appalled at what the Senate is thinking about doing tonight.   The second question is this. Yes, we should protect our veterans, but  why shouldn't we also be protecting all of the other consumers around  the United States of America? Why shouldn't they be able to seek  justice? Why should they be compelled to go to arbitration when they  would rather choose to go through the court system?   We have heard fellow Members talk about why the deck is stacked  against individuals. Just think about it. You get cheated by your bank.  Maybe it is 100 bucks, or maybe it is 500 bucks. You get on the phone,  and you know you are put on there forever. You are put on hold. You are  put on hold, and you finally get through. You get somebody. Maybe they  pass you to somebody else or maybe you get dropped in the process. But  at the end of the day, in order for you to get your money back when  they have been wronged, under this provision, the old provision, you  would have to go to arbitration and you would have to shell out a lot  of money, and the big banks know that. So what they fear is that all of  us, as consumers who have been cheated, we have a chance to get  together. It is a class action. It is when everyone who has been  wronged can get together and actually have a little bit of power and  leverage against a big bank, whether it is Wells Fargo or Equifax or  whoever it may be. That is the whole idea of a class action. People get  to band together, and that is what the American Legion is asking the  Senate to do--to let veterans band together but also just to let  American consumers band together to seek justice.   I just want to share with the Senate a story about one of my Maryland  constituents and what happened to one of my Maryland constituents  because I think a lot of people can relate. This is a pretty  extraordinary story, but they can relate to how one individual feels  like when they are fighting against a big organization. This was a  story that was reported on NPR, and the Maryland constituents' name is  Michael Feifer.   Here is what happened. One morning in February, Michael Feifer was  heading off to his job in Maryland at a company that builds guitars. He  walked to the spot where he parked his car. His car wasn't there, and  so he called the police. He called the police. He said: I was livid. I  thought someone stole my car.   Well, somebody had made off with Feifer's car, but it wasn't a car  thief. It was Wells Fargo Bank. The police informed him of this when he  called them up, and Michael Feifer said: That is when I found out my  car was repossessed.   Now, he had no idea why Wells Fargo wanted to repossess his car. He  says his payments were automatically taken out of his checking  account--his car payments. So he called Wells Fargo, and he found out  that the bank had put another insurance policy on his car. Lenders  sometimes do this when a borrower doesn't have insurance. Wells Fargo  calls it collateral protection insurance, CPI. Now, sometimes there is  nothing wrong with that, but Wells Fargo imposed this insurance on  nearly half a million people who already had bought insurance. They  were already covered. Wells Fargo just decided to put another insurance  plan on them and--guess what--started charging them for it.   So that is why right after Feifer's car got repossessed, Wells Fargo  told him that he had been marked delinquent for not paying his  insurance. Now, this again was insurance he didn't want and he didn't  need. Well, they said: Too bad, you owe us $1,500.   Now, Michael Feifer then showed up at the bank with his bank  statements and showed all the payments he had made for the vehicle. He  showed proof of insurance showing that he never had a lapse in his  insurance, and he says the people at the bank said: Well, you shouldn't  owe anything; it is not your fault. He said: They were just as confused  as I was.   Well, then, he said the branch employees tried to be helpful. They  called up the Wells Fargo department that dealt with the details of car  repossessions to find out what was going on, and they kept putting them  on hold. So this is the Wells Fargo department putting their own Wells  Fargo's branch folks on hold. He was there 2\1/2\ hours, and then it  turns out they told him to call back a couple of days later.   Well, he called back a couple of days later, and they said there was  no prior record of his calls to the bank. He said they were very rude  to him. Then, while he was arguing with the bank, they said: We have  repossessed your car. If you don't pay us 600 bucks, we are going to  sell it off. So he paid them 600 bucks. Then he found out that he  wasn't alone and that Wells Fargo had also engaged in this scheme to  sell people car insurance as part of their car loans when they already  had insurance.   So this is a very simple issue. The issue is whether or not consumers  who have been wronged by big banks or other financial institutions can  choose to band together with others to seek justice. What the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau did was to say that consumers have that  right. They have the right to choose how to go about getting justice.   What this Senate resolution does is to take that right away from  consumers and says: If you want to seek justice, you can only go  through forced arbitration, where we know the deck is stacked against  the lonely consumer and stacked in favor of the big banks and the big  financial institutions.   Let's not do that. Let's vote down this resolution. Let's protect the  consumer protections that are in place today.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.    Mr. President, I was just going to ask whether my  colleague would yield for a question.   My distinguished colleague from Connecticut is an extraordinarily  experienced and able lawyer. He was U.S. attorney in Connecticut; for a  long time, he was his State's attorney general, and I think he has  argued more before the U.S. Supreme Court than perhaps anybody in  modern history now in the Senate. One of his passions and one of the  things he focused on in law enforcement was consumer protection,  bringing to justice big entities that had done wrong to consumers.   My question for him, if I may ask one, would be, are there  circumstances--do you have experience of circumstances in which very  big and powerful entities, corporations, or industries engaged in  misconduct, even fraud, in which the individual harm to each of the  consumers was not very big--a bogus $30 fee, a bogus $100 surcharge,  something like that--but multiplied by thousands or tens of thousands  of customers, it became an enormously lucrative fraud for the  institution involved? Is that a situation that happens in real life, in  your view, I ask my distinguished colleague?    If I may ask if the Senator will yield for another  question.    If I may ask if the Senator will yield for another  question.    If I may ask if the Senator will yield for another  question.    If I may ask if the Senator will yield for another  question.    As I understand from the Senator's response to my  last question, if you force the victims of low-dollar but multi-victim  fraud to have arbitration as their only remedy, you are way less likely  to get consumers asserting their rights, and ultimately you may have  low-dollar, multi-consumer frauds that remain very remunerative for the  crooked outfit conducting the massive fraud.   I get the Senator's point that the incentives are such that it is  very hard for an individual consumer to be willing to pursue that  claim. If there is no way to aggregate themselves together into a class  action, then there is really no way to pursue that claim.   But my second question goes to a further point, which is that the  power of a court in a matter like that includes the power not just to  award damages but to provide other relief: to direct the company to  quit the fraud, to give orders to people to clean up their act, to  promise never to do it again, and so forth. I am not aware of any  arbitration panel that has ever been given that authority or has ever  used their limited power as arbiters or arbitrators to try to influence  the behavior of the corporation.   Is there not also a significant difference between an individual  consumer being forced to go to an often stacked arbitration panel to  pursue a claim that is so small, it is not worth their money, and the  simple power to provide the real remedy the public seeks, as the  Senator so wisely said, to protect the next consumer? It is not just  about the people who got their pockets picked, who paid their  unreasonable fee, who got defrauded; it is about stopping it so the  future consumer is protected. I am not familiar with arbitration panels  having that power.    And not infrequent in class action cases?    And not infrequent in class action cases?    In conclusion, is it fair to say that the measure we  are about to vote on will indisputably have the effect of shifting  enormous power  [[Page S6754]]  from consumers to corporations that engage in high-volume but low- dollar fraud?
