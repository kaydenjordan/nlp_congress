 Madam President, most people would be stumped by the  question I am about to ask, and that is, when it comes to the  commission of crime, what is the largest criminal investigation in the  history of the United States? The answer is January 6, 2021. Over 725  individuals have been charged with a Federal crime as a result of that  insurrectionist mob that descended on the Capitol.   The reason I raise that is that we are going through regular-- sometimes daily, sometimes weekly--lectures from Republicans about who  is soft on crime, who is really on the side of the American people when  it comes to defending their homes and their families.   I listen to this debate on a regular basis as chairman of the Senate  Judiciary Committee. Every single nominee who comes from the Biden  White House is subject to being challenged as to whether they are going  to defund the police or whether they are soft on crime. Yet I have to  say that it is hard to explain that these same Republicans asking these  pointed questions to nominees are nowhere to be found when it comes to  discussing January 6, 2021. In fact, many of them were cheerleaders and  apologists for the very  [[Page S759]]  demonstrators who came into this United States Capitol.   To think that a national political party like the Republican Party of  the United States of America branded this insurrectionist mob and their  attack on the Capitol as ``legitimate political discourse''--that was  the official statement, the unanimous statement of the Republican  Party.   Now, a few Republican Senators have dissented. Thank you. But why  haven't more? Why won't they step up and say a crime is a crime? If  over 700 people descended on this Capitol and are being charged with a  crime, they should have to pay the price, whatever it happens to be,  because this just wasn't some idle political exercise. At the end of  the day, we had 6 people dead as a result of that insurrectionist mob,  including law enforcement officers, and 140 law enforcement officers  attacked during the course of that day. We all saw the videos. There  are plenty of them.   Imagine, if you will, the so-called innocent, legitimate political  discourse travelers to Washington just happened to bring bear spray  with them so they could spray police in the face with a poisonous  compound that could, in fact, harm them and did. Does that sound like a  group of political tourists to you? It doesn't to me. These are violent  individuals who are being called to task for having assaulted this  Capitol, broken down the windows and the doors, came in here aping  along these desks in the Chamber, forcing the Vice President of the  United States and Senators who were there that day--and I was one of  them--to exit by the backdoor for their lives. And here we have this  ``We are not soft on crime'' message from Republicans who are making  excuses, not to mention the former President, Donald Trump, who said  that given the opportunity, he would pardon these demonstrators. It is  no surprise in light of what he has done in the past.   But being lectured to regularly by the Republicans about who respects  law enforcement and who is soft on crime--most of them cannot answer  the basic question of what they would do when it comes to the January 6  demonstrators, and the answer they give is totally insufficient.   Madam President, you know personally, because you were here on the  floor yesterday, that isn't all of it. I listen to all this talk about  prosecutors doing their job, and I can't help but think what we went  through yesterday on the floor of the U.S. Senate when the junior  Senator from Arkansas, a Republican Senator, stood here and vainly  tried to defend what he is doing.   Do you know what he is doing? You do personally. He is stopping the  appointment of U.S. attorneys, Federal prosecutors, in State after  State, and he is stopping the appointment of U.S. marshals who keep  those courtrooms safe and the judges safe and transport prisoners and  seek out fugitives. He is personally stopping them from being appointed  in the ordinary course of business in the U.S. Senate.   You have to ask yourself why. There must be a problem with their  qualifications. No. There is not a single question being asked about  the qualifications of these individuals.   Mr. Frierson in the State of Nevada, a person whom you and Senator  Cortez Masto described on the floor yesterday who would be the U.S.  attorney there, clearly is well qualified for that position. The same  is true in Illinois.   Our choice, Senator Duckworth's and my choice for the U.S. marshal to  serve in the Northern District of Illinois, is an individual with 30  years--30 years--of law enforcement experience, a chief of police in  one of the larger suburbs in the city of Chicago.   Do we need the U.S. Marshal's Office to be reinvigorated and  dedicated to its purpose? Of course we do. It wasn't that many years  ago when the family of one of our highly respected Federal judges was  literally murdered in their home by a deranged individual who didn't  care for the way he was treated by that judge. It is a very real  question of personal safety. Yet one Republican Senator from Arkansas  is stopping the appointments of these U.S. attorneys and U.S. marshals  to execute the laws of the land.    Don't tell me you respect law enforcement, and don't tell me you want  to fight crime and then turn around and tie the hands of the Department  of Justice, keeping U.S. attorneys off the job and U.S. marshals away  from their responsibilities. That is the reality.   If we are going to get serious about fighting crime--and I believe we  should--it is all hands on deck. Every Federal law enforcement official  should be doing their part. They cannot do their part when the junior  Senator from Arkansas stops us from even approving their appointments  to these positions. These appointments remain vacant, and we pay a  price for it.   When we receive lectures from the minority leader or from others on  the floor about respect for law and law enforcement, I would say he  ought to start with his own caucus. He ought to call in the junior  Senator from Arkansas and say: Enough. You are stepping on our message.  We are trying to show that we are for law and order, and you are  stopping the appointment of U.S. attorneys and U.S. marshals who are  dedicated to that purpose and risk their lives to do so.   That is not consistent with good law enforcement or sound law and  order as far as I am concerned.   (Mr. BOOKER assumed the Chair.)   Let me conclude by saying that the nominees who come before the  Senate for these judicial positions are a wide variety of individuals  with amazing backgrounds--incredible backgrounds--and who are  consistently rated unanimously ``well qualified'' by the American Bar  Association. It is true that some of them used to sit at the other  table in the criminal courtrooms, not at the prosecutor's table, but  there is nothing wrong with some balance on the court, making sure that  we have all points of view considered and certainly, above all, the law  considered.   We hear, from time to time, compelling anecdotes, such as the one  given by the minority leader related to Louisville, KY. I am not  familiar with the details. But if we are serious about making America  safer, we need to pull together on a bipartisan basis. We need to  approve President Biden's budget, which provides more resources for law  enforcement but also more resources for violence intervention.   The Presiding Officer knows personally, as mayor of a large city in  New Jersey, that we can't arrest our way out of the crime problem in  America. Certainly, we should pursue law enforcement measures and  responses when necessary and apply the law without question, but it  takes more than that. If we are going to reach into the communities  around America and try to stop this violence before it occurs, then we  have to look at other approaches.   I am happy to report that last week we announced the introduction of  the Violence Against Women Act. This is a measure which, for 3 years,  we have been trying to find common ground. We did it. We finally did  it.   I want to salute Senator Feinstein as the lead Democratic sponsor. I  was happy to join her.   I also want to salute Senators Lisa Murkowski and Joni Ernst, from  Alaska and Iowa, respectively. They have done such extraordinary work  in putting together a bill.   You say to yourself: How does this fit in with violence against  women, the question of crime in America?   Well, I can tell you--the Presiding Officer knows this personally,  and it is worth repeating--that I went to the juvenile facility in Cook  County years ago and said: Who are these teenagers who came to the  Earth in the usual way and then turned to gangs and guns and killing  wantonly? What happened to these kids along the way?   Well, there are plenty of reasons and issues related to mental  health, but one of the things that was compelling was the observation  that over 90 percent of them had been victims of trauma. Trauma comes  in many forms, not just physical trauma but to witness trauma on  another person or to be a victim yourself, to have a home where there  is no support, no encouragement, and no values being taught. Those kids  are the ones who end up, many times, in these predicaments.   What can we do about it?   Well, we can probably arrest them after the crime has been committed,  but that really doesn't solve the problem. We have got to do what we  can to intervene in their lives at a stage when they can be saved. I  don't believe that  [[Page S760]]  everyone can be saved, but I do fundamentally believe in redemption and  in our responsibility to engage in it.   That is why this Violence Against Women Act is so important. If we  can reach into a home where physical or mental abuse has taken place of  a spouse or the children and give that person, first, a caring heart-- someone who will listen and hear them out--and then advise them on what  to do to keep themselves safe and keep their kids safe and what to do  in relation to law enforcement, that is a positive move toward taking  violence out of that family and out of America.   So I hope that when we talk about this whole issue of a safer  America, which we all aspire to, we do it in a balanced way; that we  talk about effective prosecution by members of law enforcement who are  playing by the rules and that we also realize it takes more than that.  We need an investment in the communities to make a difference.  President Biden knows that. He included it in this year's budget and  will again in next year's budget. We ought to be standing up and  supporting that as well.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) and the Senator from  New Mexico (Mr. Lujan) are necessarily absent.
