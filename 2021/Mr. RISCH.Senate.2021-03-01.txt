 Mr. President, as a senior member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, each month I recognize and celebrate the American  entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting the success of a small business  in my home State of Idaho. Today, I am pleased to honor Continuous  Composites, Inc., in Coeur d'Alene as the Idaho Small Business of the  Month for March 2021.   Continuous Composites is a technology company developing composite  additive manufacturing solutions cofounded by Ken Tyler, John Swallow,  and Tyler Alvarado in 2015. The company owns the world's earliest  granted patents on Continuous Fiber 3D Printing--CF3D--a revolutionary,  automated manufacturing process that utilizes high-performance  continuous fibers, e.g., carbon fiber, glass fiber, optical fibers,  with ``snap curing'' thermoset resins to produce lightweight, high- performance composite parts on-demand. Historically, composites have  been limited to high-end products, including military applications,  where the advantages of high-performance, low-weight materials outweigh  costly conventional manufacturing processes. CF3D is reshaping  composites manufacturing at exponentially reduced costs and lead times  while providing users with a much greater degree of design freedom. The  company has an extraordinary opportunity to change how industrial  businesses and the Department of Defense innovate and manufacture  throughout the entire product life cycle, from design and prototyping  to serial production and sustainment. Continuous Composites' novel  approach to 3-D printing has garnered interest from many industry  leaders, national laboratories, and government agencies resulting in  strategic partnerships and multimillion dollar equity investments.  Continuous Composites' CF3D technology is directly aligned with the  United States of America's national defense strategy, which has led to  significant engagement from the Air Force Research Laboratory.   Since its founding, Continuous Composites has been rapidly hiring  numerous engineers and business professionals, attracting talent from  across the country to Coeur d'Alene. Last September, Alvarado and  Swallow announced the remodel and opening of a 7,500-square-foot  manufacturing demonstration facility on their campus in downtown Coeur  d'Alene. This historic building is now being used for advanced  research, development, and commercialization of CF3D. The expansion  will provide high-paying, in-demand jobs of the future to the Coeur  d'Alene community.   Continuous Composites is an outstanding example of a small,  trailblazing Idaho business that is leading the way in technological  innovation. Congratulations to Tyler, John, Ken, and the whole  Continuous Composites team for your outstanding achievements. You make  our great State proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
