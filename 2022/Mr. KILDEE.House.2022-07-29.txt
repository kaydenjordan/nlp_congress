 Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor Grand Blanc Township  chief of police Ron Wiles as he retires after 26 years of service on  the police force.   In his quarter century serving Grand Blanc Township, Chief Wiles has  been an incredible champion for community policing, bringing law  enforcement and the community together keeping mid-Michigan residents  safe from crime.   Chief Wiles is an important member of the Genesee County Advocates  and Leaders for Police and Community Trust, or ALPACT, a forum where  community leaders and law enforcement come together to develop public  safety solutions for crime.   Chief Wiles is also well-recognized as a figure across Michigan law  enforcement. Recently, he completed an outstanding term as president of  the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police.   Chief Wiles has also served on the Governor's Traffic Safety Advisory  Commission; and in March, Chief Wiles was appointed by Governor Whitmer  to serve on the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards where  he will continue working to better the law enforcement profession and  keep Michiganians safe.   I personally thank Chief Wiles for his service to our community, for  our work together on behalf of mid-Michigan. Grand Blanc Township has  been blessed by his presence, and I congratulate him on his retirement.                            ____________________
