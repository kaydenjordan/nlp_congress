 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the failures  of Bidenomics and to talk about the devastating impact Bidenomics has  had on American families.   Certainly, people in Wyoming are worried about the high cost of  groceries. I hear it every time I am at the grocery store. People wince  every time they fill up the gas tank. People have turned to either  raiding their savings accounts or taking on increasing debt just to  stay up to the current cost of living.   President Biden has a message for all of these people who are wincing  as they fill up, who are worried about the cost of groceries, and who  are raiding their savings accounts. Joe Biden's message to them is just  this. He says: Don't believe your lying eyes. That is what he believes.   Tomorrow, the President will be in Colorado, and he is going to say  some things that the American people just will not believe.   He will say inflation is getting better. He will say Bidenomics is  working. He will say that anyone who believes anything other than that  is just a victim of misinformation. Well, that is not what the families  of America are feeling. Americans know that they are subjected day in  and day out to incredibly high prices, and they know that Joe Biden is  the President of high prices.   Before Thanksgiving, we got new inflation data, and prices went up  again. Prices are now over 17 percent higher today than they were the  day Joe Biden took office. In real terms, families are paying over $900  each and every month more now for their cost of living than they were  for the same things the day Joe Biden came into office. Americans are  feeling it everywhere but specifically in the cost of gas, the cost of  groceries, and the cost of everyday goods.  [[Page S5628]]    As prices continue to go up, people are falling further and further  behind when it comes to trying to pay their bills.   Let's look at personal savings accounts. Do people have more money or  less in their bank accounts now than they did before? Well, the answer  is clearly they have less. Bidenomics is forcing three out of every  five Americans to live paycheck to paycheck.   Let's look at personal debt. Credit card debt now exceeds $1  trillion. This is a record high in the history of the United States.   Let's look at interest rates. Americans are maxing out their credit  cards just to get by, and they are having to do it at higher interest  rates just to pay their bills, so their debt number continues to go up.   Under Bidenomics, Americans barely have enough money to pay their  bills, let alone save for the future.   President Biden equates Bidenomics with the American dream. So what  do people think about the American dream? Well, for most families right  now, that American dream is further and further out of reach than it  has ever been before.   According to a recent poll by NBC News, only one in five Americans  today feels confident that their children's lives will be better than  their lives were. That is an alltime low, and this is talking about the  future and the loss of hope for a better future.   President of the United States Joe Biden is disturbingly out of  touch. According to NBC News, President Biden is baffled--baffled--that  the American people are unhappy with the state of the economy. It is  not baffling; it is the definition of ``Bidenomics.'' Americans are  unhappy with the economy because they don't like paying 20 percent more  for food, $1 more for a gallon of gas, or 8 percent mortgage rates. So  why is the President of the United States so disconnected from the  feelings of everyday Americans?   Well, hard-working Americans deserve better leadership than what they  have gotten out of this White House for the last 3 years. On issue  after issue after issue, President Biden's actions have made matters  worse. He has continued and increased wasteful Washington spending. The  Democrats are as guilty as he is. He keeps attacking our affordable,  available, reliable American energy, and my home State of Wyoming is  America's energy breadbasket. He has pursued the costliest regulatory  burden in American history. The regulations coming out of this  administration are penalizing and punishing and are costing the  American people a lot.   Let there be no confusion that the policies of Joe Biden and the  Democrats are why families have suffered the worst inflation in 40  years. Democrats have done nothing to correct course or steer the  economy in the right direction. Instead of working to cure inflation,  Senate Democrats tell Americans to endure it. They are pushing policies  that increase spending and choke off American energy--policies that  keep driving prices and costs higher.   Two weeks ago, President Biden met with the Chinese President, Xi. It  was their first face-to-face meeting this year, 2023. Tensions with  China continue to rise. Yet President Biden seems more eager to appease  President Xi than to address China's serious threat to America's  economy and safety. None of this lowers the cost of living. None of  this makes our country stronger.   Republicans have solutions to get the country back on track. Our  solutions will lower the cost of living, will increase wages, will  reduce Washington redtape, will unleash American energy, and will end  our Nation's dependence on China.   In this Congress alone, Republicans have put forward legislative  solutions--workable, meaningful solutions--to restore a strong economy.  We have introduced bills to reverse these political mandates and  eliminate these punishing regulations. We have introduced bills to end  America's dependence on China, reduce dependence for manufacturing,  reduce dependence for medicines, and to promote our own manufacturing.  We have introduced bills to increase America's production of oil, gas,  coal, and critical minerals. That would immediately lower the cost of  energy and groceries for families all across America.   Under Joe Biden and the Democrats, America is heading in the wrong  direction, and by overwhelming numbers, the American people will tell  you that.   Republicans have solutions to make a difference--to lower prices, to  unleash American energy, to secure the southern border, and, in time,  to get America back on track. The time to act is now.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the exemplary  career of Goshen County Fire Warden Bill Law. Bill is retiring after  six decades of service to Torrington, Goshen County, and the State of  Wyoming.   Wyoming adopted its official ethics code, known proudly as the Code  of the West, in 2010. One of the principle tenets is ``talk less and  say more.'' Bill Law, a humble and devoted public servant, fully  embodies this value in everything he does. He invested time,  experience, and effort in each of his careers, to the benefit of  others. Bill demonstrated his capacity for leadership while serving a  greater cause at a young age. While in high school, he enlisted in the  Wyoming National Guard. Following his graduation in 1955, he proudly  enlisted in the U.S. Navy as a radio technician. He served 3 years and  was honorably discharged in 1958.   Following his military service, Bill found other ways to invest in  his community. He moved to Torrington, WY, in 1962 after serving 4  years as the Yoder Fire Chief. This was the first of a long line of  roles in fire management.   During this time, Bill met and married the love of his life, Betty  Korhonen Law. Bill and Betty raised two children, Alicia and Trevor.  This year, Bill and Betty are celebrating their 60th anniversary.  Theirs is a remarkable partnership that has endured all of life's  challenges.   Bill began as a firefighter with the Torrington Volunteer Fire  Department in 1962. Though he enjoyed other successful careers, he  remained a committed TVFD member. He often put his life on hold to  respond to emergencies in surrounding communities. His dedication to  fire safety is unmatched. From 1969 to 1988, Bill worked for Torrington  radio legend Kerm Kath, owner and operator of the local KGOS and KERM  radio stations. He worked in sales and became the station manager  following Kerm's death in 1982. In 1991, Bill became the State provider  relations representative for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming. He  worked to secure agreements with hospitals, clinics, and medical  offices around the State. I was pleased to work with him during my time  as an orthopedic surgeon in Casper and as a member of the Wyoming State  Senate. Bill retired from Blue Cross in 2004 after a rewarding 16-year  career. Shortly after retirement, the Goshen County Commission  appointed Bill as the county fire warden. From 2004 to 2012, he served  dual roles as the fire warden and the City of Torrington's emergency  management coordinator. Bill organized the county's fire suppression  and prevention efforts, including communicating with the county's 11  fire districts and 9 fire departments.   A natural leader, Bill served two terms on the Torrington City  Council, from 2012 to 2020. His civic engagement also includes serving  as a board member for both Eastern Wyoming College and the county  chamber of commerce. Bill is a devoted member of Our Savior Lutheran  Church, where he held numerous leadership positions. Bill is a  remarkable advocate for rural fire districts and firefighters. He spent  many years lobbying on behalf of local and State organizations and  agencies. In January 2023, the Wyoming Legislature recognized Bill's  years of advocacy. Given an opportunity to comment, Bill quipped, ``I  look at when I first put the uniform on; the first 40 (years) seemed to  drag--I got to tell you, the last 20 (years) go in a hurry.''   After an outstanding career in public service, I hope Bill will enjoy  a well-earned retirement with his family. In addition to Betty, his  legacy is celebrated by his son Trevor Law of Laramie, his daughter  Alicia and Jeff Ayres of Lehi, UT, his granddaughter Emily Ayres, and  great-grandchildren Mia Ayres and Drixton Ayres.   Honest and humble, Bill is a man of great integrity. He dedicated his  life to serving others, making his community and state better in the  process. Though his experience and wisdom will be missed, I know he  will continue serving as a mentor, advocate, and trusted adviser.  Bill's nephew Chuck Kenyon, Torrington's current emergency management  coordinator, said of Bill, ``He is the foundation that makes everything  work.''   Bobbi joins me in extending our congratulations to Bill for his  outstanding legacy of service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to  express my appreciation to Ani for her hard work as an intern in my  office in Casper, WY.
