 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr.  Roy, for yielding.   The President's budget recommendation came over a month late  yesterday, and there was one detail I read in The New York Times, so it  must be true, although that is the only place I have had a chance to  see it yet, and what immediately popped into my mind when I read this  detail, is that Karine Jean-Pierre said last week--I can remember her  saying it--that the President's economic plan is working for the  American people. That popped back into my head, because the detail  disclosed by The New York Times is that the administration predicts  economic growth in this fiscal year not 3\1/2\ percent, not 4 percent  certainly, not 2\1/2\ percent, not 1\1/2\ percent, but six-tenths of a  percent.   You have to start talking about economic growth and what the  economists call basis points, because it is so small. So if the  economic plan of the Biden administration is working for the American  people, that means 60 basis points of economic growth anticipated in  the year.   And guess what the Biden administration says about that? We should do  nothing different. We should keep doing the same thing that is  producing six-tenths of a percent of economic growth, except one other  thing: We should pile the burden of a lot more taxes on the economy,  because apparently that is going to--because what do we need? Thirty  basis points of economic growth? Republicans believe we need to change.
