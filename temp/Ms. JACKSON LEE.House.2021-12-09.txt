 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support American  families. And as I do that, I am sad to say that the Texas workforce  sent almost a two-page, small-type letter to Texans around the State to  tell them that they could ignore the President's mandate on vaccines,  as the omicron variant rises, and as hospitals are beginning to teem  over with the delta variant.   Isn't that sad?   To my fellow Texans, do what is right for your family. Get your  children vaccinated. Get your booster, or your first or second shot.  Let us save lives.   I am saddened by government tax dollars being used to counter and  distort the President's mandates and the President's desire to impact  the lives of Americans.   To also impact the lives of Americans, I intend to introduce the  Kimberly Vaughan storage bill. In light of what happened in Oakland  County and the tragedy of a family leaving a gun--as they gave it to a  child for a birthday--but leaving it accessible to that child, four  precious lives are lost.   I think this is certainly bipartisan legislation to create the  opportunity for you to buy a gun, but to have the message, storage is  important. This bill will provide a variety of best practices and  penalties for those that do not store their guns.   Support me in the Kimberly Vaughan storage bill to make sure that we  do what is right for our children. Store your guns and make them safe.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her  leadership.   Madam Speaker, it is not about President Trump but it is about his  behavior. But it is overall about the sanctity of democracy and the  recognition that behaviors result in the final destination that  challenges the very core of democracy. January 6, 2021, when Members  duly sworn to take an oath to defend this Nation and to uphold the  Constitution were cowering on the floor.   I stand with enormous support for the Protecting Our Democracy Act.  Why? Because the Nation needs it and the world is watching. I stand to  avoid the abuse of the pardon powers that existed clearly in the last  administration. Need I give a long list of examples? Generals and best  friends; or then enforcement of the foreign and domestic emolument  clauses; the horrors of a hotel where many went to pay money into the  coffers of a President of the United States or enforcement of  Congressional subpoenas, the very authority that can protect democracy,  reasserting Congressional power of the purse when dollars were  manipulated and friends got a lot of dollars.   So I am believing that this is imperative, security from political  interference injustice. I might think a noose hanging in the front to  insist that Vice President Pence be arrested or hung might be an  interference. I do want to acknowledge the amendment that I offered,  very quickly.    The amendment indicates that violation by  officeholders be treated as a violation of oath of office for purposes  of ineligibility to hold public office under the 14th Amendment.   And so the collective actions, not a person, but if your actions  suggest that you are violating democracy, you should not ever run  again.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to this amendment becoming law, and I  look forward to this bill becoming law because we must protect  democracy. The Constitution says that we have been created to create a  more perfect union. I insist that we create a more perfect union.  Support this great legislation.    Madam Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to  discuss briefly the Jackson Lee Amendment No. 17 to Rules Committee  Print 117-20, the Protecting Our Democracy Act (H.R. 5314), introduced  by Congressman Schiff of California, the Chair of the House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence.   This Jackson Lee amendment improves the bill and strengthens an  important guardrail in the pillars upholding and protecting our  democracy by providing that any person who, having previously taken an  oath as an officer of the United States, as a member of a State  legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, is  finally convicted of violating laws prohibiting foreign interference in  American elections, specifically section 304(j) of the Federal Election  Campaign.   The Protecting Our Democracy Act is a sweeping package of reforms to  prevent presidential abuses and to restore the Constitutional system of  checks and balances.   Madam Speaker, the actions of the past Administration revealed  serious vulnerabilities in our democratic systems--vulnerabilities that  can and will be exploited again if we do not act urgently to address  them.   The Protecting Our Democracy Act will take immediate steps to  safeguard and strengthen our democracy so no future president-- regardless of political party--can act as if they are above the law.   And it will restore the accountability and transparency of our  institutions so that the American people can have confidence in our  government's ability to address the challenges we face.   Let me briefly highlight some of the important provisions of this  vitally important legislation that should be enthusiastically supported  by all Members.                TITLE I--ABUSE OF THE PARDON POWER PREVENTION    The Abuse of the Pardon Prevention Act is designed to deter abuses of  the pardon power, first, by requiring transparency in circumstances  where the President uses that power for potentially self-serving  purposes or in a manner that could undermine the functions of Congress.   And second, by amending the federal bribery statute to make explicit  that offering or granting a pardon or commutation may serve as the  basis for finding criminal culpability under the statute.   Finally, the Abuse of the Pardon Prevention Act makes explicit that a  president may not issue a self-pardon.               TITLE II--ENSURING No PRESIDENT Is ABOVE THE LAW    The No President is Above the Law Act would suspend the statute of  limitations for any federal offense committed by a sitting president or  vice president, whether it was committed before or during their terms  in office and thus ensure that presidents and vice presidents can be  held accountable for criminal conduct just like every other American  and not use their offices as a shield to avoid legal consequences.  [[Page H7593]]         TITLE III--ENFORCEMENT EMOLUMENTS CLAUSES OF THE FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC                             EMOLUMENTS CLAUSES    Madam Speaker, the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the Constitution  prohibits federal officers from receiving ``presents'' or  ``emoluments'' from foreign nations unless Congress first provides its  consent, while the Domestic Emoluments Clause bars the President from  receiving any emoluments from the United States government or from any  state government.   The Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Enforcement Act codifies these  foundational anti-corruption provisions and provides enhanced  enforcement mechanisms for Congress and for entities within the  Executive Branch.               TITLE IV--ENFORCEMENT OF CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS    The Congressional Subpoena Compliance and Enforcement Act reinforces  Congress's Article I powers by strengthening its tools to enforce  lawfully issued subpoenas.   First, the bill affirms the House's and Senate's authority to enforce  their subpoenas through civil suits and provides expedited processes  for these actions, as well as enhanced penalties for noncompliance.   Second, it specifies the manner in which subpoena recipients must  comply, including by creating an express requirement to testify and  produce subpoenaed information and, to the extent any information is  withheld, to produce a detailed log describing the basis for non- compliance.            TITLE V--REAsSERTING CONGRESSIONAL POWER OF THE PURSE    Madam Speaker, in drafting the Constitution, the Framers built checks  and balances into the foundation of our democracy to protect against  monarchy.   Vesting Congress with the power to make funding decisions--the  ``power of the purse''--is a critical component of that founding  principle.   Congress has crafted longstanding, foundational laws to protect its  authority like the Antideficiency Act (ADA) and the Impoundment Control  Act (ICA) to prevent federal agencies from misusing federal funds.   But over time, Presidents and Executive Branch agencies have pushed  the boundaries of these and other laws designed to prevent executive  overreach, exploiting secrecy and limitations on enforcement to push  their own agenda.   That is why as a member of the Budget Committee, I am very pleased  that the reforms embodied in the Congressional Power of the Purse Act  are incorporated in the legislation before us and will help Congress  reclaim its Constitutional spending authority and safeguard our  nation's separation of powers.   Specifically, the Act would restore Congress' central role in funding  decisions by preventing the President from effectively rescinding funds  without congressional approval; requiring the Office of Management and  Budget (0MB) to release funding at least 90 days before it expires,  whether or not the funding is part of a Presidential rescission or  deferral request; and closing a budget law loophole that essentially  lets the President unilaterally block the spending of enacted  appropriations designated as emergency.   The Act would put an expiration date on Presidential declarations of  national emergencies and any special executive authorities triggered by  those declarations; declarations would expire unless Congress extends  them.   The Act would increase transparency in the Executive Branch by  requiring OMB to make apportionments (legally binding documents that  make funding available to agencies to spend) publicly available and to  publish the positions of officials with delegated apportionment  authority; requiring the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) to publish  opinions instructing agencies on budget and appropriations law;  requiring the Executive Branch to make public amounts and explanations  of cancelled or expired fund balances, and amounts and legal  justifications of obligations incurred by agencies during a lapse in  their appropriations; and requiring the Executive Branch to report  violations of the ICA and ADA identified by the Government  Accountability Office (GAO) to Congress.   The Act would also add enforcement mechanisms to budget law and deter  lawbreaking by strengthening and expediting GAO's ability to obtain  information from agencies to assess compliance with budget or  appropriations law; expediting GAO's ability to sue agencies to release  funds being impounded in violation of the ICA; authorizing  administrative discipline for officials found to have violated the ICA,  including suspension without pay or termination of employment; and  requiring the DOJ to review reports of ADA violations and investigate  whether a violation occurred knowingly and willfully.          TITLE VI--SECURITY FROM POLITICAL INTERFERENCE IN JUSTICE    Since Watergate, every Administration has issued guidance limiting  contact between the White House and DOJ in order to limit political  interference in criminal and civil enforcement matters.   Unfortunately, in recent years we have seen numerous instances where  that norm was ignored.   The Security from Political Interference in Justice Act seeks to help  ensure that these norms are followed in the future, by requiring that  the Attorney General (AG) maintain a log of certain designated contacts  between the White House and DOJ that is to be shared with the DOJ  Inspector General (IG) on a semi-annual basis, with an additional  requirement that the IG share any inappropriate or improper contacts  with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.             TITLE VII--PROTECTING INSPECTOR GENERAL INDEPENDENCE    The Inspector General Independence Act would protect Inspectors  General (IGs) from being removed by the President based on political  retaliation.   President Trump removed or replaced numerous IGs in what appeared to  be retaliation for investigating misconduct of his own Administration.   The Inspector General Independence Act would only allow an IG to be  removed for a limited number of causes and would require that the  President, before removing the IG, provide Congress with documentation  of the cause.                    TITLE VIII--PROTECTING WHISTLEBLOWERS    The Whistleblower Protection Improvement Act would strengthen the law  to ensure that federal employees who blow the whistle on waste, fraud,  and abuse are protected from retaliation.   The Whistleblower Protection Improvement Act would clarify that no  federal official may interfere with a federal employee's ability to  share information with Congress.   This measure would also limit disclosure of a whistleblower's  identity, prohibit retaliatory investigations, expand whistleblower  protections to all noncareer appointees in the Senior Executive  Service, and provide access to jury trials for whistleblowers.        TITLE XII--PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL TAX TRANSPARENCY    Title XII requires sitting presidents and vice presidents and major  party candidates for the presidency and vice-presidency to publicly  disclose their 10 most recent federal income tax returns.                TITLE XIII--FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN ELECTIONS    Title XIII of the Act requires political campaigns, parties, and  political committees like political action committees (PACs) and Super  PACs to report attempts by foreign governments, foreign political  parties, and their agents to influence our elections to the Federal  Election Commission (FEC) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).   It requires the FBI to report on these notifications annually to the  congressional intelligence committees.   It also requires campaigns to establish compliance mechanisms.   It ensures violations of these foreign contact reporting requirements  can incur criminal or civil liability.   Title XIV of the Act works to eliminate foreign interference in U.S.  elections by making clear that the Federal Election Campaign Act  prohibits the acceptance of opposition research, polling, and other  non-public information relating to a candidate for federal, state, or  local office by foreign governments and political parties for the  purpose of influencing an election.   It provides for enhanced criminal penalties for violations of this  prohibition.   It ensures that members and employees of political campaigns will be  on notice of this prohibition by requiring the FEC to provide a written  explanation of the prohibition to political campaigns, and for  campaigns to certify their receipt and understanding of the  explanation.   Last, the legislation extends the ban on foreign national  contributions to federal, state, and local elections to include ballot  initiatives and referendums.   Madam Speaker, I believe this excellent legislation would be even  stronger had Jackson Lee Amendment No. 17 been made in order.   This Jackson Lee amendment would improve the bill and strengthen an  important guardrail in the pillars upholding and protecting our  democracy by providing that any person who, having previously taken an  oath as an officer of the United States, as a member of a State  legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, is  finally convicted of violating laws prohibiting foreign interference in  American elections, specifically section 304(j) of the Federal Election  Campaign Act of 1971 (as added by section 1301(a)), section 304(b)(9)  of such Act (as added by section 1301(b)), or section 302(j) of such  Act (as added by section 1302), shall be deemed to have given aid and  comfort to the enemies of the United States for purposes of  ineligibility to hold public office under section of the Fourteenth  Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.   This concern is particularly salient when there is clear, convincing,  and overwhelming evidence of interference by a hostile foreign  [[Page H7594]]  power to secure victory for its preferred candidate.   Madam Speaker, there is compelling reason for the Congress to pass  the Protecting Our Democracy Act by overwhelming margins in the House  and Senate to send a clear message to the world that unlike the  immediately previous Administration, the current President and his  Administration is determined and resolute in taking effective action to  deter and prevent interference by foreign powers in American elections.   Let us remember that the Intelligence Community Assessment (``ICA'')  of January 2017 assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered  an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election in  which Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US  democratic process, denigrate Democratic presidential candidate and  implacable foe of Vladimir Putin, former Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton, facilitate the election of Vladimir Putin's preferred  candidate, Donald J. Trump.   Russia's interference in the election processes of democratic  countries was not new but a continuation of the ``Translator Project,''  an ongoing information warfare effort launched by Vladimir Putin in  2014 to use social media to manipulate public opinion and voters in  western democracies.   But instead of supporting the unanimous assessment of the U.S.  Intelligence Community, the 45th President attacked and sought to  discredit and undermine the agencies and officials responsible for  detecting and assessing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential  election as well as those responsible for investigating and bringing to  justice the conspirators who committed crimes against the United States  our law enforcement.   And to add shame to insult and injury, at a meeting in Helsinki,  Finland, rather than embracing the conclusions of the U.S. Intelligence  Community, the 45th President of the United States sided with Russian  President Vladimir Putin in heaping scorn on the IC's assessment  regarding Russian interference and called the U.S. Justice Department  investigation into Russia's interference led by Special Counsel Robert  Mueller ``the greatest political witch hunt in history.''   As the Mueller Report concluded, ``The Russian government interfered  in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.''   In his only public remarks made since he was appointed at his  farewell press conference held at the Department of Justice on May 29,  2017, Special Counsel, Robert Mueller reiterated the ``central  allegation of our indictments--that there were multiple, systematic  efforts to interfere in our election'' and that ``allegation deserves  the attention of every American.''   Madam Speaker, American elections are to be decided by American  voters free from foreign interference or sabotage, and that is why any  person who having previously taken an oath to preserve and protect the  Constitution of the United States, knowingly and willingly acts to aid,  abet, or facilitate foreign interference in an American election can,  should, and must be deemed to have given aid and comfort to the enemies  of the United States for purposes of ineligibility to hold public  office under section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution  of the United States.   I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 5314, the  Protecting Our Democracy Act.   Thank you.
