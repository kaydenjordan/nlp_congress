 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Marvin  Alton Hyatt, Sr.   Marvin passed away on May 7, 2021, and returned to the God he  faithfully served for 87 years.   Marvin was born in Dillon, South Carolina on May 12, 1933. He  attended and graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1959,  with a degree in pharmacy, and later established a scholarship fund  within the University of South Carolina School of Pharmacy for those  students choosing to enter the lifelong profession that he loved and  cherished for so long.   He founded Good Pharmacy in Rock Hill, South Carolina, which he  operated for 58 years. Marvin was the face of Good Pharmacy, where he  greeted everyone with a smile, true compassion, and a desire to serve  the hundreds of customers, regardless of race, standing in life, or  ability to pay.   Marvin was legendary for meeting anyone, anywhere, at any time, and  was genuinely concerned and interested in the well-being of his  customers. In short, when it came to customer service, Marvin Hyatt not  only talked the talk, but he walked the walk, which is rare in today's  world.   Marvin Hyatt was active in his church, Woodland Methodist, for over  60 years, where he served as treasurer and as a board member. His  community service included serving as a board member of Guardian  Fidelity bank, WRHI radio station; past president of the Sertoma Club,  Rotary Club, Elks Lodge, and the Alexa R. Good ALS Foundation.   Marvin was married to the love of his life, Lois Jones Hyatt, for 63  years. Together, they had two children: Marvin Alton Hyatt, Jr., and  Laura Hyatt Sweat, both of whom are registered pharmacists and are  working in Good Pharmacy today. Marvin and Lois have three  grandchildren: Alton, Katie Jane, and Tyler.   The legacy of Marvin Alton Hyatt will be that of a man who served his  God, his country, and his fellow man. He exemplified service above  self, and for the 87 years that he walked on this Earth, his life was a  true testament of living out his Christian faith in word and in deed.                            ____________________
