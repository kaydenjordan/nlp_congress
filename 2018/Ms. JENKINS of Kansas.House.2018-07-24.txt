 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3500) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  prohibit the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service from rehiring  any employee of the Internal Revenue Service who was involuntarily  separated from service for misconduct, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3500         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Integrity in the       IRS Workforce Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON REHIRING ANY EMPLOYEE OF THE INTERNAL                     REVENUE SERVICE WHO WAS INVOLUNTARILY SEPARATED                     FROM SERVICE FOR MISCONDUCT.         (a) In General.--Section 7804 of the Internal Revenue Code       of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(d) Prohibition on Rehiring Employees Involuntarily       Separated.--The Commissioner may not hire any individual       previously employed by the Commissioner who was removed for       misconduct under this subchapter or chapter 43 or chapter 75       of title 5, United States Code, or whose employment was       terminated under section 1203 of the Internal Revenue Service       Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (26 U.S.C. 7804       note).''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to the hiring of employees after the       date of the enactment of this Act.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to carry out the       requirements of this Act and the amendments made by this Act.       Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts       otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3500, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we are taking up H.R. 3500, the bipartisan  Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act. This bill seeks to provide  additional safeguards within the IRS by prohibiting the agency from  rehiring any individual previously employed by the IRS but removed for  misconduct or terminated for cause.                                time  1515    Before we talk more about this bill, I would like to take a moment  just to thank the bill's sponsor, Representative Kristi Noem from South  Dakota, for her tireless work on this bill.   Last Congress, a version of this bill passed the House of  Representatives with overwhelming, bipartisan support. This Congress,  we made some small changes to the bill to address some of my  colleagues' concerns and we hope that they will continue to support the  bill in its new form. We are also encouraged to see its presence in the  bipartisan Taxpayer First Act, introduced by chairman and ranking  member of the Senate Finance Committee just last week.   As we all know, IRS employees have access to Americans' most  sensitive information, such as our Social Security numbers, home  addresses, and how much we are paid. Given the magnitude of the  sensitive information that the IRS holds, hiring employees of high  integrity is essential to maintaining public trust in tax  administration and safeguarding taxpayer information.   In 2017, work by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration, or TIGTA, raised serious concerns about the IRS's  continued practice of rehiring former employees with conduct and  performance issues. The inspector general concluded that the IRS does  not have effective hiring policies to fully consider past employee  conduct and performance issues prior to making a tentative decision to  rehire them.   I should note that this is the second such report that the inspector  general has published. In 2014, the inspector general first alerted  Congress to this  [[Page H7113]]  issue, finding that the IRS was rehiring former employees with  significant conduct or performance issues.   So what types of conduct are we talking about here? We are talking  about IRS employees who threatened their coworkers, didn't pay their  own taxes, were excessively absent, falsified employment forms, or were  so deficient in their jobs that the IRS had no choice but to terminate  their employment. There were also instances where employees accessed  sensitive taxpayer information without authorization to do so. I think  we can all agree that those are not the types of people that the IRS  should be seeking to rehire.   While Congress has repeatedly sought to signal to the IRS its concern  on this issue through legislation such as the IRS Restructuring and  Reform Act of 1998, and the IRS Consolidated Appropriations Act of  2016, the IRS continues to struggle.   TIGTA's most recent findings suggest that further congressional  action is needed. As a result, we have before us today a bill which  will seek to guarantee that this practice does not continue. It also  ensures greater integrity within the IRS's workforce, something that I  think all Members of Congress can easily support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   In closing, I would like to point out that this legislation has  enjoyed wide bipartisan support in the past, and for good reason. It is  a commonsense bill that will help build trust with the IRS and  integrity within our tax system.   I want to, again, thank my colleague from South Dakota,  Representative Kristi Noem, for being a leader on this issue and for  sponsoring this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3500, and I  yield back the balance of my time
