 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), my friend, for the purpose of inquiring of the majority  leader the schedule for tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   May I ask, do you know when the Rules Committee will meet, Mr.  Majority Leader?   I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Leader, if the Rules Committee meets, say, at 9 a.m., and you  said the earliest vote at 10 a.m., obviously, a lot of our Members are  focused on what time they have to be here to make sure they make a  vote, and you said the earliest would be 10, but if you have the Rules  Committee reporting out, would it be perhaps closer to 10:30?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, can the gentleman tell us how long you  anticipate the debate on the bill itself would be? Obviously, I am  asking that in the context of when can Members believe that we may be  concluding tomorrow's business?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I am not going to tell the gentleman, but it  was a good fishing trip that the gentleman was on.   I thank the gentleman, but my assumption is that Members can be  relatively confident, based upon what we are going to do and what you  are going to do, to be out of here somewhere before 5 p.m. tomorrow; is  that correct?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's information, and  I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
