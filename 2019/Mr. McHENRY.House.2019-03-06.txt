 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Republican leader on the Rules  Committee for yielding.   It is unfortunate we are here today to debate a bill like this. This  bill is nothing more than a partisan power grab. That is the sum and  substance of what has been offered here as H.R. 1.   This is about the priorities of Democrats in the House, and the  priorities of Democrats in the House is to change our election laws in  such a way as to benefit their party and hurt the American voters and  their will at the ballot box. That is the deep problem here with H.R.  1.   This is a partisan power grab by one party to seize power by  manipulating our laws to get an outcome counter to the will of the  people.   It is not about fairness. It is just the opposite. This is a problem,  the process that the Democrats went through, the majority went through  for this bill. We had one markup in one committee even though we had  multiple committees, including the House Financial Services Committee.  That is how big this bill is. It had multiple committees of  jurisdiction that were supposed to have markups on this, and they did  not go through that full process.   This bill, at the end of the day, seeks to limit free speech. It uses  taxpayer dollars to fund partisan campaign efforts, and mandates  outcomes designed to get more Democrats into power.   This is not about fairness. It is just the opposite. Let's vote  against this rule, and let's vote down this bad bill.
