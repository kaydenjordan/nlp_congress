The estimated total cost is $350 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       security of a NATO ally which is an important force for       political stability and economic progress in Europe.  [[Page S5438]]         The proposed sale will improve France's capability to meet       current and future threats by providing the necessary       sustainment, services, and spare parts to support the co-      managed fleet of French and German C-130 aircraft. France       will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and/or       services into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin       Corporation, Marietta, GA; Rolls Royce Cooperation,       Indianapolis, IN; General Electric Aviation System, LTD/      Dowty, Sterling, VA; Raytheon, Cedar Rapids, IA; and ViaSat,       Carlsbad, CA. There are no known offset agreements proposed       in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of (1) U.S. contractor representative to France       for a duration of three years to provide technical assistance       and support to include field services, engineering tech       support and integrated logistics support management.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            TRANSMITTAL NO. 20-56       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Rolls Royce AE 2100D3 Turboprop Engine is the       primary powerplant on the C-130J Hercules military airlift       aircraft.        2. The Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Low       Volume Terminal (MIDS-LVT) is an advanced Link-16 command,       control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) system       incorporating high-capacity, jam-resistant, digital       communication links for exchange of near real-time tactical       information, including both data and voice, among air,       ground, and sea elements. MIDS-LVT is intended to support key       theater functions such as surveillance identification, air       control, weapons engagement coordination, and direction for       all services and allied forces. The system provides jamming-      resistant, wide-area communications on a Link-16 network       among MIDS and Joint Tactical Information Distribution System       (JTIDS) equipped platforms.        3. AN/AAR-60 Missile Launch Detection System (MILDS) is a       passive, true imaging sensor device that is optimized to       detect the radiation signature of a threat missile's exhaust       plume within the Ultra Violet (UV) solar blind spectral band.       Functionally, the architecture detects incoming missile       threats and indicates their direction of arrival with the       `maximum' of warning time. The system is further noted as       featuring `inherently' high-spacial resolution, `advanced'       temporal processing, a `very high' declaration rate, the       `virtual elimination' of false alarm rates, `fast' threat       detection and the automatic initiation of appropriate       countermeasures. Physically, a typical application comprises       four to six self-contained detector units each of which       provides `full' signal processing.        4. The AN/AAS-54 MTS-A Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR)       System integrates electro-optical, infrared, laser       designation, and laser illumination capabilities to provide       superior detection, ranging, and tracking. The system       provides high rate of stabilization across six axis and       flexible operating modes including integrated line-of-sight       targeting and target tracking, using centroid, area and       feature tracks. The system contains an Inertial Measurement       Unit on the gimbal to enable accurate target geolocation. The       MTS-A is capable of integration onto fixed-wing, rotary-wing,       and unmanned air vehicle platforms.        5. Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) is a multi-platform       PC based mission planning system.        6. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        7. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        8. A determination has been made that France can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        9. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the France.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
