 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of title III, insert the following:       SEC. ___. TREATMENT OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AFFILIATES.         Section 1a(48) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.       1a(47)), as so redesignated by section 304(b)(1) of this Act,       is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(G) Treatment of transactions between affiliates.--        ``(i) Exemption from swap rules.--An agreement, contract,       or transaction described in subparagraphs (A) through (F)       shall not be regulated as a swap under this Act if all of the       following apply with respect to the agreement, contract, or       transaction:         ``(I) Affiliation.--1 counterparty, directly or indirectly,       holds a majority ownership interest in the other       counterparty, or a third party, directly or indirectly, holds       a majority ownership interest in both counterparties.        ``(II) Financial statements.--The affiliated counterparty       that holds the majority interest in the other counterparty or       the third party that, directly or indirectly, holds the       majority interests in both affiliated counterparties, reports       its financial statements on a consolidated basis under       generally accepted accounting principles or International       Financial Reporting Standards, or other similar standards,       and the financial statements include the financial results of       the majority-owned affiliated counterparty or counterparties.         ``(ii) Reporting requirement.--If at least 1 counterparty       to an agreement, contract, or transaction that meets the       requirements of clause (i) is a swap dealer or major swap       participant, that counterparty shall report the agreement,       contract, or transaction pursuant to section 4r, within such       time period as the Commission may by rule or regulation       prescribe--         ``(I) to a swap data repository; or        ``(II) if there is no swap data repository that would       accept the agreement, contract or transaction, to the       Commission .         ``(iii) Risk management requirement.--If at least 1       counterparty to an agreement, contract, or transaction that       meets the requirements of clause (i) is a swap dealer or       major swap participant, the agreement, contract, or       transaction shall be subject to a centralized risk management       program pursuant to section 4s(j) that is reasonably designed       to monitor and to manage the risks associated with the       agreement, contract, or transaction.        ``(iv) Variation margin requirement.--Affiliated       counterparties to an agreement, contract, or transaction that       meets the requirements of clause (i) shall exchange variation       margin to the extent prescribed under any rule promulgated by       the Commission or any prudential regulator pursuant to       section 4s(e).        ``(v) Anti-evasion requirement.--An agreement, contract, or       transaction that meets the requirements of clause (i) shall       not be structured to evade the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform       and Consumer Protection Act in violation of any rule       promulgated by the Commission pursuant to section 721(c) of       such Act.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 40, the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Lucas amendment to H.R.  238. This amendment works to provide much-needed relief and certainty  for American companies by clarifying how the internal risk reducing  transactions amongst the businesses' own affiliates are regulated. Many  businesses of all types and sizes in our country use derivatives to  manage the risks they face within their daily operations.  Interaffiliate swaps are a commonly used and effective internal risk  management tool these businesses rely upon.   Unfortunately, derivatives reforms implemented under Dodd-Frank fail  to distinguish the difference between interaffiliate transactions and  transactions executed between unaffiliated third parties. Such internal  transactions ensure firms to centralize their risk management  activities between affiliate counterparties and do not create  additional counterparty exposure outside of a corporate group. This  amendment, therefore, clarifies that interaffiliate swaps are not  subject to the same regulatory requirements as external, market-facing  swaps between third parties.   In addition, this amendment is consistent with the CFTC's attempts to  provide similar relief through rule exceptions and no-action letters.  While such actions by the CFTC have provided relief, they do not  provide a workable, clear, and predictable set of regulations that  market participants can effectively operate under.   This amendment will keep in place appropriate regulatory reforms and  provide much-needed regulatory and legal certainty for U.S. companies.  Please join me in supporting this needed reform.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to my friend Mr. Lucas' amendment.  This amendment rejects the bipartisan compromise negotiated over 4  years to strike the right balance regarding interaffiliate swaps.  Indeed, Democrats like Ms. Moore and Republicans like Mr. Stivers  carefully negotiated a way to balance the needs of operating companies  like airlines and refineries. This amendment, however, would exempt  swaps between affiliates, including megabanks like Goldman Sachs and  J.P.Morgan, from the mandatory margin, clearing, trade execution,  capital, and every other protection under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.   While we generally agree that swaps between affiliated corporate  entities do not pose a systemic threat, we are deeply troubled about  this desire to undermine all swaps rules and harm our economy.   During testimony on a similar version of this amendment, the CFTC's  former chairman, Gary Gensler, stated that such an exemption would  provide a big loophole around our derivatives rules and that it would  ``blow a hole in Dodd-Frank.''   Specifically, the amendment exempts affiliate swaps no matter where  the affiliate resides. So, an affiliate could reside in a foreign  jurisdiction that lacks any swaps regulation and share its risks with a  U.S. affiliate, but our regulators would be prohibited from imposing  any safeguards such as initial margin or capital requirements. Why  would we pass such a self-inflicted wound?   With that, Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to vote ``no'' on this  amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of my time  simply to note to my colleagues the goal of this amendment is to allow  business entities to efficiently manage their risk. If that risk is  managed internally where it is no threat to third parties then they  should have the ability to do it in the most efficient fashion. As I  noted in my earlier comments, CFTC has provided similar relief through  rule exceptions and no-action letters. What we are trying to do here is  clarify this situation.   As far as one of the previous chairmen of the CFTC, while a very  enthusiastic regulator, I would note that I and many participants down  through the years have disagreed with his interpretations on several  things. But, with that, I have the greatest respect for my colleague  over there. This is a sincere difference of opinion.   Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Conaway) who is the chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mrs. Hartzler    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8  printed in part B of House Report 115-3.
