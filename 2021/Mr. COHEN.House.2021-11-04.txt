 The President is trying to help America, help the middle  class, help the forgotten.   The Build Back Better bill will give people childcare that they need  and women to go to work. It will give a child tax credit and make it  permanent, lifting half the children in this country out of poverty. It  will give elderly people who are infirm and need to be at home elderly  in-home care so they can stay in their homes. That is wonderful for  those people, something they need.   It will provide for family and medical leave, something every other  industrial country in the world has. It will put $500 billion in  unbelievable investment in the future of our planet, on climate  controls, and credits for folks to go into renewables and solar and  heat, wind-powered energy, and improving the electrical grid.   It will do many wonderful things, and it is all paid for. And the  only Americans paying more in taxes are those making $10 million and  above, they will pay a surtax.   Madam Speaker, it is a great plan. It is an American plan. It should  be a bipartisan plan. And I am for it. Thank you, President Biden.                            ____________________
