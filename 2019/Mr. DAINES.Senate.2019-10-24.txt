 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Jocelyn Taylor, Michaela Osborne, and Addison Evans of Cut  Bank Middle School in Glacier County for their extraordinary impact on  the local community.   Jocelyn, Michaela, and Addison all had grandparents who suffered from  cancer. Because of that, the three young women wanted to do more in  their community to raise awareness for cancer with hopes to help folks  detect the disease early.   Jocelyn's mom, Cherie, suggested that the girls aim their fundraising  efforts towards upgrading the Winkley Women's Center mobile mammography  unit that visits Cutbank often. Kalispell Regional Healthcare had been  working to raise the funds for a new unit.   Jocelyn, Michaela, and Addison joined Kalispell Regional Healthcare  at the Lewis and Clark Festival in July to bake goods for a bake sale.  They managed to raise $109.50 and donated all proceeds to the cause.   Kalispell Regional Healthcare Foundation shared the story of the  girls' efforts with their supporters, and the story caught fire. The  message about their donation kept spreading, and on October 1, $750,000  was raised because of their dedication and work.   Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of these inspirational young  women, they were able to make a tremendous impact on their local  community and raise funds for a cause that can save Montana lives.   It is my honor to recognize Jocelyn, Michaela, and Addison for their  amazing endeavor. Montanans across our State are proud of the work they  achieved, and I look forward to following the future accomplishments of  these bright young women.                            ____________________
