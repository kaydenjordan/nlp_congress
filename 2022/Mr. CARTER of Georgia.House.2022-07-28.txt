 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wayne  County school system's Nick Ellis for his induction into the Boys &  Girls Clubs Hall of Fame.   Nick has been working with the Boys & Girls Clubs for 16 years. After  graduating high school in 2006, Nick began working with the Boys &  Girls Clubs of Altamaha Area as a volunteer, then as a unit director,  before rising to board membership. Today, he also serves as the area's  chief volunteer officer.   Throughout his time with the club, Nick has been a positive influence  in the lives of countless children, providing support and leadership to  those in need.   Nick also serves his community as a law enforcement officer with the  Jesup Police Department. In his 12 years with the department, Nick has  risen through the ranks and currently serves as patrol division  commander.   In 2020, Governor Brian Kemp recognized Nick's efforts in law  enforcement and appointed Nick to serve on the Georgia Board of Public  Safety.   A passionate volunteer dedicated to helping his community beyond his  professional career, Nick Ellis is a shining example of leadership and  guidance for everyone. He is fully deserving of this hall of fame  induction honor.                            ____________________
