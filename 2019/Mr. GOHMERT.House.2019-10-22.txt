 Madam Speaker, this is an unbelievable time in our  history.   There is nothing more important than elected office. It is something  that was discussed in the Declaration of Independence, and yet, we have  an attempted coup taking place. It violates the principles on which  this Nation was founded of due process--the right to confront the  witnesses against you.   And I would submit, humbly, that there is no cause for concern for  the so-called whistleblower's safety from President Trump. All the  witnesses against him are alive and well.   So who is it he is afraid might come after him if he discloses what  he knows and who conspiring to bring down this President?   Ah, there is the rub. Let's get to the bottom of it. And at the  bottom will not be President Trump. It will be the coconspirators  trying to bring this government down.  [[Page H8382]]                                ____________________
