 Madam Speaker, I rise today in defense of every  woman's access to healthcare and right to make her own personal  healthcare decisions in private consultation with her physician and her  family.   Last week, President Trump issued a shameful executive order that  will allow employers to deny women insurance coverage for  contraception. This rolls back progress under the Affordable Care Act  that required insurance companies to cover birth control without a  copay.   This is outrageous. Employers have no role dictating what healthcare  women can and cannot have. That is a decision between a woman and her  doctor.   Nearly 9 in 10 women will use birth control at some point in their  lives. This order is a direct attack on their healthcare.   President Trump tried to sneak this change through, announcing it on  a Friday afternoon before a long weekend. Well, we noticed and so did  millions of other women that this order will adversely impact.   We are paying attention and we are not about to stop speaking out and  working to protect women's access to healthcare.                            ____________________
