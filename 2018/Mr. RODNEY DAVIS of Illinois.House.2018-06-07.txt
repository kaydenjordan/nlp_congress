 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Iris  Nigg Lundin, First Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps, who  served in World War II.   Iris enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1943. She had earned her  teaching degree and was only 2 years out of college working at a summer  job when she heard the call to serve her country. She heard it through  slogans like, ``Uncle Sam Needs You,'' and ``Free a Man to Fight.''  With the U.S. Marine Corps Women's Reserve newly authorized, Iris  walked into a recruiting station and signed up to serve.   She completed boot camp at Marine Base Camp Lejeune in North  Carolina, and was selected to go through Officer Candidate School.  After graduating, she was commissioned to 2nd Lieutenant, and she and  three other women were sent to Florida to attend navigation school.   While there, Iris was one of the first four women to earn aerial  navigator wings. She was trained to teach aerial navigation,  meteorology, and radio technique to the men who flew combat missions.   Iris served in the Marines until she was discharged in 1945. This  weekend, she will celebrate her 100th birthday. I am beyond proud to  honor her today. She is a trailblazer for women in the Armed Forces,  and I am honored to commend her for her service.   Iris, thank you, and happy birthday.                            ____________________
