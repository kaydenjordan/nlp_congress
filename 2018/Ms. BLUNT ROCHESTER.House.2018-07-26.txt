 Mr. Speaker, I rise today and ask my colleagues  to join me in supporting my bill, H.R. 6483, the Trade Assistance for  Farmers Act.   As a member of the House Agriculture Committee and a proud  representative of Delaware, where 99 percent of our farms are family  owned and 1 in 4 acres are permanently preserved for farmland, we have  seen firsthand the impact of retaliatory tariffs.   Over the past 60 days, soybean and corn farmers across the country  have suffered over $13 billion in losses, and, according to the  Delaware Department of Agriculture, our soybean and corn farmers have  lost $28 million.   Delaware is a microcosm of the country, with beautiful beaches,  thriving cities, and sprawling farms. We know how important agriculture  is to our country and our communities.   My bill would create a permanent fix so that all farmers impacted by  retaliatory tariffs can have the tools they need to stay competitive,  regardless of who is in the White House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my bill.                            ____________________
