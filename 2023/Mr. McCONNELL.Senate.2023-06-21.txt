 Mr. President, earlier this year, the Senate made use  of the Congressional Review Act to push back on a particularly  dangerous part of the Biden administration's radical approach to  environmental policy.   Our colleague, the senior Senator from Nebraska, put forward a  resolution that would prevent the administration from implementing even  stricter emission standards on the trucks and heavy equipment that  literally drive our economy.   The nitrogen oxide emissions of new trucks on the market today are  already 98 to 99 percent lower than they were in the late 1990s. So we  are talking about regulation in search of a problem.   In order to keep up with the rule President Biden's EPA released in  December, heavy-auto manufacturers would be forced to add a dizzying  array of new technologies to their products. By one estimate, the new  regulations could raise the cost of a new truck by $42,000--$42,000,  just to keep pace with the changing whims of unelected bureaucrats in  Washington.   As truckers themselves have warned, the EPA's latest overreach would  drive many of them to stick with ``older, less-efficient trucks or  leave the industry entirely.'' And, needless to say, higher costs for  the men and women behind the wheel means higher costs for fuel, food,  and other essentials at the store. But that didn't stop President Biden  from vetoing Senator Fischer's commonsense resolution.   Well, today, we will vote one more time, and we will find out, once  and for all, whether Washington Democrats care more about keeping pace  with leftwing climate activists than helping  [[Page S2152]]  working families contend with the runaway inflation that they helped  create.                              National Security    Mr. President, on another matter, as I have discussed at length,  America's partners in the Indo-Pacific understand the link between  Russian aggression in Europe and the threat of Chinese aggression  closer to home. Japan and Taiwan have devoted serious resources to  Ukraine's defense, but our friends are also wisely strengthening their  own defenses.   Last year, Taiwan's government put forward its largest defense budget  proposal ever--ever--a 14-percent increase in top-line spending, along  with greater attention to territorial defense, longer service  requirements for conscripts, and a focus on whole-of-government  resilience.   Japan has a new transformational strategy. Prime Minister Kishida's  government is pursuing new long-range strike capabilities, increasing  defense spending, and buying SM-6 interceptors. In a sign of deepening  cooperation with the United States, it has expanded its defense  industrial capacity by building facilities to assemble F-35s in Japan.   South Korea is also deepening its security cooperation with the  United States, expanding its defense industrial capacity and providing  military capabilities to key American allies over in Europe.   President Yoon and Prime Minister Kishida have also worked to improve  relations between their two countries and open the door for increased  cooperation with America in the face of an increasingly belligerent  North Korea.   The Philippines is engaging in regular joint exercises in the South  China Sea and working closely with the United States on enhanced  defense cooperation sites that improve our interoperability.   And, earlier this year, Australia reached an agreement with the  United States and the United Kingdom to procure nuclear-powered  conventional submarines--the biggest defense investment in the nation's  entire history.   In other words, our friends are putting their money where their  mouths are. That is important because so has the People's Republic of  China.   Beijing has made historic investments in its own military  modernization. PRC defense spending has grown every year for almost  three decades, but in each of the last 2 years, it has jumped by at  least 7 percent. And, needless to say, China's official statistics tend  to be obscure as much as they reveal.   While our most hostile strategic adversary is accelerating its  military investments, the Biden administration asked Congress to  shrink--shrink--spending on America's Armed Forces in real dollars.   Today, our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee will mark up  the National Defense Authorization Act, beginning the Senate's annual  work on tending to our Nation's common defense.   Facing down a common threat is a chance for the United States and our  partners to grow the defense industrial base we will need to sustain  effective deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. It is an opportunity to  reform America's sluggish foreign military sales procedures, promote  interoperability, and expand joint exercises and access agreements  across the region.   If we are serious about deepening our defense industrial cooperation,  America and our partners must make it easier to work together to share  technology and intelligence and to align our defense investments. We  need to streamline regulations that can prevent our partners from  investing in their own defense bases in closer cooperation with the  United States.   Of course, this is not a one-way street. America can also benefit  from technologies our partners are developing, if our regulations and  bureaucracies simply allow it. Our agreement with the UK and Australia  could represent a transformational new approach to collective security.   If the Biden administration wants this partnership to succeed, it  should consider providing broader country exemptions for defense trade  licenses for those closest allies, similar to what we already do with  Canada. Very simply, it is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.    So China's bid for hegemony in the Indo-Pacific extends far beyond  investments in naval vessels and new missile technologies.   The PRC has poured billions of dollars into development projects in  vulnerable island nations out in the Pacific. So make no mistake, if  the United States and our partners fail to work together to maintain  robust deterrence on behalf of a free and open Indo-Pacific, China will  be all too happy--all too happy--to fill the void.
