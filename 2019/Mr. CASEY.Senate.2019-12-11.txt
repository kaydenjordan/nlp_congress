 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this morning, or I guess this  afternoon, to talk about a couple of issues. I will start with  healthcare and talk about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program, as well as another piece of legislation we are considering in  the next couple of days.   Let me start with healthcare. There is a lot to talk about here. We  don't have time for all of it today, but a number of things are  happening on the healthcare front that I think most Americans are aware  of but maybe have not heard a lot about recently.   I would argue there are three basic threats to healthcare right now-- not just healthcare for some but, in large measure, healthcare for all.  One is a lawsuit, which is being litigated in the Fifth Circuit Court  of Appeals. It is a lawsuit that would wipe out the Affordable Care  Act, and that lawsuit has already prevailed at the district court  level. It is now before the appellate court, and if that lawsuit were  to prevail, the Affordable Care Act--or I  [[Page S6969]]  should say it by its full name--the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act would be declared unconstitutional. That would have  ramifications not only for those 20 million who got covered--coverage  they didn't have before--but also the tens of millions who have  protections they never had before the act was passed in 2010.   If you have a preexisting condition, for example--roughly, one out of  two Americans has a preexisting condition--if you have one, you should  be very concerned about the result of that lawsuit, the determination  of which could be made in a matter of days or weeks. That is a big  threat. That is the biggest threat to healthcare for virtually every  American or at least every American family.   The second big threat to healthcare is what the administration has  undertaken since day one of the Trump administration, and that is the  sabotage of the existing system in this regard, especially with respect  to the insurance exchanges. What the administration has done is try to  take administrative action, action by agencies under the President's  jurisdiction, to undermine the exchanges.   How do they do that? Well, they cut the advertising. So when they  advertise to say that you can shop for a health insurance plan on the  exchanges, they cut the advertising budget by 90 percent. They left 10  percent there. I guess we are supposed to be happy with that.   So they cut advertising by 90 percent. Then they started attacking  the contracts for navigators. These are individuals all across the  country who sit with people and say: Let me help you go through the  options you might have for purchasing insurance or changing your  insurance plan.   For example, right now, we are in an open enrollment period, so folks  can change their health insurance plans until Sunday--basically,  December 15. It would be nice to have a navigator--an assistant, in a  sense--sitting next to you if you are making those decisions about your  healthcare.   So threat No. 1 to healthcare is the lawsuit; threat No. 2 is the  sabotage; and threat No. 3 has not quite played out yet, but I don't  know a Member of the House or the Senate in the Republican caucus in  either Chamber who is not against the threat--the cuts to Medicare and  Medicaid proposed by the administration.   I thought it was bad when the administration--or I should say, House  Republicans--back in the spring of 2018 proposed a cut of $1 trillion  to the Medicaid Program over 10 years. That was bad enough. That was  dangerous enough. But the administration went further than that. The  administration's proposal and, I have to say, unless it is  contradicted, the official position of Republican Members of Congress  is a 10-year cut to Medicaid of $1\1/2\ trillion--$1\1/2\ trillion.  That means the official Republican position in Congress--unless they  say they disagree with the President, and I haven't heard any Member  say that yet--is that the Medicaid Program should be cut by $150  billion each and every year for 10 years. That is the proposed cut.  That is Medicaid.   By the way, Medicaid is the kids' disabilities and nursing home  program, for shorthand. Most of the people helped by Medicaid are folks  in nursing homes, low-income children, children from low-income  families, and children with disabilities who have a substantial stake  in this.   When you consider those three threats--the lawsuit, the sabotage, and  the budget cuts--all are bad news, but then when you start getting into  the details of each, you realize one aspect of this, which I wanted to  raise today, and that is the adverse impact on children.   We are told by the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute  Center for Children and Families--I am holding up a November 2019  summary of a report, a back and a front. I will not read all of it and  I will not enter it into the Record because there is a lot of detail  here that we probably can't enter into the Record. I do want to read  into the Record a couple of highlights from it, though. These folks  have been doing research on children's health insurance for many years  and have spent their lives working on this. The headline reads ``The  Number of Uninsured Children is on the Rise.''   The United States of America, which finally, decades after passing  the Medicaid Program, which was a great advancement in children's  health insurance, then added to that with the enactment in the 1990s of  the Children's Health Insurance Program--it had the letter ``S'' before  it, the SCHIP program--which really was adopting programs that have  been adopted in my home State of Pennsylvania and a few others.   That same country which made a great advancement for children's  health with Medicaid--tens of millions of kids--then made a greater  advancement with the Children's Health Insurance Program and then made  even more substantial gains when we passed the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act and substantially drove down the number of  uninsured Americans. Basically what happened was that about 20 million  people got healthcare coverage in about 6 years--not even a decade. A  number of those Americans were children.   As we were substantially driving down the uninsured rate, what has  happened in the last 2 years? The uninsured rate is going up. The  Census Bureau told us in September that the uninsured rate is going up  by 2 million people--to be exact, 1.9 million people. A big share of  the 1.9 million people who are now uninsured--that number is going up  instead of down, as it had been for most of the decade--a lot of those  are children.   Here is a summary of finding No. 1 in this report by the Georgetown  University Health Policy Institute Center for Children and Families,  November 2019. It is by Joan Alker and Lauren Roygardner. ``The number  of uninsured children in the United States increased by more than  400,000 between 2016 and 2018, bringing the total to over 4 million  uninsured children in the nation.''   That same Nation which made great advancements by lowering the number  of uninsured children is now going in the wrong direction.   Finding No. 2: ``These coverage losses are widespread, with 15 states  showing statistically significant increases in the number and/or the  rate of uninsured children.''   The following States are listed: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia,  Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio,  Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. That is significant. Those  States are represented in some cases by two Democratic Senators,  sometimes two Republican Senators, and sometimes Senators of both  parties. So it is happening in a widespread fashion. The rate of  uninsured children is going up.   Finding No. 3: ``Loss of coverage is most pronounced for white  children and Latino children (some of which may fall into both  categories).''   The other category where the number is going up substantially is  younger children, under the age of 6. So we are not just talking about  children losing coverage; we are talking about that number being more  pronounced for children under the age of 6.   This also includes children in low- to moderate-income families who  earn between 138 percent and 250 percent of the poverty level, meaning  a little more than 29,000 bucks to 53,000 bucks annually--``bucks'' is  my word, not the report's word--$29,435 to $53,325 annually for a  family of three. So these folks who are struggling in a lot of ways-- low-income families trying to climb that ladder to get to the middle  class, in many cases working two or three jobs, trying to make ends  meet--at least in many cases, their children had coverage, and now  children in those families are losing coverage.   Point No. 4 and the last point: ``States that have not expanded  Medicaid to parents and other adults under the Affordable Care Act have  seen increases in their rate of uninsured children three times as large  as states that have,'' meaning States that expanded Medicaid. The  expansion of Medicaid was part of that advancement I talked about.   The three threats to healthcare are bad enough. It is especially bad  when you consider that the Americans who are carrying the heaviest  burden of that uninsured rate going up are, in fact, children.   The second thing I want to raise is the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program. We had a great effort undertaken in the 2018 farm  bill. There were  [[Page S6970]]  efforts by some to cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,  which we used to know as food stamps. Fortunately, those efforts to cut  the program and to knock people off of the SNAP program were  unsuccessful.   We came together in a bipartisan effort in both the House and the  Senate, and the President signed it into the law just about a year  ago--December 2018. The ink was barely dry on his signature when his  administration and the Department of Agriculture started to think of  other ways to do the same thing to SNAP they couldn't do by way of  legislation.   So where are we? Well, we have had basically three proposals over the  course of the last year by the administration that would take 4 million  people out of the SNAP program, kick 4 million people off the program.   Here is what one of those proposals would do: According to the U.S.  Department of Agriculture's own estimates, the proposed changes to one  part of SNAP called categorical eligibility would eliminate millions  from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and it could also  leave nearly 1 million children without access to free school meals. I  don't know about everyone here, but I think that is a step in the wrong  direction.   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is important not only  for those families--many of them working families, many of them with a  child in the household who needs food assistance, who faces food  insecurity without SNAP--many of those same families might have a child  and an individual with a disability in the same household or one or the  other. That is the SNAP program.   By the way, everyone else in the country benefits when people spend  those SNAP dollars because when you provide those dollars and folks buy  food, guess what happens. You guessed it. The economy gets a jump-start  from that activity. The SNAP program isn't about just the people who  are directly benefiting. I think we have an obligation to help them,  for sure. We all benefit when there is economic activity. There is more  than a bang for the buck in the SNAP program; you spend a buck, and you  get a lot more than a buck in return.   This is all in the context of where we are with a lot of families. We  hear a lot on the floor of this Chamber and I am sure on the floor of  the other body, the House, about ``Well, certain people shouldn't get  this benefit,'' and some make an argument against that.   It is interesting that in the SNAP program for many years now, not  just for the last couple of years, the payment error rate in that  program has been way down, the lowest levels ever. Why? It is because  of good efforts to detect fraud, and also technology allows payments to  be tracked. The payment error rate is at its lowest level ever. Yet we  still have efforts undertaken to knock people out of the program. That  is not just insulting, it is very dangerous to people's lives.   I hope Members of the Senate will tell the administration to back off  those proposals that have been undertaken to knock literally, if you  have the effect of all three proposals, 4 million people off of the  program, many of whom are children.   This all happens in the context of those healthcare issues I raised  before. The same child or the same family who might have their SNAP  benefits cut or taken away might be the same family who is losing their  coverage because of cuts to Medicaid and Medicare or because of the  uninsured rate going way up in a country that was driving it way down.  Both are happening at the same time.                    Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019    Mr. President, I want to raise another issue, and then I will  conclude. This is about coal miners across the country but in  particular in a couple of States, like my home State of Pennsylvania,  and I know this is true of Kentucky and Virginia and West Virginia,  just to name several--or I should say the main States we are talking  about here.   The Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019, S. 2788--I know Senator  Manchin and others have spoken about this. We are trying to get this  legislation or some version of this passed by the end of this year. I  won't go through all the details of the legislation, but it attempts to  help on the miners' pension issue--and these are obviously retired coal  miners--as well as the healthcare for those same miners, those same  families.   I will make a comment about what this means. Many of those same  families had to wait way too long--several years--before this body  acted to provide a measure of relief to some of those retired miners on  healthcare. The job isn't done yet on healthcare but even more so on  pensions.   The point I have always made here is that our government made a  promise to them decades ago. In fact, it was the time when President  Truman was in office in the late 1940s. We made a promise to coal  miners at that time.   In that whole intervening time period, those decades, they kept their  promises. Many of them were sent overseas to fight in wars, from World  War II, to Korea, to Vietnam and beyond. They kept their promise to the  country by fighting for their country. They kept their promise to their  employer by going to work every day in the most dangerous job in the  world, likely. I am not sure there is one that is more dangerous. They  kept their promise to their families to go to work and to support them,  sometimes on that one income of a coal miner.   In my home area of Northeastern Pennsylvania, the novelist Stephen  Crane--he is known for the ``Red Badge of Courage,'' but what he is not  known for as much is an essay he wrote about coal mining in the late  1800s--1890s to be exact. He described all the ways a coal miner could  die in a coal mine. He described the coal mine as a place of  inscrutable darkness, a soundless place of tangible loneliness, and  then walked through the ways a miner could die.   I know we have advanced from the 1890s--thank God we have--but there  are still coal miners in the recent history of this country who have  lost their lives. All they have asked us to do--they haven't asked us  to come up with some new fancy plan for them and their families; all  they have asked us to do is to have this government--the executive  branch and the legislative branch--keep the promise to coal miners and  their families with regard to healthcare and pensions. Both of those  parts of our policy are promises.   So when we work on this between now and the end of the year to try to  find a solution, we will be only meeting that basic obligation of  keeping our promise to retired coal miners and their families like they  kept their promise to their country.   I yield the floor.
