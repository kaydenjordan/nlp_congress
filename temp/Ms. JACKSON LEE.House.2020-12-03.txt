 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts as chair of the Committee on Rules, and I collectively  thank the Committee on Rules for its diligent work on the MORE Act, and  that is H.R. 3884.   Let me, as well, thank Jerry Nadler, chairman of the Committee on the  Judiciary, for his great work and, of course, two outstanding members,  Barbara Lee and Earl Blumenauer, for their consistent and persistent  determination.   Mr. Speaker, this morning I spoke to a representative of the law  enforcement community, and I indicated to him that we are about to move  forward on the decriminalizing of marijuana at the Federal level,  eliminating, federally, the criminalization of marijuana and cannabis.  I indicated that it was not to undermine law enforcement and not to  promote drug use but, in essence, to bring about justice and to provide  for the right kind of roadway for what over a majority of Americans,  Republicans and Democrats, want.   It is an important legislative initiative. It provides a vehicle for  sales tax and a vehicle that allows businesses in the marijuana  business to be able to bank legally. It provides for a reinvestment  program, an opportunity grant program, and, as well, an expungement  program governed by Federal courts.                                time  1430    It ensures that there are no sales made to those under 21. It deals  with substance abuse. This is a real step forward in bringing America  together, and I know that my colleagues tomorrow on the floor of the  House will recognize that is what we are doing.   As many people know, the States that have decriminalized can  continue; those who have not can continue their laws as well.   So I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 3884 when it comes to the  floor. Let us do it in unity.   I, too, want to take the opportunity, very briefly. Mr. Woodall, I  think we have seen each other quite frequently, either on this floor in  debate or in the Rules Committee. Let me echo the generosity and  cordialness of your persistent intellect in challenging each and every  one of us who came to make our case. That is all we can do as Americans  and Representatives, is to make our case.   I join you. Let us work together for a COVID-19 relief package and  have that as our legacy as we leave this place. But I wanted to make  sure you knew that Texans appreciate your great leadership. Georgians  and Texans have a good relationship. Congratulations to you. Thank you  for your service.    Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor and a member of the  Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, I rise in strong  support of H.R. 5517, the ``Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative  Act'', which establishes an exchange initiative between the United  States and India to study the work and legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and  Martin Luther King Jr.   First and foremost, I wish to express my gratitude and fondness for  my former colleague and dear friend, John Lewis, who passed away a few  months ago, for introducing and leading this vital piece of  legislation.   By passing this bill today, we authorize the U.S. Department of  State, in cooperation with the Indian Government, to incorporate three  new programs:   the Gandhi-King Scholarly Initiative, which creates an annual  educational forum for scholars from both countries that focuses on the  legacies of Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr;   the Gandhi-King Global Academy, a United States Institute of Peace  (USIP) program tasked with developing a professional development  training initiative on conflict resolution based on the principles of  nonviolence; and   the United States-India Gandhi-King Development Foundation, which  establishes a foundation to address social, environmental, and health  priorities in India.   Mr. Speaker, Congressman Lewis was a giant among us mere mortals.   Not only was he the conscience of the Congress, widely beloved and  revered on both sides of the aisle, but he was also one of the Original  Big Six, a pillar of the Civil Rights Movement, and a lifelong warrior  for a more just, equitable, and better America.   Like Gandhi and Dr. King, Congressman Lewis shaped the world through  his actions of nonviolence, and it is in his honor that we gather here  today to vote on a bill he championed.   To quote Congressman Lewis, ``Both Gandhi and King were inspired  human beings who believed deeply in the power of nonviolent resistance  to injustice as a tool for social change.''   It is because of their courage, commitment, and vision of a more  tolerant and equitable world that we are all able to enjoy and practice  our most fundamental democratic freedoms.   As the world's oldest and largest democracies, the United States and  India have long traditions of upholding these shared values of  nonviolent revolutions championed by figures like Gandhi, King, and  Lewis.   But as we have seen over the past few years, both countries have  experienced significant affronts to the fundamental democratic  principles, which threaten to erode the values that these men and many  others have given their lives to protect.   Mr. Speaker, the ``Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act''  seeks to apply the philosophies of Gandhi and Dr. King to conflict  resolution efforts and current policy challenges.   With this legislation, we seek to embody the best of what we saw of  Gandhi, Dr. King, and Congressman Lewis in their fight for equality and  justice as well as seek to preserve these values so that future  generations are empowered and able to continue the fight against  injustice.   Just a few months ago, the world was reminded of the power nonviolent  resistance has to effect positive change in the face of grave  injustices.   In the wake of George Floyd's murder, millions of people across the  world and in all 50 states within the U.S. gathered together to  peacefully protest against police brutality.   People of different races, socioeconomic classes, ethnicities,  genders, and sexual orientations came together to demonstrate in the  most democratic way possible.   Mr. Speaker, those marches, which were, without a doubt, inspired by  the marches led by Gandhi and Dr. King, have resulted in a genuine  dialogue about institutional racism in this country and have awakened  efforts to reform the system, so that it truly benefits all people.   I am honored to be a leader on this bill, and I urge all Members to  join me in voting for H.R. 5517, the ``Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange  Initiative Act.''    Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Tom Lantos  Commission for Human Rights and a former member of the Commission on  Security and Cooperation in Europe, I rise in strong support of this  bipartisan resolution, H. Res. 958, ``Condemning the practice of  politically motivated imprisonment and calling for the immediate  release of political prisoners in the Russian Federation and urging  action by the United States Government to impose sanctions with respect  to persons responsible for that form of human rights abuse.''   For years, Russia's human rights record has continued to deteriorate,  with the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful  assembly consistently restricted, both by law and in practice.   Most often, the people who are courageous enough to attempt  exercising their most basic human rights, including freedom of the  press and freedom of speech, face reprisals, ranging from harassment to  police ill-treatment, arbitrary arrest, heavy fines, and, in some  cases, criminal prosecution and imprisonment.   Among the Kremlin's political prisoners are journalists, opposition  activists, peaceful protesters, adherents of ``prohibited'' religious  groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, as well as members of  ``undesirable'' political organizations like Open Russia, an  organization that has done a lot to support victims of human rights  violations in Russia.   In fact, several human rights defenders and NGOs have been targeted  within Russia under the laws on ``foreign agents'' and ``undesirable  organizations''.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution seeks to do three things:   Condemn the practice of politically motivated imprisonment by the  Russian government, particularly under the leadership of President  Vladimir Putin;   Call for the immediate release of those designated as political  prisoners in the Russian Federation; and   Urge the current Administration to impose sanctions on those  responsible for these human rights abuses using the Sergei Magnitsky  Rule of Law Accountability Act, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights  Accountability Act, or other authorities.   By passing this resolution today, we are sending a bipartisan message  to the Russian Government that we see the violations of human rights  that are occurring, and we will not stand idly by while people who are  fighting for progress are tortured and ill-treated.   Furthermore, counter-terrorism provisions are widely used to target  dissent across the country and in Crimea, and torture tactics remain  pervasive, as does impunity for its perpetrators.   Last year, due to the growing disconnect between the authorities and  general public, there was an increase in street protests, ranging from  political to economic to social and even to environmental issues.   In July and August of 2019, more than 2,600 people were arrested  during protests in Moscow, which had remained peaceful until the police  and National Guard officers forcibly intervened.   According to Amnesty International, there were numerous reports of  arbitrary arrest, use of excessive, as well as indiscriminate force and  ill-treatment of protesters by the officers, but none of these cases  were known to have been investigated.   As a fierce defender of human rights and the world's oldest  democracy, the United States has a duty to the world to speak up in the  face of injustice and when violations of international commitments,  including the incarceration of political prisoners, occur.   It is our responsibility as Members of Congress to pass this  resolution today in order to urge the Russian Federation to release its  political prisoners and respect the basic human rights of its citizens.   I urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to join me in voting  for H. Res. 958, ``Condemning the practice of politically motivated  imprisonment and calling for the immediate release of political  prisoners in the Russian Federation and urging action by the United  States Government to impose sanctions with respect to persons  responsible for that form of human rights abuse.''    Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor, a mother, and a senior  member of the House Judiciary Committee, I rise in strong support of  this bipartisan resolution, H. Res. 17, ``Expressing Concern Over the  Detention of Austin Tice, and for other purposes.''   In May of 2012, the summer before Austin's final year at Georgetown  Law School, he chose to go to Syria as a freelance journalist to cover  the country's civil war.   Austin felt compelled to tell the story of the horrific and ongoing  conflict there as well as its impact on the people of Syria.   On August 14, 2012, Austin departed from the town of Darayya, a  suburb of Damascus, to travel to Lebanon, but shortly after leaving, he  was detained at a Syrian check point.   Five weeks later, a 43-second video emerged online with the title,  ``Austin Tice is Alive'', showing Austin being held by a group of  unidentified men with assault rifles, but there was no other message  that accompanied the video.   Even still today, no group has claimed responsibility for his capture  nor have there been any demands in exchange for his release.   Austin Tice was not a combatant.   He was simply a young man doing his job, yet he has, without a doubt,  had to suffer unimaginable ordeals and face the dangers of conflict,  hostile governments, and rapacious bandits while reporting on the  Syrian civil war.   My heart goes out to Austin's parents, Debra and Marc Tice, as well  as the rest of his family and loved ones for the pain and uncertainty  that they have had to endure for over eight years.   Eight years.   Mr. Speaker, that is over 2,920 days that Austin's mother has had to  go without hearing his voice, holding his hand, or seeing his face.   Austin was born and raised in my hometown, Houston, Texas.   He is the oldest of seven siblings, a former U.S. Marine, and his  lifelong dream was to become an international correspondent for NPR.   It is no secret that the risk of arrest, abduction, or death make  journalism extremely dangerous and difficult in Syria.   In fact, according to Reporters Without Borders, Syria is ranked  174th out of 180 countries in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index.   In 2020 alone, Reporters Without Borders has documented the killings  of 40 journalists and 3 media assistants as well as the imprisonment of  260 journalists, 122 citizen journalists, and 12 media assistants in  Syria.   Last year, I joined 122 Members of the House of Representatives and  over 50 Senators in a bipartisan letter to the President, demanding  that his Administration act to facilitate Austin's release from Syria.  [[Page H6090]]    With that letter and this resolution, I am once again calling on the  Department of State, the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for  Hostage Affairs, and other U.S. government entities to engage with  Syria for the purpose of securing Austin's safe release.   From serving in Afghanistan and Iraq as a Marine to working as a  journalist dedicated to delivering vital news to the American people,  Austin Tice spent his life giving back and showing up for this country.   Now we need to do the same for him and bring him home.   I am honored to be a leader on this resolution, and I wish to thank  my colleague and good friend from Texas, Representative Al Green, for  his leadership on this resolution.   I urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to join me in voting  for H. Res. 17, ``Expressing Concern over the Detention of Austin Tice,  and for other purposes.''    Mr. Speaker, American people are hungry. Americans  are losing their homes. And one American every 30 seconds is dying. We  need to be able to address this question and address it immediately.   We passed the HEROES Act so many months ago that had testing money.  It had restaurant money for all our local restaurants. It had PPP to  save businesses. It had PPE money in terms of helping getting the  equipment that is needed to save nurses and doctors, but it was not  done.   There is no reason for us to leave this place without recognizing the  American people are crying out for relief. I am willing to look very  carefully at the bipartisan legislation that would include dollars for  local governments finally and as much for education and vaccines. But  the main message is the American people are crying out: Do something  for us.   We have done it as Democrats. I extend my hand of friendship so that  we can negotiate, pass legislation to save lives in America. COVID-19  is raging. Let's do something about it.                            ____________________
