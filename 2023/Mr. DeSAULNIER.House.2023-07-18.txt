 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the life and  service of Dr. Orin Allen.   Throughout his life, Dr. Allen was committed to advancing justice and  serving his community. He worked for the Contra Costa County Probation  Department in California for 35 years and was especially passionate  about supporting our youth, serving on several local boards. In 1999,  Dr. Allen was named Contra Costa County's Humanitarian of the Year in  recognition of his commitment to the county's youth.   Dr. Allen also worked tirelessly to ensure quality education and  supported students. He served as an elected member on the Pittsburg  Unified School District Board for more than 20 years, and was  recognized for his contributions with an Outstanding Friend of  Education award from the Association of California School  Administrators.   Outside of his professional pursuits, Dr. Allen enjoyed spending time  with his family and friends of which I am one and consider myself lucky  to have been his friend.    Sadly, Dr. Allen passed away on April 23. He will be remembered for  his compassionate nature and his many contributions to our community.  Please join me in recognizing the life of Dr. Orin Allen.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my neighbor and colleague and  friend, Congressman Thompson, for the time and for his tireless  leadership on this important topic and for his incredible  understanding, from many perspectives, on this important subject.   I come to this subject as a survivor of gun violence, having lost my  father to gun violence 44 years ago. As Mr. Thompson mentioned, suicide  is the leading issue with gun violence, and we know the free and easy  access to guns in States and communities that don't provide for  evidence-based research results in almost 60 percent of those daily  deaths. Sixty of the 100 a day are by people that are self-inflicted  like my father.   In California, the district I represent and the district Mr. Thompson  represents, the Bay Area, we can be proud that these commonsense,  evidence-based gun violence and public health initiatives make you  safer. According to Giffords, significantly safer. We have years of  research to demonstrate this.   While we are proud of the fact that you are safer in California in  our districts because of sound public evidence and constitutionally  approved policy, we are frustrated that weak gun laws in other parts of  the country make it more dangerous even in our communities.   Forty percent of the guns used in California come from outside of the  State illegally. The ATF reports that nearly 60,000 guns are trafficked  across State lines nationally each year with tragic results.   As many as 87 percent of the firearms used in crimes in Chicago, New  York, and Boston were trafficked from other States, in spite of those  jurisdictions' thoughtful gun violence prevention laws.   Seventy-five percent of trace guns that cross State lines come from  States without background checks.   Because of this patchwork of State and local laws, States like  California, with strong gun laws, see increased rates of gun homicide  and gun crime when they border States with weak gun laws.   To make a real impact, action has to happen here at the Federal  level. We should all commit that we will not back down from this fight  because every American, no matter where they live, regardless of where  they call home, deserves to live free of the fear of gun violence.
