 Madam President, I want to concur in the remarks just  expressed by my colleague, and we do honor our veterans. And Senator  Moran serves as our ranking member at the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs, and we appreciate his leadership, as we all seek to honor that  service and to fulfill the obligation that this great Nation has made  to our veterans who don't shrink from service, who don't pass the  blame. They get up every day and they execute on their mission, and I  think it is important for each and every one of us to remember that our  service should do honor to the service and the sacrifice that they have  made.
