 Mr. Speaker, I rise today not just as a South Carolinian  but also as co-chair of the Broadcasters Caucus to celebrate the 70th  anniversary of WYFF News 4.   Known originally as WFBC, the station started broadcasting on  December 31, 1953. The first anchor for the station was Norvin Duncan  who worked for WFBC radio before joining the newly created WFBC-TV.   Channel 4 was the first broadcaster in South Carolina to televise a  live game, which was a basketball game between Furman and Newberry  Colleges.   By the 1970s, technology had advanced, and WYFF's staff had to  increase as well to ensure accurate, timely news for upstate South  Carolina, Georgia, and western North Carolina.   WYFF was also the first station in South Carolina to have an African- American anchor when Deborah Lee began anchoring ``The Scene at 6.''   For 70 years, WYFF news has kept the upstate informed on innumerable  local events, heartwarming stories, storms, and national emergencies.   WYFF has even lost staff members in the field who were just working  to keep citizens informed as storms raged. I remember specifically Mike  McCormick and Aaron Smeltzer who passed away in 2018.   I thank Carol, Nigel, Jane, and the rest of the WYFF team for  continuing  [[Page H6065]]  the station's legacy. I look forward to the next 70 years of WYFF  keeping the upstate informed and safe with local, live, and breaking  news.                            ____________________
