 Mr. President, I thank Senator Kaine for his work on this  and speaking out on it. It is an issue of justice, an issue of  fairness, and an issue that--I mean, how can you be against this? I  don't even pretend to understand it.   Senator Smith, who is still relatively new to this body, has taken a  leadership role on an issue that is as important in terms of human  rights as any I can imagine this body has taken up, this fight for  Federal contract workers who suffered because of President Trump's  disastrous shutdown earlier this year.   When you think about this, these are workers making $8, $10, and  $12--I know most of my colleagues don't know anybody--well, actually,  they know people who make $8, $10, and $12 an hour, they have just  never actually asked them their names and talked to them about their  lives to find that out. We dress well. We have great healthcare  benefits. We have good wages here, and most of the people who serve us:  the cafeteria workers here, the people who come in at night when we  leave and clean our offices--in this case, many of them are Federal  employees, but some of them are contract employees. That simply means-- go to the Cleveland airport and talk to the people who drive the carts  taking people to and from their planes or talk to the people who push  the wheelchairs of people who have a little trouble getting on and off  the planes. Those people don't work for United Airlines. They don't  work for Cleveland Hopkins airport or Dulles or National or the airport  in whatever it is called--sorry, Senator Smith--in Minneapolis-Saint  Paul. They work for contractors so often, and those are the people we  are talking about. Those are the people who are ignored. They are  making $8, $10, $12 an hour. We don't pay attention to them in this  body. We don't know their names. We don't speak for them too often.  Senator Smith, Senator Kaine, and I are speaking for them because we  know what happened to them.    I think Americans don't realize that thousands of janitors and  cafeteria workers and security guards spent weeks out of work because  of Trump's disastrous shutdown. They are employed by private  contractors, not the government, and they are paid too little to begin  with, and they have no way of making up those lost hours and lost  wages.   Missing a paycheck--you know, a lot of people in this country can  absorb missing a paycheck if they are in the 1 percent or the 2 percent  or the 5 percent or the 10 percent wealthiest people, certainly the  billionaire President and his multimillionaire--except for those  Cabinet members who are billionaires--Cabinet with their massive  investment portfolios. But for most Americans--most Americans--missing  a paycheck is a big deal.   The President doesn't understand and doesn't seem to care to  understand that working people couldn't just send a letter to  creditors, saying: Please excuse me this month, Mr. Landlord or Ms.  Landlord, from paying rent or paying my mortgage or paying for my  medications at the local CVS. They take money out of their savings, if  they have any savings. It is awfully hard to have savings at $10, $12,  and $14 an hour. They take money out of those savings. Or, more likely,  in the case of these contractors who earn $10, $12 and $14 an hour,  they turn to family members; they run up their credit cards; they go to  payday lenders; and they never get out from under that, as you know.   Some of them--many, many of them--are still dealing with the debt. I  remember talking to cafeteria workers in Senator Kaine's State in  Arlington. Federal contractor workers who serve food in our Smithsonian  museums are not Federal workers. Most people who go to the Smithsonian  figure people who are serving the food and cleaning the place or  cleaning the offices and exhibits are probably government employees,  but they are not.   One worker told me: I have to pay rent, and I have other bills. I  have a college student in his second semester, and he needs help with  his books.   The president of one SEIU local, which represents janitors and  security officers, said that those workers and their families ``will  continue to relive the trauma on a daily basis until they are  compensated for 35 days of income''--35 days of income they went  without. They are already living on the edge, and this body, because of  its inaction, because of its head in the sand, because of its--pardon  my language--boneheadedness, simply ignores them and just washes their  hands. They say, ``I don't know who they are, and I don't know their  names, so we are not going to do anything to help them,'' even though  it was the Trump shutdown that betrayed these workers.   The same President betrays workers by denying the overtime pay they  have earned. The same President puts people in the Supreme Court who  put their thumb on the scale of justice always to support corporations  over workers, always to support Wall Street over consumers, and always  to support health insurance companies over patients. Put on top of that  the Trump tax cuts--a massive giveaway to the wealthiest 1 percent.   I spoke to a group of union members today. They want a transportation  bill. They want an infrastructure bill. They know what the bridge looks  like connecting my State in Cincinnati over the Ohio River with that of  the Republican leader down the hall--Senator McConnell's State. They  know the needs there. I have to say, we got no money because of this  tax cut that my friends over here voted for, most of which went to the  wealthiest 1 percent.   Because of the Trump shutdown, these workers we are talking about  [[Page S6216]]  went without paychecks. He has done nothing to fix it. It comes back to  the dignity of work. All work has dignity. Dr. King said that no job is  menial if it pays an adequate wage, but it also means getting to go to  work every day and earning that pay.   For these contract workers, their work has dignity. If the President  understood that, he would make sure they would get their paychecks. The  House already passed backpay for contractors 4 months ago.   I ask my colleagues to join us on Senator Smith's amendment because  if you love this country, you fight for the people who make it work.   (Mr. CRUZ assumed the Chair).                                Amendment 1088     Mr. President, I rise to speak about Amendment 1088, which  I introduced with Senator Jones. The amendment is straightforward. It  provides $5 million to fund Centers of Excellence at 1890 land-grant  universities. This amendment--I want to underscore this--includes an  offset.   Let me tell you why I introduced this. The authorization for these  Centers of Excellence was included in the 2018 farm bill. I offered it  as an amendment in the Senate Agriculture Committee. It could be  critical for schools like Central State, west of Columbus, in Ohio. The  chairman and the ranking member of the Ag Committee supported it. The  Senate majority leader supported it, as did the chair of the Ag  Appropriations Subcommittee. The entire committee supported it. It  passed by a voice vote.   Then we passed the farm bill and sent it to the President. We got 87  votes from this body for the farm bill. That is more than ever, I  believe, any farm bill has ever passed the Senate. These centers will  focus on important challenges facing the agriculture sector and its  workforce.   I ask unanimous consent that the letter of support from Dr. Kent  Smith, president of Langston University in Oklahoma on behalf of the  Council of 1890 University Presidents, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                             Association of Public &                                         Land-Grant Universities,                                   Washington, DC, October 29, 2019.       Hon. Richard Shelby,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick Leahy,      Vice Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations,           Washington, DC.      Hon. John Hoeven,      Chairman, Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Jeff Merkley,      Ranking Member, Senate Agriculture Appropriations           Subcommittee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shelby; Vice Chairman Leahy; Chairman Hoeven;       and Ranking Member Merkley: On behalf of the Council of 1890       Presidents, I am writing to express our support for Senator       Brown and Senator Jones' amendment to the FY 2020 Agriculture       Appropriations bill to fund the newly created Centers of       Excellence. As you know, these new Centers were authorized       and created in the 2018 Farm Bill. The work of these Centers       is a critical part of the future research in several       strategic areas that our Universities will do on behalf of       the country.        I understand that the amendment being considered by the       Senate would provide half of the authorized annual funding       for the new Centers. While we certainly appreciate that       effort, we strongly encourage the Congress to fully fund the       Centers to their authorized level. These Centers were       promised to our Universities almost 30 years ago and while we       are pleased that they are close to being a functioning       reality, without this initial funding they will not get off-      the-ground.        Again, we strongly support Senator Brown and Senator Jones'       efforts and look forward to working with you to have this       amendment included in the final version of the FY 2020       Agriculture Appropriations Bill.            Sincerely,      Kent J. Smith, Jr., Ph.D.,        Chair, Council of 1890 University Presidents, President,       Langston University.     Dr. Smith notes that they have been promised these Centers  of Excellence for 30 years. The Senate needs to act, and it needs to  include my amendment to right this wrong.   I remind my colleagues that the 1890 land grants were created because  many States, rather than allowing African-American students to attend  the 1862 land-grant universities, decided to set up, in the name of  segregation in those States, a separate system of colleges and  universities.   The 1890s schools, as my colleagues know, despite providing a pathway  to the middle class for generations of mostly African-American  students, have been ignored or, at best, underfunded since their  creation.   I have tried to figure out why my amendment is not just automatically  set. Again, it was authorized by the Agriculture Committee; it passed  the Senate unanimously; it was signed by the President. Why isn't this  amendment acceptable? The majority can't be opposed because the House  funded this program; the majority has cleared amendments that duplicate  House money. It can't be because my amendment is too expensive, as the  majority, I am told, is willing to clear a Thune-Hoeven amendment that  funds Tribal colleges--which is a good thing--at the same level as my  amendment.   I have worked with the committee to find an offset for my amendment,  and even though the authorization is for $10 million a year, at the  committee's urging, I have reduced it to $5 million, and still, for  whatever reason, they can't see clear to support this.   I know if this came up for a floor vote, we would pass it  overwhelmingly. I don't know why we need to do that rather than just  accept this.   I urge my colleagues to include this commonsense, fully paid-for  amendment in the appropriations bill.   I yield the floor.
