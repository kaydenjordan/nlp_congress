 Madam Speaker, it is said that the Lord  takes nothing out of season, and so in this season of Thanksgiving, I  rise to give thanks for my big brother, Harry W. Dean.   After 74 years of life filled with adventure, love, and laughs, my  brother Harry died on November 20.   Harry was the second eldest of our seven siblings, five boys and two  girls; one for every day's grace, my parents proclaimed. We joked he  was my mother's favorite. It turns out he was all of ours, too.   Harry was an exceptional athlete, a champion pole vaulter with a  wicked fastball. He was effortlessly funny, a natural storyteller, king  of the one-liners.   Harry was a Navy veteran, a good cook, a fisherman, surfer, a boater,  a collector of cool and not-so-cool cars.   As we got older, Harry leaned into his quiet side. He was a careful  collector of people, relics, and their memories.   He was a steward of our family's history, preserving the photos and  legacies of those who came before. The same will be true for Harry.   Madam Speaker, in this season of Thanksgiving, Harry's brothers and  sisters, alongside Claire; Adrienne, Joe; and his handsome, loving  grandsons, Joey, AJ, and Jack, we are thankful for Harry. We are  confident that we will see him on the other side. We love him.                            ____________________
