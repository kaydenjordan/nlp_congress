 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

The       Government of France has requested the case be amended to       include additional non-MDE E-2C Hawkeye sustainment items and       services. This case amendment will increase the total case       value above the total non-MDE notification threshold and thus       notification of the entire FMS case is now required.        Major Defense Equipment (MDE): None.        Non-MDE: Included is an Engine Component Improvement       Program (CIP); software updates; technical publication; U.S.       Government and contractor technical and product support and       assistance; and other related elements of logistics and       program support.

The original       Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case, valued at $99.6 million,       included E-2C Hawkeye sustainment support. Therefore, this       notification is for E-2C Hawkeye sustainment support, which       includes an Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP);       software updates; technical publications; U.S. Government,       and contractor technical and product support and assistance;       and other related elements of logistics and program support.       The estimated total cost is $160 million,        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the security of a NATO Ally that is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.        The proposed sale will improve France's capability to meet       current and future threats in the European domain by       maintaining its E-2C fleet in fully mission-capable status       and sustain introperability with U.S. and NATO forces. France       will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal U.S. contractor will be Northrop Grumman,       Melbourne, FL. There are no known offset agreements proposed       in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of the proposed sale will require occasional       government personnel to visit France on a temporary basis and       one contractor personnel to be permanently assigned in France       in conjunction with program technical Oversight and support       requirements, including program and technical reviews as well       as training and maintenance support.        There will be no adverse-impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
