 Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear: just because  Democrats named their bill the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act does not  mean this bill will achieve that goal.   The only thing it really achieves is a campaign talking point for  Democrats responding to constituents frustrated with higher prices at  the grocery store and the gas station caused by their reckless  spending.   Instead of wasting our valuable time debating this bill that will  never become law, we should pass H.R. 8069, the Reducing Farm Input  Costs and Barriers to Production Act, introduced by Ranking Member  Thompson, which includes real, immediate solutions our farmers,  ranchers, and producers support.   His bill, which I am proud to support, would reverse the EPA's  reckless actions related to crop production tools, reverse the Biden  administration's confusing and disastrous changes to the Waters of the  United States rule, and would withdraw the SEC's ludicrous ESG rule on  climate-related disclosures, an action that has received bipartisan  support.
