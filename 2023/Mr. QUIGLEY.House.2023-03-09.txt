 Madam Speaker, as we reflect on the 1-year anniversary  of Putin's war against Ukraine, it cannot help but remind us of why we  fought in the Second World War and that the fight in Ukraine embodies  the very same principles we fought for in the Second World War.   First: Preventing authoritarian regimes from wiping out sovereign  democratic countries.   Ukraine is a sovereign democratic nation. They have held free and  fair elections since 1991. They have freedom of expression, press, and  speech, while Russia is an autocratic nation led by an authoritarian  dictator who represses personal expression, the free press, and free  speech. He invaded Ukraine expressly to expand his sphere of autocratic  control and subvert the will of the free people of Ukraine.   The second principle: To prevent further genocide.   Putin's invasion has been characterized by the commission of war  crimes. One year ago this month, Russian forces deliberately targeted a  civilian shelter. That same month they struck a children's hospital and  maternity ward. The next month, over 400 bodies of civilians were found  in mass graves in Bucha after the city was liberated. In September, 450  bodies, mostly of civilians, were found in mass graves in Kharkiv.   I visited Ukraine last summer, where I met with President Zelenskyy  and traveled to Bucha and saw the mass graves firsthand.   In the Second World War, we vowed, ``Never again.'' Removing  ourselves from this effort would be an egregious breach of that  commitment and would demonstrate that we have not learned the lessons  of those who gave their last full measure of devotion in the Second  World War.   The third principle we defended in World War II was the preservation  of a liberal world democratic order.   As we have seen in history, the actions of one autocratic nation can  inspire the actions of others. Allowing Russia to conquer Ukraine will  send the message to other autocrats that their expansion to free  nations will not be opposed. This cannot be the future we allow.   President Biden's recent historic trip to Kyiv highlighted these  reasons, but it also recalled the words of FDR in his last inaugural  address in the months leading up to the end of that great conflict. He  said, ``We have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace; that our  own well-being is dependent on the well-being of other nations far  away. . . .   ``We have learned the simple truth, as Emerson said, that `The only  way to have a friend is to be one.' We can gain no lasting peace if we  approach it with suspicion and mistrust or with fear.''   Just as the world has borne witness to Putin's relentless violence,  we have seen the resilience and determination of the Ukrainian people.  Their fight is the reason we formed the United Nations and NATO in the  first place. Quite simply, they have earned that support.   As President Zelenskyy said:         Aid is not charity, it is an investment in the global       security and democracy.    He is right.   Our efforts to defend Ukraine are to protect Ukraine's right to self- determination and protect the future of democracy around the globe.   We are, indeed, facing a turning point in this war, and I am reminded  of Winston Churchill's words after Britain's victory in the second  battle of El-Alamein: ``Now this is not the end. It is not even the  beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.''   We are today at the end of the beginning of Putin's campaign in  Ukraine and his efforts to recreate the Soviet Union. We must be united  in our efforts to defend Ukraine and democracy.                            ____________________
