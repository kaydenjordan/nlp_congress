 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the historic labor  deal reached between the Teamsters and UPS. This is a monumental  achievement for organized labor, underscoring the power of unions that  make up the backbone of our economy and our democracy.   I would especially like to recognize Teamsters Local 348, which  represents UPS workers in Ohio's 13th Congressional District.   These hardworking, dedicated union members were on the front lines  throughout the entire pandemic, keeping our country running by  consistently delivering essential supplies, food, and medicine to  communities  [[Page H3966]]  across our district, as well as throughout the country.   This historic contract acknowledges their hard work and sacrifices  and raises the bar for all workers in all industries.   I was proud to join my Labor Caucus colleagues last week in sending a  bipartisan letter reaffirming my constituents' right to collectively  bargain, and I will always stand with workers to support higher wages,  safer working conditions, and better benefits.    Congratulations, again, to the 340,000 Teamsters at UPS, and I thank  them for their dedication to setting a new standard for workers across  the country.                            ____________________
