 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the most important words in our  Constitution are the first three words, ``We the People.'' With those  words, our Founding Fathers laid out the vision, the principles, and  the foundation for our new Nation's government. It would be, as  President Lincoln so eloquently described, ``a government of the  people, by the people, and for the people.'' It would not be a  government by and for the privileged. It would not be a government by  and for the powerful. It would not be a government by and for the  elite, and it certainly would not be an authoritarian government.   I believe it is more important than ever for us to recommit ourselves  to that vision, a vision of a nation that measures successes, not at  the boardroom table but at the kitchen tables of hard-working Americans  across this land, the vision of a nation that derives its power and  authority from the people.   In order to do that, we must resist President Trump's dangerous tilt  toward authoritarianism. Throughout his candidacy and now within the  walls of the White House, President Trump has viciously and repeatedly  attacked the media. He has inflamed people's anger toward immigrants,  toward religious minorities, toward refugees, and he has undermined or  attacked individuals who publicly stand up to him and the shortcomings  of his policies. These are four strategies used by authoritarian  leaders from time immemorial to consolidate power. These are strategies  that are incompatible with our constitutional ``we the people''  construction of government, and we must call out and resist these  strategies.   President Trump's authoritarian leanings were there from the  beginning. Like many figures throughout history, he rode into office as  much on a cult personality as on the merits of his policies. It started  with the nicknames and the unrestrained insults, calling opponents  crooked and lyin' and phony, calling critics dumb as a rock,  incompetent, crazy, or dishonest. He escalated the calls to toss out or  hurt protesters at his rallies. At one point, he promised to pay the  legal bills of a man arrested for punching a protester at a rally in  North Carolina. Then there were the ``lock her up'' chants that he  repeated himself, calling for imprisoning a political opponent.  Threatening to throw your opponent in jail if you win is a strategy  usually seen only with dictators.   Mr. Trump himself best summed up his populist cult personality when  he said at one campaign event: ``I could stand in the middle of Fifth  Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?'' The  scary thought is that he was probably not so far off the mark. This  aggressive and unswerving loyalty is a challenge to our ``we the  people'' democracy.   Let's take a look at Senior White House Policy Adviser Stephen  Miller's declaration on Face the Nation last month. He said: ``Our  opponents, the media, and the whole world will soon see as we begin to  take further actions, that the powers of the President to protect our  country are very substantial and will not be questioned.''   That is an interesting statement to make: The President's powers will  not be questioned. What a bold, un-American, authoritarian statement to  make because here in America, our Nation, our national government, is  premised on the concept that we can challenge our leaders. It is not  only a privilege, it is a responsibility. Yet Mr. Trump has repeatedly  attacked this fundamental American principle and those who exercise it.   Take, for instance, his attack on freedom of the press. Demosthenes,  an ancient Greek statesman, orator, and legal scholar of the third  century B.C. once said: ``There is one safeguard known generally to the  wise, which is an advantage and security to all, but especially to  democracies as against despots--suspicion.''   What Demosthenes was saying is that in a democracy we don't take the  statements of our political leaders simply at face value. We test those  statements against the facts to find our way to the truth. In the  United States, a free and open press is how we exercise that suspicion  and find our way to the truth.   Thomas Jefferson believed that. He said: ``Our liberty depends on the  freedom of the press.'' Our liberty depends upon the freedom of the  press.   Benjamin Franklin echoed that belief when he said: ``Freedom of  speech is ever the Symptom as well as the Effect of a good  Government.''   John Adams wrote: ``The liberty of the press is essential to the  security of the state.'' It is so essential, in fact, that the Founding  Fathers enshrined our commitment to a free and open press to the very  First Amendment to the Constitution, that ``Congress shall make no law  . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.'' Yet what we  have seen time and again from President Trump is an endless attack  against the fourth estate, against the press. He said: ``The media is  very unfair. They're very biased.'' He complained on FOX News last  August.   He attacked the New York Times in that same interview, not for the  first or last time, saying: ``You look at The New York Times, I mean  the fail--I call it `The Failing New York Times.' ''   Apparently any news story critical of the President is now ``fake  news.'' He tweeted in February: ``Any negative polls are fake news.''   And when asked about leaks from the intelligence community during  last month's press conference in the East Room, he said: ``The leaks  are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is  fake.''   His staff has gotten into the action, too, pushing at one point the  Orwellian term, ``alternative facts.'' During an interview on NBC's  Meet the Press, Kellyanne Conway said: ``Sean Spicer, our press  secretary, gave alternative facts,'' and, in the administration, ``we  feel compelled to go out and clear the air and put alternative facts  out there.''   The White House has taken their fight with the media so far as to  block access to outlets they disagree with, banning outlets such as  CNN, POLITICO, the New York Times, and Los Angeles Times from an off- camera press briefing last month.   But of all of President Trump's relentless attacks against the media,  the most disturbing to me was when he tweeted in February: ``The FAKE  NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my  enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!''   President Trump, I have a message for you: A free and open press is  not the enemy of the American people. A free and open press is the  salvation of our democratic Republic. It is an essential warrior in our  Republic against fake news, charlatans, and those who would use fake  news and attacks on the press to advance authoritarian government.   I thought my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, made a very apt  analysis when he said that suppressing free speech is how dictators  ``get started . . . when you look at history, the first thing that  dictators do is shut down the press.'' Senator McCain went on to say:  ``If you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a  free and many times adversarial press.''   So this is a major concern, this attack on the media, and  particularly an attack on news organizations that work to vet their  reporting before they  [[Page S1910]]  share it with the American people. In other words, we are in the ironic  situation that the very groups under attack by President Trump are the  groups that work hardest to get true facts, actual facts, vetted facts,  carefully fact-checked information to the American people. That is the  foundation for a national dialogue: carefully vetted information so  that we know when we read it, it is reliable. That is the type of news  we need more of in this Nation.   Mr. Trump's authoritarian tactics aren't just limited to his war on  the media. His second approach is to attack and scapegoat immigrants,  religious minorities, and refugees ever since he stood in the lobby of  Trump Tower and said:         When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their       best. . . . They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime.       They're rapists.    Since then President Trump has made it his mission to turn the  American people against Mexican immigrants, to make them the enemy. He  has talked about the ``bad hombres'' flooding across our southern  border, stealing our jobs, committing crimes, and murdering American  citizens. In his mind, the people coming from Mexico are all dangerous,  violent cartel members transporting an endless supply of drugs across  our country in order to ruin America. But this storyline is completely  at odds with the facts. First, drug cartels do not ship their products  into our country through the backpacks of immigrants.   Recently I traveled with a congressional delegation to the U.S.- Mexico border to examine this issue. The experts on the border told our  delegation that drugs come into the United States through freight, in  trucks, and through tunnels--not through backpacks. What this means is  that a proposal to build a wall, whether it is 20 feet high or 30 feet  high, will be absolutely useless in diminishing the flow of drugs into  our country.   I will tell you what else they told us. They said that an end zone  defense does not work against drugs. If you want to stop the flow of  drugs, you have to work carefully with regard to everything from the  moment they are being manufactured or shipped into Mexico until they  migrate north. That means you have to work in close cooperation with  the security agencies of Mexico, with the police, and with the  intelligence agencies of Mexico. That cooperation requires a very close  coordination between respected partners, and disrespecting the partners  of Mexico is the best way to damage the ability to intercept drugs that  are coming into the United States.   We also know that the underlying premise of there being a flood of  Mexican immigrants coming into our country is false. A 2015 study from  the Pew Research Center found that between 2009 and 2014, there was a  net outflow of 140,000 Mexican immigrants from the United States. They  were migrating from the United States to Mexico, a net outflow. A more  recent Pew Study determined that the number of undocumented Mexican  immigrants in America has declined by more than 1 million since 2007.  If you take the span during the Obama administration, there was an  outflow, not an inflow--the exact opposite of the story line the  President is presenting.   What about those violent crimes being committed by undocumented  criminals? The data does not support the President. In fact, the New  York Times reported that ``several studies, over many years, have  concluded that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people  born in the United States.'' Between 1980 and 2010, among men aged 18  to 49, immigrants were one-half to one-fifth as likely to be  incarcerated as those born in the United States.   When you look closer, the attacks on immigrants fall apart, as I have  pointed out, but that is what authoritarian leaders do. They create a  false enemy, and they use the perception of that enemy to generate hate  and fear. They use that hate and fear to consolidate power. It is our  responsibility as citizens, as the press in the United States, and as  legislators to resist this authoritarian strategy of President Trump.   Another of his strategies is to attack religious minorities in our  country and abroad. Take for instance his pledge on the campaign trail  for a ``total and complete'' shutdown on Muslims entering the United  States. As we know, Mr. Trump followed up on this approach after the  election by asking Rudy Giuliani to help fashion a legal Muslim ban.   During a FOX News interview, Mr. Giuliani said:         Trump called me up. He said, Put a commission together.       Show me the right way to do it legally.    To attempt to meet constitutional muster, Trump aimed his ban at  immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations.   Rudy Giuliani went on to say in that same FOX News interview:         What we did was we focused on, instead of religion,       danger--the areas of the world that create danger for us,       which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly       legal, perfectly sensible. And that's what the ban is based       on.    But, as William Banks, the director of the Institute for National  Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University, observed, ``Since  9/11, no one has been killed in this country in a terrorist attack by  anyone who emigrated from any of the seven countries.''   The President's own Department of Homeland Security recently reported  that citizens from the countries listed in the Muslim ban are ``rarely  implicated in U.S.-based terrorism.'' In fact, the report concluded  that individuals who died in the pursuit of or who were convicted of  terrorism were far more likely to be U.S.-born citizens than to be  immigrants.   Here is the great irony and the tragedy of President Trump's effort  to demonize Muslims: Instead of protecting the United States, he is  damaging the security of the United States. His attacks feed perfectly  into and therefore strengthen ISIS's recruiting strategy of claiming  that the United States is at war with Islam. Video of his speeches and  public statements, especially Trump's call for a Muslim ban, has  already been featured in ISIS's recruiting tools. In addition, it  weakens the Muslim leaders we are seeking to partner with in taking on  ISIS. It undermines those leaders' support from their own countries in  their cooperating with the United States.   Trump's strategy does double damage to American security, and I wish  his impact against religious minorities stopped there. I wish it  stopped long before there because it is incompatible with the  fundamental premise, the fundamental values of the United States of  America, which is religious freedom. Yet, throughout the course of his  campaign, he gave voice time and again to the views and opinions of  White nationalists and anti-Semites. He did not directly attack the  Jewish community, but his White nationalist rhetoric and actions have  had the effect of doing it indirectly. When he needs news or  information, he turns to the White nationalist Breitbart News--a fake  news source which has infamously attacked American Jews with stories  like ``Bill Kristol: Republican spoiler, renegade Jew'' and another one  that attacked Anne Applebaum of the Washington Post, which read: ``Hell  hath no fury like a Polish, Jewish, American elitist scorned.''   But President Trump does not just tap into the Breitbart White  nationalist themes; he brought the former executive chair of Breitbart,  Steve Bannon, into the White House as his chief strategist and then  appointed him to the Principals Committee of the National Security  Council. This individual has no business being anywhere near the  Capital of the United States and certainly not on the Principals  Committee of the National Security Council. Bannon is a man who has not  only been embraced by White supremacists for his views, but according  to testimony from his ex-wife, he has said he does not want his  children going to school with Jewish kids and had once asked a school  administrator why there were so many Hanukkah books in the library.   If you think this theme has not had a real effect on our country, you  are wrong. When Donald Trump was elected, the KKK and other White  nationalist groups celebrated. They felt free to come out of the  shadows. They felt bold enough to hold an annual White nationalist  conference right here in Washington, DC, at the Ronald Reagan Building,  steps from the White House, because they finally felt like they had one  of their own in the Oval Office.   These nationalist groups are so emboldened that we have seen more  [[Page S1911]]  than 100 bomb threats called in to Jewish community centers around the  country since January. We have witnessed the desecration of Jewish  headstones in cemeteries in St. Louis and in Philadelphia.   Last month the President, speaking to a roomful of State attorneys  general, said he condemned these threats. I applaud him for condemning  them. But then he turned around and said: ``You have to be careful,  because the reverse could be true.'' What did he mean by that?  Commentators have suggested that the President meant by ``the reverse  could be true'' that the bomb threats, the Swastika graffiti, and the  desecration of Jewish burial sites might actually be the work of Jewish  Americans to generate criticism of President Trump. There is no  evidence of that, and I certainly do not believe it to be true. What I  do believe is that a ``blame the victim'' tactic is reprehensible and  in itself an anti-Semitic strategy.    The President has also dedicated a significant amount of time to  trying to make the country fear refugees, to demonize refugees. Many of  us grew up in a world in which Lady Liberty's words of ``give us your  tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free''  stirred our hearts because, unless you are 100 percent Native American,  you are tied in through your parents, your grandparents, your great- grandparents, your ancestors. You are tied to those who immigrated to  the United States, who came here, often fleeing persecution, often  fleeing famine. This Nation gave them a place to stand and in which to  build a new life and thrive and hand down a better, stronger nation to  their children. That is a property of our history. That is a value  deeply rooted in our hearts.   The President, instead, has dedicated his energy to attacking  refugees, those, like our ancestors, who came here, fleeing persecution  and fleeing famine, especially Syrian refugees, who are fleeing for  their lives in search of a safe haven. He has falsely claimed they  represent a ``great Trojan horse'' that threatens the safety of  Americans. Mr. Trump says these victims of war have to be subjected to  extreme vetting because we have no idea who these people are or where  they come from. The fact is that we do know who they are. We know  exactly where they come from because before they can come here as  refugees, they already go through extreme vetting. It takes 18 months  to 2 years of vetting, on average, before refugees are given tickets to  come to the United States of America, and if at any point during that  18 to 24 months something does not add up, they do not get the tickets.   Now, if ISIS or another terrorist organization wants to get people  who are dangerous into our country, they do not go through an 18- or a  24-month vetting process. No. They come on tourist visas or student  visas or business visas. Going through the refugee process would be the  worst possible way to do it.   As an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute reminded us in  October of 2015, of the 784,000 refugees who have been resettled in our  country since September 11, 2001, 3 have been arrested for planning  terrorist activities. None of them got past the planning phase, and  only one of those three was talking about potential attacks here in the  United States. The others were talking about sending money and weapons  to al-Qaida. In other words, no one has been injured by those 784,000  refugees.   These are just some of the pieces of the President's authoritarian  strategy to demonize groups, to create hate, to create fear, and to try  to consolidate power. As a result of his activities, we have seen waves  of hate crimes and violence and bigotry sweep across our Nation.   Latino and Latina students in our schools and in our classrooms have  been forced to confront classmates' bullying and taunts, chants of  ``build the wall'' and ``go back to your country,'' and graffiti  sprayed on walls to ``build the wall higher.''   We have heard reports of verbal and physical attacks against people  of the Muslim faith.   A woman at San Jose University lost her balance and choked when a man  attempted to rip off her head scarf.   A Muslim student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign  campus reported having a knife pulled on her.   A Muslim teacher in Georgia found left on her desk a note that read  that a head scarf is not allowed anymore and that she should hang  herself with it.   Within the last 8 weeks, four mosques around the country have been  burned to the ground.   Just recently, a man in Kansas went into a bar, hurled ethnic slurs  at two Indian engineers, and shot them, killing one and seriously  injuring the other.   As I mentioned earlier, since January, there have been more than 100  bomb threats against Jewish community centers.   Throughout history, we have seen this tactic used by an executive  here, an executive there, by a dictator here, a dictator there, in  country after country, to characterize minority communities as a threat  to be feared in order to make the body politic afraid, to make them  angry, and to make them willing to support authoritarian exercise of  power.   What is our job? It is our job to expose this strategy, to call  attention to this strategy, to address the myths that are used to  instill fear and the falsehoods that are used to instill hatred. It is  our job to oppose this authoritarian game plan in every way possible.   The third leg of President Trump's authoritarian attacks are ones  that go against public opposition to him and attack the protests of the  people of the United States. What was the President's response after  millions of people in cities all around the country--and all around the  world, for that matter--joined the women's march to stand up for the  fundamental values of peace, tolerance, and equality? His response was  a rebuke and a dismissal. He tweeted:         Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression       that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote?    Well, President Trump, they did vote, and they all voted  overwhelmingly for your opponent, by a 3 million-vote margin.   We saw similarly disparaging responses from Republican lawmakers like  the Facebook post from a State Senator in Mississippi who said:         So a group of unhappy liberal women marched in Washington,       D.C. We shouldn't be surprised; almost all liberal women are       unhappy.    After countless citizens around the country began showing up at  townhall meetings to make their voices heard, what was his response? He  dismissed these engaged citizens as ``so-called angry crowds,'' and  then he tweeted: ``Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters  are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to make  America great again!''   I have held a lot of townhalls since January, many of them filled  beyond capacity with regular citizens who are deeply distressed by what  they are seeing in our country. At one townhall, more than 3,500 people  showed up. We had so many people that the hundreds of folks who  couldn't get in had to stand outside the building in the cold,  listening. We took a speaker and put it in the window so those outside  could hear, and they watched through the windows.   This is ``we the people'' government. This is American citizens  saying: Your strategy, President Trump, is not OK. Your strategy to  divide us into factions in America and to pit one faction against  another, to demonize groups, to incite hate is just wrong.   I find it truly disheartening to see the President attacking citizens  exercising their voice, which is often the most basic civic duty.   President Jefferson said there is a mother principle for our  government, and the mother principle is that the actions of the  government will only reflect the will of the people if each and every  citizen has an equal voice. We know, in the modern day of campaign  financing, some citizens and, indeed, often some noncitizens--that is,  massive rich corporations--have a very loud voice compared to the  average citizen. So citizens, to compensate, are saying: We are going  to show up. We are going to take our time and our energy and we are  going to join together and we are going to send a lot of emails to  Capitol Hill, a lot of letters to Capitol Hill, but we are also going  to show up in the parks and the streets to  [[Page S1912]]  march in order to say this strategy, this authoritarian strategy, or  this strategy to take away healthcare from millions of Americans is  absolutely unacceptable. And the President somehow is living in a  fantasy world where he thinks they are paid? I don't think so. I don't  think this last weekend, when 800 people showed up at Redmond, OR, to  my townhall, that a single one of them was paid--not a single one.   When we look across the country and we see the 7-year-old who wanted  to be at a townhall because he doesn't want us to cut funding for PBS  in order to build a wall, he wasn't paid, or the Muslim immigrant who  risked his life for our Nation in Afghanistan as a military interpreter  and now wants to know ``Who is going to save me here,'' he wasn't paid.   American citizens are using their voice as designed in our ``we the  people'' Constitution, but in the mind of our President and in the  words of his adviser, Stephen Miller, his powers are very substantial  and will not be questioned, not even by the citizens and voters of this  great Nation.   Well, they are being questioned, massively, by citizens raising their  voices in every possible way.   American citizens everywhere are deeply disturbed by what they are  seeing unfold in our Nation. They fear we are headed down a dark and  dangerous path that will betray the founding principles of our ``we the  people'' government, and they have every right to be anxious and  concerned.   There have been allusions made by a number of experts to Mr. Trump's  actions and the early days of Vladimir Putin's regime and especially  his relentless war with the media. All of these are reasons citizens  are fired up, raising their voices to oppose the authoritarian tactics  of this administration.   While the President seeks to dismiss the legitimacy of these voices,  I stand here today to praise those Americans for standing up, for  taking on their responsibility as citizens to create a powerful,  courageous chorus, a public stand against the authoritarian strategy of  President Trump--his strategy of attacking the media, his strategy of  attacking immigrants, his strategy of attacking refugees, and his  strategy of attacking religious minorities.   A friend sent me a message the other day saying:         I'm more devastated daily. I can't believe the Republicans       are not stopping this, saying something. How can this be       happening? Don't the Republicans see what's happening? I weep       for my kids.    Millions of Americans across the country are feeling those same  fears. It is up to all of us here, imbued with the awesome  responsibility to speak for and represent the people of this Nation, to  stand up against advancing authoritarianism. It is right for us to  fight for a free, open democratic republic, with a ``government of the  people, by the people, for the people.''   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Brandy Boyce, be granted privileges of the floor for the remainder of  the day.
