 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, for his  kind words, for his leadership, and more importantly, for his  friendship.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to also thank the staff of the Financial Services  Committee in the work they have taken on behalf of the people of this  country.   Mr. Speaker, as some of you may know, the Financial Services  Committee has been operating at a breakneck speed in the 115th  Congress. In fact, we have had Financial Services bills on the floor 17  of the last 18 weeks that the House has been in session.   I am proud to highlight that the majority of these bills have been  passed out of this Chamber by strong bipartisan majorities.   Throughout this process, we have demonstrated that the House can find  bipartisan agreement on commonsense measures that will benefit our  constituents.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill that continues this  streak of bipartisanship in the service of Americans back home, H.R.  4061, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act.   My good friend from Maryland, Congressman  John Delaney, and I have  been working this bill for nearly 5 years, with the shared goal of  improving resiliency of our financial system, while protecting  Americans from costly and unnecessary regulations that create barriers  to achieving their financial goals.   By codifying procedures to increase the transparency of the nonbank  systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, designation  process, and providing a chance for nonbank firms to work with their  primary regulators to reduce risks prior to designation, our  legislation achieves this goal.   Mr. Speaker, we must be clear that simply designating more companies  as systemically important financial institutions does not make our  system safer. That is especially true for nonbank firms, like asset  managers and insurers, that don't fit well into the bank-centered  regulatory regime for SIFIs.   Handing down a SIFI designation to a nonbank financial firm is like  using a sledgehammer to catch a butterfly. Not only are you unlikely to  succeed, but you are also likely to destroy the very thing you set out  to protect.   After all, it is the family saving for the downpayment on a home or  retirement or the children's education that suffer when FSOC uses a  heavy-handed regulation of last resort as the primary line of defense  against threats to our economy.   The American Action Forum has found that additional capital  requirements resulting from a SIFI designation of asset management  firms could cost American retirees at least $100,000 in potential  savings over the lifetime of their investment. That is significant.   That is why these reforms included in H.R. 4061 are critical to the  more than 90 million investors who rely on the services of asset  managers to achieve their most important financial goals.                                time  1545    To be sure, FSOC has begun to recognize the benefits of providing  increased transparency and, in 2015, FSOC made welcome reforms to  improve the nonbank SIFI designation process. Many of these are  codified in this bill.   Importantly, our legislation will also give FSOC the authority it  needs to work with primary regulators who have institutional knowledge,  skill, and experience overseeing nonbank firms to address threats to  our economy without jeopardizing our constituents' financial  opportunities.   After 8 years, if we don't take steps to address the obvious  shortcomings of FSOC, like the nonbank designation process, the  regulator intended to protect the financial stability could very well  become the liability.   Again, I am proud to have worked with my colleague and friend,  John  Delaney, on this great bill, and I appreciate the support of Chairman  Hensarling in moving it through committee and now onto the House floor.   This bill does have 58 original cosponsors--29 Democrats, 29  Republicans. It passed out of the Financial Services Committee 45-10.  Our legislation demonstrates that there can be broad bipartisan support  for increased transparency of the FSOC SIFI designation.   I believe we can do even more, and I welcome the opportunity to work  with my colleagues on additional bipartisan reforms beyond those we are  considering today to better address systemic risk by firming up the  cooperative relationship between FSOC and the primary regulator to  ensure substantive engagement that can result in swift resolution of  FSOC's concerns prior to all SIFI designations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
