 Mr. President, over the past several weeks, we have  seen unprecedented obstruction from our colleagues across the aisle.  This made the confirmation of the President's nominees the slowest in  modern history. It has left several key departments without a permanent  secretary at the helm for far too long. What is the point of the  needless delay? What is the point? Our friends are slow-walking votes,  not changing outcomes.   We took several important steps last night to move the nominations  process forward. We confirmed Steve Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary.  After 8 years of failing economic policy, stagnant growth, and a tough  job market, it is clear we need a new direction to get our country back  on track. We need a new direction on regulations--smarter and pro- growth. We need a new direction on taxes--simpler and pro-jobs. If we  are going to accomplish either of those goals, we are going to need new  leadership at the helm of the Treasury Department. Secretary Mnuchin  has real-world understanding of the private sector, and he is ready to  work with both sides to get the economy moving.   Second, we confirmed Dr. David Shulkin as Secretary of Veterans  Affairs. The debt we owe our servicemembers and their families extends  far beyond any program or benefit the government can provide, but  through the VA, we should be doing everything we can to fulfill our  commitments to veterans and their families, like the more than 300,000  veterans who call Kentucky home. Secretary Shulkin will be tasked with  overseeing that our veterans in Kentucky and across the Nation receive  quality and timely care. It is a heavy burden, but he seems up to the  task. The chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Isakson,  has a well-deserved reputation for working tirelessly on behalf of our  veterans, which makes it notable that his committee voted unanimously  to recommend Dr. Shulkin to the Senate and the full Senate confirmed  him unanimously too.   We haven't seen much of that lately.   I am confident that Secretary Shulkin will work with Congress to  build on the progress we have already made in expanding accessibility  and improving accountability at the VA.   Third, I took the necessary procedural steps last night to allow us  to confirm the rest of the nominees on the calendar: Representative  Mick Mulvaney, the nominee for Director of the Office of Management and  Budget, who can help get our Nation back on track fiscally; Scott  Pruitt, the nominee for Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency, who can bring much needed change after 8 years of heavyhanded,  job-killing regulations; Wilbur Ross, nominee for Commerce Secretary,  who can help promote job creation and economic growth; Representative  Ryan Zinke, nominee for Interior Secretary, who can help improve our  Nation's land use and conservation policies; Dr. Ben Carson, nominee  for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who can help reform HUD  to better serve the American people; and Governor Rick Perry, nominee  for Energy Secretary, who can help guide us toward smarter energy  policies to grow our economy and strengthen national security.   Beginning with Representative Mulvaney, we can get each of these  nominees confirmed soon. With cooperation from across the aisle, we can  put them to work for the American people even sooner.   We will be able to put another important nominee to work just this  morning, one who understands how to help businesses flourish. The last  8 years have been very difficult for our economy, for workers, and for  small businesses. I am confident that the President's pick to lead the  Small Business Administration, Linda McMahon, will prioritize growing  jobs over growing government bureaucracy. In so many States, including  mine, that is a welcome change of pace from Washington. Small  businesses help drive America's economy, and they help drive Kentucky's  economy as well. Almost half of all the private sector jobs in  Kentucky--about 700,000--come from the more than 340,000 small  businesses  [[Page S1136]]  across the Commonwealth. These small businesses not only grow the  economy, but they also serve important roles in our communities.   Mrs. McMahon, who has built a company from the ground up, understands  the many challenges small businesses can face. She certainly has come a  long way from sharing a desk with her husband and leasing a typewriter.  I commend her for her willingness to serve her country, and I look  forward to her confirmation later this morning.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 40.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks on Wednesday, February 15, there be 10 minutes of debate  remaining, equally divided, on H.J. Res. 40; that the resolution be  read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the joint  resolution without intervening action or debate; further, that  following disposition of H.J. Res. 40, there be 10 minutes of debate,  equally divided, prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on  Executive Calendar 16, Mick Mulvaney to be the Director of the Office  of Management and Budget, and if cloture is invoked, time be counted as  if invoked at 1 a.m. that day.    Mr. President, there will be no more votes this  evening. We will have two votes tomorrow morning.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 5, H.R. 255.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 6, H.R. 321.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Wednesday, February 15; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use  later in the day; further, that following leader remarks, the Senate  resume consideration of H.J. Res. 40, as under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:59 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
