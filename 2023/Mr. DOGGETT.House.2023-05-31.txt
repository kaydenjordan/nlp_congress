 Mr. Speaker, protecting our country's full faith and  credit requires accepting some unacceptable Republican demands.   As one cartoonist aptly described them, Republicans suffer from a  form of deficit attention disorder. You see, when Republicans are in  charge, they are absolutely obsessed with deficits.   Give them a little power, and their attention--poof. It just  magically vanishes as they begin to deplete the Treasury with tax gifts  for the well connected.   Like their multitrillion-dollar Trump tax giveaway, they are already  planning in coming days to soon borrow more to reward those at the top.   Their boundless affection for tax cheats and for tax expenditures may  increase the debt by even more than the cuts that they make today in  education, healthcare, and environmental protection, which are so  wrong.   As climate deniers, these Republicans sought to repeal our climate  law but were held to one pipeline and a weakening of environmental  review laws, a troubling setback that we can overcome.   We should be leaping forward instead of moving slowly. Ransom paid;  America protected.
