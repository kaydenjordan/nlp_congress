 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of  Detective Jerry Walker of Little Elm, Texas.   Detective Walker was lost in the line of duty last week when he  responded to an emergency call that involved an active shooter. This  great loss has cast a shadow of sadness over our close-knit community.  This is the first time in the city's history that we have lost an  officer in the line of duty.   Detective Walker was a dedicated member of our police force and  community. He was a husband, a father, a mentor, and a friend to many.  I had the privilege of meeting Detective Walker when he was on duty at  one of my townhall meetings in the summer of 2014. His dedication to  protecting the residents of Little Elm was evident in all that he did.   Dallas Cowboys' wide receiver Cole Beasley sums up this loss  precisely saying: ``We lost a good one.''   Our town of Little Elm continues to mourn the loss of one of our  heroes. His service to our community will not be forgotten.   I extend my deepest sympathy to Detective Walker's family and will  continue to keep them in my prayers.                            ____________________
