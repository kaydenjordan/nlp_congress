 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R. 3922, a  partisan bill to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program,  or CHIP, as well as community health centers and other public health  programs.   It pains me to be here today, because this should not be a partisan  bill. I have tried for months to negotiate with Republicans to develop  a bipartisan compromise, but House Republicans chose to spend the first  9 months of this year trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They  failed, but now House Republicans are using the reauthorization of CHIP  and community health centers as a way to once again sabotage the ACA.    Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker: if Republicans can't repeal the ACA  outright, they will cripple it any time they can.   This time, Republicans are risking the healthcare of nearly 9 million  children and the care of families all around the country that use  community health centers. They are risking that care because this  partisan bill has no chance of ever becoming law.   By taking this route, Republicans are guaranteeing that CHIP and  community health centers will not be reauthorized until the end of the  year, and that is extremely unfortunate.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support CHIP, our community health centers,  and all of our public health programs that are extended in this bill.  These programs have traditionally been bipartisan, but the bill before  us extends these programs by taking billions of dollars away from the  Affordable Care Act and undermining Medicare.   In short, this Republican bill offers a false choice. On one hand, it  strips healthcare away from upwards of 680,000 Americans and guts the  Prevention Fund, which pays for immunization and vaccines, lead  poisoning prevention, opioid treatment, and many other important  programs; on other hand, it reauthorizes these important programs.  Democrats strongly support reauthorization of these programs, but we  reject the way Republicans are paying for them.   Mr. Speaker, there are so many other policies that save money,  countless alternatives that Democrats have offered to Republicans for  months. Yesterday I offered an alternative that would have provided a  robust reauthorization and extension of these important programs, and  it was paid for in a commonsense way.   My alternative would have changed the timing of payments to Medicare  Advantage Plans. This approach was recommended by both the GAO and the  Office of the Inspector General, but Republicans rejected it in the  Rules Committee. They wouldn't even allow it to come before the full  House for a vote. And why is because they would rather use  reauthorization of CHIP and community health centers as another way to  sabotage the Affordable Care Act.   I simply reject that approach and strongly urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is the ultimate absurdity for my colleague, the  chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, to suggest that somehow  I control when a bill comes to the floor of the House of  Representatives.   The only reason that the Republicans ever delayed bringing this vote  to the floor is because they know and I know that, if this bill is  partisan, it will  [[Page H8459]]  never become law. It will go to the Senate, and it will sit there, and  the only way that it is going to become law is if it is a bipartisan  effort that actually accomplishes something and gets most people to  support it.   We could keep listening to the other side all day say: Oh, the  Democrats delayed the vote. The Democrats delayed the vote.   The vote shouldn't be held today. The vote should be delayed today  because this is going nowhere. This bill is going nowhere. They know  it. You want to keep saying it? You can say it all day for the next  hour, but it is the ultimate of absurdity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene  Green), who is the ranking member of our Health Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), the ranking member of our Oversight  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), the vice ranking member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Vermont (Mr. Welch).    I yield the gentleman from Vermont an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The bottom line is, when you start cutting money from the Prevention  Fund, you are cutting prevention programs for kids, adults, the  disabled, and, most importantly, the opiates.   CDC spends a significant amount of money from the Prevention Fund  dealing with the opiate crisis, so don't tell me that somehow this is  okay. You are taking money away from opiate prevention. You are taking  money away from kids programs like lead poisoning and vaccines. It is  unbelievable how much is actually going to be lost from the Prevention  Fund because of this bill.   I am not interested in what happened in the past. I want to know what  is going to happen in the future. We have an opiate crisis. Don't take  money away from the Prevention Fund that is used to deal with that  crisis.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to talk about this use of the Prevention  Fund. Democrats have never supported the type of drastic cuts to the  Prevention Fund that is in this proposal today. In fact, when faced  with such cuts, we voted ``no'' nine times. In the two cases where we  voted in favor of using some of the Prevention Fund as an offset,  neither cut placed the CDC programs and efforts at risk as this  legislation does today.   The Republican proposal would cut the Prevention Fund nearly in half  and leave a $400 million hole in funding for prevention and health  programs within the CDC's budget beginning in 2019. This cut would be  devastating to local, State and Federal efforts to protect the Nation's  health.   Unlike my Republican counterparts, what they contend, this cut to  these programs would not be made up in the annual appropriations  process, as evidenced by the proposed cut of $198 million to the CDC in  the House Republican fiscal year 2018 appropriations bill, and the  decrease of $580 million in CDC funding since 2010 when adjusted for  inflation.   Again, you talk about opiates, you talk about children's health  programs. These would be drastically cut because of what they are doing  today to the Prevention Fund.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McNerney).    =========================== NOTE ===========================        November 3, 2017, on page H8462, the following appeared: 1\1/2\  minutes to gentleman California      The online version has been corrected to read: 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from California    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Velazquez).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to stress again that one of the pay-fors that the  Republicans don't talk about much is the fact that they are reducing  the grace period from 90 days to 30 days. So if someone misses a  payment on their insurance, they currently have 90 days to make up for  it. Under this bill, they will only have 30 days.   Now, the CBO estimates that over 500,000 people will lose their  health insurance and have to reapply for next year because of this  reduction in the grace period. I know my colleague from the other side  says: Well, that is too bad because they have the responsibility to pay  it.   But the fact of the matter is that a lot of people have a hard time  paying their monthly premium, and we should not be passing legislation  that ends up with half-a-million people losing their health insurance.   Again, this is a way to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. The  Affordable Care Act is trying to make more people covered, and has  succeeded in covering 95 percent of the people in this country.   Why in the world would we use a pay-for that cuts back on half-a- million people who would lose their health insurance?   I want to emphasize, Mr. Speaker, we did not have to be here today.  We could have done a bipartisan bill without sabotaging the Affordable  Care Act. That is what concerns me most, Mr. Speaker. The Republicans  tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They failed, and now they are  trying to repeal it piece by piece.   The pay-fors that are in this legislation are unfair to the American  people. The Prevention Fund is used for opiate prevention and used for  kids for various programs. Don't cut back on that to pay for these  other things.   The grace period--half-a-million Americans are going to lose their  insurance because of the cutbacks in the grace period--another effort  to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.   Lastly, and probably even most important, again, the Republicans are  going against the Medicare program. They are trying to make cuts in the  Medicare program and restructure the Medicare program in a way that I  believe will hurt the Medicare program, reduce the amount of people in  the insurance pool, and ultimately lead to higher costs for middle  class and lower-income seniors and the disabled in the Medicare  program.   I urge my colleagues: Don't let the Republicans continue to sabotage  the Affordable Care Act. We could have done this on a bipartisan basis.  Passing this bill today does nothing for the Children's Health  Initiative or for community health centers because this bill is going  nowhere. It will end up in the Senate. The Senate will not take it up,  and we will be waiting around until Christmas to actually find a way to  fund these programs and put these programs at risk. Vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
