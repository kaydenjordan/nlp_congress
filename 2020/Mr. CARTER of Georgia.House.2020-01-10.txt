 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Vic  Power, who retired as the owner of Kevin Barry's Irish Pub in Savannah  on December 31, 2019.   Kevin Barry's Irish Pub was not only a stalwart of locally owned  business in downtown Savannah, but also an excellent representation of  Irish heritage in our city.   Although Irish individuals have been calling Savannah home since its  founding, the Irish potato famine in the mid-1800s caused an influx of  migration to Savannah. By 1860, one in three White households could  claim Irish heritage.   Today, Savannah has one of the largest St. Patrick's Day parades in  the  [[Page H153]]  world. This is why it is fitting that, when Kevin Barry's Irish Pub  opened in Savannah in 1980, it was the first Irish pub south of  Washington, D.C., to offer live music 7 days a week.   With its live Irish music, cozy interior, topnotch customer service,  and quality food, it quickly became a mainstay. In 2016, Kevin Barry's  even won an award for being the most authentic Irish pub outside of  Ireland.   With Mr. Power's retirement, Kevin Barry's will be sorely missed.   We congratulate Mr. Power on his retirement. We thank him for letting  all Savannahians and visitors, alike, enjoy Kevin Barry's for the last  40 years.                            ____________________
