 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this gun bill today.  After decades of inaction and too many innocent lives lost to senseless  gun violence, this is a step we must all take.   It will provide needed resources for violence intervention, school  safety, mental health funding, community violence intervention and  prevention initiatives, school safety, and yes, enhanced background  checks to make it harder for 18- to 21-year-olds to get guns, and it  will close the boyfriend loop.   To everybody who is saying no, go tell that to the children and  families that lost lives. This bill will keep dangerous weapons out of  the hands of people. Go tell your ``no'' vote to the families and the  children who lost lives.   The compromise bill today, it is not perfect, but it will help us  save lives. I am proud that the Congressional Black Caucus had a large  role to play in this. I thank Congresswomen McBath and Kelly and  Congressman Horsford for their support. Our power, our message.
