 Mr. President, January is National Slavery and Human  Trafficking Prevention Month. In a recent proclamation, President Trump  continued what President Obama had begun in making this the ninth  annual year where we designate our first month of the year to awareness  and prevention of trafficking, awareness and prevention of this crime  against humanity.   President Trump issued a call to action. The proclamation said, in  part:         Human trafficking is a modern form of the oldest and most       barbaric type of exploitation. It has no place in our world.       This month, we do not simply reflect on this appalling       reality. We also pledge to do all in our power to end the       horrific practice of human trafficking that plagues innocent       victims around the world.    Amen. I commend the President for his strong stance, and I commend  the U.S. Senate for the work we have done over the past several years,  in a bipartisan way, to help combat trafficking. We made some progress.   About 6 years ago, Senator Blumenthal--who will speak about this  topic later on the floor--and I cofounded the Senate Caucus to End  Human Trafficking and legislation since that time to increase penalties  on people buying sex from children; stop international trafficking by  U.S. Government contractors overseas; find missing children more  quickly--the most vulnerable among us--by ensuring that their  photographs and other identifiers are available; improve data on  trafficking to find out what the problem is, where it is going; and, of  course, change the paradigm--treat children who are exploited as  victims rather than, as they have been treated over the years, as  criminals.   We have made some progress in these areas, but I have to tell you,  despite these efforts and despite the increasing awareness of the fact  that trafficking occurs right here in this country, in all of our  States, we now know that one form, at least, of sex trafficking is  actually increasing in our country. Think about that. It is increasing  in this country, in this century. What experts say when you ask them  about it is that is primarily because of one reason; that is, the fact  that the internet is being used to sell sex.   By the way, doing it on the internet, it turns out, occurs with  ruthless efficiency. Victims I have visited across Ohio tell me,  including one this past Friday in Ohio: Rob, it has moved from the  street corner to the iPhone, from the street corner to the cell phone,  from the street corner to the internet.   There was discussion earlier from my colleague from New York about  the role opioids play in causing harm in our society. Of course, the  internet combined with opioids is deadly. The young woman I met with on  Friday was one of those who had become addicted to opioids--in her  case, fentanyl, which is an incredibly powerful, dangerous drug--and  depended on her trafficker to be able to provide that. That is one form  of dependency you see in sex trafficking. And again, online is where  people are increasingly being bought and sold.   This increase in sex trafficking is a stain on our national  character. It is only Congress that has the power to stop it.   There is one website--backpage.com--that is the leader in online sex  trafficking. They have knowingly sold underage girls online. I say that  because we have done an investigation, and we determined that. We now  know from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that  backpage.com is involved in nearly 75 percent of all child trafficking  reports the organization receives from the public.   The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, along  with then-ranking member Claire McCaskill and now-ranking member Tom  Carper, has conducted an extensive, 18-month investigation into online  sex trafficking and specifically backpage.com. We found that  backpage.com knowingly facilitated criminal sex trafficking of  vulnerable women and young children. It coached the traffickers on how  to edit adult classified ads to post so-called clean ads for illegal  transactions, and then it covered up evidence of these crimes in order  to increase its profits. All this was done at the cost of human  suffering--and sometimes human life--with the sole purpose of  increasing the company's profits.   In the fall, I testified on this issue in front of the Senate  Commerce Committee--about our legislation. With me at the witness table  was Yvonne Ambrose, a mother whose 16-year-old daughter, Desiree, was  found murdered on Christmas Eve 2016 after being sold for sex on  backpage.   Desiree's death should never have happened--and neither should online  sex trafficking of minors happen at all--but this tragic trend is  compounded by the fact that backpage has evaded justice for its role in  these tragic crimes. Courts across the country have consistently ruled  that a Federal law--and this is why Congress has such a key role to  play here--called the Communications Decency Act actually protects  backpage and others from the liability they should have in sex  trafficking.   The Communications Decency Act is a well-intentioned law originally  enacted back in 1996, when the internet was in its infancy, and it was  meant to protect third-party websites from being held liable for crimes  that users might commit on those websites. Ironically, part of the  original intention of the Communications Decency Act was to protect  children from indecent material on the internet by holding liable users  who send explicit material to children. Now this same law is being used  as a shield by cynical sex traffickers who promote and engage in online  underage sex trafficking with immunity, thanks to this Federal law.   Congress didn't intend for this broad immunity in the law--I am  convinced of that--but numerous courts across the country have made it  clear that their hands are tied because of the legal precedent that has  been formed. As the lawmaking branch of the Federal Government, it is  up to Congress to fix this injustice. No one else can do it.   In the most blatant call for congressional action I have seen yet, in  August of last year, a Sacramento judge cited the broad immunity  provided by the Communications Decency Act in dismissing pimping  charges against backpage.com. The court opinion stated:         If and until Congress sees fit to amend the immunity law,       the broad reach of Section 230  [[Page S53]]       of the Communications Decency Act even applies to those       alleged to support the exploitations of others by human       trafficking.    That is an invitation to Congress to act. It is clearly up to  Congress to act. It is past time we update this 21-year-old law for the  21st century and allow victims who have had their most basic human  rights violated to get justice against those who facilitate these  crimes.   We have an opportunity this month during National Human Trafficking  Prevention Month to fix this. We can and we must.   The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA, is a bill I  introduced with my bipartisan colleagues--Senator Blumenthal, who will  speak later this afternoon, and Senators John McCain, Claire McCaskill,  John Cornyn, Heidi Heitkamp, Amy Klobuchar, and 18 other colleagues. As  of this morning, that legislation has 64 cosponsors. It is totally  bipartisan, supported by both sides of the aisle. It is popular: 64 out  of 100 have already cosponsored it because it will fix this injustice  with two very narrowly crafted changes to the Communications Decency  Act.    First, it will allow victims to get the justice they deserve by  removing the Communications Decency Act's broad liability protections  the judge discussed, specifically for websites that knowingly  facilitate sex trafficking crimes.   Second, it will allow State attorneys general to prosecute these  websites that violate Federal sex trafficking laws. These changes will  hold bad actors like backpage accountable while doing nothing to impair  the free internet. In fact, they will protect websites that do not  actively and knowingly engage in online sex trafficking.   The ``knowing'' standard is a high bar to meet. The California  attorney general, Xavier Becerra, testified at the Senate Commerce  Committee about that this fall. He said:         We have to prove criminal intent. We can't win a       prosecution unless we can show the individuals we're       prosecuting, like Backpage, had the intent--the knowledge--to       do what they're doing. The legislation we have before you is       very narrowly tailored. It goes only after sex trafficking.    The Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act passed the Senate Commerce  Committee by a vote that was unanimous. It was bipartisan. It was  unanimous, and the legislation has the support of an extraordinary  coalition of law enforcement organizations, anti-trafficking advocates,  trafficking victims, survivors, faith-based groups, and even some major  tech players, although some in the tech community continue to be  concerned. This includes the Internet Association, which now represents  companies such as Facebook, reddit, Amazon, and others. It was endorsed  by businesses, including Oracle, 21st Century Fox, Hewlett-Packard  Enterprise, and the Walt Disney Company. Other companies such as IBM  and others have stepped up to support it.   Last year, 50 attorneys general across this country wrote a letter  calling on Congress to amend the Communications Decency Act in the  exact way we are proposing in this bill--50.   Again, in the Senate, a bipartisan group of 64 Senators has now  cosponsored the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. Those 60-plus  cosponsors are significant because 60 is how many votes we need in the  U.S. Senate if there are objections to the legislation to be able to  get it passed. We already have that many Senators who have now put  their names down. They said they want to be part of the solution to  this tragic problem. They want to stop this increase in sex trafficking  that unconscionably is happening in this country in this century.   So we shouldn't wait any longer to pass this bill in the Senate.  Every day we do, those who sell women and children will be allowed to  continue that, continue to profit, and victims will continue to be  denied justice.   It is not an issue of politics or partisanship. It is about  preventing exploitation and providing justice. I am hoping we can have  a vote on this bill in the Senate this month, during National Slavery  and Human Trafficking Prevention Month. This Thursday is National Human  Trafficking Awareness Day. I urge the leadership to have the bill on  the floor as soon as possible. We have every reason to act and no  reason not to.   These victims deserve justice, and Congress should help provide it.  Passing the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act is an opportunity.   Thank you.   I yield back my time.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.
