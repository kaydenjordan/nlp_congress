 Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition, although I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, first, I want to commend the gentlewoman from  New York for her work on this. I think it is a great idea to have paid  interns at the Ex-Im Bank. The sad part is it is not going to happen  because this bill is not going to become law.   Republicans agreed unanimously to support a bipartisan compromise,  the Waters-McHenry bipartisan deal on Ex-Im Bank, that would have  actually reauthorized the Ex-Im Bank and done it in a bipartisan way.   Unfortunately, we are here on a partisan process. I have always  supported the Ex-Im Bank. I signed the discharge petition last time for  the Ex-Im Bank, but I can't support this product.   Luckily, we have a path forward through the appropriations process,  and we will be reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank on the CR.   I think this general idea is a good idea, and I hope the gentlewoman  will push it in the version that gets in the CR because this version,  unfortunately, Mitch McConnell has said is dead in the Senate and it is  under a veto threat.   So I do encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, but,  unfortunately, it is not going to become law.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0930     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition, although I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I am going to sound like a broken record  here, but Republicans have supported, unanimously, a bill that was  bipartisan, the Waters-McHenry deal that would have reauthorized the  Bank. Unfortunately, we are not here debating that. We have a much more  partisan version in front of us.   I agree with the gentlewoman from New York, and I thank her for her  work on a diverse workforce at the Export-Import Bank. Our community  colleges do an incredible job. Having several community colleges in my  district, I want to recognize them.  [[Page H8887]]    I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition, although I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I want to, again, remind everybody that  Republicans unanimously voted for a bipartisan version of Ex-Im  authorization, the Waters-McHenry bipartisan compromise. Unfortunately,  that deal isn't on the floor. We have a version that is under a veto  threat and that the Senate says is dead on arrival.   While this amendment is great to add our colleges and community  colleges to the advisory board, it is not going to become law. Luckily,  we do have a path forward through the appropriations process, and I  hope my colleague from New York will be talking to not only the  Financial Services Committee staff but the Appropriations Committee  staff to get this in the version that will become law through the CR.   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. It is too bad it  is not going to become law in this version because it is dead on  arrival in the Senate and under a veto threat. But I do hope that the  gentlewoman works through the appropriations process to make this  amendment happen because our colleges and universities can add a lot to  the advisory board at the Ex-Im.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
