 Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about DREAMers  today, and we will continue to hear that.   Let us note that we are talking about inviting millions of people to  send their children to the United States, millions from around this  hemisphere who live in poverty and oppression, and we are saying: If  you can get your kids to the United States, they are going to be taken  care of.   We have limited resources here, limited in the Federal Government.  Our people of every race and every religion and every ethnic group that  make up the American family deserve to know that we are caring about  them--I am sorry--rather than the children in other countries that come  here illegally.   We can expect a flood of new young people if we legalize this, and  they will be consuming the healthcare dollars. They will be consuming  the education dollars that should go to American children.   This is not being selfish by saying take care of your family first.  The American family deserves our attention and our support. We should  not be extracting resources, bidding down their wages, extracting the  resources of education and healthcare for people who have come here  illegally and invite more people to flood into our country.   No, the DREAMers concept is a nightmare for American young people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank you very much for providing me  this time. I rise in opposition to this rule, which prohibits a vote of  the House of Representatives on an amendment that would prevent the  Department of Justice from using its power and resources to supersede  all State laws that have legalized the medical use of cannabis.   For 3 years, States have been shielded from having the will of their  voters and their people by a prohibition on the Department of Justice  that would prevent the Department of Justice from thwarting the will of  the people of the States by superceding those State laws when they have  determined in the States that the medical use of marijuana should be  permitted with their citizens.   The Rules Committee has, thus, been basically--it will be changing  the law of the land for 3 years where the 50 States have been  permitted, if they so chose, to have the medical use of marijuana.   After this vote, because of this rule, we have been prevented from  again providing that prohibition that passed this House on a number of  occasions that would prohibit the Department of Justice from  superceding State law. In short, a vote for this rule is anti-States'  rights. A vote for this rule is against permitting the people of your  State to legalize the medical use of marijuana if the Federal  Government, if the DOJ, decides.   A vote for this rule will, thus, prevent medical use of cannabis by  our doctors in States that would like to permit their people to benefit  from illegal use of medical marijuana. Instead, those doctors now will,  as they have been, prescribing opiates. That is right, opiates. Our  people have ended up being prescribed opiates because marijuana has not  been an option.   It is a vote to cut off our veterans, and our seniors with arthritis,  those people who have children who are plagued with seizures, all of  these things now are permitted in the States where they have legalized  the medical use of marijuana. These people are provided an avenue to at  least try this as a method of dealing with these horrible maladies that  they have to deal with in their lives, whether they are seizures, or  whether they are people who have arthritis, or whether they are our  veterans who are coming back.   We need to make sure that the billions of dollars that right now are  being invested in medical marijuana businesses and clinics throughout  our country, those billions of dollars will go to the benefit of our  people. Instead, this rule prevents us from standing in the way of the  Justice Department from obliterating those rights in the States.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, so a vote against this rule is a vote  to permit those States to make that decision. The rule, as it is now,  prevents us from getting in the way of the Justice Department's  obliteration of these rights.   But one of the most important things, whether it is States' rights,  or whether it is trying to listen to the seniors who are begging for us  to give them some relief from some of their suffering and let them at  least try this if the doctors so prescribe, but let us just remember  this: that billions of dollars, $3 billion or $4 billion have been  invested in this industry to provide honest businessmen and doctors the  right to try medical marijuana on some of these maladies.   Those $3 billion will immediately be transferred to the drug cartels  in Mexico if this rule goes through. That is what it means. Now, I  would suggest that whether it is opiates, or the drug lords down in  Mexico, we need to side with the States' rights to make this  determination and decide--and to make our determination to let the  people decide in those States and let them have the choice there.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule for those reasons.
