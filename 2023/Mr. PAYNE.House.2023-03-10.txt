 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support President Biden's new  2024 budget proposal.   This budget is just what the country needs to move forward. It  includes caps on insulin payments to $35 for all Americans. It restores  the enhanced child tax credit and provides up to $3,600 per family per  child. It contains $4.5 billion for infrastructure projects. It has  $700 million for the Hudson River tunnel and Gateway Program, and it  includes $219 million to eliminate lead pipes from drinking water  around the country.   This budget represents strong leadership, and it supports investments  in the future of American prosperity. I am proud to support President  Biden's new budget.   Now we need Speaker McCarthy to show the same responsibility and  leadership with his budget proposal.                            ____________________
