 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 461) to strengthen the capacity and competitiveness of historically  Black colleges and universities through robust public-sector, private- sector, and  [[Page H6878]]  community partnerships and engagement, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 461         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``HBCU Propelling Agency       Relationships Towards a New Era of Results for Students Act''       or the ``HBCU PARTNERS Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) As many colleges and universities across the country       kept their doors closed to African American applicants,       historically Black colleges and universities (referred to in       this section as ``HBCUs'') played a central role in ensuring       that African Americans could attain an excellent education.        (2) Today, HBCUs continue to play a critical role in       ensuring that African Americans, and those of all races, can       access high-quality educational opportunities.        (3) HBCUs enroll nearly 300,000 students, an estimated 70       percent of whom come from low-income backgrounds and 80       percent of whom are African American.        (4) According to the National Association For Equal       Opportunity In Higher Education (referred to in this section       as ``NAFEO''), HBCUs make up just 3 percent of American       institutions of higher education but serve more than a fifth       of African American college students.        (5) According to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund       (referred to in this section as ``TMCF''), approximately 9       percent of all African American college students attend       HBCUs.        (6) A March 2017 report from the Education Trust concluded       that HBCUs have higher completion rates for African American       students than other institutions serving similar student       populations.        (7) According to TMCF, 40 percent of African American       Members of Congress, 50 percent of African American lawyers,       and 80 percent of African American judges are graduates of       HBCUs.        (8) According to NAFEO, HBCUs graduate approximately 50       percent of African American public school teaching       professionals.        (9) According to the United Negro College Fund (referred to       in this section as ``UNCF''), African American graduates of       HBCUs are almost twice as likely as African Americans who       graduated from other institutions to report that their       university prepared them well for life.        (10) According to a study commissioned by UNCF, in 2014,       HBCUs generated a total direct economic impact of       $14,800,000,000 and created more than 134,000 jobs.        (11) According to a 2019 report produced by the American       Council on Education and UNCF, despite efforts to counter a       historical legacy of inequitable funding and notable       investments by the Federal Government and many State       governments, resource inequities continue to plague HBCUs.        (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to strengthen the capacity and competitiveness of HBCUs       to fulfill their principal mission of equalizing educational       opportunity, as described in section 301(b) of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1051(b));        (2) to align HBCUs with the educational and economic       competitiveness priorities of the United States;        (3) to provide students enrolled at HBCUs with the highest       quality educational and economic opportunities;        (4) to bolster and facilitate productive interactions       between HBCUs and Federal agencies; and        (5) to encourage HBCU participation in and benefit from       Federal programs, grants, contracts, and cooperative       agreements.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on S. 461, the HBCU PARTNERS Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of S. 461, the HBCU PARTNERS Act, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, today is a special day for bipartisanship and for  equity, access, and inclusion.   For centuries, this country has made promises to the African-American  community that have gone largely unmet: promises of freedom, promises  of justice, and promises of equal opportunity.   So, today, we vote for a fighting chance to rectify this history and  the impacts it has had on the Black community. Today, we vote to give  HBCUs and the communities they serve a real permanent seat at the table  with the President of the United States and our Nation's Federal  agencies.   You see, like the people of color they serve, HBCUs are embedded in  the fabric of this Nation and they play a vital role in its prosperity.  While countless other institutions have often fallen short, HBCUs have  long been the means of delivering on our Nation's promise of freedom  and opportunity for all, especially for communities of color.   For generations, these schools have fought to deliver for African  Americans what is owed to them, a first-class education and a fair shot  at pursuing happiness.   While only representing roughly 3 percent of all 4-year colleges and  universities, HBCUs produce upwards of 17 percent of all bachelor's  degrees awarded to African Americans. HBCU graduates account for 42  percent of all Black engineers and 47 percent of all Black female  engineers.   What is more, these institutions produce 27 percent of all African- American STEM graduates, 50 percent of all African-American lawyers, 50  percent of all African-American public schoolteachers, and 80 percent  of all African-American judges.   Further, research has found that HBCUs are more successful at  boosting students out of the lowest income distributions than other  institutions of higher education.   In fact, nearly 70 percent of students of HBCUs attain at least  middle class incomes after graduation, including nearly 70 percent of  low-income students.   On an annual basis, HBCUs contribute nearly $15 billion to the  economy, produce 134,000 jobs, and create $46.8 billion in alumni  career earnings that can be directly attributed to their degrees.   HBCUs are clearly centers of advancement and excellence in this  country. It is important to note that this incredible success has been  achieved despite over a century of systemic underfunding at both the  State and Federal levels.   That is why my bill, the HBCU PARTNERS Act, is so very crucial. This  legislation will require every administration and the Federal agencies  it manages to plan and coordinate, on an annual basis, their efforts to  strategically engage in investing in HBCUs.   This bill also strengthens the rigor and transparency requirements of  existing law, requiring that agencies track their progress toward goals  concerning HBCUs and share their plans to advance them with Congress.   In addition, it codifies the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs,  ensuring an ongoing avenue for HBCU priorities and policy concerns to  be raised and addressed.   In other words, this legislation provides us with an opportunity to  commit to HBCUs in the same way they have committed to the well-being  and prosperity of our country. And in a very real way, it provides us  with a chance to try to honor our Nation's promises.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Smucker) for his kind remarks and support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), the chairman of the Committee on Education & Labor and a  tremendous supporter of education.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to thank both of the gentlemen for their support of this  bill.   Clearly, I have to put on the record, as I continue to do, that I am  a proud two-time graduate of an HBCU, North Carolina A&T State  University, and I spent 40 years teaching at an HBCU in Greensboro,  North Carolina, Bennett College. It was an HBCU that made a committed  investment in me as I prepared to come to college and molded and shaped  me into what they knew I could become.   Mr. Speaker, despite limited means, HBCUs have always generously  served their communities because they understand the critical role that  they play in advancing equity and access. They build on the philosophy  of W.E.B. DuBois, who talked about education and said: ``Of all the  civil rights for which the world has struggled and fought for 5,000  years, the right to learn is undoubtedly the most fundamental.''   The HBCU PARTNERS Act recognizes these fundamental rights and these  contributions in the most important way possible, by affording these  institutions the ongoing support and investment needed to deepen their  transformational work.   Advancing the mission of HBCUs and the prosperity of the communities  they serve must be on the minds of our country's leaders. More  importantly, it must be part of their agendas.   If America wants to deliver on its promises of equal opportunity for  all, investing in HBCUs is certainly one of the most important ways to  do so.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
