 Mr. President, I understand that shortly we will be  considering a motion to discharge S.J. Res. 51 from the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, and I take this time to urge my colleagues to vote  against that motion to discharge.   I understand the concerns of my colleague from Kentucky about  ensuring that Congress exercises the appropriate role in authorizing  the use of military force. I appreciate the Senator's longstanding  interest in these important matters.   I value having what I believe are critically important debates about  when and under what authorities U.S. troops serve abroad. Decisions  about authorizing the use of military force are among the most solemn  duties we have in this body. But here, the decision is not so simple as  the Senator from Kentucky presents it.   The Middle East is unstable right now. I don't have to remind my  colleagues about that. ISIS's territorial caliphate might have been  defeated, but it remains a threat to Syrians, Iraqis, and to U.S.  interests. Now is not the time to withdraw from the region, but that is  what this joint resolution would do without weighing the consequences,  without a plan.   Think about what impact it would have. Think about what it would do  to the resolve of our NATO allies and Kurdish partners fighting ISIS  alongside the United States. We are not there alone; we are part of a  coalition. Will they stick it out if we don't?   Think about how this would hurt the Syrian people. Without U.S.  presence, civilians would be caught between ISIS and the Assad regime.  Think about the ISIS terrorist cells that would have free reign to  expand their operations in Syria. They will use it as a base to attack  Iraq, where just last week they killed 11 innocent people.   Think about what a gift this would be to the Assad regime, who has  committed atrocities, aided and abetted by Russia and Iran. The regime  would strengthen its control of Syria, putting at risk the very people  who fought side by side with the United States, people who would be  subjected to the Assad regime's industrial-scale system of torture and  murder.   Then there are the Assad backers--Russia and Iran. Putin wants the  Middle East to descend into chaos and distract the world from his war  in Ukraine. Iran's longstanding strategic objective has been to push  the United States out of the region. We see it in proxy attacks on U.S.  facilities and on global shipping.   Not only would pulling U.S. troops out of Syria be a propaganda win  for Iran, it would be a strategic victory. It would make it easier for  Iran to move weapons through Syria to Hezbollah. Do we want Hezbollah  to have more weapons aimed at our ally Israel right now? We don't want  to see an escalation of the conflict.   At a time when the administration is working to prevent the Gaza  conflict from spilling over, this would be the wrong thing for us to  do. The last thing we want is the conflict in Israel and Gaza to expand  across the region.   For all of those reasons, I would urge my colleagues to vote against  the motion to discharge S.J. Res. 51 if that motion is made by my  colleague from Kentucky.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [[Page S5845]]                                                     Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

The       proposed sale will improve Spain's capability to meet current       and future threats by increasing its stocks of AMRAAMs for       its fighter aircraft fleets and air defense in support of its       national defense, and will further strengthen       interoperability with the United States.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States by supporting the security and defense needs of a NATO       Ally which is an important force for political stability and       economic progress in Europe.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology:        The Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile-Extended Range       (AMRAAM-ER) variant utilizes an AIM-120C-7 or C-8 seeker and       warhead joined with a new control section and rocket rotor       (for surface launch mode applications). This provides       extended range and altitude as well as higher speed and       maneuverability. Common Munitions Built-in-Test (BIT)/      Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE) is support equipment.        The Instrumented Test Vehicle (ITV) is a captive carry test       vehicle used primarily for flight test integration. The ITV       verifies and assesses the aircraft's ability to safely       support an AMRAAM launch through the aircraft interface       mechanism and the aircraft datalink antenna.        The Sensitivity of Technology Statement contained in the       original notification applies to additional items reported       here.  [[Page S5847]]         The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.

This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of an important regional partner. The UAE is a       vital U.S. partner for political stability and economic       progress in the Middle East.        The proposed sale will support efforts to protect critical       infrastructure and high value civilian assets, as well as       military installations and forces from rocket, artillery, and       mortar (RAM) and unmanned aerial system threats. It will also       further enhance the United States--UAE relationship, both       politically and militarily, while also increasing the UAE's       effectiveness in executing military and civil defense       operations that promote U.S. national interests. The UAE will       use the TPQ-50 radars to recognize incoming threats from       hostile nations or agents of adversary nations. The United       Arab Emirates will have no difficulty absorbing this       equipment and services into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be SRC Inc, Syracuse, NY.       There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection       with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       permanent assignment of any additional U.S. Government or       contractor representatives to the UAE. Temporary periods of       travel for two-week durations for both U.S. Government and       contractor personnel will be necessary to conduct Operator/      Maintainer training, as well as System Integration & Check       Out (SICO)/Quality Assurance and Testing (QUAT) activities.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-52       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AN/TPQ-50 Radar System--man portable version--      provides continuous 360-degree surveillance and 3-9D rocket,       artillery, and mortar (RAM) locations using a L band non-      rotating antenna with fixed elevation beams and which is       electronically steered in azimuth only. Its full azimuth       coverage allows it to simultaneously detect and track       multiple rounds fired from separate locations within a 700       square kilometer surveillance area. The AN/TPQ 50 radar       provides Point of Origin (POO) and Point of Impact (POI)       locations for hostile RAM fire and tracking of air breathing       targets (ABTs) in air surveillance (AS) and multi-mission       radar (MMR) modes.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the United Arab       Emirates can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the       U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined       in the Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the United Arab Emirates.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this past Friday, December 1, we marked  the 35th anniversary of World AIDS Day. World AIDS Day serves as a  reminder of the global struggle to end AIDS, an opportunity to honor  those we have lost while supporting those who are living with or at  risk of the HIV virus, and as a unifying call to continue working  toward a day when HIV is no longer stigmatized or a public health  threat.   Thirty-five years ago this year, World AIDS Day was established,  marking the first international day for global health. Since then,  World AIDS Day has adopted targeted themes to raise awareness and  encourage international cooperation. This year's theme in the United  States, ``Remember and Commit,'' focuses on paying tribute to those we  have lost to HIV/AIDS, emphasizing our collective responsibility to  act. Through remembrance, we draw strength and determination to  redouble our efforts in fighting this global crisis and support those  living with HIV both here and abroad. The 2023 campaign reminds us that  each one of us can make a difference while promoting the importance of  compassion, empathy, and solidarity in the face of adversity. And it  reminds us that as citizens of the world, the United States must  continue to provide a helping hand to countries less fortunate than  ours in bringing an end to the AIDS pandemic.   Since the first cases of AIDS were reported in the U.S. in June 1981,  more than 700,000 people in the U.S. have died from HIV-related  illnesses. In 2021, over 36,000 people were diagnosed with HIV in the  U.S., and more than 1.1 million people in our country are currently  living with this virus, with  [[Page S5848]]  many more at risk of HIV infection. In 2021, there were 32,100  estimated new HIV infections in the U.S. My home State of Maryland is  not immune; during 2022, 751 Marylanders over 13 years old were newly  diagnosed with HIV, and over 31,000 Marylanders were living with the  disease.   Recent data show that minority populations continue to remain  disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. In 2021, Black Americans  accounted for 40 percent of HIV diagnoses, while Hispanic/Latino  Americans accounted for 29 percent of HIV diagnoses. We must work  harder to address persistent health inequities and end the disparities  in access to prevention, care, and treatment.   World AIDS Day reminds us that HIV is not just a medical issue. It is  a human rights issue. Criminalization, discrimination, and social  stigmas continue to impact the most vulnerable populations across the  globe. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the United States proudly invests  the majority of our global HIV spending, violence and discrimination  against women and girls continues to fuel the epidemic. Children who  are orphaned or otherwise affected by HIV face a range of challenges  from child labor, to the worst forms of exploitation.   Fortunately, thanks to scientific advances, the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration--FDA--has now approved more than 30 medicines to treat  HIV infection, including the new class of antiretroviral drugs, which  have transformed HIV from a death sentence to a chronic but manageable  disease. They help extend and stabilize the lives of those living with  HIV while also dramatically reducing the risk of HIV transmission. This  makes it all the more imperative that all people who need HIV treatment  have access to it.   We are fortunate to have premier scientific research institutes  within my home State of Maryland working together to combat this deadly  virus, including the National Institutes of Health--NIH--the Walter  Reed Army Institute of Infectious Disease Research, the Institute of  Human Virology at the University of Maryland, and Johns Hopkins  University. Not only have these organizations substantially led  scientific advancements with respect to HIV/AIDS, they have also played  an important role in reducing the number of new cases among Marylanders  and affording those living with HIV the opportunity to continue living  full lives.   As a result, Maryland has reached significant milestones in reducing  HIV case numbers; my State went from ranking seventh among all the U.S.  States and territories to 12th in 2 years. Baltimore City, Montgomery  County, and Prince George's County have been participants in the  Department of Health and Human Services--HHS--Ending the HIV Epidemic  in the U.S. Program, which is working to reduce new HIV transmissions  by 75 percent by 2025 and by 90 percent by 2030. This multi-year  program will infuse 48 counties; Washington, DC; San Juan, PR; and  seven States that have a substantial rural HIV burden with the  additional expertise, technology, and resources they need to reduce  transmission. Public health initiatives the Maryland Department of  Health has implemented--including safer-sex education programs, free  HIV self-tests, condom distribution, and access to prophylactic  medication--have been instrumental in reducing new infections.  Additionally, city and county needle exchange programs have broadened  efforts to reduce the circulation of used syringes, provide testing for  infectious diseases such as HIV, and extend resources for the treatment  of substance use disorders.   Thanks to the Affordable Care Act--ACA--Americans diagnosed with HIV  or at risk of transmission have more meaningful access to healthcare  coverage and health insurance. Today, Americans cannot be dropped or  denied coverage because of preexisting health conditions such as  asthma, cancer, HIV, or COVID-19. The ACA also gives States the option  to expand Medicaid, the largest payer for those who need HIV treatment  in the country, and so far, 41 States have expanded Medicaid coverage.  I look forward to seeing the remaining States join this list.   The ACA has also established new standards and essential benefits  that certain health plans must cover. Benefits such as prescription  drug services, hospital inpatient care, lab tests, HIV screening,  preexposure prophylaxis or PrEP, and other preventive services aim to  preserve the health of those with HIV while mitigating further  transmission. Under the ACA, most health insurance plans must provide  preventive services, including HIV testing for those aged 15 to 65, as  well as PrEP for HIV-negative adults at high risk of HIV infection. I  am proud to have served as a cosponsor of the PrEP Access and Coverage  Act, which would expand access to PrEP and work to reduce the existing  disparities in access. Legislation like this is especially important in  light of recent threats to PrEP access, such as a Texas judge's ruling  in Braidwood Management v. Becerra, a decision which has the potential  to result in thousands of unnecessary HIV infections.   I commend the Biden-Harris administration for publishing the National  HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States (2022-2025) to provide a  roadmap to accelerate efforts to end the HIV epidemic in our country by  2030. These are bold targets facilitated by the White House's Office of  National AIDS Policy, ONAP. The Strategy builds on our country's  progress and lessons learned from the prior national strategies and  seeks to leverage new tools and opportunities to address the challenges  that remain. I share President Biden's determination to address the  disproportionate impact of the epidemic on marginalized populations  like the LGBTQI+ community and racial and ethnic minorities.   We must remember, however, that HIV remains a grave public health  challenge around the world. In 2022, 39 million people lived with HIV  globally. Last year, roughly 630,000 people died from AIDS-related  illnesses. Only 57 percent of children aged 14 and younger had access  to treatment in 2022, compared to 77 percent of those aged 15 and over.  We must redouble our efforts to close this gap and guarantee lifesaving  HIV treatment to all who need it and to prevent more HIV infections.  And it can be done.   This year, President Biden commemorated the 20th anniversary of the  U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief--PEPFAR--honoring the  25 million lives that have been saved worldwide in the fight to end  HIV/AIDS as a public health crisis. Since its inception in 2003, the  PEPFAR program has changed the trajectory of the HIV epidemic around  the globe, representing an extraordinary commitment to global health,  aiming to prevent, diagnose, and treat HIV infections. Over nearly 20  years, five mission babies have been born AIDS free, 7 million orphans  have been supported, and 20 million people are on lifesaving treatment  medications. PEPFAR has also demonstrated the value of strong health  systems in managing and anticipating other pandemics. Much of the  staff, infrastructure, and technology that was developed through PEPFAR  proved instrumental in the COVID-19 response in countries that would  otherwise not have the capacity to deliver treatment and vaccines. But  we have not crossed the finish line yet. The next 5 years are critical  to meet the goal of ending the global HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. The  U.S. must continue to show global health leadership and facilitate  cooperation with our foreign partners and allies.   We must continue to invest in the communities and local leaders that  know their own health needs best. All people, regardless of age, sex,  gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion,  disability, geographic location, or socioeconomic circumstance, should  have access to prevention, treatment, and care. International partners,  academic partners, faith-based organizations, and civil society are  counting on us to continue our support for their long-held efforts to  ending AIDS. This is why I call on my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to once again step forward in faith and courage and join together  to secure PEPFAR's reauthorization.   Most importantly, I want to recognize those living with HIV/AIDS  across the globe. Your demand for dignity and access to healthcare has  shown us what is possible when the world works together to fight a  public health scourge, and in accordance with that spirit, we will  prevail in doing so. We must recommit ourselves to continuing this  [[Page S5849]]  fight because success is within our reach.                            ____________________
