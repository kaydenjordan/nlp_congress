 Mr. Speaker, today is a momentous day, as we have just  received the news that my constituent, Trevor Reed, a Texan, a marine,  and a patriot, has been released from a Russian prison after being held  for an anguishing 985 days as a political pawn.   Trevor's parents, Paula and Joey Reed of Granbury, Texas, have been  tireless advocates for the release of their son, and I cannot imagine  the relief that they are feeling right now. The Reeds have been living  a 2\1/2\-year nightmare, fighting every day for their son's release.  And today, our prayers have been answered.   I thank my colleagues in Congress on both sides of the aisle for  working in a bipartisan manner to pass the resolution calling for  Trevor's release, and continuing to draw attention to his case,  including my predecessor, Mike Conaway, Chairman  Mike McCaul, Senator  Cornyn, Leader McCarthy, Congresswoman Jackson Lee, and Congressman  Castro, and my entire office that represents the 11th District, my  staff.   I especially recognize Ambassador Sullivan and his team, as well as  those that work in the NSA, the NSC, and the SPEHA.   Finally, President Biden, thank you for bringing Trevor Reed home.  Thank you for believing in leaving no American overseas.                            ____________________
