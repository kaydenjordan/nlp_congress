 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Rosa Parks,  a beacon of hope during the civil rights movement.   As we mark the 68th anniversary of her historic defiance against  racial segregation, we remember her decision to not give up her seat on  a Montgomery bus in 1955 and how it ignited a movement that reshaped  our Nation's history.   Detroit, her adopted home and final resting place, has been indelibly  marked by her courage. Her spirit and resolve continue to inspire  generations in Detroit to stand up against racial disparity and  champion inequality.   In her honor, and in recognition of the city she loved, we must  persist in our efforts to dismantle systemic racism and build a society  where every individual, regardless of race, can achieve their full  potential.                            ____________________
