 Mr. Speaker, I start by saying I am honored to be  the co-chair of the Congressional Family Caucus.   We have seen the decline of the traditional family for many years,  and it is not by chance this has occurred. We have come to a point in  society that the restoration of the family is of the utmost importance.   Russell Kirk wrote about the problem this way: ``We cannot feel any  affection for our country unless we first love those near to us. The  conservative feels that the family is the natural source and core of  any good society; that when the family decays, a dreary collectivism is  sure to supplant it; and that the principal instrument of moral  instruction, ordinary education, and satisfactory economic life always  must remain the family.''   Kirk goes on to say: ``Now very powerful forces are at work to  diminish the influence of the family among us, and even to destroy the  family for all purposes except mere generation. Some of these forces  are material and unintentional: . . . cheap amusements and  transportation, which encourage members of the family to spend nearly  all their time outside the family circle; the assumption of the old  educational functions of the family by public schools . . . .''   He continues: ``But other forces hostile to the family are not merely  impersonal and unconscious; they are more or less deliberate, and they  may be countered by intelligent action in the social and educational  and political spheres. The chief of these ominous forces is the  deliberate desire of certain people to have the political state assume  nearly all the responsibilities  [[Page H1121]]  which the family once possessed. This movement is the most thorough and  disastrous form of collectivism.   `` `The shrewd totalitarian mentality knows well the powers of  intimate kinship and religious devotion for keeping alive in a  population values and incentives which might well, in the future, serve  as the basis of resistance. Thus to emancipate each member, and  especially the younger members, from the family was an absolute  necessity. And this planned spiritual alienation from kinship was  accomplished, not only through the negative processes of spying and  informing, but through the sapping of the functional foundations of  family membership and through the substitution of new and attractive  political roles for each of the social roles embodied in the family  structure. . . . What the totalitarian must have for the realization of  his design is a spiritual and cultural vacuum.'''   He goes on to list some of the deliberate techniques of the mass  state for undermining the family.   Number one is: ``Taking the instruction of children entirely away  from their parents by the official adoption of theories that prescribe  `educating the whole child' in the state schools, with a corresponding  depreciation of parental intelligence and rights.''   Number two is: ``Creating `youth organizations' to take young people  quite out of the sphere of the family in their leisure hours and to  indoctrinate them in the ideology of the mass state.''   The third is: ``Abolishing the inheritance of family property,  through confiscatory inheritance taxes or through income tax policies  that leave small margin for family saving.''   The fourth one is: ``Planned encouragement of divorce, `sexual  freedom,' and `deprivatization of women,' through positive legislation  or official propaganda, with the aim of weakening the bonds  of affection within the family that offer a strong barrier to the  wishes of the total state.''    ``The traditional family--which, like many old-fashioned things, is  an indispensable thing--gives us those roots without which we all would  be just so many lonely little atoms of humanity, unprincipled and at  the mercy of some iron political domination.''   Do you know when this little book was written, Mr. Speaker? That was  written in 1957.   Kirk's insights about family, the importance of private property,  education, religion, and a dozen other subjects not only remain  completely sound but now seem downright prophetic.   We were being warned about the attacks on the family unit more than  60 years ago. That is why, as chosen leaders, we have the  responsibility to protect the sanctity of the traditional family  because marriage and family are institutions unique to human beings  among all of God's creation.   In modern-day wording by the author Tim Clinton in a book from 2021,  he says this: ``Suffice it to say that the deterioration of the  American family is the source of nearly every symptom of cultural  decline, from criminal activity to plunging academic performances, from  damaged mental health to poor physical health, from rising poverty to  shredded social networks.''                            ____________________
