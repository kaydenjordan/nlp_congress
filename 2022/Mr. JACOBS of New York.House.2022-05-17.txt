 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my  amendment, which would be of great benefit to adult learners across  this country, and especially in my home State of New York.   New York State has had issues over the last several years in  distributing these funds promptly. Independent programs typically  operate on very thin budgets, so any delay in funding puts their  operations in jeopardy.   My amendment would ensure States are held accountable for  distributing funding promptly by requiring the States to provide a  timeline for distributing grants and contracts for adult basic  education in the Unified State Plan, and specifying that funds must be  distributed in a timely manner.   The typical adult learner benefiting from title II funding is either  an individual who was not able to access a K-12 education as a child or  is a recent immigrant.   Last September, I visited one of the adult education programs in my  district, Literacy West New York, and I walked away very impressed by  the adult learners there. Life certainly has not been easy for them,  but that hasn't stopped them from pressing on and working to improve  their lives.   It is important we make sure that the resources promised to our  Nation's adult learners, and the programs that support them, are  available.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
