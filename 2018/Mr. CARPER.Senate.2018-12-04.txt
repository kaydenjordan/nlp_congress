 Mr. President, the Presiding Officer knows I spent a  little time in the Navy. So did my father. My father enlisted in the  Navy right before World War II broke out. He was not 18.   George Herbert Walker Bush, I think on his 18th birthday, just out of  high school, enlisted in the Navy as a seaman second class. About a  year later, he was off to Corpus Christi Naval Air Station, where I  earned my wings as a naval flight officer a long time ago. He became an  ensign, I think at the age of 19, and became, maybe, the youngest Navy  pilot around that time that they had in the Navy, if you can believe  that. A year or so later, I think in September of 1943, he was on the  USS San Jacinto in the Pacific and flew avenger bombers with the 3rd  Fleet and 6th Fleet. When you think about it, at that point in time he  must have been about 20 years old, flying avenger bombers. That is  pretty amazing.   When I was 20 years, I was a sophomore or junior at Ohio State. The  idea of flying missions, as we did stuff in the summers with Navy ROTC  in Corpus Christi, flying airplanes and so forth--to be flying missions  in the Pacific theater in the middle of World War II is pretty  astounding.   In 1944, he would have been maybe 20 years old, not quite 21. He was  a lieutenant JG. I think I made lieutenant JG when I was 22 or so. But  later that year, in 1944, when he was still about 20 years old, he was  shot down off the coast of Chichijima by a Japanese anti-aircraft flier  while flying a mission to bomb an enemy radio site located on the Bonin  Islands about 600 miles south of Japan. In some of my missions during  the Vietnam war, we flew by there. He was rescued by the U.S. submarine  Finback after he had floated around the ocean for a while in an  inflated raft. God bless the folks on the Finback. They somehow found  out he was out there and found him. It was like finding a needle in a  haystack. I have done a fair number of search and rescue missions out  of a P-3 airplane. To find somebody on a little dingy from an airplane  is hard enough, but to find them from a submarine is even more  difficult. It is miraculous to me that on September 2, 1944, they found  him and saved him.   In November of 1944, he returned to his ship, the USS San Jacinto,  and participated in operations in the Philippines until his squadron  was sent home. I have some fond memories of operating missions in the  South China Sea out of the Philippines and off the coast of Southeast  Asia. But his career took him there. I think at that time he was about  21, an old guy, in the Navy.   A year or so later, in September of 1945, he was discharged from the  Navy. He had served 58 combat missions during World War II, for which  he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. You don't get much  better than a Distinguished Flying Cross. So there were three air  medals--I had one, and this guy had three--and the Presidential Unit  Citation awarded to his  [[Page S7268]]  ship, of which he was a member for a number of years. That is one heck  of a record for a guy who signed up as a seaman second class at the age  of 18 and 3 years later finished up after flying all those missions  when he was 21. I am still thinking about what I was doing when I was  21. I wasn't doing this. I was looking forward to going into the Navy  on Active Duty and ended up in Southeast Asia with John McCain, from  Arizona, one of our colleagues and the Presiding Officer's wingman in  the Senate for a number of years.   I had never met George Bush when he was on Active Duty or in the  Navy. I was not yet born. My dad served about the same time, never at  the same time at the same duty station, although they both spent a fair  amount of time in airplanes. My dad was a chief petty officer.   My guess is that George Bush got pretty good leadership training from  his parents, but, starting from the age of 18, the Navy took over and  provided him with exceptional leadership training. I would like to  think some others--including John McCain, hopefully yours truly, and  some others with whom we served, not just in World War II but in  subsequent wars, including Vietnam and even today--received great  leadership training in the military. George Herbert Walker Bush was  trained, as was I and as were many of our peers, that leaders are  humble, not haughty. Think about that: Leaders are humble, not haughty.  Speeches were given last week as we gathered in the Capitol, and  thousands of people have walked by his casket since. If there was ever  a leader I have met who was humble, not haughty, it was George Herbert  Walker Bush.    He was trained that leaders lead by their example. It is not do as I  say, but do as I do. That is what he was like. He had the heart of a  servant throughout his life. I can't remember all of the different  roles in which he served. Maybe our Presiding Officer can help me;  maybe the Senator from Tennessee who has joined me can fill in the  blanks. But it was a pretty amazing career, which includes jobs I  wasn't even mindful of. A lot of us remember he was head of the CIA.  Everybody knows he was President and Vice President. But there were so  many other jobs--Ambassador to China and a host of other challenging  positions--that he fulfilled every step of his life.   He was a Congressman and served in the House for 4 years. This is  really instructive; if Senator Alexander would correct me if I am  wrong, my recollection is that he ran for the U.S. Senate not once but  twice and was not successful either time. Sometimes we learn more when  we are unsuccessful than when we are successful.   He was the kind of leader who thought that part of being a leader is  staying out of step when everybody else is marching to the wrong tune.  He was the kind of leader who felt that a leader should be aspirational  and appeal to people's better angels. He was the kind of leader who  surrounded himself with really good people. I have known a bunch of  them, and so have some of you. He surrounded himself with exceptional  people.   He was the sort of leader who, when the team did well, he would give  credit to the team, and when the team fell short, he would take the  blame. He was one of those leaders who actually sought to unite people,  not divide people. We hear a lot these days about building bridges and  building walls. He was a bridge builder, never much for building walls.   One of my favorite quotes about politics is that our friends come and  go, but our enemies accumulate. All of those years, the people he ran  against--Bill Clinton certainly comes to mind, but others, as well--had  great affection for him and loved him. There is some secret there that  the rest of us could probably learn from.   The other thing I am especially mindful of him as a leader is that he  was interested in doing what was right--not what was easy or expedient,  but what was right. He treated other people the way he wanted to be  treated--the Golden Rule. He was interested in doing things well, and  he wanted people around him to do things well--sort of like, if it  isn't perfect, make it better. He was not one to give up.   For those reasons, and others, I would like to say that he was the  kind of leader we need more of in both parties--here, in the executive  branch, and in other branches of our government. We could use more like  him, men and women. But those of us who were lucky enough to be around  him, to learn from him, and to see him in action, whether he was  successful or not--it was a great opportunity for us.   I have the opportunity now to serve as the senior Democrat on the  Environment and Public Works Committee; our chair is John Barrasso. The  chairman of the HELP Committee is here on the floor today, Senator  Alexander. He and I, in earlier days--when he was a member of the  Public Works Committee--worked on the Clear Skies legislation.  President George W. Bush, the son of President George Herbert Walker  Bush, proposed something called Clear Skies legislation--sulfur  dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury. As I recall, Senator Alexander  and I, maybe along with Senator Voinovich of Ohio, worked on something.  I call it ``Really Clear Skies'' because sulfur dioxide, nitrogen  oxide, and mercury make CO2, carbon dioxide.   Much has been made of late of the environmental record of Richard  Nixon. I never thought I would be extolling the virtues of Richard  Nixon as our President, but I have quite a bit in the last several  years as the senior Democrat on the Environment and Public Works  Committee. I am the only Democrat I know who quotes President Nixon.  Richard Nixon said, among other things, that the only people who don't  make mistakes are people who don't do anything. Isn't that good? The  only people who don't make mistakes are people who don't do anything.  We all make mistakes. I probably learn more from my mistakes than from  the things I have done right.   People talk about the environmental legacy of Richard Nixon. He  signed legislation creating the EPA; he signed legislation creating the  Clean Air Act; he signed legislation creating the Clean Water Act. He  did some amazing stuff, for a Republican President, with respect to the  environment.   Not as much has been made of George Herbert Walker Bush's  environmental record, but I have some notes that I am going to refer to  here to help refresh my memory and maybe expand a little on what others  know.   In the House of Representatives, when we were working on the 1990  amendments of the Clean Air Act, I had the opportunity to coauthor a  couple of little pieces of that legislation, which he actually signed,  so I feel a sense of ownership. He, as President, signed into law the  Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.   On the Friday after Thanksgiving, a couple of weeks ago, here in our  Nation's Capital, 13 Federal agencies released a major report laying  out the alarming impact that climate change is having on the  environment, our public health, our economic growth, and our weather. I  never thought I would see the day when we are measuring rainfall by the  foot instead of by the inches. I never thought I would be seeing  wildfires in California, Montana, Washington State, and Oregon that are  bigger than my State of Delaware. I never thought I would see this many  category 5 hurricanes. I never thought I would see two 500-year floods  in Ellicott City, MD, just a short way up the road here. They didn't  come every 500 years; they came one year after the other. I never  thought I would see that kind of weather.   These Federal agencies put out a report a couple of weeks ago, laying  out some of the alarming impacts that climate change is having on our  environment, public health, economic growth, and our weather. That  report is known as the ``National Climate Assessment.'' It is put out  every 4 years as a result of an act signed in 1990 called the Global  Change Research Act of 1990. Who signed it? Why, it was President  George Herbert Walker Bush who signed it into law all those years ago.   The 41st President raised the alarm decades ago about a threat that  he referred to as the ``ozone hole.'' That is what he called it, the  ozone hole. The Clean Air Act of 1990, which he signed into law, hoped  to implement the Montreal Protocol, a landmark international treaty to  deal with the problem. The protocol is highly widely regarded as a  success. The treaty is widely regarded as a success. A couple of years  after that, he helped form the United Nations framework. If I am not  [[Page S7269]]  mistaken, I think he was maybe our Ambassador to the United Nations as  well.   In 1992, he helped form the United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change, which has now been embraced by every nation on Earth  and is taking place this very week in Poland. Countries from throughout  the world are there.   I mentioned earlier the 1990 amendments of the Clean Air Act, which  turned out to be some of the most important environmental laws that we  have on our books in this country, and that law enabled the government  to control the nearly 200 toxic substances that are present in our air  and pose threats to human health. That same law paved the way for  cleaner running cars and clean fuels that have dramatically reduced  pollution from smog.   I can remember when I was in the Navy, spending part of the summer at  the Long Beach Naval Station on a big jumbo tanker. I like to run, and  I remember running close to L.A. in the summer--late sixties. I  remember on some days that I ran, I felt I was doing more damage to my  lungs than I was doing good for my body, running and breathing that  kind of air. The air in California was awful. It is not perfect today,  but it is a whole lot better, except when there are all these fires  they have to put up with.   According to the EPA, the 1990 amendments of the Clean Air Act, over  the first 20 years of enactment, have also prevented 160,000 premature  deaths, reduced illnesses and diseases related to air pollution, and  spurred $2 trillion in overall economic benefits.   I will end with this. In February of 1990, President Bush said this  about our changing climates. I want to quote him. He said:         We all know that human activities are changing the       atmosphere in unexpected and in unprecedented ways. Much       remains to be done. Many questions remain to be answered.       Together, we have a responsibility to ourselves and the       generations to come to fulfill our stewardship obligations.    Those are his words. Those words and the positions he took and the  work his administration did on this front show real leadership and,  maybe, the courage to stay out of step when everyone else is marching  to the wrong tune and a willingness to step up and address that  unprecedented challenge that is before us.   He lived to be 94. He was active and vibrant almost to the end. I  think a number of us have had the opportunity to serve as Governor with  both of his sons and to know them as friends and leaders of our  country. The legacy of their dad lives on through the children he and  Barbara helped raise.   We miss his personality. We miss his warmth and his good humor. We  miss his affection, and we miss his leadership. I hope our colleagues  and, certainly, I can learn from his example and learn again over and  over again from the example he set to do the right thing, even when it  is not easy.   With that, I yield the floor.
