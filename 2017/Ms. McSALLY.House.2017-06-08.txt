 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Phillip  D. Ledford, Navy veteran, dog lover, patriot, and husband to Helene,  his wife of 41 years.   I was blessed to be Phil's next-door neighbor in Tucson for the last  20 years. Having lost my father at the age of 12, Phil became a father  figure to me, and I loved him deeply.   Phil was born in Ohio and joined the Navy in 1963, at the age of 17,  requiring his father to approve his enlistment. After 4 years serving  as a boilerman and traveling the world, he transitioned to civilian  life. After working in Ohio as a commercial refrigerator technician,  Phil, Helene, and their beloved English Setter named Molley moved to  Tucson.   Phil and his best friend and brother-in-law Mike would go on  adventures in the desert and mountains, exploring old mines, gold  prospecting, and hiking the beautiful landscapes of Arizona.   After Molley passed away, Phil and Helene couldn't imagine bringing  another dog into their broken hearts for a while. Slowly, my Golden  Retriever, Penelope, started to melt his heart, and soon they were  spending their days together. Phil and Helene cared for Penelope when I  was deployed to Afghanistan, then drove across the country to help me  move when I got orders to Alabama. Phil came out to babysit Penelope  and even drove her all the way back to Tucson to be at home for a while  with Helene.   Phil volunteered to be a foster for the local Golden Retriever rescue  organizations. He took this responsibility seriously, caring for many  goldens coming out of difficult circumstances. One golden named Rudy  had cancer, and Phil agreed to care for him until he passed. Rudy was  deathly afraid of thunder, but Phil discovered that Rudy's fears were  cured if he was riding in a car. So every time storms came, Phil would  load Rudy up--even borrowing Mike's van so that Rudy could enter more  easily--and drive him around so he wasn't afraid during the storm, even  if the storm lasted all night--no complaints and no questions asked.   When I returned home to Tucson, we cut a hole in the wall between the  two houses, and we had doggy doors, food bowls, toys, and treats in  both places. Penelope happily lived in both of her homes again, roaming  freely. What a life. What love.   Phil was with me when Penelope passed in 2014. Within a few weeks,  Phil's best friend Mike went to be with the Lord after battling Agent  Orange-caused cancer for years. It was a rough spring for Phil, losing  his best guy friend and furry friend so quickly.    Despite our grief, we soon welcomed a rescue golden named Boomer into  our lives and hearts. Boomer was a 10-month-old, energetic handful, and  Phil got to work with his training, coaching, and love.   Phil was a patriot, who loved his country, God, and valued a hard  day's work. He was a skilled tradesman, who was always eager to pull  out his tools and try to fix literally anything that broke in the house  or car.   Those of us who knew him best and loved him called him our favorite  curmudgeon. He was stubborn and opinionated but would literally give  you the shirt off his back or the last dollar in his wallet.   He used to scold me on my lack of discipline with the dogs. Boomer  would get rambunctious with me and not listen but was perfectly well  behaved with Phil. I realized, finally, that Boomer saw me as a litter  mate and Phil as the pet parent.   In November 2015, Phil was diagnosed with head and neck cancer. The  last year and a half, he navigated an extremely difficult journey. He  channeled his stubbornness towards his fight against cancer and refused  to give up or get down. His deep character traits of selflessness,  faith, love, courage, and humility were tested and purified on this  walk. He was a hero and example to all of us in the face of extreme  pain, suffering, adversity, and eventually the end of his physical  life.   In mid-April, the cancer came back with a vengeance and rapidly  spread. The pain was unbearable at times, and it was so difficult for  us to watch him suffer.   Two weeks ago yesterday, he took a turn for the worse. I flew home  from D.C. to be with him. After a long night, Helene, Boomer, and I  were by his side, praying he would be willing to let go and be received  into God's holy embrace. He was unconscious for over 24 hours, but in  that prayer, he scrunched his eyes closed twice, took his last breath,  and went to be with the Lord, finally free of all the suffering and  fully restored.   We could all learn a lot from Phil Ledford. He did not live a  complicated life and found pure joy in simple and beautiful things: a  walk with a beloved dog; exploring with his best friend Mike; watching  football with his adored bride, Helene; tinkering with the furnace or  his Jeep; a walk and casual dinner at our local favorite restaurant,  Papa Locos; driving me to the airport or events with constituents;  taking care of and protecting those whom he loved. He didn't seek  glory, fame, or riches, but humanity, integrity, loyalty, and service.   Phil Ledford was a good man with a large heart and a selfless spirit.  I truly could not have served in my calling in uniform and in Congress  without his love and support. He directed us to not have a memorial  service or funeral, but he never said anything about a speech on the  floor of the House of Representatives. It is the least I could do to  honor his impact on my life and all those blessed to know him and love  him, human and furry. We love you and miss you, Phil. As the song says:  ``Go rest high on that mountain. Son, your work on Earth is done.''                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of my  amendment to H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act.   Since Dodd-Frank was signed into law, we have seen more than 1,900  community financial institutions in the U.S. close.   Additionally, rules promulgated to combat money laundering in  transnational organizations have had unintended consequences on  legitimate businesses along the border.   In my home State of Arizona, banks and legitimate businesses along  the U.S.-Mexico border have been particularly hard hit by ambiguous and  onerous regulations. In the last decade, Arizona has lost 70 percent of  its community banks.   These regulations, which were meant to minimize risk and combat money  laundering, have actually contributed to high transaction costs and  imposed substantial difficulties for legitimate companies engaged in  cash-intensive types of businesses, like ranchers and farmers.   Many banking institutions have closed their doors, and others have  dropped customers participating in cross-border commerce. As a result,  individuals and local businesses, some of them family-owned who have  been operating in the region for generations, have since lost access to  banking services and the capital they rely on.   I strongly support Federal efforts to combat money laundering and  illicit activities, and I understand how transnational criminal  organizations can exploit vulnerabilities in the financial system for  their own gain. However, limiting the availability of banking services  and hampering cross-border transactions to legitimate businesses has  negative impacts on communities in my district. Should this be the  result of regulations handed down by Washington, the Treasury  Department should examine ways to remove these unintended consequences.   As such, my amendment simply asks the Department of Treasury to  review existing regulations and submit a report to Congress regarding  its efforts to work with Federal bank regulators, financial  institutions, and money service businesses to ensure that legitimate  financial transactions can move freely and globally.   It is critical that the new administration engage with small  businesses and local stakeholders in the Southwest to ensure legitimate  cross-border commerce can continue to be a major contributor to our  economy. It is imperative we do everything we can to find a balance  between economic needs of border communities while maintaining strong  safeguards against illicit activities.   This amendment is supported by the Fresh Produce Association, the  Electronic Transactions Association, and the Arizona Bankers  Association.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague recognizing that  this is a problem and saying he agrees with it, but then doesn't  support the amendment because it is not enough. I don't understand  that. I had hoped that he would support the amendment, and then we  could continue to work together on other initiatives as well.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
