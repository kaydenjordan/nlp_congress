 Mr. Speaker, 33 years ago, I stood near this spot and  watched Thurgood Marshall come through these doors as a member of the  Supreme Court at a State of the Union address. And as a Marylander and  as a Baltimorean, I had a great sense of pride.   I got to know Mr. Marshall. All he ever said by his eloquence and his  example was this is how we ought to be as Supreme Court justices.   I must tell you, I was dismayed, though, years earlier, to learn as a  young student at Morgan State University the history of Roger B. Taney,  who did just the opposite to my spirit and just the opposite, I think,  to what we believe Supreme Court Justices should act like and how they  conduct themselves.   A gentleman from the other side earlier said that Mr. Taney rendered  the worst Supreme Court decision ever. And he is exactly right. That  decision said that Black people had no rights for which the White man  must respect, and therefore that the Negro might justly and lawfully be  reduced to slavery for his own benefit. It also said that Black people  born in America, like Dred Scott, were not citizens and it eviscerated  the Missouri Compromise of 1820.   So replacing the statue of Taney with one instead of Thurgood  Marshall  [[Page H3665]]  seems to me the way we ought to go as a Chamber. I hope in a bipartisan  fashion, not only for ourselves, but to say to all the visitors that  come through this building that we will continue to hold high real  American heroes that sought to keep us together, and we will not honor  those who sought to divide us.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's kind and overly  gracious remarks. I appreciate also his sense of history and for what I  think today is being displayed as a bipartisan effort to draw attention  to and to reconcile a very real problem.   So I will be more than happy to do that. And Lincoln was one of my  heroes in many respects, not just because he signed, as Mr. Butterfield  said, an executive order in 1863, but that he reminded us of what we  were supposed to be as a Nation. Was he flawed? Yes. Are we flawed?  Yes. Do we increase our ability to grow together? The absolute answer  is yes. So I do appreciate the gentleman's comments, and I appreciate  him yielding.    Mr. Speaker, as we have been hearing and continue to hear,  the passing of John Lewis represents a loss for America of one of our  greatest heroes and, for many of us, a dear and old friend.   John and I were sworn in together in this Chamber 33 years ago as  classmates in the 100th Congress. There were only four African  Americans elected to Congress that year, he, myself, Floyd Flake of New  York, and Mike Espy of Mississippi. We huddled with John here on the  floor, and he made all of us hug each other. He said: We got here in  different ways, but we are one band of brothers now.   The passion and the equality that he carried with him throughout his  life, as we know, never waned. His untiring quest for justice never  faltered. With a big heart for compassion, John, like his mentor, Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., was unawed by opinion, unseduced by flattery,  and undismayed by disaster.   Birthed in an area of Jim Crow and vile and vicious segregation, he  defied the limitedness of others' expectations.   John knew that politics changed people, so he set out early to change  politics.                                time  1915    Everything about him pointed to the fact that he was emblematic of  that great band of freedom fighters who realized that freedom wasn't  free.   In this era where everyone seems to be searching for the next big  thing or the next great thing, isn't it odd, Mr. Speaker, that the  greatness of John Lewis was with us all along? We needed only to look  as far as the latest movement for social change to find it.   We are sad today, but heaven is rejoicing, and John has claimed his  final reward.
