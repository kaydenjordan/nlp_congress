 Madam President, later today, the Senate will have the  opportunity to confirm another brilliant nominee to the Federal  judiciary. In this case, I am proud to say this new lifetime judge will  be another fine Kentuckian.   For those of us who know Justin Walker and have seen his work up  close, it is clear that President Trump made an outstanding choice to  be a district judge for the Western District of Kentucky.   Mr. Walker has sharpened his legal skills at the highest levels,  including premier clerkships to then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the DC  circuit and former Justice Anthony Kennedy.   As a prominent attorney and law professor, he has earned the respect  of his peers in the legal world and of the community that he will serve  on the bench.   For his students, Mr. Walker has been a mentor who helps push them to  fulfill their potential in the classroom and throughout their legal  careers.   His thoughtful and deliberate approach fit the mold of a Federal  judge who--imagine this--will uphold the laws and the Constitution as  they are actually written, not as he might wish them to be.   So I am confident Mr. Walker will serve our Commonwealth and the  country extremely well as a district judge. I look forward to voting to  confirm him, and I certainly urge my colleagues to join me.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, too many times I  have had to come to the floor to speak about the pain inflicted on  families and entire communities by opioid addiction and substance  abuse.   It is a crisis present in every ZIP Code, one that has wrecked lives  throughout our country.   My home State of Kentucky has been hit particularly hard, but I am  relieved to say that we are seeing at least a glimmer of hope on the  horizon.   This past summer brought news of the first nationwide decrease-- decrease--in overdose fatalities in almost three decades. Kentucky saw  a nearly 15-percent drop. After so much suffering, this is an  indication that the tide may be starting to turn.   The result has been hard-won, after years of coordinated efforts  between States, localities, and Washington. It has been a nationwide  response, and we in Congress, along with the Trump administration, have  been focused on doing our part.   Today marks the 1-year anniversary of one key part of our ongoing  efforts. One year ago today, President Trump signed into law our  landmark opioid legislation that will hopefully spare more families  from the pain of addiction.   This legislation included work from 5 different committees and 70  Senators. Thanks to Chairman Lamar Alexander and so many of our  colleagues, this significant package focused on providing innovative  solutions, promoting long-term recovery, and empowering local leaders  and first responders out on the frontlines.   A little more than a year ago, it passed the Senate with overwhelming  [[Page S6136]]  bipartisan support. I am proud that two of my own bills were included  in that package. The Protecting Moms and Infant Act safeguards of the  addiction crisis from its heartbreaking consequences, and the CAREER  Act addresses the major role that stable employment plays in long-term  recovery. It encourages treatment facilities to form partnerships with  local businesses and short-term housing facilities to ``hand up'' to  those who need it.   We are proud of what we accomplished a year ago, and I am proud that  my Kentucky colleague, Representative   Andy Barr, is leading the push  for the CAREER Act's companion legislation over in the House.   But we know all too well that, unfortunately, this work is far, far  from finished. That is why, this very week, the Senate is moving  forward $25 million more for the CAREER Act's transitional housing  pilot program in the domestic appropriations we are advancing here on  the floor.   The work will not stop there. This fight has been one of my top  priorities since I became majority leader. We have put cutting-edge  tools into the hands of healthcare professionals and first responders  who face this crisis every single day.   In my State alone, I helped secure an unprecedented $200 million to  address the urgent crisis facing Kentuckians--a funding increase of  more than 400 percent on this issue for Kentucky since I became  majority leader.   We have committed to a comprehensive strategy of prevention,  treatment, and enforcement efforts. At my invitation, the White House  drug czar, Jim Carroll, saw some of Kentucky's innovative leadership  firsthand when he visited this past April. We have pushed the  boundaries of research to find new ways to treat addiction and help  families escape its painful consequences.   Earlier this month I joined Secretary Azar, NIH Director Collins, and  an all-star research team at the University of Kentucky to celebrate  the largest Federal grant in the University of Kentucky's history.  These new resources will fuel UK's bold commitment to cutting overdose  deaths by 40 percent in 16 counties over the coming 3 years. I was  proud to help secure those funds.   Kentucky is proud that we are leading the national response, but I  know my colleagues each have their own inspiring stories of how States  are fighting back.   As I said, the work is far from over, but today we take a moment to  celebrate the progress of the past year. To help mark this anniversary,  the First Lady of the United States joined us here in the Senate  yesterday.   I am proud to stand with her and the Trump administration and my  colleagues in this body as we recommit ourselves to this effort.                            ____________________     Madam President, this anniversary also reminds us of  how many urgent issues are crying out for substantive, bipartisan,  bicameral cooperation for the good of the American people.   I am talking about funding our Armed Forces and the Department of  Defense, just as both sides agreed to do back in the summer when we  signed on to a bipartisan, bicameral budget agreement that Democrats  have lately sort of wandered away from--just wandered right away from  it.   I am talking about passing the USMCA, the most consequential update  to North American trade policy in a generation, which Speaker Pelosi  has put on ice in order to move Democrats' impeachment obsession to the  front burner, despite the fact that there are 176,000 new American jobs  on the line if we pass the USMCA.   The needs of the American people have not been put on pause just  because Washington Democrats have decided it doesn't suit them to get  along with the White House.   My friends in Democratic leadership insist over and over that their  focus on undoing the 2016 election will not keep them from the  substantive legislation that American families need. Well, our Armed  Forces are still waiting for their funding; our workers and small  businesses are still waiting on their new trade agreement.   Our Senate Democratic colleagues have enough time to push partisan  resolutions, such as their effort yesterday to enact a new tax cut-- listen to this--their effort yesterday to enact a new tax cut for  wealthy people in blue States, like New York and New Jersey, at the  expense of working families everywhere else.   But so far we have seen little--little--indication that they are  really ready to put our differences aside and come to the table on  significant bipartisan subjects that can actually become law.   I worry that something like the landmark opioid package that we are  celebrating today would not have moved through the Congress today, just  one year later. I worry it would have been another victim of Democrats'  decision to avoid working with Republicans and the White House on  basically anything, to keep all of their focus trained on impeachment.   I hope I am mistaken. I hope we make real progress soon. The American  people are waiting on us.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution authorizing the production of testimony and ask for its  immediate consideration.   Mr. President, this resolution concerns a subpoena for testimony in a  criminal action pending in Superior Court in the District of Columbia.  In this action, the defendant is charged with demonstrating during a  Subcommittee hearing of the Judiciary Committee and continuing to  demonstrate after being instructed to stop by a law enforcement  officer. A trial is scheduled to begin in the case on October 28, 2019.  The Government is seeking testimony at the trial about Committee  hearing procedures from Jason Covey, hearing clerk of the Judiciary  Committee. The Committee would like to comply with the subpoena by  making Mr. Covey available for testimony in this case.   The enclosed resolution would authorize the production of testimony  from Mr. Covey in the upcoming trial.                            ____________________
