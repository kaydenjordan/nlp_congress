 Madam Speaker, House Democrats are putting  people over politics by lowering healthcare costs and creating better- paying jobs.   We are cutting costs for healthcare coverage, capping insulin at $35  for Medicare patients, and giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower  drug prices. We expanded the Affordable Care Act program which will  lower premiums for over 13 million Americans.   Just in my district alone, 62,000 seniors with Medicare will pay less  for prescription drug coverage, and 29,000 people in my district will  have access to affordable healthcare coverage due to lowered premiums  under the Inflation Reduction Act.   Meanwhile, some extreme MAGA Republicans are threatening to cut  Social Security and Medicare.   House Democrats will always protect seniors from Medicare cuts or  Social Security cuts because we put seniors over politics. In fact,  House Democrats increased benefits by 8.7 percent last year to ensure a  dignified retirement for Americans who worked hard for  [[Page H920]]  these vital benefits. Let me repeat that: They worked hard for these  vital benefits.    This increase helped more than 80,000 people in my district who are  on Social Security. That is more than 10 percent of my constituents.   These are retired workers, disabled workers, widows, and children who  need these critical funds to survive. They have earned them. They paid  into them.   Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline for our seniors and  especially those in my district. We will always defend these programs,  and we will always put seniors over politics.   We will never cut Medicare. We will never cut Social Security. We  will fight for our working families until the end.   Madam Speaker, House Democrats are creating good-paying jobs for all  our American families. Democrats have created a record 12 million jobs  since President Biden took office, and we aren't stopping there. Let me  repeat that: 12 million, and we are not stopping there. That is almost  as many jobs in 2 years as any President has created in a 4-year term.   House Republicans are trying to undermine all this through bad lies  and made-up stuff suggesting that President Biden has hurt our economy.  He has not.   Republicans want to raise the cost of everything 30 percent while  giving the wealthiest Americans cuts on their taxes. This is outrageous  and just plain wrong.   While extreme MAGA Republicans hand out tax breaks to the wealthy,  Democrats are focused on lowering everyday Americans' costs.   We will continue to fight for working families.   I am not willing to use politics over people. I will always put  people over politics and always, always people first.                            ____________________
