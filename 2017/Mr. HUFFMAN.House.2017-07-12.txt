 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, so much for regular order. The bill before us today has  not received a hearing in committee where witnesses could have  testified about its effects. It has not gone through the markup process  so that the committee of jurisdiction could actually debate and offer  amendments to improve it.   Moreover, we are about to vote on a bill with several provisions that  no one has ever seen before last Wednesday, aside from a small group of  Republican offices and special interests that have been working on the  bill.   Now, this closed-door process not only ignores the changing  conditions of drought in California and how the State has already been  adapting to meet water conservation needs, but it also ignores all of  California's water provisions that were included, albeit at the last  minute, in the WIIN Act last year, which is now Federal law.   There has been no discussion, no hearing, no way to know how the  provisions of this bill that overlap with the enacted law will actually  be implemented by the Trump administration. This is legislating blind,  and it is a bad idea.   On some level, I do understand my Republican colleagues' fear of  regular order on this bill. The more sunlight and public scrutiny that  this bill gets, the uglier it looks. Make no mistake, if enacted, this  bill will hurt a lot of people.   This bill takes water away from fishermen, from tribes, the  environment, Delta farmers, and others in order to redistribute it  primarily to a small group of some of the Nation's biggest and most  politically connected agribusiness interests.   My Republican colleagues often talk about States' rights, yet this  bill repeatedly overrides State laws over the objection of that State.  I am talking, of course, about California.   A letter of opposition to H.R. 23 recently came from Governor Jerry  Brown, sent to the speaker of the house in the California Congressional  Delegation attesting to this. Governor Brown writes: ``This bill  overrides California water law, ignoring our State's prerogative to  oversee our waters. Commandeering our laws for purposes defined in  Washington is not right.''   This assault on California law and its values are why both California  Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Kamala Harris oppose this bill as  well.   Now, here are just a few examples of the sections in this bill that  preempt State law. Section 108(d) begins with the words ``California  law is preempted'' on page 21, paragraph 3. That section goes on to  remove State protections for certain fisheries.   Section 113 of the bill preempts California law that requires the  restoration of California's second longest river and that river's  native salmon runs.   Section 108 of the bill tells the State of California that it is  barred from managing the State's water in any way that would ``protect,  enhance, or restore . . . any public trust value.'' In other words, the  broader public interest can't be considered by the State when it is  managing the water that belongs to the people of California.   Additionally, this bill eliminates existing fishery protections,  which could put many of California's native fisheries and the thousands  of jobs they support on a path to extinction. That means that this is  more than just a California problem, because fishing communities in  Oregon and Washington also depend on California salmon runs.   There was a recent UC Davis report that found that if present trends  continue, many of California's salmon runs are on a path to extinction  in the decades ahead. This bill would hasten that prediction into  reality.   This is not just an environmental impact. It is a human one as well.  We have heard from fishermen who are struggling to pay their mortgages,  boats are being scrapped because owners can't pay mooring fees, homes  are being repossessed. We have heard about the struggles of small- business owners running restaurants, hotels, and other retail and  service businesses. We have also heard from Indian Country, like the  Hoopa Valley Tribe that I represent, and others about the danger that  this bill poses to tribal fisheries, to tribal water, fishing,  property, and other rights.                                time  1645    Rather than simply picking winners and losers, as this destructive  bill does, Congress should be working together to grow water supplies  for everyone without violating Tribal responsibilities or overriding  State sovereignty. Congress could be supporting a range of modern water  technologies like reuse, desalination, water use efficiency, storm  water capture, and groundwater storage and remediation. These are the  tools that have increased California's water supplies in recent years  and are making our State more drought resilient, but this bill does  none of that.   These are not controversial suggestions working on these modern water  supply tools; in fact, it was the reclamation commissioner for  President George W. Bush who described the water that we could tap  through reuse as the next great river of the American  [[Page H5505]]  West. We should be focusing on those kind of noncontroversial consensus  solutions.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Nunes), who has been a leader on this issue for more  than two decades.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, so much for regular order.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Nunes), who has been a leader on this issue for more  than two decades.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We often hear about water that flows through the estuary of  California's Bay-Delta system, we hear that sometimes described as  wasted. There are some inconvenient facts that we have to bring up when  that happens, like the fact that almost all of that water that flows  out through the estuary is to prevent salt water intrusion so that the  State and Federal water pumps aren't sending salty water to millions of  Californians. That wouldn't work. In fact, if we shut down all of that  outflow that my colleague just mentioned, that is exactly what you  would see: massive salt water intrusion and a shutdown of the State and  Federal water projects.   There is also incredible value in the water that flows through that  estuary for downstream communities and farmers and senior water right  holders, and others who have depended on it for decades. No one  understands that better than my colleague who represents some of those  communities in the estuary, in the delta, Mike Thompson.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Chairman, just to clarify, our environmental laws  are not preventing new dams from being built. In fact, the Bureau of  Reclamation, the GAO, and the Congressional Research Service have  looked at this and haven't been able to identify a single--nor my  colleagues across the aisle have been able to identify a single dam  project that somehow was blocked because of environmental laws.   What has been stopping many of them--not all, but many of them--has  been the financing challenge because many of these projects just don't  make a lot of sense. It is important to realize that projects that do  make sense have moved forward. They have secured financing. They  haven't needed special shortcuts from the environmental laws. And they  have happened, projects like Diamond Valley, projects like Los  Vaqueros, probably the coming expansion of Los Vaqueros.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, we see this bill every Congress. That is, every 2 years  we fight this thing out.   Let's talk about what it would do. It would weaken the Endangered  Species Act--that has been a target of the Republican Party for  decades. It will benefit one region while harming another. It will make  a few people very wealthy. It will likely cause additional drainage  problems for the Westlands and other water districts. It will cause  ocean salt water to come farther inland in the California delta,  poisoning farmland, destroying marinas, disrupting water supplies for  cities along the delta, basically destroying the delta as we now know  it. It will use precious limited water to plant evermore thirsty  orchards in the desert. And it may expedite the creation of new dams  with weakened environmental control.  [[Page H5508]]    So let's look at what it won't do. It won't create any new water.   So why do we have to go through this every 2 years?   It is good political theater for some colleagues, but it is not going  to get through the Senate.   But all may not be lost. Here is a novel suggestion: work across  party lines, work across northern versus southern California lines, and  come to a compromise that will actually create new water and take all  stakeholder interests into account.   We need to take a holistic approach.   It means actually funding recycling and above- and below-ground water  storage that makes environmental sense. It means capturing stormwater,  early leak detection, data collection, efficiency, and conservation. It  is all of these things, all of which can be done in a cost-effective  way that prepares us for the long-term.   There are countless recharge, recycling, desalinization projects, as  well as other storage projects that are ready to go and could create or  save enough water for thousands of families in California.   Instead of considering a bill that wastes water and that California  opposes, we should be discussing how to most efficiently utilize the  rain and snowpack we have, which can be done while protecting the  environment.   Let's oppose this bill and start working on legislation that can be  signed into law and benefit everyone.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar), the chairman of the bipartisan Western Caucus.    Mr. Chairman, I want to briefly respond to my friend's  reference to a manmade drought.   What California just went through is what hydrologists, scientists,  and historians tell us is the most significant drought the State has  ever experienced--a natural one. I certainly knew that human activities  were impacting the climate, but, wow, if human beings could actually  cause the snowpack to be 5 percent of normal and cause a drought like  that, that is taking human-induced climate change to a whole new level.  We have got to be careful in this debate. We are beginning to give  hyperbole a bad name.                                time  1715    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Garamendi), representing the Sacramento Valley.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Bera), my colleague from the Sacramento area.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Bera), my colleague from the Sacramento area.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Responding briefly to a bit of hyperbole just now that somehow  environmental laws have created a ``desert that produces nothing in  California,'' we do need to remember the facts.   The truth is, even through this historic drought, farm employment  rose statewide each year during the drought. The agricultural economy  is thriving, and, thankfully, this year, even the most junior Federal  contractors are enjoying a 100 percent allocation. They are fully  realizing the vision of being the breadbasket of this country and the  world. It is hardly a desert that produces nothing.   With that, I do need to contrast what has been happening on the other  end of the system, many of the communities I represent, where fishing  communities really do have nothing.   The California salmon season this year will be little or nothing. The  Yurok Tribe that I represent that is dependent on fisheries, salmon  fisheries in California since long before there was agriculture, will,  for the second year in a row, close its Tribal fishery. We are seeing  folks selling their boats. We are seeing fishing communities impacted  in dramatic ways. There is real genuine hardship, much like what was  just described by my friend. So the facts do matter.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Bakersfield, California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority  leader.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his work when it comes to water in California.   Mr. Chairman, water is not optional, not in my district, not in  California, not anywhere. But over the past 5 years, my constituents  have struggled to survive without life-giving water in the face of a  catastrophic drought.   This past winter, heavy rains and snowfall have brought much-needed  relief. In fact, there was so much water this past winter we ran out of  room to store it.   But we cannot always expect a year to bring monsoon-level rains and  record snow. What happens if next year's rain and snowfall is average,  or below average, or we have another drought? The Federal and State  regulations that keep us from pumping and storing water will come back  to haunt us.   The water bill passed by this body and signed into law last year was  a downpayment on California's future. Today's legislation is another  major investment in our State's future.   So let's look at pumping. There is no reason--absolutely no reason-- we should prioritize potential benefit to fish over real benefits to  families. This legislation increases delta pumping and will bring  immediate relief to two-thirds of California south of the delta.    But a long-term solution demands more pumping. While California's  population has doubled since the 1970s, we  [[Page H5510]]  haven't completed a single major storage project in that time.   Now, that is worth restating. While California's population has  doubled since the 1970s, we have not completed a single major storage  project in that time. How can California grow and thrive in the future  if we depend on inadequate infrastructure from nearly 50 years ago?   Currently, five reservoir projects have been stalled in regulatory  and red tape for decades. If these reservoirs alone are built, we could  store between 1 to 1.5 million acre-feet of additional water in our  State. So we need to build more storage as soon as possible.   Last year's water bill jumpstarted the process for building new  reservoirs in California and the West. It was a bipartisan bill, with  the vote being hundreds of votes out of the House, more than 70 in the  Senate.   Today's legislation builds on that by requiring the Federal  Government to finally finish the feasibility studies for the five  storage projects in California. Then we reform the permitting process  so other projects aren't held up for years trying to get approval from  a dozen different agencies.   So I want to thank Congressman David Valadao for his hard work, his  persistence on this issue. Ultimately, American citizens haven't gotten  the water they need because their government was failing them. Last  year's bill was the start to change all that. Today, we take another  major step to bring our communities the water they contract and pay  for.                                time  1730    Now, Mr. Chairman, you are going to hear a lot of people on this side  of the aisle talk about the need from California. Unfortunately, on the  other side of the aisle, it looks like you will just hear from one.  That should show you the need and desire of why this bill is so  important.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this debate is causing the fact checking machines to  melt down, unfortunately. We just heard that there hasn't been a single  major storage project in California since the 1970s. That is going to  come as shocking news to the folks of the Metropolitan Water District  which completed a huge storage project, Diamond Valley, during that  period. It will certainly surprise the folks in Contra Costa, which  completed Los Vaqueros without any special environmental shortcuts and  with their own financing for the most part. It will surprise local  water districts around the State, including my own Marin Municipal  Water District, which completed two dam expansion projects in that same  timeframe. It will surprise the folks at the current and semitropic  groundwater banks that expanded significantly groundwater storage  during that timeframe.   In fact, the truth is, California has added nearly 6 million acre  feet of new storage, surface and groundwater storage, over the past few  decades in this timeframe we have been talking about. So facts really  do matter.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters).   Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in  support of H.R. 23, the GROW Act, which makes important and necessary  regulatory reforms to allow for better management of water resources  throughout the West.   My home State of California recently suffered its worst drought on  record, which significantly affected the entire State. Families,  communities, workers, and businesses all made significant sacrifices to  conserve water and mitigate the drought's impact.   I applaud the water agencies and residents in my home district of  Orange County for taking the necessary steps to adapt to the severe  drought conditions. While substantial rainfall this winter effectively  ended California's drought, the recent crisis was not just from a lack  of rain. It is also the result of failed State and Federal policies  that have mismanaged critical water resources throughout the West.   The GROW Act is a crucial step toward addressing these failed  policies. H.R. 23 will help California recover from this devastating  drought and ensure the State is better equipped to handle future water  deficiencies.   In addition to addressing water delivery and water rights issues, the  bill also facilitates the development of new water storage projects,  which is a key water management tool for southern California water  agencies. These projects are critical to a number of California  communities, like Orange County, that lack the access to water even  during nondrought conditions. The GROW Act removes regulatory barriers  from streamlining the permitting and approval process for new  infrastructure projects.   Under current law, new water storage construction projects require  approval from a number of Federal, State, and local agencies. This bill  provides for a consolidated permitting process that would require  Federal agencies to conduct coordinated reviews of non-Federal storage  projects.   The GROW Act will also expedite feasibility studies for much-needed  Federal storage projects, some of which have been unnecessarily delayed  for years.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Knight).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I think it is time to fact check the fact checker.   The last major reservoir of over a million acre feet was in 1979. It  was in New Melones, 2.3 million acre feet. The two reservoirs that the  gentleman referenced combined are less than a million acre feet. They  would fill New Melones to less than half of that amount.   With respect to water salinity, the Bay-Delta Accord, that is  codified by this bill, guarantees the water necessary to combat salt  water intrusion.   And finally, I would point out that, no, dams don't create water.  Nature creates water. Dams store that water from wet years so that we  have plenty of it in dry years. That is where we have fallen a  generation behind in our needs precisely because of the laws that the  gentleman from California doggedly defends.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate the redefinition of ``major water  storage  [[Page H5511]]  projects.'' It is not a definition that I think is recognized anywhere  else other than just now on this floor, but I appreciate it.   Mr. Chair, there are many problems with this bill, and I do want to  urge my colleagues to oppose it. I can't keep track of the number of  times the State of California has come up in our debate here these last  several minutes. So let's look to the State of California and see what  the State of California says about this bill.   The Governor of the State of California opposes it in a hard-hitting  letter that went out to the California delegation and others just a few  days ago. The new attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra, wrote  an equally critical letter opposing this bill. Both U.S. Senators from  California oppose this bill.   It is going nowhere in the Senate and will not become law because of  fundamental flaws that have been brought up each of the past several  years that this bill has been introduced in this Congress.   It overrides California State sovereignty and State water laws in  ways that are unacceptable to the people of California and to the  government of California. So when we keep bringing up California, let's  just be very clear that California doesn't want this bill. California  opposes this bill.   Now, I represent the downstream end of some of these water systems  that we are talking about. When we talk about people and fish and jobs,  it is important to remember that fishing jobs matter, too. In the  communities that I represent, and also communities throughout Oregon  and Washington that depend on California salmon runs, they are hurting.   This summer we are going to probably see a closure, for all intents  and purposes, of the commercial salmon season. We are certainly going  to see a closure of the Yurok Tribal Salmon Fishery for the second year  in a row. That is not only economically devastating to Tribal  communities that I represent, it has an emotional impact as well. These  are communities that are hurting. In fact, the Yurok are reporting  suicide rates among young people that are alarmingly high. The closure  of this sacred fishery that is their grocery store, that is a sacred  part of their existence, is certainly not going to help, and I think  could very well contribute to the very severe problems that they are  experiencing.   Fishing jobs matter, the environment matters, downstream communities  that depend on this water that would be redistributed and reallocated  by Congress through this short-sighted bill, that all matters, too.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this wrong-headed bill,  and I urge my colleagues across the aisle to do what we have been  inviting them to do each of the past several years, and that is to  reach across the aisle on bipartisan, commonsense water solutions.  There is a lot that we could do together. Many of my colleagues served  with me in the California State legislature. They know, because we did  it together, that there is a different way. There is a better way.   We were able to pass landmark, bipartisan water legislation during  our time together in Sacramento, and we did it because we didn't try to  pick winners and losers. We found all sorts of low-hanging fruit and  consensus solutions, and we came up with something that was supported  across party lines, and in every region of the State. We can do that  here, too, but we won't do it through this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Abundance or shortage, that is the question. And I want to thank and  salute Mr. Valadao for his work on this issue and for putting that  choice so clearly before the House today.   It is true, we can choose to continue down this sad road that we have  been on. That means increasingly severe government-induced shortages.  It means higher and higher water and grocery prices and a permanently  declining quality of life for our children who will be required to  stretch and ration every drop of water in their bleak and parched  homes.   With this bill, we choose a different future. We choose abundance. We  choose a future in which water flows again to the fertile fields of the  Central Valley, providing full employment for families and affordable  groceries from America's agricultural cornucopia. It is a future in  which families need not watch their gardens shrivel and die, and towns  and cities need not fear mandatory water rationing and uncertain and  unpredictable supplies.   It is a future in which long-established water rights are safe and  secure from the whims of politicians and bureaucrats. We choose a  future in which thriving populations of young salmon can swim to the  sea unmolested by the non-native predators that now kill 90 percent of  them before they reach the ocean; a future in which new fish hatcheries  assure the release of millions of additional salmon to supply a revived  and rapidly expanding commercial fishing industry.   We choose a future in which great new reservoirs can store vast  amounts of water in wet years to assure abundance in dry ones; a future  in which families can enjoy the prosperity that abundant water and  hydroelectricity and affordable groceries provide, and the quality of  life that comes from that prosperity. Abundance or shortage? That is  the question. We choose abundance.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I also represent northern California. My  friend, Mr. LaMalfa, just said that this bill fully protects northern  California's water. Well, we represent the two districts right next to  each other that are the northernmost districts in California, and I can  tell you, my part of northern California doesn't do so well under this  bill.   In fact, the only way we have been able to prevent a repeat of a  catastrophic fish kill disaster in the Klamath River system each of the  last several years has been by releasing cold water in the Trinity  River, which is a major tributary to the lower Klamath River. That has  been a lifesaver for the communities downstream that depend on those  salmon runs. This bill would legislatively prohibit the Bureau of  Reclamation from ever doing that again.   So this is not a bill that is good for northern California,  certainly, my part of northern California. And I think the same goes  for the other northern California colleagues that we heard testify in  opposition earlier.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, providing flexibility for more parts of  California does not, indeed, punish any other part of northern  California. With that, we have to dispel some of these notions about  what the end goal is for this legislation and for my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Fresno, California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close. How much time do I  have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) has 45  seconds remaining, and the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman) has  2 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, indeed, the water battles in California  have been very difficult for many, many years, but what I hear from the  other side of the aisle is a whole lot of ``no.'' What I hear from  normal Californians who aren't in positions of elected leadership who  seem to be more interested in catering to a few environmental groups  instead of the needs of Californians, especially on the heels of  drought, what these Californians are saying is: Get this stuff done.  Get these projects done. Help us out. Help us to have jobs in our State  and not cater to just a handful of interests here that will help us  through another election.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to present the amendment and proud to work  with these folks, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I actually have no problem with my  colleague's attempt to make a clarification to this bill. That  clarification is needed, I am sure, but it is important to realize that  the reason it is needed is because we haven't gone through regular  order. We are talking about provisions that have not had the benefit of  hearings, of markups, of witness testimony, clarifications that would  have been made in the regular order process.   The underlying bill, it is important to remember, does enormous  damage to California water law. That is why it is opposed by the  Governor, by our attorney general, by our two U.S. Senators, and by  many members of the California delegation.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).   The amendment was agreed to.                     Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Costa    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in part C of House Report 115-212.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to quickly offer my support  for my colleague's amendment. This is a commonsense amendment that  recognizes the tremendous potential that groundwater storage  represents. This is one of the most important tools in our water  management toolbox. We know that our future hydrology will be less  certain because of climate change. It is going to make droughts across  our country more frequent and severe.   This amendment will help make sure we are taking the appropriate  steps to prepare. So I want to thank my colleague for this forward- thinking amendment, and I support its adoption.    Mr. Chairman, I want to express my support for this  amendment as well.   The headwaters of our watersheds play a crucial role in ensuring the  reliability and the quality of water supplies throughout our State. Our  water supply depends not just on artificial reservoirs, but also on  natural reservoirs of snowpack and groundwater retention in the forests  of these headwater areas.   Healthy, vibrant forests provide multiple benefits, including carbon  capture and shade to reduce rapid snowmelt. When they are properly  protected, forest soils act like sponges to absorb rainfall and slowly  release it back into rivers and streams throughout the year.   This amendment is one of the many ways that we can ensure that the  Bureau of Reclamation is building a 21st century water supply system  for California and the West, so I strongly encourage support for it.    Mr. Chairman, in defense of the economics of water  recycling, I need to correct the record.   The WateReuse Research Foundation has found that recycling projects  tend to be among the cheapest ways to increase water supply. Potable  water reuse is generally comparable or less expensive than alternative  options.   The Congressional Research Service has found that title 16 water  recycling projects are comparable in price to alternate water sources-- in some cases, substantially cheaper--and there is vast new potential  to develop these water supplies.   This is exactly the kind of forward-thinking conversation we ought to  have if we are serious about California water.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I would simply cite to my friend the  California Public Utilities Commission report in 2016, and what would  be the cost of future sources of water for California. They say very  clearly that recycling water is nearly four times as costly as  traditional sources of water, and that is being generous.   I support any water project that pencils out. This one does not. This  one would require water bills to quadruple. For California, it is  exactly policies like these that are driving water bills up. The people  of California need to take note of that and to realize the choices they  make at the ballot box have real world implications to the bills they  are paying for simple things like water and power.   Mr. Chair, I ask for a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Pearce    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6  printed in part C of House Report 115-212.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed.   The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from California?   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I object.   The Acting CHAIR. Objection is heard.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed.   The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from California?   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I object.   The Acting CHAIR. Objection is heard.    Mr. Chair, I certainly appreciate that my colleagues are  trying to help mitigate a small amount of the harm caused by this bill,  but, unfortunately, the underlying bill remains a disaster for Indian  Country.   Title 5 of this bill is a direct attack against the existing rights  of Tribes in my district. As I have said previously, the salmon in the  Klamath River system are the grocery store, the church, the lifeline  for the Tribes in my district, and this bill explicitly prevents  Federal agencies from making emergency water releases to combat fish  disease and prevent massive fish kills that would devastate these  Tribal balance fisheries.   That is important to remember, lest we get too carried away with  whatever curative effects this amendment might have.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5-minute vote.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 230,  noes 190, not voting 13, as follows:                               [Roll No. 352]                                 AYES--230       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta  [[Page H5533]]        Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costa      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Cuellar      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Gutierrez      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
