Southern Maryland National Heritage Area Act                                 H.R. 2024         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Southern Maryland National       Heritage Area Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) National heritage area.--The term ``National Heritage       Area'' means the Southern Maryland National Heritage Area       established by section 3(a).        (2) Local coordinating entity.--The term ``Local       Coordinating Entity'' means the local coordinating entity for       the National Heritage Area designated by this Act.        (3) Management plan.--The term ``management plan'' means       the management plan for the Heritage Area required under       section 5(a).        (4) Map.--The term ``map'' means the map entitled       ``Southern Maryland National Heritage Area Proposed       Boundary'', numbered 672/177,225, and dated August 2021.        (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.        (6) State.--The term ``State'' means the State of  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 8294.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Over this last year, Congress began to restore our investments after  the years of disinvestment that working families, the middle class, and  vulnerable people believe was wrong. Spending has favored the biggest  corporations and special interests, which got heard first in  Washington. But hardworking Americans are still paying high taxes and  have not seen a pay increase in years.   The spike in the cost of living, gas prices, and rent are blows to so  many. That has guided our priorities, and it has guided these bills.   In the Appropriations Committee, we were determined to put together  bills that ensure we offset the rise in prices produced by blocked  supply chains, the greed of oil companies, and the Russian invasion of  Ukraine.   H.R. 8294, the package of the six 2023 appropriations bills before  us, provides the critical funding America needs. Instead of catering to  big corporations and the wealthy, we uphold our commitment with this  legislation that helps lower the cost of living, creates American jobs,  gives working families a better shot, and supports small businesses. As  we do so, we tackle our Nation's and the world's toughest crises.   We reach some of our most vulnerable Americans by funding the  programs that keep roofs over the heads of millions and keep food on  the tables of millions more. We strengthen nutrition assistance through  WIC, food stamps, and child nutrition programs like school meals. We  increase access to affordable housing with rental assistance programs  and improve the safety and living conditions of those in public  housing. We also expand opportunities for families with support for  homeownership programs.   These bills help invigorate rural communities as we expand broadband,  strengthen water programs in rural areas, and invest in single-family  home loans.   We support Native Americans and honor the Federal Government's  responsibilities to Native families by investing in strong and  resilient Tribal communities, including through housing, education, and  healthcare programs.   We also transform the ways we meet the needs of our veterans, who  deserve and who have earned our support, including the 9.2 million  veterans who rely on the VA for their healthcare, by increasing funding  for medical programs. For the first time ever, we put VA medical care  into its own funding category so that funding for veterans does not  have to compete with other critical programs.   Supporting those who protect us also means protecting servicemembers  and their families and communities all over our Nation. We invest in  our national security and improve our military readiness through robust  investments in critical military installations at home and abroad and  in the well-being of our servicemembers and their families.   At the same time, we also make our communities safer by supporting  victims while fighting crime, violence, and corruption.   This package strengthens our capacity to work for all Americans. We  ensure the IRS has the resources to crack down on big corporations and  the wealthy who do not pay their fair share and provide better customer  service to families navigating the tax system. We protect consumers  with more funding for critical consumer protection agencies by  strengthening our food safety  [[Page H6734]]  infrastructure, including oversight of the baby formula industry.   We do this while bolstering economic development in distressed  communities and strengthening our economy and our economic growth by  supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs as they pursue the  American Dream. We create jobs and put Americans to work rebuilding our  infrastructure. We help small businesses grow and thrive, foster the  green energy jobs of tomorrow, and support a skilled and growing  workforce.   We confront the existential threat of climate change and strengthen  our resiliency on various fronts, including by investing in cleaner,  safer, and more affordable American energy, advancing climate science,  conserving our land and water, expanding environmental enforcement, and  embracing stronger environmental justice efforts.   Finally, with inclusion of nearly 2,700 community project funding  requests totaling over $6 billion, we are directly meeting the needs of  Americans everywhere in ways that will have a profound and lasting  impact.   When taken together, this package meets the moment at a time when so  many want to see critical changes in our priorities. It reaches every  corner of our Nation to give hardworking Americans, the middle class,  and the vulnerable a better shot. I urge my colleagues to support these  bills.   I thank the subcommittee staff, led by our clerks, for all of their  work: Christina Monroe with the Transportation, and Housing and Urban  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee; Martha Foley with the  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee; Scott McKee with the Energy and Water  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee; Matt Smith with  Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee; Rita Culp with  the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee; and Jenny  Neuscheler with the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee.   I also thank all the subcommittee chairs and ranking members for  their efforts and their dedication to these efforts. Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chair Pingree is not  here today, but I specifically thank her for her work. This bill makes  transformative investments in our environment, and this is in large  part because of her relentless advocacy.   Madam Chair, I urge support for the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Energy and  Water Development, and Related Agencies.    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio.                                time  1345    These investments in the Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of  Reclamation are critical to protecting and supplying communities in  every district of our Nation.   Our bill increases funding for regional commissions which promote  economic development in economically challenged regions and distressed  counties across our country. Our bill will strengthen the foundational  components that underpin every aspect of decent life in our Nation and  represents a strategic investment in America's future, without  question.   Madam Chair, I thank the staff who worked tirelessly to put this bill  together: Scott McKee, Brian Smith, Will Ostertag, Daniela Todesco,  Eric Lipka, John Howes, and Angie Giancarlo.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Before I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina, I would say that  Chairman Price, this will be the last time he brings an appropriations  bill to the floor of the House of Representatives. I think I speak for  all of us when I say that his honesty, his integrity, his commitment to  the legislative process and making it work for the people, not only in  his district but all over the United States, is really pretty  extraordinary.   I quote from Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman who  was elected to the House of Representatives, when she said that public  service is the rent you pay for space on this Earth.     David Price has paid that rent over and over and over again.   Madam Chair, it gives me great pleasure to yield 6 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), the chairman of the  Transportation, and Housing, and Urban Development, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House of  Representatives.    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who is the chair of the Subcommittee  on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley), the chairman of the Financial Services and  General Government Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, first, let me just say, I thank the ranking member (Ms.  Granger) for her commitment and her dedication to the Appropriations  Committee and the process, a place where she has spent a number of  years in the various subcommittees, and it is an honor to work with her  in this effort.   I applaud the funding bills that help the middle class, working  families, and small businesses, in what are desperate times. And that  is what these bills do is to provide that kind of assistance to these  families. I am proud to support these bills.   I listened to my colleagues about inflation, what they failed to  mention, which has been really demonstrated, is that we are looking at  oil companies who have consolidated; and what they are doing is buying  back their stock, instead of lowering the price of gas.   They now have 26 million acres of Federal land in which they could  deal with extraction, and they have the permits, but they refuse to do  it. They are in the business of buying back their stock, thereby  increasing inflation by keeping gas prices high.   We have the same situation in the meat industry with meat, poultry,  and pork, which is continuing to raise the price because of the  consolidation.   I would just mention one other thing. In the recommendations to vote  ``no'' on this package, it just is interesting to look at what my  colleagues view as not wanting to do; that is, to provide an increase  for the Internal Revenue Service. Why is that money provided to the  IRS? It is really to look at those corporations who are not paying  their fair share of taxes.   So they are not much interested in seeing them pay their fair share  of taxes, or the wealthiest of individuals who don't pay their fair  share of taxes.   They also do not want to provide money for women, infants, and  children for food. They don't want to provide money for food security,  for people who are on the food stamp program.   They don't want to do anything for domestic manufacturing on clean  energy, which could lower the cost of energy. So, there is a bit of  disingenuousness on what we are doing with the cost.   I am proud to support these bills. I urge my colleagues to support  the six-bill appropriations package, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lee), the chairwoman of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related  Programs Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 1232, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   While I have offered this en bloc amendment for the purposes of  legislative efficiency, I strongly oppose it. This en bloc amendment  makes severe and harmful cuts to the minibus.   The draconian cuts are indiscriminate, they are harmful, and they  seek to overturn long overdue investments. I urge all Members to oppose  this en bloc amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Quigley), the chair of the Subcommittee on Financial Service and  General Government.    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Price), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Chair, if my colleagues on the other side were so  interested in really reducing inflation, I would hope that they would  be supportive of the child tax credit, which none of them have  supported, which, in fact, the majority of the people using the child  tax credit are dealing with food, with clothing, with school supplies,  with rent, but all of these expenses have gone up, and the money has  run out.   They can't find their way clear to support a child tax credit, and  that  [[Page H6840]]  lack of action from the Congress to renew the child tax credit is  trouble, it is big trouble for these families, especially as the costs  of life continue to swell due to inflation.   Let's look at the cost of inflation and why we have inflation and  take a look at what the oil companies are doing with price gouging.  What we ought to do is to do a windfall profits tax on people who are  making money hand over fist and refuse to lower the price of gasoline  at the pump because they are buying back stock to take care of  themselves and their stakeholders.   That is a portion of what is causing inflation and the rise in the  cost of living. If you were genuine about that, you would look at these  matters as well as just talking about inflation and not looking at the  root causes of it today.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 1232, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 45 seconds. The en bloc  amendment includes a number of proposals offered by my Democratic and  Republican colleagues. I urge my colleagues to support the important  proposals contained in this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Schrier).    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the chair of the Agriculture, Rural Development,  Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 1232, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 45 seconds.   The amendments en bloc includes a number of proposals offered by my  Democratic colleagues. It reflects our shared values of investing in  the American people to create good-paying jobs, grow opportunity, and  provide a lifeline to the vulnerable.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the important proposals  contained in this en bloc, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of amendment No. 66  included in En Bloc 3 and sponsored by Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez of  New York. I am a cosponsor of this amendment, which supports an  increase of $1 billion for the Nutrition Assistance Program in Puerto  Rico for Fiscal Year 2023 .    Unlike the 50 states, the U.S, Virgin Islands, and Guam, Puerto Rico  does not participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,  known as SNAP. Instead, we have the NAP block grant, which provides  capped funding and serves over 1.4 million of my constituents on the  Island.   Due to limited funds, NAP does not automatically adjust to increases  in demand These are most common in the aftermath of natural disasters,  like we saw after the hurricanes in 2017, and most recently the COVID- 19 pandemic. Because of this, we have had to turn to Congress on  multiple occasions to advocate for additional emergency NAP funds,  included in various disaster supplementals.   The most recent allotment, provided due to COVID-19, was expended  last month, meaning Island residents who rely on this program have  already noticed a significant reduction in their monthly benefits as we  continue managing the challenges related to the pandemic and the rising  costs of food. Additional funds are needed since, for many, NAP is the  main program that secures their access to a healthy diet.   Mr. Speaker, the true remedy to this issue is a transition to SNAP.  Currently, NAP beneficiaries in PR receive far less in monthly benefits  than their counterparts in SNAP, and don't have access to programs like  D-SNAP. which is a vehicle to get expedited disaster assistance without  depending on supplemental legislation. As such, I have introduced H.R.  5220, the Puerto Rico Nutrition Assistance Fairness Act, which  transitions Puerto Rico from NAP to SNAP, and I continue working with  stakeholders to gather additional input on this issue moving forward.   Still, there is an immediate need at hand. As such, I support this  and every effort that seeks to secure additional funds for NAP and  underscores the need to transition to SNAP   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 1232, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I oppose these amendments en bloc. Davis-Bacon is a pretty simple  concept and a fair one. What does the Davis-Bacon Act do? It protects  the government as well as workers in carrying out the policy of paying  a decent wage on government contracts.   The Davis-Bacon Act requires that workers on federally funded  construction projects be paid no less than the wages paid in the  community for similar work. It requires that every contract for  construction to which the Federal Government is a party, in excess of  $2,000, contain a provision defining the minimum wages paid to various  classes of laborers and mechanics.   The House has taken numerous votes on this issue, and on every vote  this body has voted to maintain Davis-Bacon requirements. We should not  be attacking working-class people, men and women who work every single  day for a decent paycheck, and their wages haven't been increased with  the cost of inflation. We should defeat the amendment before us today,  and we should move on to more important matters.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Price), the chairman of the Transportation, Housing and  Urban Development, and Related Agencies for appropriations.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I just remind my colleagues,  this body has rejected this amendment on a bipartisan basis time and  time again.   Speaking about inflation, we know that wages have not kept up with  inflation, and working people are struggling, living paycheck to  paycheck. Why are we dealing with an amendment that would try to  curtail wages and prevailing wages for workers every day who go on a  job and put forth all of their efforts to be able to get a decent wage  to take care of their children, to be able to deal with inflation?   It speaks loudly of my colleagues who refuse to believe that we need  to have wages increase to help people fight inflation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 1232, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume in  closing.   Mr. Chair, while I have offered this en bloc amendment for  legislative efficiency, I strongly oppose it.   The en bloc amendment makes severe, harmful changes to the bills that  are under consideration. Included in the en bloc amendments there is a  limitation on the Environmental Protection Agency to be able to hire  new employees and detrimental efforts to the environment; it limits  access to voting; and, in particular, infringes on a woman's access to  healthcare. These amendments do not move our country forward, they  really are harmful to all Americans.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 1232, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 45 seconds. The en bloc  includes a number of proposals offered by my Democratic colleagues. It  reflects our shared values of investing in the American people to  create good-paying jobs, to grow opportunity, and provide a lifeline to  the vulnerable.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the important proposals  contained in this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley), who is the chairman of the Financial Services  and General Government Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Auchincloss).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Torres of New York) having assumed the chair, Ms. Wild, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  8294) making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, and  Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2023, and for other purposes, and has come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
