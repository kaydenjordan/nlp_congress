 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Little Rock Central High  School's flag line and marching band for participating in the events  marking the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.   Known as the Stereophonic Storm of the Mid-South, Central's flag line  and marching band joined several high school bands across the Nation at  the annual Waikiki holiday parade to commemorate this historic moment.   Led by band director Brice Evans, the school's trip lasted an entire  week, giving our students the chance to having an unforgettable  experience by meeting Pearl Harbor survivors and enjoying Thanksgiving  in Hawaii.   With their seemingly limitless enthusiasm and spirit, the Central  High  [[Page H61]]  School band continues to represent themselves with determination and  dedication that make all Arkansans proud. As a long time friend and  supporter of all things for Central High, congratulations. I look  forward to following the band's continued success.                            ____________________
