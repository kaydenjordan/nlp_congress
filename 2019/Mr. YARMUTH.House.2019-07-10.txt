 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 476, the  rule allowing for consideration of the National Defense Authorization  Act, including my amendment to, once and  [[Page H5318]]  for all, repeal the SBP-DIC offset, commonly known as the widow's tax.   I would like to thank Chairman Smith and Chairman McGovern for their  work to include my amendment in this bill. I also want to thank the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) for his continued stalwart  leadership on the issue.   I got involved in this issue several years ago when I was contacted  by a constituent of mine named Ellen. She emailed me to tell me about  the unfair burden being placed on an estimated 64,000 surviving spouses  and families of the men and women of our military, forcing them to  forfeit all or part of an annuity purchased by their beloved fallen  heroes.   In the final paragraph of Ellen's email, she mentioned a First  Sergeant in the U.S. Army who suffered a heart attack during his  required physical training in 2002. That First Sergeant was her  husband.   It became clear to me that Congress' mistake more than 4 decades ago  was now negatively impacting one of my constituents, a constituent who  was already grieving the loss of her husband. And while I am  heartbroken by the reason Ellen was forced to become an advocate on  this issue, to this day I am very thankful she contacted me.   Including this provision to ax the widow's tax in must-pass NDAA  legislation is likely our only shot in this Congress to end the unfair  offset once and for all. I want to urge my colleagues to support this  rule and final passage of this bill. We have tried for years to get  this right and now we finally can.   Stand up for Gold Star families and support this rule and the  underlying legislation. The spouses and children of our fallen heroes  have sacrificed enough.
