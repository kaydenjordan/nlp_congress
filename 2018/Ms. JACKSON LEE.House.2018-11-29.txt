 Mr. Speaker, the uniqueness of this Nation is the  idea that we have coddled democracy, freedom, and justice. We have  maintained a constitutional government and have been respected  worldwide. This has been through wars, times of peace, times of  depression, and times of devastation in our own Nation. Yet, we remain  a Nation that has a moral guidepost.   I rise today to announce to this House that America can do two things  at once. It can condemn the terroristic, violent act of killing a Saudi  reporter who worked at the Washington Post, and, at the same time,  maintain its status and prominence to engage in the affairs of the  Middle East, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the legislation that is now  moving through procedurally in the United States Senate to remove our  support for the Yemen war that the Saudis have enacted upon against the  people of Yemen and stand against the violent acts against children-- the killing of children on school buses, which has happened over and  over again--and the bloodshed and starvation that is going on in Yemen  with our affirmation.   It is time now to end that bloody war with our handprints on it. I  hope the other body will engage in debate and be fully informed by this  thoughtful, bipartisan legislation. I believe that it should come to  the House and that we should act on it with all expeditiousness.   Now just imagine that a tape exists, which I believe Members of  Congress should have the right to listen to, but I understand we are  brilliant people and our imaginations are vivid. Imagine that you went  into a consular's office with the hopes and dreams of a new marriage.  You are following the codes and laws of your native land to get  permission to marry again, to have joy again, to be able to be with  someone you love.   Rather than having the process on paper, your blood was splattered on  the floor. You are greeted with a brutal force that demanded whatever-- loyalty to the crown prince--and you were bludgeoned and killed by  allegedly the biggest untruth: it was an accident. Then, tragically, to  your family comes the evidence or the word that you were mutilated or  dismembered.   Our imagination, tragically, can allow us to see that picture,  ordered by the crown prince. We must cease and desist any relationship  in this war and, at the same time, maintain diplomacy.   Mr. Speaker, we also need to be more merciful to those who are at the  border. As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, we have  created this crisis here in the government, the White House, and the  administration. We must be humanitarians. Tear gas can be used to  protect our men and women at the border, but it must be used sparingly  and not against mothers and children.   I hope to be able to discuss this issue. I hope to be down at the  border to see this disgraceful behavior. We can do better in feeding  them and providing cover as they are processed. Our law has not  changed. You can seek a legal asylum request to enter the legal ports  of entry--even those who are not. The White House knows that. Let us  not be known for the brutality against women and children as we have  been known to separate women and children.   Finally, again, as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, we  need to rush disaster housing assistance to California. None of us have  seen the magnitude of the Camp fire fires. FEMA has not provided  disaster housing assistance. The President must issue that order. We  must rush to provide for those people who are homeless. We know that it  is more efficient to provide funding for housing as opposed to hotels.  They are begging for it. I believe that we should convene a Homeland  Security hearing to be able to assist these individuals as quickly as  possible.   Where is the humanitarian moral compass of this Nation to stop  killing children in Yemen; to understand that we must help those  suffering refugees at the border; and finally, Mr. Speaker, to help our  neighbors in California get housing after everything is gone?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the Nation loves its history. We in  Texas love our history. Today, I rise to encourage and to announce the  legislation that reflects history.   H.R. 4745, to designate the Emancipation National Historic Trail, is  a wonderful legislative initiative that reflects history in the State  of Texas and throughout the Nation.   We are all reminded of the Emancipation Proclamation that was issued  in 1863. We know that there were areas of the South that did not get  the word that the slaves were free for 2 years.   Earlier this week, I celebrated the commemoration of the birthday of  the Honorable Mickey Leland, who died some years ago alongside an  Ethiopian mountain while attempting to feed those struggling. But he  believed in stopping food insecurity.   In honor of him, reflecting on the history of our community, I ask my  colleagues to sign on to H.R. 4745 because it recounts the announcement  by Captain Granger that the slaves were finally free in Texas and  throughout the Southwest, and creates a wonderful trail that all of us  can enjoy that chronicles the story from Galveston to Houston.   Mr. Speaker, this is legislation that says that America can accept  all of our history, and I ask you to join H.R. 4745.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California  for her unceasing--unceasing--commitment to the National Flood  Insurance Program. I can't thank her enough.   I know that my colleagues and I are from different States, but how  many have walked through gutted homes and seen families full of sorrow  and tears? Hurricane Harvey was the singular largest flood next to, of  course, Hurricane Michael. Mr. Speaker, 51 trillion gallons of water in  2017. How many have walked in Puerto Rico to see the devastation, as I  have, or walked in the U.S. Virgin Islands and seen homes and hotels  and places for home and for business devastated?   The National Flood Insurance Program is a necessity. I wish this was  a longer extension. But I have seen the desperation of those who have  suffered. They need flood insurance. And those of us who have felt the  pain of the fires in California driven by the Camp fire know that they  need aid as well.                                time  1700    If you want to know a number, what about $1 trillion plus in the tax  scam bill that was passed where my constituents say they have not seen  one dime from the tax bill, and here we are going to be on the floor  tomorrow with a tax extender.  [[Page H9713]]    So I ask the question: Can we help desperate families by ensuring  that this program goes for a week and that we can do better? Yes, we  can do better. But let's stop the pain now with homes that are about to  close. With real estate, builders, and others, the economic engine has  been, in many instances, the buying and selling of homes.   This is an important extension, but let's be truthful. You can't  match up billions to a trillion, and you can't match up the pain of  families looking at gutted homes versus fat cats filling their pockets  with a tax scam. I ask for the support of this bill.
