 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues in the  House to support the 2018 NDAA conference report.   This body has no higher or more urgent priority than providing for  the common defense and restoring our military readiness. I am proud of  the final text that my colleagues in the House and Senate worked  together on so diligently.   Not only does this legislation authorize a total of nearly $700  billion in defense spending, a $26 billion increase above the  President's budget request, but it also provides the largest pay raise  for our troops in 8 years.   This NDAA also gets us closer to the critical goal of a 355-ship Navy  and includes funding for three littoral combat ships, helping to meet  the Navy's urgent and enduring requirement for more small surface  combatants.   I want to thank Chairman Thornberry for his leadership and my  colleagues in the House and Senate who fought tooth and nail to give  our warfighters the resources they need to deter threats, support our  allies, and, above all, keep the American people safe.
