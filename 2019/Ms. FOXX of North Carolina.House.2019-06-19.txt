 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize  today's guest chaplain, Pastor Ryan Hodges of Rocky Face Baptist Church  in Hiddenite, North Carolina.   In 2005, Pastor Hodges earned his theology degree from Cherry Grove  Baptist Bible College in Wilkesboro. He has since served in four  churches in our State, wherever God has called him to use his gift of  preaching and zeal for souls. He is also a loving husband and father.   Mr. Speaker, the surest way to make a positive change in our country  is to follow God's will for our lives, which is itself a lifetime's  work.   North Carolina's Fifth District is blessed to have a faithful servant  in Pastor Hodges, dedicated to helping others recognize God's love and  plan for them. We are blessed to have his prayers and service today, as  is everyone that God places in his life.                            ____________________     Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman  for yielding.   Madam Chairwoman, this amendment is about preventing harm to  communities and supporting local control. The Youth PROMISE program was  enacted as a part of the broader and very bipartisan Juvenile Justice  and Delinquency Prevention Act reauthorization.   These reforms were focused on giving States and local authorities the  ability to help prevent delinquency and put these young people on a  path to success. Delinquency prevention is the key to helping local  communities thrive, and the Youth PROMISE program will be a critical  tool in their work.   I particularly like this program because it is not a one-size-fits- all approach, as Washington so often wants to do. Rather, this program  is a complete toolbox of options for State and local officials to  determine what is needed to help them address the problems they may be  facing, or, even better, help young people before there is real  trouble. That is what prevention is all about.   I also like this program because it is the essence of true  bipartisanship, and it was the authorizing committee coming together to  evaluate the need, consider the evidence, and develop a better plan to  help people in need.   I should not be surprised, but I was when I saw the Appropriations  Committee continued to fund their projects rather than building off of  the hard, bipartisan work of the authorizing committee. If we want  Washington to work, we need to start by having the appropriators work  more closely with the authorizers.   While this amendment will not address all of these issues, it is a  start. These funds will help make this a program that we will be able  to assess and, hopefully, see some real success.   I was pleased Mr. Scott and I were able to come to an agreement on  positive reforms that will help young people in all of our communities  last Congress, and I appreciate working with him now on this continued  priority for our committee. I urge support of the amendment.
