 Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted:  ``no'' on rollcall No. 120 (Veto message to accompany H.J. Res. 76-- Borrower Defense CRA); ``yes'' on rollcall No. 121 (MTR on H.R. 51-- Washington DC Admission Act); and ``no'' on rollcall No. 122 (Final  Passage of H.R. 51--Washington DC Admission Act).                             personal explanation
