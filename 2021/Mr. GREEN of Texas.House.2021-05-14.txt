 Mr. Speaker, much has been said about the Civil  Rights Act. Well, what do the organizations that protect and promote  the Civil Rights Act actually say?   More than 220 of them, I might add, say that the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act is critical to promoting economic security for pregnant  workers and their families.   They say that women of color--more than two-thirds of Black women, 55  percent of Native American women, and 41 percent of Latina women--are  the sole primary breadwinners for their families. They say that they  support reasonable accommodations.   They say that a woman ought not be fired or be threatened with being  fired for simply coming to work bearing a child, having a child.   They say that they support this legislation.   But the question really is, who are they? They are the Human Rights  Campaign. They are the Anti-Defamation League. They are the League of  Women Voters of the United States. They are the NAACP. They are the  American Civil Liberties Union. They are the AFL-CIO. They are Mary Kay  Henry. They are the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. They  are the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. They are Rabbi Jonah  Pesner. And they are for this legislation.
