G. Raun.   L.G. and his lovely bride, Linda, are rice farmers from El Campo,  Texas, a third-generation family farm. Both have very capably and  faithfully served the U.S. rice industry all their lives in varying  degrees of leadership within USA Rice.   L.G. recently completed his term as president of the Southwest  Council of Agribusiness, a highly respected consortium of farm and  ranch organizations, agricultural lenders, and allied businesses  serving Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, and Colorado.   Although L.G.'s term as president of the Southwest Council is  concluding, I am confident that he and Linda's role in service to  American agriculture will carry on, and all of agriculture will be  better for it.   I often say, agricultural policy doesn't just impact farm families  like the Rauns, but it impacts every American and everyone who eats.  These are critical matters, and the Rauns deserve a lot of credit for  helping us get it right.   Thank you, L.G., for your strong leadership and your friendship.                            ____________________
