 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7666, the  Restore Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act of 2022.   I am proud to be a member of a committee that works in a bipartisan  way to help solve the problems facing our constituents every day. Right  now, that means addressing the Nation's mental health crisis.  [[Page H5782]]    Though many challenges existed before the start of the COVID-19  pandemic, 2\1/2\ years of widespread fear, social isolation, and  financial uncertainty has further increased Americans' need for mental  health support systems.   This bill reauthorizes many of the critical mental health programs  Americans currently rely on, but also provides for new measures.   Especially important to me is the inclusion of the TRIUMPH for New  Moms Act, a bipartisan bill I coauthored with Representative Barragan.  It aims to establish a no-cost, interdepartmental task force to address  the U.S. maternal mental health crisis by eliminating duplication and  coordinating Federal resources toward maternal mental health.   This task force would also work closely with State Governors to  alleviate the maternal mental health challenges in their States.   Current Federal efforts to support women suffering from maternal  mental health conditions lack coordinated action and organization  toward this issue. And, as a result, 50 percent of these new moms never  receive treatment.   This bill will increase mental health support for pregnant and new  mothers by offering targeted solutions that have proven success, a fact  that is particularly important to me, given Indiana's maternal  mortality rate, which is one of the highest in the Nation.   Passing this bill will help provide better support for future  generations of mothers and children.   Again, I thank the chair and ranking member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee for their dedication to these issues, and I look  forward to passage of H.R. 7666.
