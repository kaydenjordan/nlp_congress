 Madam Speaker, there is no denying that we need to support  an all-of-the-above solution for energy policy to secure our energy  independence. But the Green New Deal which was recently introduced, yet  again, seeks to fundamentally change our way of life, cripple American  businesses, and explode our national debt--$93 trillion, with a T,  which is how much their proposal will cost over the next 10 years.   Let's put that into perspective. $93 trillion is more money than the  Federal Government has spent for the entire period from 1979 until the  present. Madam Speaker, that is absurd. Worse yet, how do the Democrats  propose that we pay for it? By raising the taxes, of course, up to 70  percent. This is outrageous.   It crushes jobs, costs an average American household nearly $700,000  through 2029, provides paychecks for people unwilling to work,  abolishes airplanes, cows, and fossil fuels, and would require  rebuilding and retrofitting every building in America. This is a crazy  policy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, our Nation is in a crisis. We are facing a  real crisis at our southern border. As I speak, hundreds of migrants  are crossing into the United States right now because the Biden  administration has made it clear to the world that the border is open  and the rule of law will not be upheld.   Now, instead of working on solutions to address the ongoing border  crisis, the majority has brought forward legislation that would cripple  our Nation's screening process for individuals entering at U.S. ports  of entry.   Currently, a right to counsel does exist, but it only occurs once a  screening turns from questions on the admissibility of people or goods  to a custodial interrogation relating to a criminal offense.   More efficient, says my colleague from the other side.   This bill would place a significant burden on the men and women of  the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who, prior to the pandemic,  processed over 1 million people daily at various ports of entry. The  CBP regularly conducts over 17 million secondary inspections each year.  That is not more efficient with this legislation.   This legislation would severely limit the CBP's ability to ensure  thorough inspections of all travelers, not only those referred to  secondary inspection, creating unnecessary delays and significant  impacts on daily operations.   This bill misuses taxpayer dollars, puts the interests of foreign  citizens above the interests of American citizens.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
