 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2, the Moving Forward Act. This transformative legislation will  revitalize our Nation's infrastructure, including our most vulnerable  communities.   The last several weeks have, once again, brought attention to the  legacy of vulnerability Black Americans and other minorities suffer at  the hands of a global health crisis, a shuttering economy, and systemic  racism.   With this backdrop, people of color should not assume that this  massive infrastructure bill has little to do with them. In fact, there  are many aspects of H.R. 2 that are intended to assist people who have  routinely been left out and left behind.   One of the most powerful is the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise  program. This program, when properly administered and enforced, ensures  that businesses owned by women and minorities have a fair chance to  compete for federally assisted transportation projects and contracts.   A 2016 report, in my home State of Georgia, found that women- and  minority-owned construction prime contracting businesses earned about 7  cents on the dollar, and women- and minority-owned subcontracting  businesses made about 39 cents on the dollar.   This is unfair, and this evidence abounds. And it is not limited to  any one region. The data underscores the continued need for the DBE  program. I am proud to see it reauthorized in this bill, and I am proud  to have been a part of its reauthorization.    We must right the wrongs of business inequity in this country, and  programs like the DBE, the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program,  will help us do just that.
