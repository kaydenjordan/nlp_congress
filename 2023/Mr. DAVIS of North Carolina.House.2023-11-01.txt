 Mr. Speaker, this week, we salute the  brave men and women who have served our Nation not only in uniform but  also as small business owners.   As we celebrate National Veterans Small Business Week, let's shine a  light on a northeastern North Carolina business.   In Roanoke Rapids, the barbershop Super Cut 2 embodies the spirit of  precision and camaraderie.   Owned by Ronald Barnes, a disabled veteran who dedicated 7 years to  the United States Army, his small business symbolizes an unwavering  commitment to service. Barbers uplift the community, making people feel  and look good.   Mr. Speaker, let us remember the veteran-owned small businesses like  Super Cut 2. They represent the spirit of service and resilience, and  these are great contributors to communities across the Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do  now adjourn.
