 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one  of our strongest and valued leaders in municipal government from my  home State of Louisiana, Mayor Jennifer Vidrine. On July 30, Mayor  Vidrine will be become the first African-American woman to lead the  Louisiana Municipal Association--LMA. She will also be the third woman  to serve in this prestigious position in the LMA's 96 years of service  to municipal government in Louisiana.   While Mayor Vidrine will undoubtedly lead this fine organization for  the next year with great loyalty and enthusiasm, she will also continue  to serve her most beloved residents of Ville Platte. Since her election  in 2011, Mayor Vidrine has not stopped working to bring improvements  and investments to her city. She remains at the forefront of local  government officials developing new approaches to solving complicated  problems.   Mayor Vidrine is a woman of great faith who believes in serving her  community wholeheartedly. She is a lifelong member of her hometown  congregation of the Ninth Missionary Baptist Church, where she serves  and assists in a number of leadership roles.  [[Page S3336]]  Her commitment to the elderly and youth are quite noteworthy and deeply  rooted in her beliefs. Among her many accomplishments, she is the  founder of the Ville Platte Girls and Boys Place where afterschool and  summer programs teach children culinary skills, music appreciation,  improved communications, and writing techniques. During the summer,  Mayor Vidrine is a regular presence at the Girls and Boys Place  offering encouragement to the children to expand their thinking,  explore their passions and to be a good citizen. She works tirelessly  to provide unique opportunities for these young minds, many of which  come from very low-income homes. This, in turn, allows parents to feel  more hopeful that their children will have a better life.   When it comes to technology, Mayor Vidrine has practically taken her  community from ``worst to first'' as she likes to say, by developing  critical partnerships with public and private broadband providers. In  the very near future, the city of Ville Platte will begin enjoying  internet speeds like they have never seen before, thanks in large part  to the mayor's efforts. She knows the importance of technology and how  it has an immediate impact on the lives of every resident.   I consider Mayor Jennifer Vidrine as a most accomplished stateswoman,  and I am extremely proud to call her a friend.   I ask all of Louisiana to join me in congratulating Mayor Vidrine for  reaching this important milestone in her career.                            ____________________
