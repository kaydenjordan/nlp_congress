 Mr. Speaker, President Herbert Hoover once  stated, ``Blessed are the young, for they will inherit the national  debt.''   Four young interns in my office--Nathan Olsen, Jill Oxley, Austin  Snell, and Tyler Wiley--recently shared their concerns about the debt  burden they will inherit from debt-addicted Washington politicians.  These remarks reflect their concerns.   Ironically, their concerns coincide with a massive $2 trillion  deficit bill Congress will soon vote on that bequeaths at least $24  trillion in debt to America's future generations. Bequeathing this  dangerous debt is the greatest disservice ever done by one American  generation to another.   My interns itemize three ways in which excessive debt endangers  America.   First, excessive government debt and borrowing compete with and crowd  out private borrower investment opportunities by decreasing available  credit, thereby costing American jobs and better incomes. According  to the Congressional Budget Office, when the government borrows, it  borrows from people in businesses, which limits American business and  citizen opportunity, which, in turn, drives them to be less productive,  cuts their compensation, and makes them less inclined to work. In sum,  excessive government debt stunts future growth and hurts the American  economy and people.    Second, excessive debt hurts Congress' ability to respond to  challenges and emergencies. The Peter G. Peterson Foundation warns that  high levels of debt reduce our government's flexibility concerning  ``future emergencies, unanticipated challenges, wars, or recessions.''   The Peterson Foundation adds that one reason ``the United States was  able to recover from the Great Recession more quickly than other  countries was because our debt was fairly low, at 35 percent of GDP.''   As recent history proves, America can better respond to a financial  crisis if we are not drowning in excessive debt. Unfortunately, by  year's end, America's debt will explode to roughly 78 percent of GDP,  more than double that of a mere decade ago. That trend is dangerous.   Third, as America's debt becomes more unmanageable, our creditors  become increasingly concerned about government default and national  bankruptcy and insolvency. The Congressional Budget Office warns that  with the debt-to-GDP ratio projected to grow to ``unprecedented levels,  it is increasingly likely that . . . investors will become concerned  about the risk of default.''   America has clearly entered dangerous, uncharted financial waters.  The greater the debt, the greater the risk.   How do we safely navigate these dangerous waters? Washington must  learn from history and heed the advice of President John F. Kennedy,  who said we do not choose to cut spending because it is easy, but  because it is hard. Unfortunately, today's Washington politicians  reject President Kennedy's wisdom because they are as hopelessly  addicted to debt as a junkie is to heroin.   As a result, America faces a mountainous $22 trillion debt and a  bipartisan debt agreement that adds yet another $2 trillion in debt in  just 2 years.   If America is to soar to new heights rather than crash and burn on a  mountain of debt, Washington politicians must act like adults. Our  choice is clear.   Washington can rack up obscene deficits, accumulated debt, and pay  hundreds of billions of dollars each year in debt service costs, with  the ultimate catastrophe being debilitating national insolvency and  bankruptcy. Or Washington can protect America's future, stop  unnecessary spending, and bequeath future generations economic freedom  and prosperity.   Mr. Speaker, I choose the path of economic freedom and prosperity for  future American generations. That is why I vote against so many  unnecessary and excessive spending bills that we don't have the money  to pay for. And that is why I will vote against the proposed spending  deal that creates a short-term debt junkie high while badly risking  America's future and health.                            ____________________
