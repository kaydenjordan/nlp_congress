 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Stanley John Kaczorowski, who passed away on December 23 at the  age of 78.   Mr. Kaczorowski dedicated much of his life to public service in our  Nation's judicial system. Originally from New Jersey, Mr. Kaczorowski  graduated from Seton Hall University Law School before being hired as  the assistant prosecutor for Union County, New Jersey. As assistant  prosecutor, he tried his first murder trial at the age of 25.   After a number of years with the prosecutor's office in New Jersey,  he moved with his family to Georgia's First Congressional District,  specifically Skidaway Island. Here, he continued his dedication to  public service by serving on the Chatham County Board of Elections.   He is survived by his wife, Carole, of 30 years, along with a number  of children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. Mr. Kaczorowski  will be missed.                            ____________________
