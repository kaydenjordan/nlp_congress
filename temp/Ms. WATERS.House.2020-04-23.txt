 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership  and tough negotiations in support of this legislation, H.R. 266.   I not only rise in support of this legislation, the Enhancement Act,  I also would like to rise in support of what we are doing for the  Health Care Enhancement Act in this bill.   And I am going to take a moment to dedicate this legislation to my  dear sister, who is dying in a hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, right  now, infected by the coronavirus.   This legislation provides $370 billion in funding for small  businesses, as well as $100 billion for hospitals and coronavirus  testing. I am pleased that we have been able to set aside $60 billion  for our Nation's community development financial institutions, minority  depository institutions, community banks, credit unions, certified  development companies, and microlenders to directly lend to their small  business customers, who are often minority-owned businesses.   Small businesses and their workers all across the country are in dire  need of assistance and will benefit from this bill. And so with that,  Congress must now immediately turn to the next package of legislation  to provide relief during the pandemic. We need to do much more to help  renters, homeowners, people experiencing homelessness, and mom-and-pop  landlords.   As chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, I am already  working on additional coronavirus relief legislation, including  legislation that creates a $100 billion emergency rental assistance  fund and a $75 billion homeowner assistance fund.   Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 266, and look forward to working with  my colleagues on the next relief package.
