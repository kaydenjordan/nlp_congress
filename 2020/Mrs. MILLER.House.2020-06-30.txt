 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2 because we  need to put an end to the highway robbery before us.   The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has a long history of  bipartisan cooperation, rising above the political games to strengthen  the backbone of our country. However, after the Democrats' power grab  in this year's highway funding bill, that is sadly no longer the case.   When drafting this legislation, my colleagues across the aisle  neither asked for nor accepted input from me or any of my Republican  colleagues. They steamrolled a bill through the committee with so many  irredeemable qualities, you would think they wanted it to fail. After  it passed committee, the bill was gutted of bipartisan amendments  solely because they were introduced by our party.   And it is expensive. At the outset, this legislation cost nearly $500  billion over 5 years, and then they tacked on another trillion in the  last week. It cuts money from where we need it and throws taxpayer  dollars at problems that don't exist.   Our roads and bridges are failing, and projects, many like Corridor H  in West Virginia, are underfunded. This bill hamstrings our State  government and adds red tape instead of flexibility. Rather than  bridging America's urban-rural divide, my Democrat colleagues want to  put the big cities first and ignore our rural communities but still  stick us with the bill.   We need all of America to thrive, from Appalachia to the heartland,  the Rockies to the Rust Belt. We need to build up our entire country to  create a modern economy that offers success to everyone. But here we  are, debating a bill that gives $2 of every $5 to the Green New Deal.   This is partisan messaging, not meaningful policy.   I am disheartened. I am disappointed. And I am disgusted that  politics continue to take precedence over the needs of our country. Our  people want and need better roads. For these reasons and many more my  time will not allow, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for yielding.   I rise in opposition to amendment No. 124 on both the merits and the  process that bring us to the people's House today.   I came to Congress to fix issues in southern West Virginia, like our  need for strong and stable infrastructure and to bring new opportunity  to our State.   During the markup on H.R. 2, I introduced a commonsense amendment to  solve a problem that has been plaguing rural America for years: the  Appalachian Development Highway System. The ADHS is an essential part  of America's highway system and has been since 1965. Its goal is to  connect rural communities with high-quality roadways, allowing us to  transport our goods and people across the country. This system is  instrumental in guaranteeing economic success for all of America.   Unfortunately, outdated funding mechanisms are bogging down progress  by holding taxpayer money hostage in projects that are already  completed while other underfunded projects stay unfinished.   My legislation would fix this problem by freeing up the States to  collaborate on these projects and deliver money in a targeted approach.  There is no additional cost to taxpayers, and it would not cut funding  for any State.   It is good policy that was adopted in the Senate and passed in our  committee without objection by one single member. Bipartisan and  bicameral, what a rare sight for Washington these days.   However, once again, at the eleventh hour, my colleagues across the  aisle added this new language that contradicts my amendment and  threatens the entire livelihood of the ADHS.   Passage of this amendment kills the one I offered. It would cut rural  support for more big-city interests, holding back hardworking people  from the benefits of quality roadways and the job opportunities that  come with it.   It is misplaced priorities like these that lead to Congress' low  approval rating.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose amendment No. 124 so that  we can give Appalachia the respect and service it deserves.
