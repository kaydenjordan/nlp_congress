 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support today for the Child  Care Is Essential Act.   As a working mom, I know that finding quality, affordable childcare  is not easy even under the best of circumstances, but the strain of  COVID-19 has pushed the childcare industry to the brink of collapse.   Nearly half of all childcare providers have closed at some point  during this pandemic, and those that have reopened are facing increased  costs to implement new safety measures, including reduced capacity,  intense and frequent disinfecting and cleaning, and the purchase of PPE  for providers. Without immediate financial support, many are at risk of  closing permanently.   Congress and this administration must recognize there cannot be a  strong and full economic recovery without access to quality, affordable  childcare for working families.   This important bill will create a $50 billion childcare stabilization  fund and invest in childcare across our country to ensure that  providers have the resources they need to safely reopen. The Child Care  Is Essential Act would bring an estimated $985 million to my home State  of Virginia to keep childcare providers open and their employees on  payroll.   Parents simply cannot return to work if they can't find childcare. We  are facing a crisis, and Congress must take decisive action on behalf  of the working families and parents in America.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Child  Care Is Essential Act.
