 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service,  accomplishments, and retirement of Michigan native GEN Joseph M.  Martin.   Joe will pass on the mantle of leadership after 36 years of service  and completes his highly decorated career as the Vice Chief of Staff of  the U.S. Army.   Joe is a proud son of Michigan. Born and raised in Royal Oak and  Dearborn, his family is deeply rooted in the area, with strong ties to  the Ford Motor Company. Joe's grandfather, Leonard Martin, worked there  for 43 years. Joe's father, Leonard Martin Jr., worked there for 42  years.   It was from his father and grandfather that General Martin learned  the Michigan values of honesty, hard work, and service to his  community. And it is these values that General Martin has carried with  him throughout his 36 years in the U.S. Army.   As a child, Joe attended Henry Ford Elementary and Woodworth Junior  High. Before high school, the Martin family moved to the west side of  Dearborn, where Joe attended Clare Bryant Junior High and Dearborn High  before college.   And although Joe's family has a tradition steeped in naval aviation,  Joe took a different path and chose to attend West Point and join the  Army.   General Martin graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1986 and  was commissioned as an armor officer. Throughout the next 30 years,  General Martin would serve in support of America's most significant  large-scale operations and fight in some of the Army's most storied  divisions.   He deployed in support of Operation Desert Storm, twice for Operation  Iraqi Freedom, and as the Combined Joint Force Land Component Commander  for Operation Inherent Resolve.   Among other assignments, Joe served with the 1st Armored Division,  the 4th Infantry Division, U.S. Army Operational Test Command, and  served as the commanding general of the National Training Center and  the commander of the 1st Infantry Division.  [[Page S3680]]    Following his command of the Big Red One, General Martin was  appointed as the Director of Army Staff and later confirmed as the Vice  Chief of Staff of the Army.   Joe credits his success to his wife, Leann; and the Martins have two  children, Joey and Kylie.   To General Martin and to his family: On behalf of a grateful Nation,  thank you for your incredible service and sacrifice over the last  three-and-a-half decades. We are glad to welcome you back to your home  State of Michigan as you begin your next chapter.
