 Mr. Speaker, today I introduced a fully bipartisan  healthcare bill, the Know the Price Act. It says something very simple  that I am confident we will agree on: Americans should know how much  our healthcare is going to cost before we receive it.   Many Americans aren't aware that, when we go to a healthcare  provider, there is often a gag clause, a gag clause in the contracts  between providers and insurers that blocks us from seeing the cost and  quality of the care we are about to receive. My bill eliminates these  gag clauses so that we have the power and the freedom to make informed  decisions about our healthcare.   The bill would also allow employers to access deidentified claims  data, consistent with the Privacy Act, so that they have the  information they need to choose the healthcare plans that are actually  best for their employees.   Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense legislation that will offer families  and businesses in New Jersey and all across our country more choice in  their healthcare at lower prices.                            ____________________
