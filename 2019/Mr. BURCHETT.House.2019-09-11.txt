 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Knoxville,  Tennessee, native, Corporal James Colquitt, an American hero and United  States Marine.   Corporal Colquitt joined the United States Marine Corps at the age of  17. On March 15, 1944, he boarded a train and was sent to Marine Corps  Recruit Depot San Diego for recruit training.   Corporal Colquitt served as a rifleman with I Company, 23rd Marines,  4th Marine Division. From February 19 to March 2, 1945, he participated  in combat action against the Japanese during the Battle of Iwo Jima,  one of the bloodiest battles of the entire Pacific War.   Corporal Colquitt received a Purple Heart for wounds received during  combat operations on March 2, 1945. He was promoted to the rank of  corporal and was honorably discharged from Marine Barracks in  Washington, D.C., on April 26, 1946.   Corporal Colquitt is one of thousands of great men and women who  honorably served our country during World War II. After defending our  values and freedoms, these brave solders returned home, raised  families, strengthened communities, and continued the growth of  America.   It is my honor to recognize James Colquitt as the Tennessee Second  Congressional District's September 2019 Veteran of the Month and to  thank him for his service to our country.                            ____________________
