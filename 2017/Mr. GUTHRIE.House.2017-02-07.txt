 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 91, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 58) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Department of Education relating to teacher  preparation issues, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 91, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 58         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Department of Education       relating to teacher preparation issues (published at 81 Fed.       Reg. 75494 (October 31, 2016)), and such rule shall have no       force or effect.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie)  and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis) each will control 30  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 58.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?  [[Page H1042]]    There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 58. The  purpose of the resolution under consideration is simple: reining in the  Federal role in education and protecting State and local control  promised to students, parents, and education leaders.   Under the Higher Education Act, teacher preparation programs are  required to provide certain information to State leaders to help  determine the effectiveness of those programs. The State then submits  an annual report card to the Department of Education that highlights  the quality of their teacher preparation programs. Additionally, the  Higher Education Act provides TEACH Grants to high-achieving students  who commit to teaching math, science, reading, or a foreign language at  high-needs schools. To ensure taxpayer dollars are being used  responsibly, the law requires that grant recipients attend an  institution that provides high-quality teacher preparation and  professional development services.   In 2012, the Obama administration began a rulemaking process to  develop Federal criteria for State teacher preparation report cards.  For the first time, and without congressional authorization, the rule  that came out of that process tied eligibility for TEACH Grants to the  State's teacher preparation report card. That flawed and controversial  rule is the reason we are here today.   We all agree that accountability is important, particularly when it  comes to ensuring our students receive the high-quality education they  deserve. However, it is also important that State and local leaders  have the flexibility they need to make decisions that affect the  schools and programs in their local communities.   Teacher preparation should be addressed through reauthorization of  the Higher Education Act, not unilaterally by executive fiat. That is  exactly what the Obama administration did by forcing its one-size-fits- all approach to education on teacher preparation programs. The rule  requires States to track new teachers across three performance levels:  student learning outcomes, employment outcomes, and employer surveys.  In doing so, it essentially creates a Federal mandate for teacher  evaluations that Congress explicitly rejected with the Every Student  Succeeds Act. The regulation assumes the Federal Government knows  better than local education leaders when it comes to what makes an  effective teacher. And to make matters worse, it will also result in  fewer teachers opting to teach students in low-income neighborhoods and  schools.   Teachers play an important role in helping students learn and succeed  both in and out of the classroom. Unfortunately, as it did so often,  the Obama administration overreached and took a flawed approach to  preparing teachers to meet the needs of their students. The teacher  preparation rule blatantly ignores the principles guiding recent  bipartisan education reforms and will make it more difficult for State  and local leaders to help ensure teachers are ready to succeed.   The resolution under consideration, H.J. Res. 58, will block the  implementation of this misguided policy and protect State and local  control over decisions affecting their teachers and students. The  Federal Government has played too large a role in education for far too  long. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this resolution and  help rein in the Federal Government's role in education.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I need to explain what we are doing here. We are not changing the  report card that schools have that teacher preparation programs have to  provide.   This rule says that if a school doesn't score well on its report card  then students in that program can't get TEACH grants, which tries to  focus on getting teachers from teacher programs into challenging  schools. So what happens is, if you are an outstanding student and you  are trapped in a school, let's say, because where you can afford to go  is not performing well, then based on your school not performing well,  not on the merit of that future teacher, they are not allowed to get a  TEACH grant. That is what we are trying to prevent here.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd).

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the aisle have worked hard  in recent years, particularly in the ESSA that we passed to make sure  that we have local control of education, the idea that reforms that  State and education local leaders know best. I think the same is true  for teachers.   It is vitally important that we have teachers that are prepared to  succeed. We want the best and brightest in the classroom that help  ensure our students receive the quality education they deserve.   This resolution will put an end to this rule that will have negative  consequences, I believe, for teachers and students; but it will allow  us to address teacher preparation responsibly. Article I of the  Constitution gives the legislative powers to Congress. So we don't just  need to say: There's a new administration in town, let them fix it.   What we need to say is that it is Congress' job, through working  together, to pass the law and reauthorize higher education that will  ensure that we have quality teachers in the classroom teaching our  children.   So I urge my colleagues to put a stop to this rule and vote ``yes''  on H.J. Res. 58.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 91, the previous question is ordered on  the joint resolution.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint  resolution.   The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third  time, and was read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the joint  resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
