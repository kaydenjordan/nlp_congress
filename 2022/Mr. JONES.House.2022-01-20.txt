 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague,  Congressman Allred, for his leadership in the fight to protect the  fundamental right to vote and to save our ailing democracy. It has been  an honor working with him, with Congresswoman Terri Sewell, and with  Congressman   John Sarbanes over the past year on the John R. Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.   As you just heard, we are living through the worst assault on the  right to vote since the Jim Crow era. And yesterday, on the Senate  floor, white nationalists used the Jim Crow filibuster to block voting  rights legislation.   But they did not win the contest for the soul of our Nation. I rise  to affirm that we the people aren't giving up that easily. We never  give up.   We the people didn't give up when, after we finally ended the scourge  of slavery in this Nation, white nationalists fought back, violently  unraveling Reconstruction, throwing duly elected  [[Page H277]]  Black people out of office, and barring Black voters from the voting  booth for generations. We responded by organizing.   Progress came in fits. It took us nearly a century, but progress  came.   It came in the courtroom where Thurgood Marshall helped to end a  century of legalized segregation.   It came on the streets, where the March on Washington and the  Montgomery bus boycott produced meaningful social change.   Of course, it came in Congress where, after considerable pressure  from the civil rights movement, this Chamber and the Senate passed the  Voting Rights Act into law, and they overcame a filibuster to do it.  Imagine that.   Mr. Speaker, like you, I was hoping against all hope that today's  story would end the same way, with a majority of Senators doing the  right thing.   To those of you watching at home, to the millions of you who put it  all on the line to save our democracy, to see the Freedom to Vote: John  R. Lewis Act become law, I feel your pain right now. But I do not  despair. As Sherrilyn Ifill, the director-counsel of the NAACP's Legal  Defense Fund, said recently: No story in the history of our quest for  racial justice has ever ended with the words: ``And then they gave  up.''   Our story, the story of building a true, multiracial democracy in the  21st century, is no exception. The fact is, progress is not always  linear. It is messy. There are false starts. There are setbacks, like  what happened last night. But the weight of history and the force of  reason are on our side.   I grew up in the Baptist Church. To quote from the book of Jeremiah:  Like a fire shut up in my bones, I know that goodness will prevail.   As the elders used to say: Trouble don't last always. Weeping may  endureth for a night, but joy--joy--cometh in the morning.   Look at how far we have come already. Just a few years ago, democracy  reform was a pipe dream embraced by only the most committed activists.  But thanks to an overwhelming groundswell of energy, of movement  building, of organizing, the Freedom To Vote: John R. Lewis Act passed  the House, and it came just two votes short of passing the Senate.   We are not going anywhere. We are more energized than ever to see  this through. We must pick up Senate seats this fall to make the  filibuster an impossibility.   This is the fight of our lives, for our climate, for healthcare, our  jobs, our dignity under the law, our future. We have no choice but to  keep going.   I am reminded of the words of Dr. King in his 1966 speech in  Kingstree, South Carolina:   ``Let us march on ballot boxes, for this is the way we are going to  straighten up . . . the Nation.   ``Let us march on ballot boxes until somehow we will be able to  develop that day when men will have food and material necessities for  their bodies, freedom and dignity for their spirits, education and  culture for their minds.   ``Let us march on ballot boxes so that men and women will no longer  walk the streets in search of jobs that do not exist.   ``Let us march on ballot boxes until the empty stomachs . . . are  filled.   ``Let us march on ballot boxes until the idle industries of  Appalachia are revitalized.   ``Let us march on ballot boxes until `brotherhood' is more than a  meaningless word at the end of a prayer but the first order of business  on every legislative agenda.   ``Let us march on ballot boxes.''   Dr. King's words are as true today as they were nearly 60 years ago.  But while our work must include the ballot box, we know that it also  must go beyond it. We must envision the world as we want it, and we  must do everything in our power to bring about that world.   Hold your elected officials accountable. Educate your friends, your  family, your neighbors. Change their hearts and minds.   Mr. Speaker, unlike John Lewis and his generation, we are not called  to risk our lives. We are merely called to exercise the rights that  they helped to win: our votes and our voices.   Like those before us, let us march on.                                time  1245                           Remembering Lani Guinier     Mr. Speaker, as we grieve the demise of democracy  legislation in the Senate last night, I rise in grief and in gratitude  to honor my beloved teacher, the legendary Lani Guinier, who passed  away earlier this month.   Lani Guinier's life defies summary. She began her career in the civil  rights division at the Department of Justice. She led voting rights  advocacy at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, often driving alone at night  through hostile places, like from Selma to Mobile, Alabama, to win 31  of the 32 cases she argued. Due to her intellect and her sterling  record of accomplishment, she was nominated to lead the Civil Rights  Division at the Department of Justice. She would go on to become the  first woman of color tenured at Harvard Law School.   But like many great civil rights leaders, Lani Guinier did not define  herself by the power she held or the acclaim she received. She defined  herself by the power she unleashed within her clients, her students,  and the American people. Lani Guinier found her voice by helping others  find theirs.   I am blessed that she helped me find my voice. So the day after the  Senate tried to silence the voices of the American people, it feels  fitting to honor her by speaking from the floor of the people's House.   I first met Professor Guinier when I was in college. I was taking a  writing course, and with her characteristic generosity, she agreed to  let me interview her. At the time, I wanted to be a civil rights lawyer  like my friend, Colin Allred. That warm evening, the Sun still glowing  in the sky, she illuminated a different path forward for me. She  revealed to me that civil rights advocacy was about so much more than  litigation, as important as that is. It was also about leveraging the  power of impacted communities to transform entire institutions. Without  meaning to, she helped persuade me to become a legislator.   When I arrived at law school, Professor Guinier taught me more than I  could ever have expected, not just everything I know about voting  rights law, but also how to become the person I hoped to be.   As the first woman of color to be tenured at Harvard Law School,  Professor Guinier showed us that being a first is not a privilege but a  responsibility--a lesson that is not lost on me as one of the first  openly gay Black Members of Congress.   Her scholarship sought to show that every voice belonged in our  constitutional conversation. Not just John Marshall, but Thurgood  Marshall. Not just lawyers like Constance Baker Motley, but activists  like Fannie Lou Hamer. Not just the people whose names make the history  books, but the seemingly ordinary people living lives of extraordinary  service.   While most law professors obsess over jurisprudence--what judges do,  say, and think--Professor Guinier opened our eyes to demosprudence, the  law that emerges from and enhances the power of the people. She knew  that justice is not the work of Justices alone.   At heart, Professor Guinier was a democratic idealist, a prophetic  voice who called us to reconstruct our democratic institutions and  reimagine our democratic identities. She cautioned us that winner-take- all elections risk converting political competition into mutually  assured destruction, intensifying conflict and underrepresenting those  already underrepresented.   She helped Congress reinvigorate section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,  work the Supreme Court subverted last year in Brnovich v. DNC, and  which I was proud to help restore by introducing the Inclusive  Elections Act, which we passed in the House but, unfortunately, the  Senate rejected last night through the filibuster.   After the Court demolished the Voting Rights Act's foundation in  Shelby v. Holder in 2013, she urged Congress to not only repair the  damage--as we did in the House, but as was blocked last night by the  Jim Crow filibuster--but she also encouraged us to guarantee an  affirmative right to vote. I have been honored to answer that call by  introducing the Right to Vote Act, which also passed the House last  week as part of the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.   Beyond prescribing specific reforms and remedies, Professor Guinier  urged  [[Page H278]]  us to see that democracy was not a zero-sum war over the power to  dominate but, rather, a delicate project of sharing power with one  another as equals. ``Living in a democracy,'' she said, ``is not  something we inherit. It is not something we inhabit, and it is not  something that we consume. It is something we actively build  together.''   Just as the Senate refused to heed the will of the people last night,  the powerful did not always heed Professor Guinier. But she knew the  power of dissent. Whether dissenters speak from the bench, from the  lectern like this one, or from the streets, what seems like their  weakness is really their strength. The powerful coerce us to do their  bidding, but dissenters call us forward to freely do what is right.   I am heartbroken by Professor Guinier's passing. I miss her.   But Professor Guinier, even now, shows me that accepting myself as I  am can help me to center the people I serve. She inspires me to protect  and perfect our multiracial democracy. I once asked her how to advance  that mission in today's times. She said, ``I think that is the question  for your generation.'' With our democracy on the line, may we, the  people, lift every voice to answer.
