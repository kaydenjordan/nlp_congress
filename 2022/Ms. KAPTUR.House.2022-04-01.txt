 Madam Speaker, I rise today to reintroduce our  Transforming Student Debt to Home Equity Act.   Home ownership is a key that opens the door to the middle class for  tens of millions of Americans. But today, too many young workers and  their families are weighed down by student loan debt that keeps this  dream out of their reach.   The Transforming Student Debt to Home Equity Act would create a pilot  program to test various approaches that combine student loan payments  and mortgage payments into one monthly bill. It would empower  hardworking Americans that are current on student loan repayments to  actually combine their loan costs, allowing them to build home equity.   The purpose of this act is to move forward with those pilot projects,  and with millions of vacant homes around our country, this legislation  would spur neighborhood revitalization and improve our quality of life.   The promises of the American Dream should be available to all, so let  us lift up and invest in new means to help the next generation and  invest in middle-class workers and families that build up our Nation by  investing in it.                            ____________________
