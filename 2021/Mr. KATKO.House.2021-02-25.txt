 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my dear  friend Noreen Reale Falcone, who passed away on February 6, just shy of  her 84th birthday.   Quite simply, Noreen led a remarkable life. She was a lifelong  educator, a passionate philanthropist, and a cherished community leader  who lived her life in service to others.   A Syracuse native, Noreen started her career working as an elementary  school teacher. There she developed a passion for helping young people  achieve their dreams and become well-rounded adults who strive to make  the world more just and humane.   Even before she started teaching, Noreen always focused on  philanthropy. Her family recounted a time to me when she was a child  and received a new bicycle for Christmas. Instead of keeping it for  herself, she gave it to someone less advantaged than her. That is  Noreen.   In adulthood, she served on countless charitable boards, an  incredible amount of boards that she was on. She also served as  president of the board of trustees at Manlius Pebble Hill School and in  a wide range of roles at her alma mater Le Moyne College.   In recognition of Noreen's contributions to education and her service  to the community, in 1998, Le Moyne named its library the Noreen Reale  Falcone Library.   Beyond her love for education and philanthropy, Noreen was a devoted  wife, mother, and grandmother. She leaves behind her beloved husband of  60 years, Michael, better known as Mickey, 4 kids, and 13 grandkids.  She so loved her grandkids and her kids that she actually put statues  in her yard so when they weren't there in the later years, she could  look out and be reminded of them when she sees these statues. That is  the kind of person she was.   She was also a woman of strong Catholic faith who was an active  parishioner at St. Mary's of the Lake in  [[Page H625]]  Skaneateles and participated in service missions around the world.  Remarkably, she was the first female ever elected president of the 900- plus-year-old order of the Knights of Malta, an incredible feat.   Noreen will leave behind an enduring legacy that will live on through  the many community works she championed and the countless lives,  including mine, that she uplifted through her educational endeavors.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in  honoring the life and legacy of Noreen Falcone. May she rest in peace.                            ____________________
