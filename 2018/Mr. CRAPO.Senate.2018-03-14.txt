 Madam President, I object.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of S. 2155,  and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I am asking my colleagues to waive this  budget point of order.   In order to offset the Congressional Budget Office's estimated  increase in Federal deficits due to the enactment of the Economic  Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the bill  contains a provision that reduces the amount of discretionary surplus  the Federal Reserve may maintain from $7.5 billion to $6.825 billion.   The Federal Reserve surplus funds have been used in the past to pay  for bipartisan legislation emanating from committees that do not have  jurisdiction over the Federal Reserve. Unlike those past instances,  these funds will be used to offset costs of legislation emanating from  the Banking Committee.   In order to provide meaningful relief for consumers, community banks,  credit unions, midsized banks and regional banks, I urge my colleagues  to waive this point of order.    Mr. President, the time to vote has come, and we are a few  minutes over. This is one of those times when the Senate is on a very  tight timeline, so I will have the majority of my speech put into the  Record. I just wanted to respond in one quick way to some of the  comments my colleague from Ohio has just made.   A lot of attacks on this floor have been made saying that this bill  rolls back the regulatory authority of the Federal Reserve and exposes  all of our large banks to much greater risk or much less supervision  than they would have had before and on and on. We knew these attacks  were coming. They came in the Banking Committee when we had the markup  on this bill.   Basically, I want to read a series of questions and answers I had  with the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve about these types of  allegations being made about the bill--a bill which is designed to deal  with credit unions and community banks and the smaller sector of our  economy, not the big banks--all these attacks about rolling back the  protections against big banks.   I asked Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell whether it was accurate,  if this bill were passed, that the Federal Reserve would still be  required to conduct supervisory stress tests for any bank with total  assets between $150 billion and $250 billion to ensure that it has  enough capital to weather economic downturns.   He answered: Yes, it is.   I asked, if this bill were passed, whether it was accurate that the  Federal Reserve would still have sufficient authority to apply any  prudential standard--let me repeat that--any prudential standard to a  bank with between $100 billion and $250 billion in total assets if the  Fed determined that was appropriate.   He answered: Yes, that is true.   I asked whether it was accurate that this bill does not weaken  oversight of the largest globally systemic banks.   He answered, correctly, that yes, that was correct.   Then I asked whether it was accurate that the Federal Reserve applies  enhanced standards to international banks based on their global total  consolidated assets--meaning that our bill would not exempt banks like  Deutsche Bank and Santander from section 165 of Dodd-Frank.   He answered: That is correct.   I want to repeat this, because this keeps coming up. The Chairman of  the Federal Reserve said that this bill does not exempt G-SIB foreign  banks, such as Deutsche Bank and Santander, and that we do not  eliminate the ability of our Federal Reserve to correctly and properly  supervise our banks.   We are going to go back and forth over this, but this bill is  designed to protect community banks and credit unions. That is why we  have such bipartisan support for it.   Mr. President, we have been able to highlight the benefits of the  Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act on the  Senate Floor over the last week, and I am glad we have the opportunity  to continue that discussion this week.   I have been very encouraged by my colleagues' support for this  critical piece of legislation. I thank each of those Senators,  including many members of the Banking Committee, for their support,  interest, and involvement in the many discussions, hearings, and  personal conversations we have had to improve this bill. I also thank  all those who voted on the motion to invoke cloture on substitute  amendment No. 2151, as modified, to S. 2155.   Since the bill passed out of the Banking Committee, supporters have  worked in good faith to include provisions that different Members have  offered, including those who do not support the bill.   The substitute amendment we offered last week reflects the additional  provisions that the bill's supporters were able to agree on,  collectively.   To ensure that everyone understands what the substitute amendment  does, let me take a few minutes to explain the changes from the bill  that passed out of committee.   This amendment makes both technical and substantive changes to  further improve economic growth, regulatory relief, and consumer  protections.   This substitute makes changes to the appraisal provision in our bill  to add definitions and provide detail on criteria for efforts to  document and contact appraisers.   It also strengthens the HMDA provision by adding a ``bad actor''  prohibition, limiting the universe of lenders who can take advantage of  the relief to those that do not have ratings of ``need to improve'' on  their last two CRA exams or one rating of ``substantial non- compliance'' on their last CRA exam.   It adds further consumer protections on who can take advantage of  transitional licenses and adds liability protections for government  officials who carry out their official duties.   It modifies a provision by raising the threshold from $15 billion to  $20 billion for those Federal savings associations that wish to take  advantage of charter conversions.   It modifies the existing provision dealing with applying the  Expedited Funds Availability Act, which governs bank deposit holds, to  add Guam to the list of American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands which would receive the benefit.   It clarifies the current international insurance provision so that  the Treasury, Fed, and Federal Insurance Office report to Congress on  studies regarding consumer and market impact of international insurance  capital standards is only required with respect to final standards.   It also changes the date at which point Treasury and Fed reporting  requirements on international insurance regulatory and supervisory  forums terminate from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024--this  aligns with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors'  planned timeframe for implementing its insurance capital standard.   It promotes construction and development on Main Street by ensuring  that the Federal Reserve appropriately treats certain commercial real  estate loans in its rules.   It helps reduce identity fraud by directing the Social Security  Administration to accept electronic signatures as consumer consent for  financial institutions trying to verify customer ID and root out  synthetic ID fraud.   It uses part of the Fed's discretionary surplus as a pay-for.   It expands the existing credit freeze provisions by increasing the  circumstances where Americans can get a free credit freeze, and  clarifies that an incapacitated person receives the same protections as  a minor under the age of 16.   It also adds a provision that gives free and ongoing credit  monitoring to Active Duty servicemembers who are serving and  sacrificing for our country.   It adds a provision which helps protect veterans from predatory  lending by requiring VA lenders to demonstrate a material benefit to  consumers when refinancing their mortgages.   It adds a section requiring Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac to establish a  process for validating and approving credit score models, and requires  FHFA to establish standards and criteria for such processes.   The language requires that any credit score model must meet a series  of criteria related to predictiveness, accuracy, safety and soundness,  and other metrics in order to be approved, to ensure that this will not  undermine the quality of underwriting at Fannie and Freddie.   The substitute adds important reports: a GAO report on Puerto Rico  foreclosures; and a report on children's lead-based paint hazard  prevention and abatement, which is a serious issue in many of our  States.   It also makes permanent certain protections for members of uniformed  services under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.   It also makes further clarifications to the section about enhanced  supervision and prudential standards for certain banks, by lowering the  asset threshold above which banks have to pay assessments and requiring  the Fed  [[Page S1729]]  to adjust such charges to reflect the fact that the cost of supervision  and regulation of certain institutions will be reduced as a result of  this legislation.   It also clarifies that this bill does not affect the legal effect of  the Federal Reserve's final rule on foreign banking organizations, and  the bill does not limit the Federal Reserve's legal authority to  require intermediate holding companies, apply enhanced prudential  standards, or tailor regulations for certain foreign banking  organizations.   The amendment also adds a new Encouraging Capital Formation title,  which includes five capital formation and securities bills that passed  the Senate by unanimous consent last year, as well as a bill to help  companies take advantage of further ways to raise capital and ease  burdens on certain publicly traded investment companies.   Lastly, the bill provides additional protections for borrowers and  cosigners of private student loans, and requires the Treasury  Department to study and promulgate best practices for higher education  financial literacy.   All of these additions improve the bill and strengthen the core  themes of the existing provisions; namely, improving economic growth,  regulatory relief, and consumer protections.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment.                         Amendment No. 2152 Withdrawn     Mr. Chairman, before I yield, I withdraw my amendment No.  2152.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess until 5:45 p.m. today; that when the Senate reconvenes,  all postcloture time be considered expired and the Senate vote on the  motion to waive; and that following the vote on the motion to waive,  the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the  bill, as amended.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5  minutes before we begin voting.    Mr. President, we are about to witness a rare bipartisan  moment in the Senate that has been years in the making. We have had the  opportunity to highlight this bill over the  [[Page S1730]]  last 2 weeks, and I have been very encouraged by my colleagues' support  for its critical results.   Again, I thank each of the Senators who support this bill--including  many members of the Banking Committee--for their interest, involvement,  and the many discussions, hearings, and personal conversations we have  had to get to this point.   I want to stop at this point and give a special thanks to my staff,  who has spent countless hours, weeks--actually months and years-- getting us to this point on this legislation, and the staff of the  other Members who have worked so closely with us as we worked to find a  yes to difficult problems and solutions that we are facing.   Since the bill passed out of the Banking Committee, supporters have  worked in good faith to include provisions that different Members have  offered, including those who do not support the bill. The substitute  amendment we introduced last week reflects the additional provisions  that the bill supporters were able to agree to.   The final bill we are about to vote on today is the product of  careful negotiations and good, old-fashioned statesmanship. The  majority of us in this body recognize that our community financial  institutions have been struggling to keep up with the regulatory  demands coming out of Washington and that it was time to revisit  current law and make changes where necessary.   While there are certain provisions that I would like to have included  in this bill, I believe the package on which we were able to reach  consensus is an important step in the right direction and will deliver  much needed relief and economic growth to Main Street America.   When this bill is signed into law, it will right-size regulation for  financial institutions, including community banks and credit unions,  making it easier for consumers to get mortgages and to obtain credit.  Those are the real victims of this regulatory overreach--individuals  who find it difficult to get access to credit, to get a loan for  college, to get a mortgage for a house, or small businesses seeking to  start up or to expand that cannot get necessary access to capital not  because they are not creditworthy but because the system we have  created makes it so that our smaller financial institutions that do the  relationship banking throughout so much of America don't have the  ability to serve them anymore. It also increases important consumer  protections for veterans, senior citizens, victims of fraud, and those  who have fallen on tough financial times.   This bill has received widespread support for good reason. The cycle  of lending and job creation has been stifled by onerous regulation.  Absent excessive regulatory burdens, local banks and credit unions will  be able to focus more on lending and in turn propel economic growth and  create jobs.   Not to be overlooked, this is also an important moment for  bipartisanship and working across the aisle to legislate. Many people  are worried about the gridlocks in Congress. This bill shows that we  can work together and can do big things that make a big difference in  the lives of people across this country.   Those who support this bill have recognized that, with the right  regulation, tailored regulation, we can promote local economic growth  through our Nation's smaller financial institutions.   I will end with this: This bill was a bipartisan compromise. The  changes are common sense, and it will allow financial institutions to  better serve their customers and communities, while maintaining safety  and soundness and important consumer protections. At a time of intense  political polarization, we have proven that we can work together to get  things done.   This is good for small financial institutions, good for small  businesses, and good for families across America, and I encourage my  colleagues to support its passage.   I yield back my time.                           Vote on Motion to Waive
