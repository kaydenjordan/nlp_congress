 Mr. Speaker, this morning I would like to  recognize the 25th anniversary of the Black Family Foundation of Erie,  Pennsylvania.   The foundation was established in 1993 by a very distinguished  constituent of mine, Mr. Samuel P. ``Pat'' Black, III, and his late  father, an Erie legend, Mr. Samuel P. Black, Jr., who passed away in  2001 just 4 months shy of his 100th birthday.   According to its mission statement, the foundation exists to fund  systemic change.   It proudly focuses on strategic nonprofit investments throughout Erie  County that leverage resources for the greatest gains in social  progress.   Its vision is profound and very ambitious. It exists:   To promote continuous improvements in the quality of life around the  globe by investing in projects that offer a high probability of not  only transformational value, but also sustainable change.   Over the course of its respected history, the foundation has funded  nonprofit programs and organizations in the areas of health and  welfare, entrepreneurial education, homelessness, environmental  sustainability, economic initiatives, and technology initiatives.   Specifically, the organization has supported such initiatives as the  creation of the Elizabeth Lee Black School at the Barber National  Institute. This is an approved private school that offers state-of-the- art educational programs to children ages 3 through 21 with autism and  intellectual and physical disabilities.   Over the last 15 years, Mr. Black and the Black Family Foundation  have also supported hundreds of students through scholarships at Penn  State's Behrend College and at Mercyhurst University.   In the last decade alone, the foundation has donated more than $13  million throughout the Erie community and to worthy organizations  around the world.   To Mr. Black and his family, we say: Happy anniversary, and may God  bless you for all that you do to help bless others.                            ____________________
