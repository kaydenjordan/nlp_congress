 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about a  recent tragedy that has deeply impacted my home State of Iowa and I  think all of the country because cable television is well aware of  this.   Yesterday, authorities announced they found the remains of a 24-year- old University of Iowa sophomore, Mollie Tibbets, of Brooklyn, IA.  After searching tirelessly for months, State and local law enforcements  announced the unthinkable, Mollie was murdered in cold blood.   I would like to commend the efforts of all who were involved in  searching for this remarkable young woman, including the Iowa Division  of Criminal Investigation, the FBI, Homeland Security, and the  individual members of the community who volunteered tirelessly to find  Mollie.   Americans watched the news every night, all of us, holding out hope  that Mollie would soon be found and returned to her family. I extend my  sincerest condolences and sympathies to Rob Tibbetts, Mollie's father,  and Laura Calderwood, Mollie's mother. They spent the last month and a  half searching the State for their missing daughter. Rob and Laura  traveled across the State, raised awareness on TV, and handed out  buttons, T-shirts, and missing person fliers at the Iowa State Fair.  Both Rob and Laura showed remarkable bravery in the face of tragedy.   Know that our thoughts and prayers are with you and your family  during this difficult time.   For those of us in Washington, we ought to try to learn something  from Mollie's character and the example she set. As Mollie's boyfriend  Dalton Jack said, ``She's not just a missing person flyer.'' Mollie was  an avid reader who enjoyed the choir, theater, and writing.   Mollie loved her friends and had a natural ability working with  children. Her friends say she had a gift for making everyone feel like  the most important person in the room. There is no doubt her nurturing  character and her ability to be everyone's counselor--as a friend put  it--led her to the University of Iowa to study psychology. While there,  Mollie spent her summers taking classes and working at a day camp with  the Grinnell Regional Medical Center, where she mentored children. It  is no surprise that when Mollie went missing, over 200 people showed up  for a vigil in her honor.   While we mourn the loss of Mollie Tibbetts, it is the duty of this  Senator and every other Senator to act to prevent further tragedies  such as this one from devastating a family and an entire community.   We now know that Mollie was murdered by a 24-year-old, undocumented  immigrant who has been in the United States illegally for 4 to 7 years.  That is right. For 4 to 7 years, this man was here undetected and  unaccounted for. This raises questions about his immigration,  employment, and criminal history, and we must receive answers.   So, today, I sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security  seeking any immigration history on this man and a briefing to better  understand how he was able to get to and stay in Iowa. This isn't too  different from what I have done in many cases with some undocumented  person, particularly those who had been deported and returned, asking  for answers when there was a tragedy such as what happened to Mollie. I  think of recent cases, maybe within the last 2 years, of murders in  Northern Virginia and in Maryland. The Tibbetts family, the people of  Iowa as well, and I hope all of the American public feel they deserve  answers.  [[Page S5816]]    Based on the information I do have, it seems this murder was  preventable. Stricter border security measures, including increased  personnel, enhanced technology, and modernized infrastructure could  have prevented this man from crossing the border--in other words,  secure the border.   Stronger interior enforcement and addressing weaknesses in E-Verify  could have prevented this individual from working and would have  allowed immigration enforcement authority to initiate removal  proceedings years ago.   Earlier this week, President Trump invited officers and agents of  Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement  to the White House to thank them and the people under them for all they  do on a daily basis to protect Americans. Recent events are a stark  reminder as to how much we need these hard-working men and women.   Amidst cries from the radical far left to abolish law enforcement  agencies, such as ICE, I am proud to stand in support of the brave men  and women of that agency. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration  and Customs Enforcement are tasked with protecting the homeland, a duty  they willingly accepted on behalf of all Americans and, of course, the  No. 1 responsibility, the Federal Government.   Every day, men and women of the Border Patrol and ICE, or Immigration  and Customs Enforcement, put themselves in harm's way because Congress  tasked them with this great responsibility.    So to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who call for  abolishing immigration enforcement, I urge caution. We have heard a lot  of that lately about abolishing immigration enforcement.   Scapegoating our uniformed officers, who are simply executing the  law, to launch future Presidential campaigns only moves us further away  from one another and further away from a lasting solution.   To put their efforts into perspective, let's take a look at some  data. During fiscal year 2017, ICE arrested more than 127,000 aliens  with criminal convictions or charges. ICE made 5,225 administrative  arrests of suspected gang members. Last year, the criminal aliens  arrested by ICE were responsible for more than 76,000 dangerous drug  offenses, 48,000 assault offenses, 11,000 weapon offenses, 5,000 sexual  offenses, 2,000 kidnapping offenses, and 1,800 homicide offenses. Those  statistics are just for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.   Last year, ICE Homeland Security Investigations made over 4,800 gang- related arrests. ICE also targets illicit drug flows, human trafficking  operations, and transnational criminal and terrorist organizations.   ICE is part of our broader national security apparatus and often  works hand in hand with their partners at the Department of Justice,  including the Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, and hundreds of  Federal prosecutors.   In 2017, ICE identified or rescued 904 sexually exploited children  and 518 victims of human trafficking. ICE seized more than 980,000  pounds of narcotics just last year, including 2,370 pounds of fentanyl  and almost 7,000 pounds of heroin.   To my colleagues who have spoken strongly about combating the moral  stain of human trafficking or about ending the opioid epidemic gripping  our country, I ask: How is ICE anything but an indispensable partner in  this fight? How can we expect to combat the flow of lethal narcotics  without the brave men and women of the Border Patrol and ICE?   Just last week, I sent a letter to Secretaries Nielsen and Pompeo  about an Iraqi national who lied about his active membership in ISIS  and al-Qaida in Iraq so he could claim refugee status and settle safely  in Sacramento, CA. ICE played a very vital role in his arrest.   This weekend, ICE deported a Nazi prison guard who was living in  Queens, NY, and yesterday ICE was immediately there on the scene in  Brooklyn, IA, when State and local authorities determined the suspect  was a foreign national.   Congress has been dancing around the issue of securing our borders  and strengthening interior enforcement for far too long. We have told  voters we will fix the problem, but we don't seem to get the bills  passed. Stories like those of Kate Steinle, Sarah Root, Kayla Cuevas,  and now Mollie Tibbetts continue to appear in the news, and we ought to  come to the conclusion that enough is enough.                                 Sarah's Law    Mr. President, I urge the Senate to put partisanship aside and  support Sarah's Law. That is a bill that some of us from the Midwest  have introduced, but we also would like to see justice for Kate  Steinle's murder because people who have been deported, coming back to  the United States to do this killing--just for coming back and  violating our law over and over and over by crossing into the country  without papers, they should have mandatory sentences.   Sarah's Law is a bill I introduced with Senator Ernst in honor of a  fellow Iowan, Sarah Root, who was killed by an undocumented immigrant  driving drunk and was three times over the legal limit.   Sarah's Law is a commonsense bill that requires the Federal  Government to take custody of anyone who entered the country illegally,  violated the terms of their immigration status, and had their visas  revoked and is thereafter charged with killing or seriously harming  another person. It also requires ICE to make reasonable efforts to  identify and provide relevant information to crime victims and their  families.   I end thinking about Mollie's death, but you can continue to think  about Sarah Root, Kate Steinle, and others. We haven't responded to it  very well. We can and we must do better.                        Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh    Mr. President, if I may, I want to continue to speak but on another  subject.   Over the past day, several of my colleagues issued statements calling  for Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing to be delayed. A lot of  these colleagues have written me very personal letters calling for  Judge Kavanaugh's hearing to be delayed. Some of them have written me  very personal letters about coverups or hiding or handling documents in  ways they perceive to be different from what other committee chairmen  have done. In regard to the delay of the hearing, they claim that it is  because President Trump's former lawyer recently pleaded guilty to  criminal violations of campaign finance law, allegedly at President  Trump's direction.    I am not going to delay Judge Kavanaugh's nomination hearing. There  is no precedent for delaying a hearing in these circumstances. In fact,  it is just the opposite. There is clear precedent pointing in the other  direction. I will give my colleagues at least one.   In 1994, President Clinton nominated Justice Breyer to the Supreme  Court. At that time, President Clinton was under investigation by  Independent Counsel Robert Fiske in connection with the Whitewater land  deal. Indeed, President Clinton's own records were under grand jury  subpoena. Yet the Senate confirmed Justice Breyer by a vote of 87 to 9  during all of that.   In fact, President Clinton was under investigation for much of his  Presidency and was even impeached for committing perjury. Obviously, he  wasn't convicted. But through all of this, the Senate didn't stop  confirming his lifetime appointments to the bench. President Trump is  not even close to being in the same legal situation as President  Clinton, but obviously some people around here think he is.   So my colleagues' plea to delay the hearing rings very false  considering the precedent I just gave, and maybe historians can give us  more precedents.   So I want to tell my colleagues why liberal outside groups and Senate  Democratic leaders decided to oppose the President's Supreme Court  nominee by any means necessary. They even said so. Some even announced  their opposition before Judge Kavanaugh was nominated. The minority  leader said he would fight Judge Kavanaugh with everything he has.   Members of the Judiciary Committee announced their opposition before  giving Judge Kavanaugh any consideration whatsoever. One Member said  that voting for Judge Kavanaugh is ``complicit in evil.'' Another  Member said that Judge Kavanaugh threatens ``destruction of the  Constitution of the United States.''  [[Page S5817]]    The goal has always been the same: to delay the confirmation process  as much as possible and hope that the Democrats take over the U.S.  Senate in the midterm elections.   The Ranking Member's hometown newspaper reported on this strategy  recently, and the headline called it an attempt to stall. The  strategies may change, but the goal to obstruct the confirmation  process remains unchanged. First, Democratic leaders tried to apply the  Biden rule, which bars confirmations in Presidential elections and  which many Democrats previously said doesn't even exist. They tried to  apply it even to midterm elections. When they used it, it was applied  just to Presidential elections.   Now, when this strategy failed, because it was completely and flatly  false, they changed strategies. They tried pushing for an unprecedented  disclosure of Judge Kavanaugh's executive branch documents, even though  we have already received more pages of such documents than any previous  Supreme Court nominee. This is on top of Judge Kavanaugh's 12-year  judicial track record and other more relevant publicly available  materials.   Now they are trying to latch on to the legal troubles of President  Trump's former associates, but, as I just explained, there is no  precedent or logical reason for the Senate to decline to proceed on  Judge Kavanaugh's nomination in these circumstances. It is just another  attempt to block Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation by any means necessary.   On a related note, we are working to make available as many of the  documents relevant to Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court  when we receive them--to make them publicly available as soon as  possible.   It is common practice--I hope everyone knows--to receive documents  with a restriction called ``Committee Confidential'' until we can  assure ourselves that we will not disclose sensitive, confidential  information to the public in violation of the Presidential Records Act.  Chairman Leahy, who is here on the floor with me, did so during Justice  Kagan's confirmation process, and I am doing the same. This gives  Judiciary Committee members a jump start on reviewing documents  because, otherwise, if you had to wait until they were all cleared, you  wouldn't even be reading them yet.   The goal is to make as many publicly available as possible as soon as  possible.   I have promised to work with President Bush and President Trump to  waive committee confidentiality, when the law requires it, for specific  documents that my colleagues would like to use at the confirmation  hearings. This is also consistent with how the Judiciary Committee has  handled this issue in the past. And, of course, all of my Senate  colleagues are welcome to review committee-confidential documents at  their convenience. Simply get in touch with my staff. The staff there  will make sure that they have full access to the range of committee- confidential documents.   One of my colleagues tweeted, and I am not going to name this  colleague because there is no point in embarrassing anybody to make a  very strong point here about how ridiculous some of this argument has  become. This is the tweet:         Chairman Grassley unilaterally deemed Kavanaugh records       Committee Confidential. Penalty for release could include       `expulsion' from the Senate, which hasn't happened since the       Civil War, for disloyalty to the Union. GOP is going that far       to keep them secret.    I hope all of my colleagues see the absurdity of that tweet.   Now, that person is kind of acting like the Senate has never received  committee-confidential documents before. It is common practice, and it  has happened in previous Supreme Court nominations, even under  Democratic chairmen.   So to sum up, it is so regrettable that some of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle have politicized this process so much, but  also, at the same time, they have short memories.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Aakash  Singh, immigration counsel with my Judiciary Committee staff, and  Robert Shifflett, a detailee from the Department of Homeland Security,  be granted floor privileges for the duration of today's session.
