 Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), ranking member of the Subcommittee  on Oversight and Investigations of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  great State of North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. John W. Rose), a new member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would commend to the House that, when someone gets  into fundamental issues of a 5-year term that the only way the Director  can be fired is for cause. The Democrats have created an unaccountable  bureau of government.   Now, I think what we have today is a bit of buyer's remorse by my  Democratic colleagues who created the CFPB in order to be this  unaccountable bureau, but headed by a Democrat or a Democratic  Presidential appointee. Now that we have a Republican appointee in the  CFPB, they want to reorder how the Director has her staff report to  her.   That is what a big chunk of this bill does. They want to micromanage  the Bureau because they don't like what the current Director is doing.   If we seek to actually have long-term consumer protection within our  financial regulators, I think we need a bipartisan board to oversee an  agency like this. I think it is a fundamentally different agency when  you have a bipartisan board and it looks and acts more like the  Securities and Exchange Commission that has long-term, lasting buy-in  by both parties and by the American public for the enforcement actions  that they take and gives investors confidence in that area.   On this side of the ledger, what we said on the Republican side  during the Dodd-Frank debate and we have said consistently since then  is, if you want a lasting Bureau, you need to have a bipartisan board.  And funny enough, I think that was originally a bipartisan idea, and it  has now become mostly a Republican idea.   What I would commend is, if we want to get into issues of reforming  the Bureau, we need to get into the structural reforms about  appropriations and a bipartisan board and inspector general to oversee  an agency such as this rather than tinkering around the edges about  reporting structures within the Bureau or the naming of the Bureau.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close, so I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1300     Madam Chair, I inquire from Chairwoman Waters if she is  prepared to close.  [[Page H4081]]         Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   What I would say, Madam Chair, is that this bill does nothing to  protect consumers. This is all about the reporting structure, the  organization chart within the CFPB. In fact, in 21 pages of findings in  this bill, the next 21 pages of legislative text does nothing to answer  the fundamental questions raised in the first 21 pages.   Moreover, the reforms that are necessary weren't even considered by  the Democrat majority. So we want to protect consumers. I think we all  want to protect consumers. Where there is malfeasance and where there  is wrongdoing, we will seek it out and we will have bipartisan  cooperation for that proper oversight by this branch of government.   One area where we can have bipartisan work is the Military Lending  Act. We want to make sure that those who are serving in the Armed  Forces are protected by those who seek to do financial wrongdoing and  perpetrate financial wrongdoing. This is an area where Congressman Andy  Barr of Kentucky has authored a bill. He offered it as an amendment-- and it was rejected by the Rules Committee--that would have made this  otherwise subpar bill much better in effect, and it would have actually  had a positive impact on the people whom we all seek to protect.   I think it is important that our colleagues understand part of the  reason why we should oppose this bill. I am prepared to close, but I  will wait for the majority to finish with their speakers before I will  do so, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, let me close by saying what I said briefly in debate.  This bill is about buyer's remorse.   I would say to my colleague from Massachusetts who raised the issue  about Wells Fargo, there was a bipartisan hearing. Chairwoman Waters  called the hearing. We had bipartisan questioning of the Wells Fargo  CEO. We have taken bipartisan work on the oversight of regulators and  the regulated when it came to malfeasance by Wells Fargo and some of  the employees who were within that firm. There was a bipartisan level  of cooperation there.   I would also highlight, to my colleague from Massachusetts, that it  was not the regulators who found the malfeasance of Wells Fargo, it was  the good and wise reporting of the Los Angeles Times. Through  investigative journalism, they found the malfeasance, the bad actors,  and the bad policies within Wells Fargo--not the regulators. That is a  failure of the regulators. It is a failure of the CFPB. We have yet to  have a hearing about those failures.   Let me say from the outset about this bill; it proves what  Republicans have said since the passage of Dodd-Frank: the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau is unaccountable.  [[Page H4082]]    We hear my Democrat colleagues complain about the actions of a legal  overseer of the Bureau, Mick Mulvaney, and now the complaints about the  Republican-appointed Director, Kathy Kraninger. We are here today  because Democrats regret that during Dodd-Frank they didn't go far  enough by mandating outcomes by this Bureau, because they didn't  consider that a Republican could actually be a leader of that Bureau  and they may not like the action of that unaccountable Director.   They have buyer's remorse, and, unfortunately, they have decided to  advance legislation that does nothing to create a more responsible CFPB  over the long term. Instead of taking this opportunity to work  together, to bring transparency and accountability to the CFPB, the  majority is moving a bill that does little more than advance their  political agenda and micromanage the Bureau.   H.R. 1500 codifies and recreates offices inside the CFPB, some of  which are given more authority and some of which, like the Office of  Cost Benefit Analysis, are given less.   H.R. 1500 actually directs what Bureau staff can refer to the Bureau  as in public. Now, let me explain: if it is called the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau under this bill, it is okay. If it is  called the CFPB, that is okay. If it is referred to as the Bureau, a  law has actually been broken under this bill.                                time  1315    That is one of the more substantive changes in the bill, actually. I  don't think it is wise legislating by Congress.   That represents the policy side of the legislation. One look at this  bill's findings is enough to tell Members what H.R. 1500 is really  about.   There are more pages of findings than there are of actual legislative  text. The issues they raise in the findings sections, however, are not  remedied in the legislative text part of the bill.   In a series of disparaging statements, former Acting Director Mick  Mulvaney, a former colleague of ours here in the House and member of  the Financial Services Committee, and Director Kathy Kraninger are  vilified as irresponsible zealots.   Specifically, the text describes former Acting Director Mulvaney as  ``anticonsumer,'' ``destructive,'' and ``inane,'' only working ``to  hamstring the good work, passion, and the capacity of dedicated  staff.''   The findings also opine that ``the appointment of Mr. Mulvaney aimed  to diminish and undermine the mission of the Consumer Bureau.''   This is a highly suspect section of legislation before this House. I  don't think it is becoming of this House to opine in this way.   While Mick Mulvaney may be many things, he is not inane nor is he  anticonsumer. Now, I may say, jokingly, that I find him destructive,  probably destructive with his humor, but not destructive in the work  that he achieves in public policy. I think he is a good public servant,  serving our country admirably; and, with the work that he did at the  Bureau, he was trying to achieve the best results possible for  consumers, for institutions, for financial safety and soundness, and  for the economy at large. He did good work.   With that context in mind, we know that this bill is not about  helping consumers. This bill is about constraining Republican Directors  from making decisions they believe are in the best interest of the  agency.   In the Financial Services Committee markup, Republicans offered  amendments that would have made responsible changes to the Bureau. Had  those amendments been adopted, the majority would have a much better  bill.   An inspector general would have provided oversight of the Director,  ensuring the mission of the agency is not undermined. That is important  for all branches of government.   Subjecting the Bureau to annual appropriations would have also  ensured congressional oversight of the CFPB, or the Bureau, and a voice  in the prioritization of Bureau functions.   A GAO study examining the efficacy in which the Bureau meets its  statutory obligations would have actually yielded insight into the  workings of the otherwise opaque Bureau.   But those amendments were not adopted. The choice was made to move  forward with a partisan declaration instead of meaningful bipartisan  legislation. That is unfortunate.   Thankfully, there will be a Senate, and the Senate has a different  view on this. It is my hope that this bill does not become law.   Unfortunately, we can't improve this legislation through a meaningful  amendment process because of the nature of the rule passed by the Rules  Committee.   We are merely adding more political fodder for press releases as a  result of this bill. H.R. 1500 will pass the House and will go nowhere  in the Senate.   The Financial Services Committee will then turn to the next issue.  Hopefully, it is bipartisan legislating, where Chairwoman Waters and I  have had success in the past, and I hope we have success in the future.   But, to the American people, I say that the Financial Services  Committee Republicans remain committed to bettering this organization  of the CFPB. We will protect consumers, while maximizing financial  choice. We will work to advance solutions, not sound bites. It is my  sincere hope that we can do that with cooperation from the majority.   I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 1500, legislation  that puts politics first, not consumers.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this bill, this amendment, reinstates an  older form of regulation of HMDA data. This is the data that is  collected when you have a home mortgage. It is required data.   Under the old regulation, there were 48 pieces of data that had to be  collected. Under the new regulation, it is 23. That is a modest change  that was agreed upon by a bipartisan vote of this House and the Senate  and signed into law last Congress under S. 2155. A changed regulatory  structure, still collecting the data.   The most important thing this bill does, however, is it subjects  small credit unions and small banks to a higher level of regulation  than contemplated under the new regulations and the new law.   We are rolling back to an older form, whereby community institutions,  small banks, and small credit unions have been disproportionately  disadvantaged in the mortgage marketplace. They have been given a  higher regulatory burden, a higher cost structure, which means that  they are out of the home mortgage game.   The net effect of this amendment is that you will have small credit  unions and small banks not being able to participate as fully as under  existing regulations in home mortgage making, and I think that is one  of the deep flaws of this amendment.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. This rolls  back to an older form of regulation, not a new, modern form of  regulation.   We still collect very important data from mortgage makers, those that  are actually in the mortgage marketplace. What we did was right-size  our regulation so that small financial institutions like community  banks and credit unions could be in the mortgage marketplace once  again.   This amendment rolls back those reforms and hurts small community  banks and hurts small credit unions in a way that this body, I don't  think, wants to support.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I think the gentleman from Wisconsin has  authored a very good amendment. It is a constructive amendment in this  legislative process to make a bad bill less bad.   It strikes the findings sections, not the legislation contained  therein. It is the egregious findings and the personalities in the  first 21 pages that the gentleman removes and says we should use the  arm of Congress to look at those findings of fact and to get a report  from the General Accountability Office on those matters raised in the  findings section.   I urge my colleagues to support this very good amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank my colleague from North Carolina  for raising this issue of student loans. It is a very important issue  for a whole generation of Americans.   But let's rewind and understand why we are in the position we are in  with student loans. In 2009 and 2010, there was a Democratic majority  in the House and the Senate that, in order to pass ObamaCare, they  needed pay-fors to pass the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act,  the formal name of what we commonly call ObamaCare.                                time  1345    One of the major pay-fors was the nationalization of student lending.  So now we have a generation of American students that have a crushing  debt burden because of a government program. Ninety percent of student  loans are done through the Federal Government.   So let's get to the fundamentals of this reform, so that consumers  can have choice, students can have choice.   This amendment doesn't do that.   The memorandum of understanding between the CFPB and the U.S.  Department of Education outlines the parameters to share student loan  information. The Department of Education was clear in its letter  terminating the memorandum of understanding, stating:   It takes exception to the CFPB unilaterally expanding its oversight  role to include the Department's contracted Federal student loan  servicers. The Department has full oversight responsibility for Federal  student loans under Federal law.   The Department letter also expressed concern that:   CFPB's intervention in this area adds confusion to borrowers who now  hear conflicting guidance related to Title IV of student loan services  for which the Department is responsible.   So the memorandum of understanding was terminated because the two  separate departments, the CFPB and the Department of Education, were  sending information to students who were trying to make payments, some  were trying to catch up on payments, and they are getting two different  pieces of guidance.   So to reinstate this provides more confusion for the very people that  are being crushed by a generation of debt. So it is a deeply  problematic amendment, not because it has an ill intent.   The very issue that we are trying to confront here is a very real one  to these students, to their families, and to the lost prosperity and  economic opportunities that they are experiencing because of the  structure of this debt load and because of this Federalized approach to  student lending.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, let me state this clearly. Dodd-Frank  conferred authority over private student lending to the CFPB. It did  not grant the CFPB a role in Federal student lending that is overseen  by the Department of Education.   So this amendment is a counterpoint to what is existing law. The  memorandum of understanding was terminated for good reason.   This amendment is nothing more than an attempt to undo another  Federal agency's action without understanding the context in which it  was terminated.   I think the fundamental issue here is consumer choice, student  choice. We lack that currently.  [[Page H4090]]    When 90 percent of student lending is run by the Federal Government,  we have a problem. That is a nationalized set of lending.   With more consumer choice, with better technology, with real  innovation, we can give students better opportunities and better  choices. Those things are happening in the private sector, but in a  limited way, because the Federal Government is so deeply involved in  student lending.   Let's fix that issue of student lending with good reforms, with  proper innovation, with more choices.   Madam Chair, this amendment does not achieve those things, sadly, and  I would ask my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I believe this amendment will divert  important resources away from pursuing fair lending violations. I know  that is not my colleague's intent.   We currently have an annual report requirement under this very  provision. I do not think a monthly report would give added clarity to  Members of Congress.   Moreover, when it comes to Federal regulatory agencies under the  jurisdiction of the Financial Services Committee, I know of no other  monthly reporting requirement we impose upon regulators, and so this  would be inconsistent with other pieces of financial regulation and the  law that we currently have.   If Congress wants to control more of how the CFPB is using its  resources, we should bring them under the annual appropriations  process. That is a fundamental reform which is not included in the  underlying bill.   Madam Chair, I would say that while my colleague has a very important  issue he is raising here and trying to clarify on the actions of the  CFPB and ensuring that fair lending is enforced reasonably, I concur  with him that that is an important and good thing, but a monthly  reporting requirement will provide no additional clarity for us as  public policymakers.   Madam Chair, I stand in opposition to the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, in closing, I want to commend the author of this  amendment, who is using this opportunity to highlight his support of  fair lending enforcement by the CFPB. I commend him for that. I commend  my colleague for that. I believe he is a thoughtful legislator.   I reluctantly oppose this amendment, given the fact that we have  already provided in law and regulation an annual report of this same  data, and I believe that resources would be better spent on protecting  consumers directly around fair lending violations rather than reporting  on a monthly basis what they do on an annual basis.   Madam Chair, while I oppose this bill, I certainly commend my  colleague for his passion, his care for consumer protection.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    I am opposed to the amendment.   I would ask the amendment's author, if I am reading this correctly,  that on a quarterly basis they will disclose the previous 12 months'  action.   Am I reading the legislative text?    I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for clarifying.   Madam Chair, I would say that having a quarterly requirement for an  annual report doesn't seem like the right approach. We currently have  an annual report, so what this amendment does is simply say, on a  quarterly basis, they must provide an annual report rather than have an  actual annual report annually. So this is really about micromanaging  the Bureau.   The Bureau currently reports on an annual basis, as the Congresswoman  from Massachusetts outlined. Moreover, it not only changes that, it  also changes what is currently in the middle of a 90-day public comment  period, which is the regulations put forward on May 7 by the Bureau on  fair debt collection practices.   What this amendment does is simply say that, for debt collection  purposes, you can't text or email a consumer. That is what this  amendment does. That is not modern. That is not the nature of how we  communicate with our smartphones in today's environment.   What this amendment would do is drive up the cost of healthcare, of  collecting on student loans. By not being able to communicate with  consumers in a modern way, they will not have the follow-up necessary  so that consumers will have some knowledge that perhaps they owe money  that they didn't otherwise know about.   And simply saying snail mail is the way to go does not seem like what  this amendment should be about nor what we should be about as a  Congress. We should be using all elements of technology to make sure  that our financial institutions, our government can actually  communicate with people in the way that they see fit. This amendment  limits that.   I think this amendment is unproductive. The public should have the  right to opine on the proposal put forward by the CFPB, and the public  should also have the right to be communicated with by their financial  service providers in a way that they see fit.   So, with that, I do ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to say to the author of this legislation, I understand your  intention. We have a rule that is out for comment right now to get the  public feedback on this.   Moreover, I would say, under existing law, harassment by debt  collectors is not permitted, period, under current law. What is  prevented, though, is somebody who is trying to collect debts from  actually texting someone. That is a problem.   I don't think that is the intention of this amendment, but that is  the net effect, because the regulations put forward say that you can  text, you can email, something that the Debt Collection Act, written  before email, written before text messaging, did not contemplate. We  are updating this so that people can be communicated with in a modern  way.   There is nothing more annoying than finding on your voice mail some  random voice mail from somebody you have never heard of, and you are  supposed to call this random person and provide them information. How  about a text, right?   When I got a text from my pharmacy that said, ``Do you want to  reorder your prescription?'' and I texted back, ``Yes,'' that saved me  a phone call. I liked it.   When talking about student debt, if somebody doesn't even know that  they have missed a payment and the debt collector calls and they have  got a full voice mail, they may never know that they missed a payment.  If they got a text or if they got an email, that may be the way that  they actually want to be communicated with.   What we are talking about is innovation; what we are talking about is  modern communication; and what we are talking about is reasonable  regulation to ensure that consumers, especially students, are able to  be communicated with in the way that they seek and the way that they  like.   This amendment is premature because there is notice and comment out  under the rule that this seeks to undo, and this amendment is  unproductive because it limits the rights of individuals to be  communicated with in the way that they seek. That is what I would say.   To Members of Congress, my friends on the other side of the aisle, I  would also say that they are going back to an old system. If they don't  want modernization under the current rule so that people can be  communicated with in the way that they seek, I would tell Members of  Congress to not text or email their constituents but only mail them  through the U.S. Postal Service.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   There is landmark legislation in the 1990s that required a free  credit report. The underlying components of a free credit report are  given directly by the agencies to the people. What this would require  is the CFPB to go purchase the FICO, or take the FICO score, which is  derived from the underlying credit reports.   The underlying credit reports are much more meaningful in terms of  the value they provide to consumers. The flaws that they have in them,  consumers can remedy.   We currently have existing law that does the right thing here. I urge  my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this, while a thoughtful idea, a bad  idea in how it is constructed.    Madam Chair, it is insulting to hear a colleague say  that the other party does not care about the consumer. That is  absolutely wrong. It is not becoming to the House, and it is not  becoming to the debate on this House floor.   We care about consumers; we all do. It is about how we take care of  them and how we defend them.   This is a bad amendment, badly constructed. We already have a free  credit report. We don't need the CFPB to get between consumers and  their free credit report. This amendment does that, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no.''    Madam Chairwoman, I claim the time in opposition, though  I am not opposed.    Madam Chair, this is a reasonable amendment that  highlights the issues facing young borrowers.   As I said in previous amendment debate, in 2009 and 2010, the student  loan industry was nationalized. Ninety percent of student loans are  government loans. It is the government that is putting and saddling a  generation of students in unsustainable debt. That is deeply  problematic.   As a result of the pay-for of the ACA and as a result of the pay-for  under ObamaCare, that industry is now 90 percent government. That is  problematic.   This amendment doesn't deal with the substance of that, though it  does deal with the risk factors associated with young consumers and  student borrowers. I think it is important that we highlight the needs  of young borrowers, the needs of students, and this amendment will  provide that type of data on an annual basis. I think it is a good  amendment.   I appreciate the author for her willingness to engage in this debate,  but also highlighting the need for us to think more thoughtfully here  in Congress, think more deeply around financial literacy.   We passed a bipartisan resolution a month ago that highlighted the  National Endowment for Financial Education and the needs of financial  literacy, the basic understanding of interest rates, the time value of  money, and basic fundamentals of financial literacy that young people  need to be aware of and the population needs to be aware of more  generally. This amendment gets to that subject matter that is a  bipartisan concern and is a bipartisan approach to that bipartisan  concern.   So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the  Congresswoman for offering it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, I want to close by reminding Congress and reminding my  colleagues that in 2009 and 2010 the Democrat House, Democrat Senate,  and Democrat President nationalized the student lending industry.  Ninety percent of student loans last year were done by the government.  Only 10 percent were done by the private sector.   That is deeply problematic. It is government that is saddling a  generation of students with debt that is unsustainable for them. The  lost economic potential as a result of that is  [[Page H4097]]  deeply problematic for our Nation and for the individuals who are  affected here.   To highlight the risk factors facing young consumers and student  borrowers is the right thing. For our Congress to have that proper data  is important, but do remember the nature of what is happening in the  student loan industry is being driven by a proactive decision of  Congress to nationalize that area of student lending. That is  problematic. We need to resolve that issue. It is an issue I want to  continue to highlight in any debate that we have around student  lending.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed.    Madam Chair, this amendment would ensure at least one  member of the Consumer Advisory Board is an expert in consumer privacy.  I think Congress has a proper role that they can exert in the make-up  of boards, advisory boards, or make-up of commissions, and I think this  is reasonable legislating around that.   We constantly hear from both financial firms and their regulators  that cybersecurity and insufficient data privacy standards are  significant threats to consumers and financial stability.   Moreover, as employees of the Federal Government, we know of Federal  Government data breaches of Federal employees. We have to do more to  make sure that we stop that and stop malicious state actors from these  cyberattacks.   Billions of people were impacted by data breaches and cyberattacks in  2018 alone. The problem is only growing, and the threats are becoming  much more sophisticated. Given the importance of this conversation,  ensuring that one individual on the Consumer Advisory Board has  consumer privacy expertise offers a reasonable solution.   Madam Chair, I commend my colleague from Hawaii for offering this  amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   I commend my colleague for offering this amendment. I urge my  colleagues to support it. It is a reasonable step for Congress to say,  clearly, that data breaches, cybersecurity, and personal privacy  matter. As a matter of public policy, we need to be interested in it.  [[Page H4098]]    I would also urge my colleagues and reach out to the other side of  the aisle for us to have a deeper conversation about cyber data and  privacy. We need to legislate in these areas.   Without our taking action, we are allowing the Europeans to set the  global standard, and we are allowing the European Union to set the  standard for our data and privacy here in the United States. That is  not appropriate. As American policymakers, we should be interested in  legislating in a bipartisan way to achieve that type of data privacy  and cybersecurity that is necessary for the American economy, not just  in the short run, not just for the next election, but for the next  generation to make sure that they are safe and secure.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I commend my  colleague for raising this important issue, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed.    Madam Chair, this amendment will help ensure that  servicemembers, veterans, and their families have representation on the  CFPB's Consumer Advisory Board.   As I stated with the previous amendment, I think it is fair and just  for Congress to make the decision on who should be members of the  advisory boards, various agencies, and the make-up of boards and  commissions as well as for government.   Congress' action in the past ensures that men and women serving our  Nation do not fall victim to fraud and unscrupulous lenders, and this  amendment is consistent with those efforts.                                time  1500    Moreover, I think there is a missed opportunity in this bill. Mr.  Barr, my colleague from Kentucky, offered an amendment before the Rules  Committee to this bill to say that the Military Lending Act gives  explicit authority to the CFPB. That amendment was not made in order by  the Rules Committee. I think it was a bad decision.   If my colleague supports defending those in the military from  unscrupulous action, I would encourage him to cosponsor Mr. Barr's  amendment because it is conforming with his very concern about making  sure that military families and veterans are protected. The Military  Lending Act and the supervisory authority to the CFPB is just the way  to do that.   I am supportive of that measure. It should have bipartisan support  and should have been made in order under this amendment.   So, both sides of the aisle have these concerns. I am grateful that  the gentleman from Maine and the gentleman from Texas have offered a  good amendment.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time  [[Page H4099]]     Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  though I am not opposed.    Madam Chair, this amendment will direct the CFPB to  appoint representatives of the military- and veteran-serving financial  institutions to advisory committees. It is another step in ensuring  servicemembers, veterans, and their families have a voice in consumer  protection.   Military- and veteran-serving financial institutions are unique and  can provide the CFPB advisory boards with insights into the biggest  risks facing veterans, servicemembers, and their families.   I do concur that there should be more military representation across  all fronts at the CFPB and across the government.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition, though I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, older consumers are undoubtedly at the  highest risk of becoming the victims of financial crimes. That is the  unfortunate case that we are facing today.   That is why, earlier this month, the House passed multiple pieces of  legislation to highlight the issues of elder financial abuse and the  mechanisms to combat it.   The statistics on senior citizens who are exposed to financial  exploitation are shocking. Older Americans lose approximately $36.5  billion each year to financial crimes, scams, and abuse. One in five  seniors have reported being victims of exploitation, and only 1 in 44  cases of financial abuse are reported.   The gentleman from Colorado has offered an amendment that will  require the CFPB to study and report on consumer complaints filed by  older Americans and recommend legislative or regulatory actions to  enhance consumer protections to those citizens.   This amendment would increase transparency and allow the CFPB to  identify trends in elder financial abuse. Those insights could be used  and can be used to protect senior citizens.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I thank my  colleague for offering a good amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed.    Madam Chair, the gentlewoman from Michigan has offered  an amendment that will help ensure the Consumer Advisory Board has a  balanced perspective by including individuals who represent community  banks, credit unions, and small business owners, or economic growth  experts.   Community banks, credit unions, and small businesses are  disproportionately affected by heightened regulatory burdens.   Dodd-Frank imposed 4,000 new Federal regulations on financial  institutions, including smaller institutions that lack the resources of  larger ones. As a result of that, we have seen the decline of nearly  2,000 banks, from about 6,400 banks at the end of 2010, to the end of  last year, that number was 4,600. This is a significant issue for  community financial institutions, the weight of regulation.   The number of credit unions has also declined by nearly 3,000 over a  similar period of time, down to 5,600.   While community banking organizations, such as credit unions and  small community banks, represent 17 percent of all U.S. bank assets,  they make up nearly half of all small business loans. Small businesses  account for over half of all U.S. employment, and nearly two-thirds of  all employment growth over the last decade.   These institutions fuel our economy and spur job growth. They deserve  a seat at the table.   I commend my colleague from Michigan for offering this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As I said, small community financial institutions have been  disproportionately affected by the regulatory burden of Dodd-Frank,  which has driven small community banks to either merge, or go out of  business. Likewise, the same for credit unions.   So for them to have a seat at the table at the CFPB, I think, is  right, fair, and appropriate. I appreciate my colleague from Michigan  offering this. I support the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to  vote ``yes.''   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I am opposed to the amendment. I appreciate  the gentleman's interest in this issue, but I have concerns with this  amendment.   Before I get into the substance of the amendment, I do want to remind  my colleagues that the Democrat majority, in 2009 and 2010, passed  through the House and the Senate, and got signed by the President, the  nationalization of the student loan industry, giving it to the  Department of Education to administer.   Knowing their limitations, the Department of Education, at the time,  contracted with loan servicers that are private enterprises, but under  the direction and the regulatory enforcement of the Department of  Education.   Now, the Democrat majority is unhappy, and the Federal Government is  crushing an entire generation with debt by the decision they made to  help pay for the ACA or ObamaCare.   To get to the substance of the amendment, this amendment would  require loan servicers to submit considerable data to the CFPB, data  that they are already submitting to their primary regulator, the  Department of Education.   I am troubled by the sheer volume of information that would be  collected and by the lack of definitive guardrails around what the CFPB  can and cannot collect.   We had an amendment before that said we need to have on the Advisory  Committee a privacy expert. Well, this amendment runs counter to this  need for us to have enhanced privacy standards for those that are  seeking loans, and enhanced privacy standards for individuals in  society, because this would now require a second area of government to  collect data, sometimes counter to what the Department of Education  would suggest is the right and proper data to collect.   The Department of Education has authority over student loan  servicing, and that work is performed on the Department's behalf under  its regulation. And the servicers fall under the Department of  Education's regulatory authority broadly.  [[Page H4102]]    While I support the spirit of this amendment that was offered, I ask  my colleagues to oppose it.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, in closing, this amendment is not  practical. It should be offered when we reauthorize the Department of  Education. I would support it if it is mandated on the part of the  Department of Education to collect this data, which is the right  regulator of this nationalized industry of making student loans.   Rather than collecting more data, what we need to do is get into the  action of fixing the problem of student debt. We need to make sure we  have more choices for students, better communication with students, and  a better understanding of the consequences of this massive debt load.   We can collect all the data we want, but the Federal Government will  eventually have to take responsibility for these bad actions we have  taken to saddle a generation with student debt that they cannot afford.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I would ask the author for a point of  clarification.   As I read it, the amendment requires quarterly reporting to Congress.  Is that correct?    I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan.    Am I to read it correctly that that quarterly report is  supposed to give 12 months of data?    Okay. Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for  clarifying.   Madam Chair, looking at this, that means that on a quarterly basis,  it is an annual report. It is a bit clunky.   What we already see with the issues of payday and car title lenders,  we know that those are State-regulated products, but we also know,  according to the Bureau's 2018 Consumer Response Annual Report, payday  loans account for 0.7 percent of consumer complaints, title loans  account for 0.2 percent of consumer complaints. This is less than 1  percent of the consumer complaints the CFPB already deals with.   The issues of reporting here, if this were merely an annual report to  reposition the data that they put out on an annual basis, I would not  see that as a burden or a major cost to the CFPB, but doing an annual  report on a quarterly basis would be more costly.   While I am not opposed to this data being made public--I do think  that would be additive to the public--the fact that this is a quarterly  filing for an annual report, I don't think that that is going to be  quite as sensible as it otherwise could be.   Moreover, if you look at the Consumer Response Annual Report on the  consumer complaints to the CFPB, 80 percent of those consumer  complaints revolve around the credit reporting agencies and credit  repair firms.   I think we should be focused on that, as a policy matter. I think  there is bipartisan consensus that the credit reporting agencies need  to undergo a change in the law by which they must abide to make sure  that consumers are protected and their data is protected.   This is bipartisan work that I hope Chairwoman Waters and I can  engage in this Congress. We have raised similar concerns about credit  reporting agencies in the past, and I do think there is an opportunity  for us to have bipartisan legislating that protects the consumer.   Madam Chair, I commend my colleague from Michigan for offering this.  I know this is a major issue in Michigan and a major issue for the  question of car insurance, the cost of car insurance as well, and a  number of other issues that I know that she seeks to remedy for her  constituents.   Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman raising this concern to us  as a body, but I respectfully oppose the amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, in my reading of the bill, I would suggest  that when it says, ``the Director shall issue a quarterly report to  Congress containing,'' and then in subsections 4 and 5 it says 12  months of data, that 12 months is--I don't want to be snarky about it,  but 12 months is a year.   So on a quarterly basis, CFPB has to provide 12 months of data. That  is what I mean by on a quarterly basis CFPB has to provide an annual  report. Twelve months being a year, a year being annual, filing yearly  is annual.   I don't mean to be completely snarky about it, but I think if we  simply had an annual report, this would be a much better structured  amendment.   Madam Chair, while I oppose the amendment, I do so reluctantly.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, the gentleman's amendment would reinstate a  bad rule by the CFPB that was repealed.   The CFPB's own data demonstrates that consumers fare better under  arbitration than under litigation. On average, plaintiffs' attorneys  account for approximately 31 percent of payments plaintiffs receive  from class action settlements. Plaintiffs' attorneys collect, on  average, $1 million per case; actual plaintiffs receive just $32 each.   If Members want to be consumer friendly, if Members are about  consumer protection, let's let the consumers get the benefit if they  are wronged rather than trial lawyers and the trial bar.   This is a trial lawyer's dream amendment.   Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment and ask my colleagues to vote  ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, let me just reiterate: This amendment is for trial  lawyers. That is what they are trying to reinstate, forcing consumers  into the hands of trial lawyers. Every million dollars plaintiffs  receive in attorney's fees, the actual plaintiff, the one who is  harmed, the one who is wronged, receives, on average, $32. That is not  fair. That is not equitable. That is not right.   It is not defending an abstract concept. It is actually defending  those consumers' right to receive compensation for the harm that they  have experienced. Also, it allows that consumer to enter into  contractual agreements with people they seek to.   This amendment would reinstate a rule that would take that consumer's  right away from them and put it into the hands of the trial lawyer once  again. It is a profit center. It certainly is.   In November last year, the President signed a joint resolution passed  by Congress disapproving of the arbitration rule under the  Congressional Review Act. Congress spoke, in the House and in the  Senate, and we changed the law.   Pursuant to the joint resolution, the arbitration agreement rule has  no force or effect. That means, moreover, that a rule similar to that  can no longer be written going forward. That is under the Congressional  Review Act.   This amendment serves as little more than a payday for plaintiffs'  attorneys.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
