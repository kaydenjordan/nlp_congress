 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I would like to start briefly by  mentioning the horrific chemical attack on innocent civilians in Syria  earlier this week. It was nothing short of evil. I stand shoulder to  shoulder with the administration in condemning this brutality. Again,  we see Bashar al-Assad crossing a line--a line drawn and then ignored  by the Obama administration.   The United States and the world community simply can't stand idly  while Syria continues crimes against humanity, again, under Russian  protection. That is why last night the administration responded quickly  and proportionally. I commend the President and his national security  team for acting decisively and sending a clear message to Assad and our  allies. I am sure it was a message that was not missed by the leaders  of the Iranian Government, the Russian Federation, and North Korea.   I agree with Ambassador Haley that Russia's obstructionism at the  U.N. has enabled Assad and prevented international action, resulting in  at least 400,000 Syrians dead in this civil war and millions of others  displaced as refugees, not only internally but externally as well.  Going forward, I stand ready to work with the President and his  administration on a unified strategy to defeat Assad's barbarism and  work toward greater stability in Syria and throughout the region.   Madam President, on another subject, as we all know, here in about 20  minutes, we will start the vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch as the next  Justice of the Supreme Court. Over the last few weeks, our colleagues  and I have--and the entire country, as a matter of fact--have gotten to  know Judge Neil Gorsuch not only as a judge but as a man. He is a good  man with superb qualifications and incredible integrity.   A Colorado native, Judge Gorsuch has served on the Denver-based Tenth  Circuit Court of Appeals for about 10 years. He is known for his sharp  intellect, his brilliant writing, and his faithful interpretation of  the Constitution and laws passed by Congress. He is, in short, a  distinguished jurist with an impeccable legal and academic record.   In addition to his decade on the bench, his professional experience  includes years practicing in a private law firm, prestigious  clerkships, including the Supreme Court of the United States under two  separate Justices, and service in the Department of Justice.   It is simply undeniable that Judge Gorsuch is a qualified, high- caliber nominee. I have no doubt that he will serve our Nation well on  the Supreme Court. But of course, in spite of all of this--his sterling  background, his proven character, his broad bipartisan support--we have  seen an unprecedented attack on this good judge and this good man in  the form of a partisan political filibuster, the first ever lodged  against a Supreme Court nominee. Yesterday, our Democratic colleagues  would have prevented the up-or-down vote we are getting ready to have  here starting at 11:30. For what? Well, it certainly was not because of  the judge, his character, his qualifications, or his background and  experience; it was merely because so many of our colleagues across the  aisle simply have not gotten over the fact that Donald Trump won the  Presidential election and Hillary Clinton did not.   Before Judge Gorsuch was nominated, the minority leader, our  colleague Senator Schumer, said they needed a ``mainstream nominee.''  After President Trump nominated a mainstream nominee, Democrats then  looked for other ways to make him out to be some sort of extremist or  radical. But they failed because there is simply no evidence to justify  those kinds of characterizations.   For one, judicial experts spanning the political spectrum, including  President Obama's former Solicitor General, voiced their support.   Second, they had to deal with the facts of his record. During his  time on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch was  [[Page S2441]]  involved in thousands of decisions--2,700 to be exact. The vast  majority of those panel decisions made by at least three judges-- sometimes more on the panel--97 percent of them were unanimous. So you  would basically have to slander the reputations of all of those other  judges with whom the judge agreed to claim that he is some sort of out- of-the-mainstream extremist. That is truly an impressive record for a  judge in a multi-judge court like the Denver-based Tenth Circuit Court  of Appeals. It simply rebuts any picture our friends across the aisle  have attempted to paint of him as some kind of extremist or radical.   I would ask our friends this question: If Judge Gorsuch does not fit  the bill for a qualified, mainstream nominee, then is there any nominee  from this President or any other Republican President who will meet the  Democrat's arbitrary, flimsy standard?   Time and time again, our friends across the aisle failed to make any  intellectually honest argument against this nominee. Still, they are  determined to block him. That brought us to the cloture vote yesterday  and the last-ditch effort to block Judge Gorsuch. They did not want to  even give him the up-or-down vote we are getting ready to have here in  a few minutes. Instead, they wanted to kill his nomination by simply  refusing an up-or-down vote and moving his nomination forward.   In our Nation's entire history, before yesterday there had only been  four cloture votes for Supreme Court nominees--only four. None of them  had been cast as a partisan filibuster determined to try to block the  nomination--until yesterday.   Still, the minority leader, cheered on by the extreme groups on the  left, barreled this Chamber to the first-ever partisan filibuster of a  Supreme Court nominee, following a regrettable and recent tradition of  Democratic obstructionism when it came to Republican judicial nominees.   Now that there is a Republican White House, that is what they want to  do again--obstruct. This is a wholly concocted method the Democrats  started back when George W. Bush was President to deny a Republican  President an opportunity to nominate the person of his choice,  confirmed by a majority vote in the Senate.   Before 2000, before Senator Schumer and a number of liberal legal  activists decided they wanted to raise the threshold for confirmation  to 60 votes, instead of what the Constitution requires, which is a  majority vote. No one would ever have dreamed that the Constitution  would have allowed for a 60-vote requirement, rather than an up-or-down  vote.   It is not that our friends across the aisle truly oppose Judge  Gorsuch. The fact is, they oppose President Trump. That is what this is  all about.   This vote isn't actually about President Trump. It is about the man  we have all learned so much about, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who has a record  of faithfully interpreting the law, a man who has proved himself to  possess an independent judicial mind, who simply follows the law  wherever it may lead. He is someone who has won bipartisan approval.   This vote is about delivering our promise. The Republicans have  promised to let the American people's voice be heard in deciding who  they would choose as President to select the next Supreme Court  Justice. The American people did that. They chose President Trump, and  he chose Judge Gorsuch.   If Hillary Clinton had been elected President today, I have no doubt  that her choice for the Supreme Court would be confirmed by a majority  vote in the same U.S. Senate.   Now it is time that we deliver on the promise we made to the American  people and confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Georgia (Mr.  Isakson) would have voted ``yea.''   The VICE PRESIDENT. As a reminder, expressions of approval or  disapproval are not permitted from the gallery.   Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote or  change their vote?   The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 45, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 111 Ex.]                                  YEAS--54       Alexander      Barrasso      Blunt      Boozman      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Corker      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Donnelly      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Flake      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hatch      Heitkamp      Heller      Hoeven      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Manchin      McCain      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott      Shelby      Strange      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--45       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Franken      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Hirono      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy  [[Page S2443]]        Markey      McCaskill      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--1               Isakson           The nomination was confirmed.
