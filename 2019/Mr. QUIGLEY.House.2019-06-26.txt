 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Leor Torchman Auerbach  for receiving the 2019 CityPAC Scoop Jackson Award.   Her service for over 20 years as an advocate and leader in Chicago's  pro-Israel community make her an ideal recipient for this honor. Since  the 2000s, Leor has served as a long-time CityPAC board member, and her  organizational and fundraising approach set the standard that CityPAC  continues to emulate.   She has served as the AIPAC Chicago co-chair of the Young Leadership  Council and is AIPAC's Illinois council member. She leads Americans  United in Support of Democracy which has organized more than 1,000  events to cultivate support for the U.S.-Israel relationship.   As a granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, Leor is a friend and  supporter to the entire community, and her activism is an inspiration  and model for us all.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, pursuant to section 5 of House Resolution  460, as the designee of the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), I  rise to offer amendments en bloc which are at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the amendments included in the en bloc were made in  order by the rule, and they have been agreed to by both sides. They  improve the bill.   I appreciate the collaborative approach that my friend from Georgia  and I were able to take in constructing this package. I am particularly  pleased to see amendments highlighting the important work being done  with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the CDFI fund, and  the HIDTA and Model Acts programs at the ONDCP.   Importantly, the amendment also calls attention to unfortunate delays  in placing Harriet Tubman's portrait on the $20 bill. This historic  change in American currency would represent the first African American  and the first woman featured on paper currency since Martha Washington.   Another amendment speaks to the importance of combating unwanted  robocalls intended to scam seniors. This aligns perfectly with the  committee's direction in this bill to the FCC to provide a detailed  plan to create a robocall division dedicated to holding  [[Page H5178]]  fraudsters accountable as well as ensuring timely collection of  penalties.   The package also includes an amendment that addresses growing  concerns regarding tech companies abusing the privacy of their  customers, including the collection of data from children under the age  of 13.   Finally, I couldn't agree more with the importance of including  postal delivery in rural areas. This is a priority that I also share  and hope to continue having the cooperation of the Postal Service as we  continue to rectify issues in my home district in Chicago and  throughout the country.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Mr. Chair, I support the amendment, urge its adoption,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered  by the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Chair, this bill funds multiple programs that are  not only necessary to the daily operation of the Federal Government but  also have a direct impact on the lives and livelihoods of American  families, businesses, and communities.   I stand in support of the bill on the floor today, which restores  cuts proposed in the President's budget and finally invests in programs  that have been starved for funding under Republican leadership for the  past several years.   This amendment would not just cut these programs. It would do so in  an arbitrary manner, without regard to the impact on particular  programs.   In addition, this cut would take funding well below even the level  proposed in the President's budget request. Let me say that again: It  would bring the bill below the President's budget by many hundreds of  millions of dollars.   It would reduce by 3.1 percent the funding available to the SBA to  enable small businesses to access loans for working capital, fixed  assets, and other assistance to establish, operate, acquire, and expand  a small business.   It would reduce by 3.1 percent the funding available to the  Department of the Treasury to counter terrorist financing and money  laundering and to implement the expanded requirements that Congress  placed upon the Treasury to review proposed foreign investment in U.S.  businesses to ensure these transactions do not threaten our national  security.   It would reduce by 3.1 percent the funding available to the Office of  National Drug Control Policy to make grants to Federal, State, and  local entities that are on the frontline combating the opioid epidemic.   Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I strongly oppose this amendment and  urge my colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I urge opposition, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  [[Page H5180]]     Mr. Chair, pursuant to section 5 of House Resolution  460, as the designee of the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, the amendments included in the en bloc were made in order  by the rule. This package includes amendments that cover a broad range  of issues across the Financial Services and General Government bill.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment and urge its adoption, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Chair, I strongly urge support of this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I always like being lectured on how I don't  understand the debt and deficit.   As one of, I think, 38 Members of this House to vote for Cooper- LaTourette, I understand those concerns, but any attempts to be serious  about our debt and deficit must include a big, balanced, and bipartisan  effort to address those matters, not going after one of the 12 smaller  spending bills and saying, See. There, we did it.   It would have to include appropriate revenues. It would have to  include addressing all elements of this government, including the  sacred cow of the defense budget. If you are going to address our  Nation's debt and deficit, you have to look at the government as a  whole.   This is a similar measure to the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Wisconsin, only it is more destructive to the cuts it proposes to  make across the board.   I will not repeat the same talking points that I previously stated  regarding the harm that such indiscriminate cuts would have on American  families, businesses, and communities. I would just note this amendment  proposes to cut more than $2 billion from this bill. This reduction  would bring the bill below the funding level provided in fiscal year  2012 under a Republican-controlled Congress.   Mr. Chair, this amendment is harmful. I urge my colleagues to oppose  it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I know what to tell the people of Indiana:  the same thing I tell the people of Illinois. I know what to tell my  constituents about this matter. I am from Indiana. I tell them that I  am serious about this and that I am willing to work with everyone on  the floor and in both chambers and the President of the United States.   But any serious measure dealing with such matters as the deficit and  the debt, must be, again, much bigger than this, much more balanced  than this, and much more bipartisan than this, and it must recognize  that it involves revenues and cuts, reforms, restructuring, and, of  course, the Department of Defense.   Mr. Chair, any time anyone over there wants to address these matters  in a serious way, I am more than willing to listen. As for this matter,  though, I strongly oppose it and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    I object.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I am going to begin by quoting an eminent  Republican from Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, because this argument and  the timing of it reminds me of what took place in Illinois some time  ago.   One morning, Abraham Lincoln argued before the Illinois Supreme  Court, and he made a point on a case. In the afternoon, arguing for  another client, he spoke in exact opposition to the point he had made  in the morning.   When one of the justices pointed this out, he said: I have had time  to reflect on that, and I changed my mind.   Mr. Speaker, we have just witnessed the same thing. How in the world  can we take their MTR seriously? Just a few moments ago, on an  amendment proposed by Mr. Banks from Indiana, they voted ``yes'' on two  amendments that would cut this account by 14 percent, a cut of $23.5  million.   Apparently, they have had time to think about it and realized,  perhaps, the error of their ways.   In addition, I would say--and I loved working with the ranking member  when he was chairman last year--he funded the same bill, as the  chairman, wrote the bill and funded it by millions less than we are  proposing today in our bill.   Apparently, time changes our minds.   I don't know where the gentleman will be 5 minutes from now or  whether his passion for this will be as strong as it was a half an hour  ago, but the underlying bill includes an increase of $8.7 million above  FY19, where my friend from Georgia proposed this.   I started with the President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. I  am going to end talking about this bill with the eminent philosopher  from London, who I saw last week in Chicago, Mick Jagger. He said: You  can't always get what you want, but if you try real hard, you get what  you need.   This bill isn't perfect, but it is a really good bill under trying  circumstances. And what do you need if you try?   We are funding the IRS up to $12 billion. We included $600 million  for election security. Rather than eliminating, as the President  proposed, Community Development Financial Institution grant programs,  we boost them by $50 million.   Instead of slashing funds for the Small Business Administration, we  are increasing those funds.   We are also boosting the ability to protect consumers and police bad  actors by providing sorely needed additional funding to the agencies  that need them.   Finally, I think the most timely, important point is, when Mr.  Mueller spoke to the American public for the first time about the  report, he said this was a systematic attack on our democratic process  by our adversary, and it has to be a bipartisan approach. This bill  does that with $600 million to protect against an assault on who we are  as a democracy.   My colleagues need to support this bill and oppose this MTR.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the instructions of the House  in the motion to recommit, I report the bill, H.R. 3351, back to the  House with an amendment.
