 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1663, the Foundation of the Federal  Bar Association Charter Amendments Act of 2019. I appreciate the  gentleman and his fine laying out of what the bill actually does. I  thank him and Congressman   Steve Chabot for their work on this  legislation and for their support of the Federal Bar Association.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   The gentleman from Georgia is not prepared to close because, frankly,  the gentleman from Ohio is on his way. I will do the best I can here.   Mr. Speaker, interesting discussion today. I could go on. I think it  is interesting. Again, sometimes we get lost in the formalities and  everything else of what is going on here. But this discussion about  moving offices outside the District and moving them around is an issue  and discussion that should be had.   I think there are some that are very vital to being here in the  District or, as in the case of this organization, in Arlington, just  outside the District. But then there are also some very real concerns  on how we can discuss that.   I think one of the things that we have lost, and I will discuss here  since we are in this mode, is this discussion of having a real, honest,  back-and-forth discussion on legislation and pieces of legislation or,  honestly, where things need to be.   Mr. Speaker, I think this is something that is vitally missing,  probably from both sides of the aisle, especially this year, as we look  at the context of bills and stuff that have gone on without the benefit  of true bipartisan discussion. I can think of the arbitration bill that  was just recently on the floor, in which there were very real concerns  that Republicans had, very real concerns the Democrats had.   Unfortunately, when I actually mentioned to the chairman that I think  we could have gotten a bill that would have had 375, 400 votes on the  floor for ``yes,'' my chairman was amazed. Do you think we really could  have? And I said, yes, if we had engaged in dialogue to fix what was  wrong and not try to do a whole rewrite on something that could get  made into law.   I think these are the kind of discussions that are very good. I think  these are the kind of discussions that make it.   I appreciate so much the gentlewoman taking up for the District of  Columbia. I think that is exactly why we come here. I come here from  the perspective of northeast Georgia. The gentleman comes from  Maryland. The gentlewoman comes from the District right here.   Members from all over the body bring their ideas and their thoughts  of their constituents to the floor, especially in markups and  especially in bills, in which not everything, at the end of the day, is  from a Republican or Democratic standpoint.   At the end of day, as someone who has authored many pieces of  legislation, just as the gentleman has as well, the big things get done  when we work together. The big things--I mean, criminal justice reform  was when Hakeem Jeffries and I bridged a large gap in a divide, even an  unruly Senate, to actually pass something that really worked.   We had the Music Modernization Act, which, again, took 6 years to  discuss and 6 years to be a part of. When you had Members of the bodies  that ended up being a part of this not even willing to sit down and  talk to each other at the beginning of this process and, at the end of  the day, having a major accomplishment and a major bill that was passed  because of bipartisanship, I think that it gave on both sides.                                time  1230    I appreciate the gentlewoman bringing those things up. I think it is  an interesting correlation between the Federal Bar Association and the  excellent work that they do. I have no problem with the work that they  do.   I will reserve, if the gentleman would like to share and respond on  what we just talked about.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H8796]]         Mr. Speaker, I have one more speaker and I  will yield him the balance of my time, so when he yields back, I will  close.   I appreciate that now that the airplane has circled enough and we  have run out of enough fuel, we are now on to the next topic, and I  appreciate the gentleman discussing that.   I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4258.  The gentleman has spoken well of what it actually does and what it will  not do. I support that.   I would like to congratulate Congressmen Stanton and Steube on their  work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
