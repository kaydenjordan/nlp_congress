 Madam Speaker, I rise today to raise  awareness for the severe mental health crisis in our country.   Two weeks ago, there was a terrible incident that occurred in Uvalde,  Texas; 19 innocent children were murdered and two of their teachers  alongside them. Uvalde is in my district, Texas' 23rd District.   Over a year ago, after I got elected, I visited Uvalde and I sat down  with the county judge, who is a Democrat, and the mayor, who is a  Republican, and the local sheriff. I sat down with them, and I said, If  I could do one thing, what would that be, gentlemen? And they go: Tony,  we need a mental health hospital.   They identified this crisis over a year ago. Last year, we  appropriated over $2 million toward that hospital. It is a $25-million  project, and I am working on the remaining $23 million to get that over  the finish line. This is something that that community asked for.   There is so much division here in Congress. There is so much hate and  rhetoric that gets spewed. I think mental health is an area that can  bring us together, that can unite us as we go forward, not only as we  reflect on what happened in Uvalde, but across the country.   COVID did something to this country. We are coming out of that, and I  think part of the mental health crisis that is going on in our country  has to be addressed. It is heartbreaking to see what happened, to be  there as the Uvalde community heals and comes together. What I will say  is, this mental health crisis goes beyond those that are looking to  cause harm to themselves and others.   Madam Speaker, I would argue everyone in that community needs to sit  down with a mental health provider; my staff, included. Our team  essentially had turned into a mini FEMA office where we were answering  all kinds of different claims every day and having to hear these  horrendous stories and having to hear the issues that our community was  dealing with.   So this crisis is very deep and it is very sad. It is an issue that  this body needs to address. It needs to start early on, not wait until  when an incident occurs. We have to start very early on. This shooter,  this gunman, was a troubled young man for a very long time. It was no  surprise to a lot of people what occurred. If we could have got ahead  of the issue instead of waiting until the problem happened, I think  that is critical.   Another thing a lot of people don't realize, the day of the shooting,  there was actually a young lady that had suicide ideations, and two of  the local law enforcement officers had taken her to San Antonio. This  was hours before the shooting.   What does that mean? That means the community of Uvalde has a very  deep mental health issue that is popping up every single day. And  Uvalde isn't unique. It isn't just this one small town and this one  incident. We have seen it happen all over the country.   Madam Speaker, I urge this body to come together. I urge Congress to  come together and use this terrible incident to unite us in finding  real, tangible solutions. Part of those solutions is identifying mental  health resources which we can provide directly to the communities of  need.                            ____________________
