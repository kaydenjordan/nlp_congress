 Madam President, Cory Gardner and I first met in 2011,  when he became the first alumnus of the United States Senate Youth  Program to be sworn into the House of Representatives. As the first  Senate Youth Program delegate elected to the U.S. Senate, I felt an  immediate connection to this new Member of Congress from Colorado. One  year, both of us had the privilege of addressing the student delegates  to this wonderful program that had made such a difference in the lives  of both of us.   Since he joined the Senate 6 years ago, Cory has demonstrated his  leadership on many issues which we have heard described today. His  upbeat personality and his commitment to compromise, to solutions, and  to bipartisanship have had a positive influence on this Chamber. As the  renowned columnist George Will once called Cory, he is ``a human beam  of sunshine.'' I am sure that is the phrase that was going through the  mind of his colleague from Colorado.   His approach to legislating has indeed been enlightening, but it has  been his positive approach to every problem that we encounter, his  upbeat personality, his wonderful smiles, and his problem-solving  devotion to America and to his State that have distinguished him.   Cory's landmark achievement, which he discussed today, is the Great  American Outdoors Act. I was proud to cosponsor his legislation. This  historic bill, at long last, fully and permanently funds the Land and  Water Conservation Fund and provides funding to address significant  parts of the multibillion-dollar national parks maintenance backlog.  The Great American Outdoors Act will help to ensure that both current  and future generations can enjoy the pristine beauty of our natural  treasures in Colorado, in the great State of Maine, and throughout our  country. Cory's hard work to bridge the partisan divide and secure  support from both sides of the aisle leave a lasting legacy that the  American people will cherish. I would note that he never gave up in his  pursuit of seeing this landmark legislation signed into law.    That is typical of the approach that Cory takes. He doesn't give up.  He persists. But he does so in such a delightful way--always in search  of a solution--that it is very difficult for his colleagues to ever say  no to him.   Cory's commitment to environmental stewardship extends from the great  outdoors to the frontier of technology to advance the development and  deployment of energy from renewable, sustainable, and clean energy  sources.   Cory, as was mentioned by Senator Bennet, has also been a champion  for those who have served our Nation in uniform. In 2017, a troubling  GAO report revealed an unacceptable trend of VA facilities failing to  report healthcare providers who made major medical errors to the boards  responsible for tracking dangerous practitioners, or, in some cases,  revoking or suspending their licenses. As a result, these practitioners  can go into private practice from their work at the VA or simply move  across State lines without disclosing prior performance problems to  either patients or State regulators.   To solve this serious problem, Cory introduced the Department of  Veterans Affairs Provider Accountability Act. His bill, which passed  the Senate unanimously, helps to protect patients by requiring the VA  to disclose major errors committed by its medical providers.   Time and again, I have seen Cory put into practice the values that  the Senate Youth Program imparts to high school students--a deep  respect for our enduring system of government, a dedication to public  service, and a willingness to work in a bipartisan spirit to get the  job done.  [[Page S7261]]    It has been such an honor and a great joy to serve with Cory in the  U.S. Senate. I am certain he will continue to serve his State and his  country, and I wish him and his family all the best. Thank you, Cory,  for all you have done.    Mr. President, when Senator Tom Udall announced last  year that he would not seek reelection, he said, ``The worst thing  anyone in public office can do is believe the office belongs to them,  rather than to the people they represent.'' Throughout his more than  three decades of service to his State and to our Nation, Tom has  demonstrated time and again his adherence to that principle. As New  Mexico's attorney general, Congressman, and Senator, he has always  treated public office as a public trust.   Everyone who serves in this Chamber takes an oath to support and  defend our Constitution. That remarkable document begins with three  words Tom lives by, ``We the People.''   That commitment to our Constitution was put to the test in early 2019  when the President issued an emergency declaration that diverted $ 3.6  billion from 127 military construction projects that Congress duly  approved and funded and the President had signed into law. Tom stood  strong against this clear violation of the separation of powers  doctrine that is so vital to our enduring Republic, and I was proud to  stand with him.   In a powerful floor statement on the resolution we introduced to  overturn the emergency declaration, Tom got right to the point. He  said:         This is no longer about the president's wall. This is not       about party. This is about protecting the very heart of our       American system of governance. Congress--and only Congress--      holds the power of the purse.    Tom also made clear that this encroachment upon Congress's authority  was not an isolated incident but part of a dangerous pattern Congress  has permitted over many decades and under many Presidents. And make no  mistake--the hyperpartisanship that afflicts Congress far too often  aids and abets this lamentable historical trend. By pursuing a  bipartisan response to this Executive overreach, Tom helped to make  real progress in defending the separation of powers.   It has been a pleasure to work with Tom on many other issues over the  years. From land conservation and environmental protection to rural  health care and pandemic relief, he has been an informed and effective  legislative partner.   Tom leaves the Senate with an impressive record of accomplishments.  Even more important, he leaves a legacy of reverence for our  Constitution and courage in defending it. I thank him for his service  to the people of our Nation and wish him well in the years to come.                            ____________________
