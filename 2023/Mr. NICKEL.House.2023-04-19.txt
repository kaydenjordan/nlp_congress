 Mr. Speaker, we need to raise the debt ceiling and we  need to do it soon. I rise today in support of the bipartisan debt  ceiling framework unveiled today by the Problem Solvers Caucus.   In such a closely divided Congress, the only real solutions are  bipartisan solutions that can get 218 votes in the House, 60 votes in  the Senate, and on to the President's desk.   This framework proposes reasonable and responsible steps to ensure  that we won't default on our debt while also ensuring that Congress  takes short-term and long-term steps to address spending and balance  the budget.   I came to Washington to get things done, and I am firmly committed to  working with the Problem Solvers Caucus and my colleagues across the  aisle to find solutions for the most pressing issues facing our Nation.   I am proud to support this bipartisan framework, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it.                            ____________________
