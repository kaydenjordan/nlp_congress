 Mr. President, it is an honor to recognize Emily  Holmes for her diligent service through the U.S. Senate Page Program.   During her placement, Ms. Holmes has been critical to the daily  operation of the Senate.   Senate pages work long hours, dutifully delivering legislative  material throughout the U.S. Capitol complex and assisting Senators and  staff on the Senate floor.   Through her work, Ms. Holmes has demonstrated excellent  professionalism and a commitment to the work of this legislative body.   Ms. Holmes's passion for public service is evident from her extensive  involvement in her local community through organizations such as Los  Alamos Teen Court and student council.   Ms. Holmes also participates in Model United Nations because she  believes understanding both local and global issues is the best way to  affect change in her community.   During her time as a Senate page, Ms. Holmes learned about the  legislative process and experienced new ideas and perspectives.   I especially appreciate Ms. Holmes's commitment to bring what she  learned in Washington back to New Mexico as she continues her  education.   As part of the next generation of changemakers, Ms. Holmes will play  an important role in the trajectory of our State's future.   I am grateful for thoughtful young people like Ms. Holmes who seek  opportunities to develop as both a citizen and a leader.   I commend Ms. Holmes for her excellent work in service of our Nation  as a Senate page and for her dedication to public service.   It has been a pleasure to have Ms. Holmes working in the U.S. Senate,  and I wish her the best in all of her future endeavors.                            ____________________
