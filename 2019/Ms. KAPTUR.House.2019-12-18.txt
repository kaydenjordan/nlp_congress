 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   I wish to place on the record that Members of Congress swear a solemn  oath to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies,  foreign and domestic. Today we fulfill our oath by defending liberty.   The central figure testing America's resolve is not here in  Washington today. Rather, the closeted villain sits in Moscow at the  Kremlin.   Vladimir Putin has coordinated murders, election hacking, propaganda,  the entrapment of willing fools and greedy underlings who put their own  selfish interests over liberty.   Putin seeks to sow disarray and destabilize democracies and the NATO  alliance. At Putin's direction, Russia illegally invaded Ukraine in  2014. As Ukrainians defend Europe's eastern flank, 14,000 people have  been killed at Putin's hand, with over 2 million displaced.   Rather than stand up to Putin, President Trump and his minions aided  Putin, first in hastening Russian interference in our 2016 elections,  and then more recently withholding vital military aid from Ukraine to  coerce its interference in our 2020 elections for Mr. Trump's personal  gain.   Might I end by saying: Onward to liberty. Vote for the Articles of  Impeachment.
