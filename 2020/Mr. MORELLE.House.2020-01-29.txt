 Mr. Speaker, in addition to marking the 100th  anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, this year also  marks the 200th birthday of Susan B. Anthony, a pioneer of the women's  rights movement who made her home in my district in Rochester, New  York.   As a Nation, we have come so far in the fight for equality, but we  continue to face new barriers that threaten to roll back the progress  we have made. That is why at next week's State of the Union Address, I  am so proud that I will be joined by Deborah Hughes, president and CEO  of the National Susan B. Anthony House & Museum in Rochester, and a  passionate advocate for women everywhere.   Deborah's work reminds us that the words of Susan B. Anthony still  ring true today; we must ``organize, agitate, educate'' until every  American has full equality.   I am so grateful that Deborah will be joining me next week, and I  will continue to stand alongside her and work together to support and  empower women everywhere.                            ____________________
