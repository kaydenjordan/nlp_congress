 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Quigley and  Ranking Member Graves for their hard work on the Financial Services and  General Government Appropriations bill. This legislation prioritizes  public safety and invests in underserved communities like the ones that  I represent.   I am especially grateful to the chairman for increasing funding to  the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program at its highest  possible level. Drug trafficking is a major challenge for my district.  It brings violence and crime to our streets. It is flooding our  communities and schools with harmful, illegal drugs like cocaine,  methamphetamine, and opioids.   Our local law enforcement is the first line of defense. They  understand what is going on in our neighborhoods, in our schools, and  in our families.   What I appreciate so much about HIDTA is that it creates a real  partnership, a partnership between local law enforcement, State  agencies, and Federal enforcement agencies. It provides them with  important resources to bring to the fight against illegal drugs. It  also supports prevention and education campaigns to ensure that our  children do not suffer from addiction and deadly overdoses.   On the subject of public safety, I am encouraged that this bill  prevents the administration from raiding funds from the Treasury  Department's asset forfeiture funds. These are funds that our local  police departments can use to purchase better equipment and keep our  communities safe.   Another way to strengthen public safety is by financially investing  in our local communities. I am pleased that the bill rejects President  Trump's proposal to cut funding for community development financial  institutions by 94 percent.   Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the swift passage of the Financial  Services and General Government Appropriations bill.
