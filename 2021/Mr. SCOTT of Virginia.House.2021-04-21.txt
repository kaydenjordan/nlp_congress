 Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my  colleagues in honoring the life and legacy of our dearly departed  friend and colleague Congressman Alcee Hastings, who passed away  earlier this month.   Alcee and I were both elected to Congress in 1992. We were part of a  historic class of new African American lawmakers from the South. Few  would make such a tremendous and impactful mark on this institution  than Alcee Hastings. He was one of Congress' most steadfast advocates  for civil and human rights, working families, and the most vulnerable  in our society.   He bravely battled pancreatic cancer for the last year and a half.  And despite this devastating diagnosis, Alcee remained a powerful and  active voice for his constituents and the state of Florida.   I will miss seeing him on the House floor. I will miss his sharp- witted questioning in the House Rules Committee. I will miss his  friendship.   Madam Speaker, our nation lost one of its most dedicated public  servants. And in Alcee Hastings, we lost one of our most unique,  friendly and hardest working colleagues. My thoughts and prayers are  with his wife Patricia, children, staff, constituents and many, many  friends.
