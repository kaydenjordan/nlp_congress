 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up H. Res. 660 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 660         Resolved, That the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence and the Committees on Financial Services,       Foreign Affairs, the Judiciary, Oversight and Reform, and       Ways and Means, are directed to continue their ongoing       investigations as part of the existing House of       Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist       for the House of Representatives to exercise its       Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President       of the United States of America.       SEC. 2. OPEN AND TRANSPARENT INVESTIGATIVE PROCEEDINGS BY THE                     PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE.

The chair may confer recognition for       multiple periods of such questioning, but each period of       questioning shall not exceed 90 minutes in the aggregate.       Only the chair and ranking minority member, or a Permanent       Select Committee employee if yielded to by the chair or       ranking minority member, may question witnesses during such       periods of questioning. At the conclusion of questioning       pursuant to this paragraph, the committee shall proceed with       questioning under the five-minute rule pursuant to clause       2(j)(2)(A) of rule XI.        (3) To allow for full evaluation of minority witness       requests, the ranking minority member may submit to the       chair, in writing, any requests for witness testimony       relevant to the investigation described in the first section       of this resolution within 72 hours after notice is given for       the first hearing designated pursuant to paragraph (1). Any       such request shall be accompanied by a detailed written       justification of the relevance of the testimony of each       requested witness to the investigation described in the first       section of this resolution.        (4)(A) The ranking minority member of the Permanent Select       Committee is authorized, with the concurrence of the chair,       to require, as deemed necessary to the investigation--        (i) by subpoena or otherwise--        (I) the attendance and testimony of any person (including       at a taking of a deposition); and        (II) the production of books, records, correspondence,       memoranda, papers, and documents; and        (ii) by interrogatory, the furnishing of information.        (B) In the case that the chair declines to concur in a       proposed action of the ranking minority member pursuant to       subparagraph (A), the ranking minority member shall have the       right to refer to the committee for decision the question       whether such authority shall be so exercised and the chair       shall convene the committee promptly to render that decision,       subject to the notice procedures for a committee meeting       under clause 2(g)(3)(A) and (B) of rule XI.        (C) Subpoenas and interrogatories so authorized may be       signed by the ranking minority member, and may be served by       any person designated by the ranking minority member.        (5) The chair is authorized to make publicly available in       electronic form the transcripts of depositions conducted by       the Permanent Select Committee in furtherance of the       investigation described in the first section of this       resolution, with appropriate redactions for classified and       other sensitive information.        (6) The Permanent Select Committee is directed to issue a       report setting forth its findings and any recommendations and       appending any information and materials the Permanent Select       Committee may deem appropriate with respect to the       investigation described in the first section of this       resolution. The chair shall transmit such report and       appendices, along with any supplemental, minority,       additional, or dissenting views filed pursuant to clause 2(l)       of rule XI, to the Committee on the Judiciary and make such       report publicly available in electronic form, with       appropriate redactions to protect classified and other       sensitive information. The report required by this paragraph       shall be prepared in consultation with the chairs of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Oversight       and Reform.       SEC. 3. TRANSMISSION OF ADDITIONAL MATERIALS.         The chair of the Permanent Select Committee or the chair of       any other committee having custody of records or other       materials relating to the inquiry referenced in the first       section of this resolution is authorized, in consultation       with the ranking minority member, to transfer such records or       materials to the Committee on the Judiciary.       SEC. 4. IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY PROCEDURES IN THE COMMITTEE ON                     THE JUDICIARY.         (a) The House authorizes the Committee on the Judiciary to       conduct proceedings relating to the impeachment inquiry       referenced in the first section of this resolution pursuant       to the procedures submitted for printing in the Congressional       Record by the chair of the Committee on Rules, including such       procedures as to allow for the participation of the President       and his counsel.        (b) The Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to       promulgate additional procedures as it deems necessary for       the fair and efficient conduct of committee hearings held       pursuant to this resolution, provided that the additional       procedures are not inconsistent with the procedures       referenced in subsection (a), the Rules of the Committee, and       the Rules of the House.        (c)(1) The ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary is authorized, with the concurrence of the chair of       the Committee on the Judiciary, to require, as deemed       necessary to the investigation--        (A) by subpoena or otherwise--        (i) the attendance and testimony of any person (including       at a taking of a deposition); and        (ii) the production of books, records, correspondence,       memoranda, papers, and documents; and        (B) by interrogatory, the furnishing of information.

(3) Subpoenas and interrogatories so authorized may be       signed by the ranking minority member, and may be served by       any person designated by the ranking minority member.        (d) The Committee on the Judiciary shall report to the       House of Representatives such resolutions, articles of       impeachment, or other recommendations as it deems proper.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me say, Madam Speaker, I appreciate the professionalism that my  friend from Oklahoma has demonstrated throughout this process. We don't  see eye to eye on this impeachment inquiry, but he has always conducted  himself with integrity and defended this institution.  [[Page H8684]]    During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Wednesday afternoon, the Committee on  Rules marked up and favorably reported H. Res. 660, directing certain  committees to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the  existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient  grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its  constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President of the  United States of America.   Madam Speaker, this is a sad day for our country. Over 230 years ago,  when the Founders of our country wrote the Constitution, they entrusted  us with the gift of self-government, but they knew the persistence of  this gift was not assured.   It may be taken for granted today, but having just shaken off a  tyrant, the Founders knew better. They understood that the very  foundations of our country are dependent on safeguarding against one  branch of government encroaching on the others. That is what the idea  of checks and balances is all about.   Within that system, the Framers gave only this Congress the power, if  need be, to impeach a President over possible wrongdoing. This fact-- that no one is above the law--is what separates this country from so  many others.   Because of its seriousness, the impeachment process has been rarely  used for Presidents. For just the fourth time in our Nation's history,  Congress is now investigating whether to impeach a President of the  United States. Our authority to do so under Article II, Section 4 of  the Constitution of the United States and the Rules of the House of  Representatives is clear, and the courts have recently agreed.   For all the disagreements I have with President Trump, for all of his  policies, his tweets, and his rhetoric that I deeply disagree with, I  never wanted our country to reach this point. I do not take any  pleasure in the need for this resolution.   We are not here in some partisan exercise. We are here because the  facts compel us to be here.   There is serious evidence that President Trump may have violated the  Constitution. This is about protecting our national security and  safeguarding our elections. That is why the Intelligence Committee has  been gathering evidence and hearing testimony.   Like any investigation, reasonable confidentiality has been  paramount. Witnesses should not be able to coordinate testimony in  advance. The truth must be allowed to prevail.   Republicans have been a part of every single proceeding conducted so  far. Republicans conducting these depositions, along with their staffs,  have had an opportunity to question each and every witness.   Now, Madam Speaker, we are entering the public-facing phase of this  process, and I commend the investigative committees and their staffs  for the professional manner in which they have conducted themselves.   I would also like to commend the courageous public servants that have  bravely come forward to tell the truth. Without their courage, this  possible wrongdoing would never have seen the light of day.   The public should not be left in the dark. They should see the facts  about the President's conduct firsthand.   That is why I introduced this resolution. It establishes the next  steps of this inquiry, including establishing the procedure for public- facing hearings conducted by the Intelligence Committee and the process  for transferring evidence to the Committee on the Judiciary.   It is about transparency, and it is about due process for the  President. Some on the other side will never be satisfied with any  process that uncovers the truth of what the President did.   Madam Speaker, none of us know whether or not President Trump will be  impeached or convicted. Only the facts, and how we respond to them,  will dictate the outcome. But I truly believe that, 100 years from now,  historians will look back at this moment and judge us by the decisions  we make here today.   This moment calls for more than politics. It calls for people  concerned not about the reactions of partisans today but of the  consequences of inaction decades from now. If we don't hold this  President accountable, we could be ceding our ability to hold any  President accountable.   At the end of the day, this resolution isn't about Donald Trump. It  isn't about any of us. It is about our Constitution. It is about our  country.   I urge my colleagues to not just think about the political pressures  of the moment. These will pass. Please consider the heavy  responsibility you have today to this institution, the Constitution,  and to our country.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0930     No, I do not.                        Request to Extend Debate Time     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just say, briefly, that this resolution provides better  protections for the President than those Presidents Nixon and Clinton  received. And just like under Nixon and Clinton, in the Judiciary  Committee, the President's counsel can submit additional testimony or  evidence for the committee to consider. The President and his counsel  can attend all hearings and raise objections. They can question any  witness.   This is going beyond Nixon and Clinton. This resolution allows the  President's counsel to ask questions at the presentation of evidence.   Under our procedures, the ranking minority members of the Judiciary  Committee and the Intelligence Committee may issue subpoenas if  authorized by a committee vote. These are the same subpoena powers that  the ranking minority member was given during Clinton and Nixon.   Our resolution allows for greater Member participation than under  past impeachment procedures, including a robust process for the  minority to propose witnesses and even issue subpoenas if authorized by  committees.   And let me just say, I think the fact of the matter is I don't think  there is any process that we can propose that Republicans who prefer to  circle the wagons around this President and prevent us from getting to  the truth would accept.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record H. Res. 581 from the 105th  Congress, the Clinton impeachment inquiry resolution that contains the  same minority subpoena powers as this resolution.         Authorizing and directing the Committee on the Judiciary to       investigate whether sufficient grounds exist for the       impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, President of the       United States.        Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary, acting as a       whole or by any subcommittee thereof appointed by the       chairman for the purposes hereof and in accordance with the       rules of the committee, is authorized and directed to       investigate fully and completely whether sufficient grounds       exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its       constitutional power to impeach William Jefferson Clinton,       President of the United States of America. The committee       shall report to the House of Representatives such       resolutions, articles of impeachment, or other       recommendations as it deems proper.        SEC. 2. (a) For the purpose of making such investigation,       the committee is authorized to require--        (1) by subpoena or otherwise--        (A) the attendance and testimony of any person (including       at a taking of a deposition by counsel for the committee);       and        (B) the production of such things; and        (2) by interrogatory, the furnishing of such information;       as it deems necessary to such investigation.        (b) Such authority of the committee may be exercised--        (1) by the chairman and the ranking minority member acting       jointly, or, if either declines to act, by the other acting       alone, except that in the event either so declines, either       shall have the right to refer to the committee for decision       the question whether such authority shall be so exercised and       the committee shall be convened promptly to render that       decision, or        (2) by the committee acting as a whole or by subcommittee.        Subpoenas and interrogatories so authorized may be issued       over the signature of the chairman, or ranking minority       member, or any member designated by either of them, and may       be served by any person designated by the chairman, or       ranking minority member, or any member designated by either       of them. The chairman, or ranking minority member, or any       member designated by either of them (or, with respect to any       deposition, answer to interrogatory, or affidavit, any person       authorized by law to administer oaths) may administer oaths       to any witness. For the purposes of this section, ``things''       includes, without limitation, books, records, correspondence,       logs, journals, memorandums, papers, documents, writings,       drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, reproductions,       recordings, tapes, transcripts, printouts, data compilations       from which information can be obtained (translated if       necessary, through detection devices into reasonably usable       form), tangible objects, and other things of any kind.     Madam Speaker, I also include in the Record H. Res. 803  from the 93rd Congress, the Nixon impeachment inquiry resolution, which  also contains the same minority subpoena powers as this resolution.         Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary, acting as a       whole or by any subcommittee thereof appointed by the       chairman for the purposes hereof and in accordance with the       rules of the committee, is authorized and directed to       investigate fully and completely whether sufficient grounds       exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its       constitutional power to impeach Richard M. Nixon, President       of the United States of America. The committee shall report       to the House of Representatives such resolutions, articles of       impeachment, or other recommendations as it deems proper.        Sec. 2. (a) For the purpose of making such investigation,       the committee is authorized to require--        (1) by subpena or otherwise--        (A) the attendance and testimony of any person (including       at a taking of a deposition by counsel for the committee) ;       and        (B) the production of such things; and        (2) by interrogatory, the furnishing of such information;       as it deems necessary to such investigation.        (b) Such authority of the committee may be exercised--        (1) by the chairman and the ranking minority member acting       jointly, or, if either declines to act, by the other acting       alone, except that in the event either so declines, either       shall have the right to refer to the committee for decision       the question whether such authority shall be so exercised and       the committee shall be convened promptly to render that       decision; or        (2) by the committee acting as a whole or by subcommittee.        Subpenas and interrogatories so authorized may be issued       over the signature of the  [[Page H8686]]       chairman, or ranking minority member, or any member       designated by either of them, and may be served by any person       designated by the chairman, or ranking minority member, or       any member designated by either of them. The chairman, or       ranking minority member, or any member designated by either       of them (or, with respect to any deposition, answer to       interrogatory, or affidavit, any person authorized by law to       administer oaths) may administer oaths to any witness. For       the purposes of this section, ``things'' includes, without       limitation, books, records, correspondence, logs, journals,       memorandums, papers, documents, writings, drawings, graphs,       charts, photographs, reproductions, recordings, tapes,       transcripts, printouts, data compilations from which       information can be obtained (translated if necessary, through       detection devices into reasonably usable form), tangible       objects, and other things of any kind.        Sec. 3. For the purpose of making such investigation, the       committee, and any subcommittee thereof, are authorized to       sit and act, without regard to clause 31 of rule XI of the       Rules of the House of Representatives, during the present       Congress at such times and places within or without the       United States, whether the House is meeting, has recessed, or       has adjourned, and to hold such hearings, as it deems       necessary.        Sec. 4. Any funds made available to the Committee on the       Judiciary under House Resolution 702 of the Ninety-third       Congress, adopted November 15, 1973, or made available for       the purpose hereafter, may be expended for the purpose of       carrying out the investigation authorized and directed by       this resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Mexico (Mr. Lujan), the Assistant Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    I yield the gentleman from Maryland an additional 20  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a New York Times  article entitled ``Army Officer Who Heard Trump's Ukraine Call Reported  Concerns'' in which Colonel Alexander Vindman, an Army officer who was  on the call, said, ``I did not think it was proper to demand that a  foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen,'' and ``This would all  undermine U.S. national security.''                [From the New York Times, October 28, 2019]       Army Officer Who Heard Trump's Ukraine Call Reported Concerns                              (By Danny Hakim)       The top Ukraine expert at the White House will tell impeachment     investigators he twice reported concerns about President Trump's      pressure tactics on Ukraine, acting out of a ``sense of duty.''         Washington--A White House national security official who is       a decorated Iraq war veteran plans to tell House impeachment       investigators on Tuesday that he heard President Trump appeal       to Ukraine's president to investigate one of his leading       political rivals, a request the aide considered so damaging       to American interests that he reported it to a superior.        Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman of the Army, the top Ukraine       expert on the National Security Council, twice registered       internal objections about how Mr. Trump and his inner circle       were treating Ukraine, out of what he called a ``sense of       duty,'' he plans to tell the inquiry, according to a draft of       his opening statement obtained by The New York Times.        He will be the first White House official to testify who       listened in on the July 25 telephone call between Mr. Trump       and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that is at the       center of the impeachment inquiry, in which Mr. Trump asked       Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R.       Biden Jr.        ``I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign       government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried       about the implications for the U.S. government's support of       Ukraine,'' Colonel Vindman said in his statement. ``I       realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the       Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a       partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine       losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.''        Burisma Holdings is an energy company on whose board Mr.       Biden's son served while his father was vice president.        ``This would all undermine U.S. national security,''       Colonel Vindman added, referring to Mr. Trump's comments in       the call.        The colonel, a Ukrainian-American immigrant who received a       Purple Heart after being wounded in Iraq by a roadside bomb       and whose statement is full of references to duty and       patriotism, could be a more difficult witness to dismiss than       his civilian counterparts.        ``I am a patriot,'' Colonel Vindman plans to tell the       investigators, ``and it is my sacred duty and honor to       advance and defend our country irrespective of party or       politics.''        He was to be interviewed privately on Tuesday by the House       Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform       Committees, in defiance of a White House edict not to       cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.        The colonel, who is represented by Michael Volkov, a former       federal prosecutor, declined to comment for this article.        In his testimony, Colonel Vindman plans to say that he is       not the whistle-blower who initially reported Mr. Trump's       pressure campaign on Ukraine. But he will provide an account       that corroborates and fleshes out crucial elements in that       complaint, which prompted Democrats to open their impeachment       investigation.        ``I did convey certain concerns internally to national       security officials in accordance with my decades of       experience and training, sense of duty, and obligation to       operate within the chain of command,'' he plans to say.        He will testify that he watched with alarm as ``outside       influencers'' began pushing a ``false narrative'' about       Ukraine that was counter to the consensus view of American       national security officials, and harmful to United States       interests. According to documents reviewed by The Times on       the eve of his congressional testimony, Colonel Vindman was       concerned as he discovered that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the       president's personal lawyer, was leading an effort to prod       Kiev to investigate Mr. Biden's son, and to discredit efforts       to investigate Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul       Manafort, and his business dealings in Ukraine.        His account strongly suggests that he may have been among       the aides the whistle-blower referred to in his complaint       when he wrote that White House officials had recounted the       conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky to him, and       ``were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone       call.''        Colonel Vindman did not interact directly with the       president, but was present for a series of conversations that       shed light on his pressure campaign on Ukraine.        He will also testify that he confronted Gordon D. Sondland,       the United States ambassador to the European Union, the day       the envoy spoke in a White House meeting with Ukrainian       officials about ``Ukraine delivering specific investigations       in order to secure the meeting with the president.''        Even as he expressed alarm about the pressure campaign, the       colonel and other officials worked to keep the United States       relationship with Ukraine on track. At the direction of his       superiors at the National Security Council, including John R.       Bolton, then the national security adviser, Colonel Vindman       drafted a memorandum in mid-August that sought to restart       security aid that was being withheld from Ukraine, but Mr.       Trump refused to sign it, according to documents reviewed by       the Times. And he drafted a letter in May congratulating Mr.       Zelensky on his inauguration, but Mr. Trump did not sign that       either, according to the documents.        Colonel Vindman was concerned after he learned that the       White House budget office had taken the unusual step of       withholding the $391 million package of security assistance       for Ukraine that had been approved by Congress. At least one       previous witness has testified that Mr. Trump directed that       the aid be frozen until he could secure a commitment from Mr.       Zelensky to announce an investigation of the Bidens.        While Colonel Vindman's concerns were shared by a number of       other officials, some of whom have already testified, he was       in a unique position. Because he emigrated from Ukraine along       with his family when he was a child and is fluent in       Ukrainian and Russian, Ukrainian officials sought advice from       him about how to deal with Mr. Giuliani, though they       typically communicated in English.        On two occasions, the colonel brought his concerns to John       A. Eisenberg, the top lawyer at the National Security       Council. The first came on July 10. That day, senior American       officials met with senior Ukrainian officials at the White       House, in a stormy meeting in which Mr. Bolton is said to       have had a tense exchange with Mr. Sondland after the       ambassador raised the matter of investigations he wanted       Ukraine to undertake. That meeting has been described in       previous testimony in the impeachment inquiry.        At a debriefing later that day attended by the colonel, Mr.       Sandland again urged Ukrainian officials to help with       investigations into Mr. Trump's political rivals.        ``Ambassador Sondland emphasized the importance that       Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election,       the Bidens and Burisma,'' Colonel Vindman said in his draft       statement.        ``I stated to Ambassador Sondland that his statements were       inappropriate'' and that the ``request to investigate Biden       and his son had nothing to do with national security, and       that such investigations were not something the N.S.C. was       going to get involved in or push,'' he added.        The colonel's account echoed the testimony of Fiona Hill,       one of his superiors, who has previously testified behind       closed doors that she and Mr. Bolton were angered by efforts       to politicize the interactions with Ukraine.        The colonel said that after his confrontation with Mr.       Sandland, ``Dr. Hill then entered the room and asserted to       Ambassador Sondland that his statements were inappropriate.''        Ms. Hill, the former senior director for European and       Russian affairs, also reported the incident to Mr. Eisenberg.        The colonel went to Mr. Eisenberg a couple of weeks later,       after the president's call with Mr. Zelensky. This time, the       colonel was accompanied by his identical twin brother,       Yevgeny, who is a lawyer on the National Security Council.        The picture painted by Colonel Vindman's testimony has been       echoed by several other senior officials, including William       B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, who       testified last week that multiple senior administration       officials had told him that the president blocked security       aid to  [[Page H8688]]       Ukraine and would not meet with Mr. Zelensky until he       publicly pledged to investigate Mr. Trump's political rivals.        While the White House has urged witnesses subpoenaed by       Congress not to participate in the impeachment inquiry,       failing to comply with a congressional subpoena would be a       risky career move for an active-duty military officer.        As tensions grew over Ukraine policy, the White House       appears to have frozen out Colonel Vindman. Since early       August, he has been excluded from a number of relevant       meetings and events, including a diplomatic trip to three       countries under his purview: Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus.        Colonel Vindman said he had reported concerns up his chain       of command because he believed he was obligated to do so.        ``On many occasions I have been told I should express my       views and share my concerns with my chain of command and       proper authorities,'' he said. ``I believe that any good       military officer should and would do the same, thus providing       his or her best advice to leadership.''     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I get it. My friends on the other side  of the aisle want to talk about process, process, process, but it is  interesting that not one of them wants to talk about the President's  conduct, and that speaks volumes.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), another distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds.   The gentlewoman wants to talk about a sham process; let's talk about  a sham process.   Instead of respecting the constitutional authority of the House of  Representatives, the White House has obstructed our investigation,  ignored our duly authorized subpoenas, withheld key documents,  prevented witnesses from testifying, and intimidated witnesses. They  have tried to disparage Members of Congress who are trying to fulfill  their responsibilities under the Constitution of the United States.    Article I of the Constitution gives the House the right to  investigate the President, and we are taking our responsibility  seriously.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jeffries), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Shalala), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), the distinguished chairman of the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres), a distinguished member of  the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier), a distinguished member of  the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Morelle), another distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on  the Judiciary.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters), the distinguished chairwoman of the Committee  on Financial Services.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Swalwell).    Madam Speaker, we do.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Neguse).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close for our side, so  I will yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me assure the distinguished minority leader that this Democratic  majority can legislate and also fulfill our constitutional  responsibilities to hold this President to account because it is our  job. We took an oath to do that.   In terms of our legislative accomplishments, they are second to none.  When the Republicans were in the majority, they shut the government  down. Today the Education and Labor Committee just reported out the  higher education bill, we passed a bill to deal with gun violence, we  passed the Dream Act, and we raised the minimum wage. We are working on  a bill to lower prescription drugs, and we passed a bill to protect our  elections so Russia doesn't interfere in our elections ever again.   So, Madam Speaker, I want to say to my colleagues that I am proud of  the process we are following here today that brought us this  resolution.   Madam Speaker, past Congresses under the impeachments of Presidents  Nixon and Clinton found it prudent to have a resolution in place laying  out the path forward, and that is what we are doing here today.   This resolution before us today is based on precedent. It includes  protections for President Trump. The President's counsel is given the  right to ask questions when the evidence is presented. The rules here  expressly provide his counsel the chance to be invited to offer a  concluding presentation. Neither of these things were guaranteed to  President Nixon or President Clinton.   It lays out a clear path forward so that the American people know  what to expect going forward.   Madam Speaker, the obstruction from this White House is  unprecedented. It is stunning. We don't know whether President Trump  will be impeached, but the allegations are as serious as it gets,  endangering national security for political gain.   Madam Speaker, history is testing us, and I worry, based on what we  have heard from the other side today, that some may be failing that  test.   There are no kings and queens in America. That is what separates this  country from so many other nations. No one is above the law. Let me  repeat that: No one is above the law.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
