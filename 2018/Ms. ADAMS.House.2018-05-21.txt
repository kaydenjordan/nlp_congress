 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York and the  gentleman from Pennsylvania for organizing this event tonight. Thank  you for allowing me some time.   Like many of my colleagues, I have come to the floor to speak on this  topic too many times. In the last year, we witnessed dozens of school  shootings, and each time we say it is too soon to discuss a solution to  the violence.   Instead, we call for a moment of silence. Mr. Speaker, it is not too  soon, but it will soon be too late. Thoughts and prayers and silence,  they just aren't enough. We need action, and we need it now.   In 2018, there have been more than 20 school shootings, which have  resulted in more deaths than lives lost in military combat. Students  and their parents shouldn't have to wonder whether they are safe in  school. They shouldn't have to fear going to school.   As a grandmother and mother and retired educator, that shocks me. As  an American, that infuriates me. It is time Congress has the moral  courage to act. Like Fannie Lou, I am sick and tired of being sick and  tired of the same old 1 minute, 1 minute, 1 minute rhetoric. We owe the  students and families of Santa Fe and Stoneman Douglas and Sandy Hook  and Columbine and all of our children all over this country so much  more. No more executions. Let's pass some legislation to help end this  tragic epidemic immediately.   We must not wait. Our Nation can't wait any longer and our children  can't either, so let's do the right thing because it is the right  thing. You know, the time is always right to do what is right.                                time  2045
