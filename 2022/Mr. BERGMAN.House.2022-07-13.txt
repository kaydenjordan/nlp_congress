 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support today of S.  3373, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to  Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022.   I associate myself with the comments of our Republican leader on the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, Mr. Bost, who also happens to be a fellow  marine. He articulated very well the elements of where we were, where  we are, and where we are going.   This is the latest version of what many of my constituents know as  the PACT Act, and it has only improved since it passed the House last  March.   As a Vietnam veteran myself and as the ranking member of the House  Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Health, I am more than familiar with  the struggles faced by veterans, young and old, across our Nation who  have been exposed to toxic substances during their time of service.   This legislation will finally establish a comprehensive framework for  the VA to provide veterans and their survivors for generations to come  with the toxic exposure-related care and benefits that they deserve.   For example, this bill will instantly provide presumptive benefits  for veterans and survivors who are terminally ill, homeless, over the  age of 85, experiencing extreme financial hardship, or able to show  another emergent need.   It will also supercharge toxic exposure research, improve the way in  which the VA interacts with toxic-exposed veterans, and authorize 31  major medical facility leases.   Whether it is from burn pits or Agent Orange, toxic exposure is  perhaps the most widespread and urgent issue facing our military  community.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bipartisan solution based on what the veterans themselves have been  telling us for a long time. It is time to act.
