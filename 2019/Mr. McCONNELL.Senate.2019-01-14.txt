 Mr. President, although three-quarters of the  government is funded and fully operational, important Federal functions  continue to be unduly affected, and hundreds of thousands of Federal  workers have now missed paychecks.   By now, everyone in America understands the basic faultlines of this  disagreement. The Speaker of the House has decided that opposing  President Trump comes before the security of our borders.   The President has asked for a reasonable new investment, $5.7  billion--about one-tenth of 1 percent of Federal spending--for the same  kinds of border security that prominent Democrats actually used to brag  about supporting, for the very same kind of reinforced steel fencing  that the Obama administration bragged about building, and for precisely  the kinds of barriers that the men and women of law enforcement there  on the ground insist are vital for their mission.   It is for precisely the same kind of physical border security in  which a number of my Democratic colleagues here in the Senate were  perfectly happy to vote to invest billions of dollars just as recently  as last Congress. The 2017 funding measure that passed the Senate with  47 Democratic votes included upgraded border fencing; that was in 2017,  just this past Congress--last year. And 40 Democrats voted for the  bipartisan spending deal that was cleared just this past March. It  included more than $1.5 billion for border barriers. Then, of course,  the Appropriations subcommittee and full committee approved another  $1.6 billion for border security in a bipartisan vote just this last  June, and 10 of 15 committee Democrats voted to report the final  package to the full Senate. Those are billions of dollars for physical  border security, winning Democratic votes just last year.   Well, that was before we had a new Speaker of the House. That was  before Speaker Pelosi and her far-left base decided that the politics  of obstruction would come before commonsense policymaking.   Here is how serious the Speaker is about ending the impasse and  getting the government reopened: She now proudly boasts that she would  allow exactly $1--$1--for border barriers.   There was bipartisan support in the Congress for billions of dollars  of physical barriers at the border before Representative Pelosi was  Speaker. Now congressional Democrats support just $1--$1--for border  barriers since she became Speaker. You have to ask yourself, what is  the reason?   Earlier this month, Speaker Pelosi declared that the concept of any  physical wall on our southern barrier was ``an immorality''--an  immorality.   ``A wall is an immorality.'' That is what Speaker Pelosi said. Look,  that is not a serious statement. It would be laugh-out-loud material if  hundreds of thousands of Federal workers weren't going without pay  because the Speaker has decided this absurdity is now her party's  official position.   Immoral? Was it immoral for Democrats to vote for the Secure Fence  Act in 2006? Was it immoral for President Obama's administration to  proudly build the same kinds of steel slat barriers that President  Trump now wants more of? Is Speaker Pelosi calling sitting Democrats  immoral because they voted to invest billions in border security over  the past few years alone?   I would like to see how this new philosophical opposition to the  existence of walls plays out in practice. Shouldn't the Speaker  introduce a bill to destroy the walls and fencing that already exist if  they are immoral?   Or maybe this actually isn't a new, principled stand by Democrats.  Maybe this is all one big political game--no negotiations, no  collaboration. It is political game playing.   Consider the latest tactic by my Democratic colleagues. They have  said that the President just needs to drop his request and agree to the  Democrats' plan to reopen the government, and then--and then--they will  talk about border security--except they couldn't even keep up that act  either.   When President Trump and Speaker Pelosi met last week, the President  [[Page S166]]  put the question to her directly: If the government were reopened,  would Democrats, after 30 days, then compromise and agree to more  border security?   No, no, said Speaker Pelosi. They would not.   So here we are, day 24, because the Speaker of the House has decided  that enforcing our own laws is now immoral, because she has decided it  is better to prolong this partial shutdown than invest $1 in something  that both parties agreed was a good idea until about 5 minutes ago-- funding that Obama administration border experts continue to argue is a  good idea, an essential idea.   Here in the Senate, I am sorry to say, my Democratic colleagues seem  to have just fallen in line. Based on their actions, my colleagues  across the aisle seem to agree that it is better for Federal workers to  keep going without pay than to invest one one-thousandth of Federal  spending in the same kinds of border security that they themselves have  voted repeatedly to fund in just the past 2 years.   I have a hard time believing that every last one of my Senate  Democratic colleagues really stands with Speaker Pelosi on this. It is  hard to believe. It is hard to believe that Senate Democrats now agree  their own recent votes on border security were actually immoral, that  it would be better to keep the government shut down than to invest one  one-thousand of Federal spending in fencing that the Obama  administration bragged about building.   It is particularly hard for me to believe that my distinguished  colleagues from Maryland and Virginia, who are understandably very  concerned with the circumstances of the Federal workforce, would rather  echo Speaker Pelosi's fringe position--rather echo Speaker Pelosi's  fringe position--than work with the White House to find a real  compromise and reopen the government.   What is happening here is that Federal workers are paying for this  far-left ideological crusade. Lots of American families are facing  great uncertainty because Senate Democrats apparently agree that the  same kinds of reasonable investments they happily supported last year  and the year before have now become completely immoral this year simply  because Speaker Pelosi suddenly now says that they are wrong.   That isn't really what has happened. That isn't what has happened.  Enforcing our laws has not become unethical overnight. The physical  barriers at the border that Democrats used to support in past  Congresses and in the Obama administration have not somehow become  radical rightwing positions.   Walls and fences still work. Border security still matters. American  families still deserve safety. Reality is still reality. When Democrats  are ready to reaccept these realities, they can negotiate seriously  with the White House and bring an end to this impasse.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to S. 1.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, when Paducah Police Chief Brandon  Barnhill announced last October that he would be retiring at the end of  the year, we knew he would leave large shoes to fill. During his 20  years with the department, including the last 5 it at the helm, Brandon  helped develop a statewide reputation for excellence. Now, as Brandon  retires to pursue new opportunities, I would like to take a moment to  thank him for his service to the city of Paducah and the Commonwealth  of Kentucky.   Brandon graduated from Murray State University and earned a master's  degree from Andrew Jackson University. It was at the Murray Police  Department that Brandon began his noble vocation in law enforcement. He  spent 3 years there before joining Paducah's police force in 1998.   Every day, Brandon wore the badge with pride. Out of love for his  community, he faced down danger with integrity and professionalism. Our  Commonwealth is blessed with an abundance of brave men and women who  put themselves in harm's way to protect their fellow citizens, and  Brandon fulfilled his duty with distinction.   It didn't take long for his potential to be recognized in Paducah.  Promoted to detective the year after joining the department, Brandon  continued to earn the respect of his colleagues both in Paducah and  throughout the State. When the previous police chief announced his  retirement in 2013, Brandon became the best choice to lead his  colleagues to preserve the peace.   Brandon's leadership has helped place the Paducah Police Department  among the most respected law enforcement organizations in Kentucky. One  of his major initiatives was to strengthen the partnerships between the  department and the local community. Brandon recently said he was  particularly proud of the ``Chief's Community Forum,'' a way to receive  feedback on the perception of policing in the city. Throughout his  service, Brandon became an example of integrity and credibility in law  enforcement, and the Kentucky Association of Chiefs of Police named him  the Chief of the Year in 2016.   In recent years, I have had the privilege to work with Brandon to  bring increased Federal law enforcement resources to Paducah in support  of the work already being done there to combat the substance abuse  epidemic. In 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal  Bureau of Investigation both committed to open new offices in Paducah  and to dedicate assets to a partnership with State and local law  enforcement. Brandon and the men and women of the Paducah Police  Department were, of course, integral to this effort to keep our  communities safe.   At his retirement celebration, Brandon was greeted with an outpouring  of support and gratitude from the community he had spent two decades  serving. I would like to take this opportunity to add my voice to those  congratulating him for his remarkable success in Paducah. With his wife  Renee and their children, Natalie and Reese, I wish him all the best in  his next adventure. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking  Chief Brandon Barnhill for his leadership at the Paducah Police  Department.                            ____________________     Mr. President, after 16 years of service to the people  of Taylor County, KY, Judge-Executive Eddie Rogers is beginning his  retirement. My friend leaves behind a legacy of passion for the men and  women he represented, and I would like to take a moment to acknowledge  Eddie's career in public service and to thank him for his commitment to  Taylor County.  [[Page S180]]    Eddie first entered the county's top job in 1999, and he worked  closely with the members of the fiscal court to address the challenges  facing the area. He made some difficult choices, but as he looked back  on his career, Eddie said he always did what he thought was best to  help attract new jobs to Taylor County and provide new opportunity for  Kentuckians.   Serving in office a second time beginning in 2006, Eddie's leadership  secured several major accomplishments for the county that will continue  to be enjoyed for years to come. During Eddie's tenure, he oversaw the  opening of the Taylor County Judicial Center and the construction of a  new fire department. The county also built a new animal shelter, and in  the near future, a technology center will open as a result of Eddie's  work. These buildings will stand as lasting landmarks to Eddie's  service and his success in Taylor County.   At his final fiscal court meeting as judge-executive, the county's  other elected officials thanked Eddie for his leadership, his  collaborative nature, and his record of achievement. They also noted  his work with the Kentucky Association of Counties, helping other  communities across the Commonwealth. In addition to his tireless work  for Taylor County, Eddie's colleagues also thanked him for his personal  friendship. I can echo those sentiments and say I have enjoyed working  with Eddie on a broad range of projects for the community and our home  State. Joined by members of his family, Eddie adjourned his last  meeting with the appreciation of many throughout Taylor County.   At the end of his 16 years of dedication, Eddie has a lot to be proud  of, and I would like to thank him for his hard work. With his children,  Michele, Wynn, and Natalie, and his grandchildren, Dalton and Laine, I  hope he will enjoy a well-earned retirement. I ask my Senate colleagues  to join me in congratulating Eddie for his years of service to  Kentucky.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that H.R. 266 has been  received from the House and is at the desk.    I ask for its first reading.    I ask for a second reading and object to my own  request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 17, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  January 15; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; finally, that the Senate recess  from 12:30 until 2:15 to allow for the weekly conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order following the remarks of our Democratic  colleagues.
