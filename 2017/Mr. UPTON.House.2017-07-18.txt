 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2786) to amend the Federal Power Act with respect to the criteria  and process to qualify as a qualifying conduit hydropower facility, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:  [[Page H5936]]                                      H.R. 2786         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. QUALIFYING CONDUIT HYDROPOWER FACILITIES.         Section 30(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 823a(a))       is amended--        (1) in paragraph (2)(C), by striking ``45 days'' and       inserting ``30 days''; and        (2) in paragraph (3)(C)--        (A) in clause (i), by adding ``and'' after the semicolon;        (B) by striking clause (ii); and        (C) by redesignating clause (iii) as clause (ii).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2786, introduced by my two colleagues,  the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson) and the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Ms. DeGette), has always been a bipartisan bill. It amends  the Federal Power Act to promote renewable energy from small conduit  hydropower facilities.   The bill would encourage the generation of electricity from existing  manmade conduits operated for the distribution of water for  agriculture, municipal, or industrial consumption.   I would note that Congress established qualifying conduit exemptions  under the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013. This bill, H.R.  2786, builds on that law to provide benefits to a greater range of  conduit hydropower projects. This bill, in fact, will shorten the  review period and allow larger conduit projects to be eligible for  exemption from certain listing requirements.   I know of no serious objections to the bill. It is bipartisan, as it  should be. I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson), the original author of the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to comment briefly on the remarks  by my two colleagues.   This is an important bill, and for those of us who have always  supported all of the above, whether it be renewable or safe nuclear,  all those different things, hydro is part of that mix.   I would just note that I had a question yesterday morning. I did a  big Farm Bureau breakfast in my district, and the question about  hydropower came up. Just like my friend from Colorado talks about the  most important bill in Colorado, this is an important bill.   It is also important that we work together to get this bill done so  that the Senate can follow suit. I urge my colleagues to vote for this  bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2828) to extend the deadline for commencement of construction of  a hydroelectric project.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2828         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding the time period specified       in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that       would otherwise apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory       Commission project numbered 12569, the Commission shall, at       the request of the licensee for the project, and after       reasonable notice, in accordance with the good faith, due       diligence, and public interest requirements of that section       and the Commission's procedures under that section, extend       the time period during which the licensee is required to       commence the construction of the project for up to three       consecutive 2-year periods from the date of the expiration of       the extension originally issued by the Commission under that       section.        (b) Reinstatement of Expired License.--If the period       required for commencement of construction of the project       described in subsection (a) has expired prior to the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall reinstate the       license effective as of the date of its expiration and the       first extension authorized under subsection (a) shall take       effect on the date of such expiration.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2828, introduced by the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse). This bill will authorize the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, to extend the time period  during which a licensee is required to commence construction of a  hydroelectric project.   Back on July 9, 2013, FERC issued a license for the Public Utility  District Number 1 of Okanogan County, Washington's proposed 9-megawatt  Enloe hydroelectric project. This project will be located at the  existing Enloe Dam on the Similkameen River near the city of Oroville,  Washington.   The license requires the licensee to commence construction of the  project within 2 years of the issuance date of the license, or by July  9, 2015. At the licensee's request, FERC has already granted the  maximum allowable 2-year extension, thus making the construction  deadline July 9, 2017.   Development of the Enloe project has experienced setbacks that have  complicated the licensee's ability to meet the deadline. This bill,  H.R. 2828, would authorize FERC to reinstate the license and issue up  to three consecutive 2-year extensions to commence construction.   This bill is consistent with prior congressional actions and FERC's  longstanding policy limiting the maximum allowable extension to 10  years from the issuance date of the license.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues again to support this  bill, on a bipartisan basis, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3050) to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide  Federal financial assistance to States to implement, review, and revise  State energy security plans, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3050         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing State Energy       Security Planning and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. STATE ENERGY SECURITY PLANS.         (a) In General.--Part D of title III of the Energy Policy       and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6321 et seq.) is amended by       adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 367.

(4) Table of sections.--The table of sections for part D of       title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is       amended by adding at the end the following:  ``Sec. 367. State energy security plans.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill. It really is. This bill, H.R.  3050, is a bipartisan bill introduced by myself and by my good friend  and colleague across the aisle, Mr. Rush. It is bipartisan.   This bill reauthorizes the State Energy Program and it strengthens  our  [[Page H5939]]  energy emergency planning and preparedness efforts in a big-time way.  This bill builds upon the Energy and Commerce Committee's impressive  record of hearings and legislation focused on energy security,  emergency preparedness, job creation, and infrastructure protection and  resilience.   Across the country, States have to respond to a variety of hazards,  including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fuel supply disruptions,  physical and, yes, cyber threats, too. This legislation provides States  with tools in the toolbox so that they have flexibility that they need  to address local energy challenges.   It ensures that State energy security planning efforts address fuel  supply issues, assess State energy profiles, address potential hazards  to each energy sector. It mitigates risk to enhance reliability and  incorporate regional planning efforts.   Let's face it, the consumer at home, businesses trying to put out a  product, they want to make sure that the electricity is on. They don't  care what the excuse is. They want it on.   This bill makes significant strides to protect our Nation's fuel and  electric infrastructure from physical and cybersecurity threats and  vulnerabilities. It makes sure that we are thinking ahead not just  about the actual threat, but, in fact, how our energy and electric  systems might be vulnerable in a broader sense.   The bill also encourages mutual assistance, an essential part of  responding and restoring in the event of an energy emergency. Teamwork:  prioritizing and elevating energy security planning and emergency  preparedness is, yes, an important step in the face of increased  threats, vulnerabilities, and interdependencies of energy  infrastructure and end-use systems.   This bill is important and is going to get to the President's desk in  a bipartisan way. Again, I thank my good friend and colleague for his  help in getting this bill through our committee and here to the House  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton), former chairman and now vice  chairman of the influential and powerful Energy and Commerce Committee,  coming from the good State of Texas versus the great State of Michigan.   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I would like to conclude by saying that I  thank the gentleman from Texas for his remarks. It was an important  amendment. God help us if something happens in our country because of a  physical or cyber attack. And if it does, we always wonder and ask the  questions: What do we do?   This is a step in advance to make sure that, in fact, we do have, as  I said earlier, the tools in the toolbox to try and prevent such a  travesty from happening that would impact the Nation in a major way. So  it is important that this legislation pass this afternoon; that the  Senate take it up as quickly as they can; that the President sign it;  and that it then gets implemented to protect all of our citizens from  East to West, to North, to South. It is an important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
