 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Petty Officer First Class  H. Travis Parker, an American hero who served in World War II and the  Korean war.   Mr. Parker enlisted in the Navy on August 26, 1942. He began his  service on the USS Midway during World War II, flying Consolidated PBY  Catalina seaplanes. He then flew Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes as  a member of Scouting Squadron VS-62 during the Korean war. He was  stationed on the USS Monterey.   Petty Officer First Class Parker was honorably discharged on January  5, 1963, after nearly 21 years of service to his country.   Mr. Parker became very involved with A.L. Lotts Elementary School  after his military service. He was consistently present at the school,  reading to children and serving as a mentor for troubled students  throughout the years.   Mr. Parker also devoted his time and resources to improving the  school and always took it upon himself to help fix problems. He  purchased school supplies and even fixed up a classroom after it was  vandalized by hoodlums.   Our country's heroes are the men and women of our Armed Forces like  Mr. Parker, not those who throw a baseball or throw a football. They  served and sacrificed for our freedom.   It is my honor to recognize Petty Officer First Class H. Travis  Parker as the Tennessee Second District's December 2019 Veteran of the  Month.                            ____________________
