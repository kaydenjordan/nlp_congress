 Mr. Speaker, once again, I have the  superlative pleasure of speaking from the well of the Congress of the  United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a liberated Democrat.   I rise today to speak truth to power.   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to remind us that, although we are the  leaders of the free world, we will not be received as the leaders of  the free world if we are perceived as the leader of worldwide bigotry.   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to remind us that we won't be received as  the leaders of the free world if we are perceived as being anti- immigration when it comes to Muslims and, as a result, xenophobic.   We won't be received as leaders of the free world if we are perceived  as homophobic because we are anti-transgender.   We won't be received as leaders of the free world if we are perceived  as anti-Africa because it is a continent of s---hole countries. We will  be perceived, quite frankly, and received as racist if we do so.   Mr. Speaker, if we are to maintain our preeminence in the world, we  must not be perceived as the bigots of the world.   Mr. Speaker, the solution can be an election in 2020, or it can be  impeachment tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I will bring impeachment before the Congress of the  United States of America again tomorrow sometime after 9 a.m. and  before we leave for our break.   Mr. Speaker, history is watching. We will be judged by our actions.  Time will tell. I will be on the right side of history.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I clearly, truly, and sincerely  thank the gentleman from New York for yielding to me. I would like to  acknowledge that his message was most edifying. It was made  perspicuously clear, and anyone having the opportunity to hear his  message clearly understands that there is a pathway to success for the  DREAMers. I am grateful that he has given his message, and I am honored  that he has yielded to me.   Mr. Speaker, Dr. King--and I mention him tonight because we just  celebrated his life and legacy, and I am still celebrating--but Dr.  King reminded us that the time is always ripe--r-i-p-e--always ripe to  do right. The time is always beneficial, the time is always right to do  that which is right. There may appear to be circumstances before you  that would cause you to conclude that there are great obstacles in your  way, and because of these great obstacles, you probably should wait  just a little bit longer. But there are some questions that cannot  wait, and allowing time to pass will only allow greater harm to  manifest itself. The time is always ripe, and the time is always right  to do that which is right.   In the past, the not too distant past, I was accorded the preeminent  privilege of bringing a privileged resolution before the Congress, and  that resolution was one for impeachment. That resolution received 58  votes to further the opportunity for impeachment to be voted upon.  There were a good many people who were of the opinion that this was 57  more votes than expected. I had no idea as to the number of votes that  would be cast for moving the resolution forward such that there might  be an up-or-down vote on impeachment. I had no idea. Fifty-eight votes  was acceptable to me. But I also want the Record to show, Mr. Speaker,  that if there had been but one vote, that would have been acceptable to  me because the time is always ripe to do that which is right, and it  was the right thing to do to bring the Articles of Impeachment.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to say that I believe the time is ripe for  additional Articles of Impeachment, and, as a result thereof, tomorrow,  additional Articles of Impeachment will be brought because the time is  ripe and because allowing additional time to pass will only allow  additional harm to manifest itself without a proper challenge having  been made to things that are occurring from the Presidency that, Mr.  Speaker, cannot be tolerated.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to say that I have no idea as to what the  vote will be when we vote tomorrow or within the next 2 legislative  days, as required by the rules. My suspicion is that the vote will take  place tomorrow. I don't set the time for the vote. I determine when the  resolution will be presented, and the Speaker of the House determines  when the actual vote will take place. That is his to decide. I respect  any decision that he makes.   But as to my colleagues, I am not lobbying anyone to vote for this  resolution. Each person must address what his or her conscience  dictates. I have no idea as t what the vote will be, and I say this  candidly because there are a good many people who will continually  query: How will people vote? What will the outcome be? I have no idea,  Mr. Speaker.    But I say this: whatever the outcome, I will know that I have done  the right thing. I will know that I will be on the right side of  history, and I will know that there are unborn generations who will  look back through the vista of time, and they will make decisions about  the actions we take at this time. I will let them judge.   It is unfortunate, but the people of the time that we live in can  sometimes not be in the best position to judge the things that we do  and the actions that we take. So I will know, Mr. Speaker, that we have  done the right thing, and I will know that the judges who look through  the vista of time will set the record straight for those who may have  some confusion about what is happening at this time.   I am confident, Mr. Speaker, that whatever the vote is, it will be a  vote that will be recorded on our Record. It will be the second vote,  and I want the Record to show that I repeatedly stood on the right side  of history. I will repeatedly do this. For those who may be concerned,  this may not be the last vote. So there may be more than two votes that  we will take that will show where we stand on this great question of  our time.   What is the great question of our time? The great question of our  time, as it relates to those of us in this country and around the  world, is this: Are we going to allow the United States of America, the  country that I love--no one sings ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' louder  than I do, maybe not in a perfect key. No one recites the pledge with  greater enthusiasm than I do. No one believes in the words told in the  Pledge of Allegiance, liberty and justice, more than I do. No one  believes in the words in the Declaration of Independence, ``All persons  being created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable  rights''--no one believes these things more than I. I love my country.   So the question is, this country, the leader of the free world-- people around the world depend on us for leadership and guidance on the  great issues impacting the world; whether they be political or moral,  people in this world depend on the United States. People want to know:  Where is the United States of America when it comes to a crisis?  Regardless of the magnitude of the crisis, where are the Americans, the  leaders of the free world?   So, Mr. Speaker, the question is: Will we allow our preeminence in  the world to be diminished by a perception that we condone and accept,  in fact, will tolerate, bigotry? Will we tolerate bigotry? Will we  allow the bigotry emanating in this country from the highest office to  become the image of the United States of America? Will we allow people  around the world to think that we condone this? I think not,  [[Page H550]]  which is why I will bring the Articles of Impeachment tomorrow.   It is my opinion that I--personal pronoun--will not and should not  tolerate bigotry. I lived too long, Mr. Speaker, and I fought too hard.  I have suffered too many indignations associated with segregation. I  had the Klan burn a cross in my yard. I know what bigotry looks like, I  know what it smells like, I know what it sounds like, and I know what  it feels like.   So I have been involved and engaged in this struggle too long to  tolerate it. I refuse to tolerate bigotry. The truth is, that which you  will tolerate, you are not likely to change. If you will tolerate it,  you are not likely to change it.   So my vote tomorrow will be one indicative of a person who will not  tolerate bigotry. My vote tomorrow will be one that I trust young  children in years to come will be proud to say: One American stood  against bigotry.   We in this House have had years, in fact, centuries, to eradicate and  eliminate the hatred associated with bigotry and invidious  discrimination. We went through slavery.                                time  2130    We fought back. We went through segregation. We changed the laws. But  we cannot allow ourselves to be put in a position such that it will be  perceived that we are amenable to allowing the clock, the hands of  time, to be rolled back to a time that none of us would like to return  to. Surely, I would not, given what I know about how bigotry impacts  the lives and the psyches of human beings.   We are confronting the great question of: What will the United States  look like to the rest of the world? How will we be perceived?   But more important than this, Mr. Speaker, the question is really:  Will we stand by silently when we can plainly and clearly see that  wrong is being perpetrated and that people are being harmed?   Bigotry may not impact me the same way it impacts people who are  working every day and who don't have the benefit of Congress to come to  and to work in the facilities that I work in.   There are people who are hardworking Americans who are impacted by  bigotry in ways that are harmful and that I and many others will not  experience. There are people of color who will go in to apply for a  loan and have their loans denied because of how they look. We have  empirical evidence to support it. It happens. It still happens to  people of color.   There are people who will be impacted by bigotry simply because of  who they happen to associate with in their intimate personal lives.  There is still bigotry associated with the LGBTQ community. You can be  fired because of who they happen to be, the person that God created.  They can be fired for being that person.   There are people who suffer from bigotry because of their religious  beliefs. If you are Jewish, you may find yourself at some point  suffering from bigotry perpetrated because of your belief in your God.   If you are Muslim, you may find yourself suffering from the horrors  associated with bigotry and being banned from a country because of your  religious beliefs and because you are of the Islamic faith.   Mr. Speaker, the list goes on and on. These are everyday, hardworking  people who suffer. Those of us who are here in Congress may not suffer  all of these indignations, but there are times when some of us, too,  will befall to the ugliness of bigotry.   Mr. Speaker, the question is: Will we allow people who we know we can  help be assisted by virtue of the position that we take?   I say to you, Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, sometime after we start our  legislative day, I will come to the well and I will present Articles of  Impeachment that will differ from the prior Articles of Impeachment.  These articles will associate commentary made in the highest office in  the land with policies that are produced.   When you are in the White House and you say ugly comments about a  continent, the countries within that continent, about other countries,  and you are talking about immigration policy, surely it is reasonable  to conclude that your commentary can be converted into your policy,  that it can become part of your policy, and that if you conclude and if  you, by your commentary, would have us know that you may have concluded  that people from a predominantly White country are more welcome than  people from countries of color, it is not unreasonable for one to  conclude that your immigration policy may be one that is race-based  masquerading as one that is merit-based. It is not unreasonable, Mr.  Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, as I close, I want to apologize to people who I may have  offended with my message, because the intent is not to offend. The  intent is to speak the truth.   Mr. Speaker, I take no great solace in having to bring this truth  before the Congress of the United States of America. This is not  something that I came to Congress to do. It is not something that I  take great pleasure in doing. People say ugly things about me and to  me. Just today, we had a call to our office, a threat that involved the  taking of life.   So this is nothing that I do with any degree of pleasure. I do it  because it is right. And to all of the people who I may have offended,  to colleagues that may somehow think ill of what I do, you have my  apologies. It is really not about you. It is about democracy. It is  about government of the people, by the people, and whether we will  maintain government of the people, by the people. It is about the  Republic and whether we will do as Franklin indicated, keep the  Republic that we have.   It really is not about any individual. It is not about any political  party. It is about the greatest country in the world and whether we,  who have the ability, the responsibility, if you will, to take on these  challenges, will do so in such a way as to protect the institutions  that we love.   I am giving you my position. I give no one else's position. I am a  caucus of one. It is called the liberated democratic caucus. That is  who I am, a liberated Democrat. That means that I cannot only speak  truth to power, I can speak truth about power.   Tonight, the truth is that we have a country in crisis. The stock  market is up, yes. Jobs, yes, people are employed. There is something  to be said about the types of jobs at minimum wage, but for this  soliloquy, let's just say people are employed.   But these things are not what make a country great. The greatness of  a country is not measured by how we treat people who live in the sweets  of life. The greatness of a country is measured by how you treat people  who live in the streets of life. Those who live in the streets of life  are the ones who have to cope with bigotry that many of us never see  and many don't understand.   So, Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to have had this moment to talk about  the time that we will share tomorrow. It will take place. I do look  forward to having the opportunity to stand in the well again of the  Congress of America. It is a preeminent privilege, a superlative  pleasure, and a splendiferous honor.
