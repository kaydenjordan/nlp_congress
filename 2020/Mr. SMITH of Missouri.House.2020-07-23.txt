 Madam Speaker, on the last day of the Obama- Biden administration, Fish and Wildlife issued a ``Director's Order''  setting in place an almost total ban on lead ammunition and tackle on  Federal lands.   While Fish and Wildlife claimed that the rule was based on science,  we know clearly it was not. The decision by the Obama-Biden  administration was made solely to limit access to public land of  sportsmen and fishermen.   As soon as I was made aware of this midnight rule, I worked with the  incoming Trump administration to get it overturned. Fortunately,  President  [[Page H3821]]  Trump acted quickly to undo this disastrous order. And since then he  has only taken steps to increase access to public lands for sportsmen  and fishermen alike.   Since President Trump's actions, Congress has taken additional steps  to prevent the regulation of ammunition and tackle for sportsmen.  Unfortunately, Democrats have decided to abandon the precedent.    My amendment simply reinstates a policy that Congress has carried in  a bipartisan fashion for the past several years and continues support  for the rights of sportsmen to access public land for recreational  purposes.   I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Speaker, waters of the U.S., social cost  of carbon, the Clean Power Plan rules, these are just a few of the  crushing regulations issued by the Obama-Biden Presidency.   During the Obama-Biden administration, the EPA issued nearly 4,000  regulations. These rules totaled tens of thousands of pages in Federal  regulations and billions of dollars in compliance costs. The families,  farmers, and  [[Page H3828]]  small businesses of Missouri could not keep up.   Thankfully, since taking office, President Trump has kept his promise  to deliver regulatory relief to the American people. He has removed  seven regulations for every new one added, saving households thousands  of dollars a year in regulatory costs.   The other side would have you believe that reining in the EPA by  reducing funding leads to dirtier air and dirtier water when, in fact,  the opposite is the case. Under President Trump, emissions have fallen  in every major category and overall have dropped 7 percent since 2017.  Right now, we have the cleanest air since 1970. That is 50 years.   Democrats want to take us back to Obama-Biden era spending policies  with this funding bill, which breaks the recently agreed to spending  caps and returns us to the regulatory machine of the prior  administration that harms small businesses and family farmers. But the  American people are not interested in returning to the increased costs  and overregulation of that administration.   My amendment simply reduces funding for the EPA to reflect President  Trump's budget request.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, more money is not always the  answer. The right policies, efficiency, is the answer.   As I said earlier, for the first time in 50 years, under Trump's  policies and Trump's spending, we have the cleanest air since 1970.   I am not sure why the majority is concerned about cutting funding for  the EPA when they have included $13 billion in additional emergency  funding in this bill for the EPA alone.   My amendment is not about preventing the EPA from doing its job. It  is about ensuring that the EPA does the job we gave it to do and  nothing else.   Now is not the time to return to the spending habits and  overregulation of the Obama-Biden era. If this funding amount is good  enough for the President, it is good enough for me.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Speaker, once again, I rise to advocate  in favor of the fiscal sanity of the Trump administration.   Just like my last amendment, this amendment prevents the Democrats  from taking us back to the Obama-Biden era policies of overregulation  and overspending.   The Obama-Biden EPA brought us thousands of new regulations, tens of  thousands of new pages in the Federal  [[Page H3829]]  Register, and billions in compliance costs for American farmers, small  businesses, and families, much of this backed by flawed research with a  political agenda.   The Office of Science and Technology aids in the regulatory process  and is responsible for the faulty research that led to costly  regulations like the social cost of carbon and the Clean Power Plan.   The American people need transparent research without an agenda. They  don't need Obama-Biden era regulations and spending policies.   The amendment, once again, simply reduces funding for the EPA to  reflect President Trump's budget request.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, if you listen to my Democrat  colleagues, you would think the EPA could not go on without this  funding that we are trying to reduce. It is about being efficient.   This administration, as I had said earlier, under President Trump,  emissions have fallen in every major category and overall have dropped  7 percent since 2017. Right now, we have the cleanest air since 1970.   Throwing money at an issue you care about is not the solution. Being  efficient in government is the solution, and that is what the Trump EPA  has done.                                time  1930    So they have asked for this particular amount of money, and I am  making sure that we are giving the EPA what they need, not busting the  spending caps which were agreed to by Republicans and Democrats by  their current proposal.   Let's keep the spending caps. Let's adopt my amendment.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
