 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, where did we get this notion  that the filibuster is more worth preserving than the right to vote?  That is surely not the lesson of American history. That is surely not  what we teach our students in the classroom or our children at home.  Yet, that is the lie that dictates what happens here in the Nation's  Capitol, a lie that comes at a heavy cost to American democracy.   It seems that there is nothing sacred in American politics--not the  truth, not the peaceful transfer of power, not the full faith and  credit of the United States, and, indeed, not even the right to vote.   The enforcement mechanisms of the Voting Rights Act have been all but  eviscerated.   First, there is section 5, otherwise known as preclearance, which  enables the executive branch, the Civil Rights Division of the  Department of Justice, to enforce the Voting Rights Act. Then there is  section 2, which enables the judicial branch, the courts, to enforce  the Voting Rights Act. Both of these provisions have been gutted at the  hands of rightwing judicial activism.   The end of the Voting Rights Act as we know it has been a political  windfall for the Republican Party, which is intent on holding power by  any means necessary, even if it means disenfranchising Black and Brown  voters.   We are here to tell you that the Congressional Black Caucus will not  stand by idly while the voting rights of Black Americans come under  systematic assault. We will fight back because fighting is what we do  in the Congressional Black Caucus and because there were many before us  who were bloodied and bludgeoned and beaten so that we can have the  right to vote. The least we can do is fight back.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty),  our dynamic leader, our dynamic chair.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Underwood).    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have left?    I will use far fewer than 16 minutes.   Madam Speaker, the lesson of history is State and local governments  cannot be trusted to respect voting rights in the absence of Federal  oversight. Federal voting rights enforcement is essential, as essential  as the right to vote itself. And the most powerful tool for voting  rights enforcement is preclearance. Preclearance has been so effective  that, from 1965 to 2006, it kept 1,200 State and local voting  restrictions from taking effect.   The John Lewis Voting Rights Act would restore preclearance as the  gold standard of voting rights enforcement, not only for some States  but for all.   The John Lewis Voting Rights Act makes real the creed of America,  liberty and justice for all.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
