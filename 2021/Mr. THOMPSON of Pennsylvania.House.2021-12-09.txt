 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize an ordinary citizen of Patton Township in Centre County,  David Panko.   For the past 22 years, David served as president of the Patton  Township Business Association. In his role as president, he built  lasting relationships between the association, the community, and the  Patton Township Police.   In 2002, David worked to establish the Patton Township Children's  Safety Fair, a community event focused on building trust between  residents and their police officers, firefighters, and EMS responders  in Centre County.   David will be remembered as a leader who worked to make his community  a better place. He rebuilt the organization into a group full of  gracious and welcoming members.   Through David's leadership, the Patton Township Business Association  has  [[Page H7562]]  continued to advance the commercial, industrial, and civic interests  for the people of Patton Township.   I have had the privilege of working closely with David and the Patton  Township Business Association as they advocated on behalf of small  businesses in Patton Township and the Centre County region.   I thank David for his years of leadership and service to the  organization, Patton Township, and Centre County. His contributions  cannot be overstated, and his legacy will be remembered for years to  come.                            ____________________
