 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the commitment  of a devoted central Washington public servant, Kevin Fuhr.   Formerly the chief of police for Moses Lake, Chief Fuhr has concluded  an illustrious 32-year career in law enforcement and is now ready to  move on to the next chapter of his life.   While other regions of Washington had trouble hiring new police  officers, Chief Fuhr's leadership drew people to his department in the  pursuit of working with him. Chief Fuhr's force also spearheaded an  exceptional outreach program, and his leadership on my Central  Washington Fentanyl Task Force has fostered a remarkable level of trust  within our communities.   When most folks retire, they look forward to all the spare time they  will have. Not Chief Fuhr, as he has recently been hired as the city  manager for Moses Lake, underscoring his unwavering dedication to  central Washington.   I have known Kevin for a long time and am proud to call him a dear  friend. His leadership, integrity, and commitment to the prosperity of  our region have resulted in a wonderful career with so much to show for  it. It has been a pleasure working with him, and I am looking forward  to that continuing in his new role.                            ____________________
