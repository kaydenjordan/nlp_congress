 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the  life and career of John Michael Elliott, who passed away suddenly on  March 12, 2021. It is my honor to reflect on the legacy John built for  his family and his community. For me and for my family, John M. Elliott  was a faithful friend.   Community, heritage, and history were all important to John. Born in  Girardville, Schuylkill County, PA, on July 8, 1941. John later  graduated magna cum laude from St. Vincent College, where he played  varsity baseball. He received the American Jurisprudence Award from the  Georgetown University Law Center and launched a successful 55-year  legal career. John Elliott never forgot his Schuylkill County roots or  Irish-American heritage.   John was a skilled lawyer who became chairman and CEO of Elliott  Greenleaf, the law firm he founded in 1990. To John, law was a  profession as well as a means by which he could advance his greater  purpose in life: to be of service to others. He was talented and  tenacious. In 1979, he worked to right a past wrong and won a  posthumous pardon for Irish immigrant and Schuylkill resident, Jack  Kehoe. In 2002, he won an age-discrimination case that resulted in the  largest single-plaintiff jury verdict in the history of the U.S.  District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. John was  generous with his legal talents and imparted his knowledge onto the  next generation of lawyers as a lecturer for the American Law  Institute, the American, Pennsylvania and Philadelphia Bar  Associations, the National Institute for Trial Advocacy, and the  Pennsylvania Bar Institute.   Outside of his law practice and lectures, John remained committed to  service. He served as chairman of the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme  Court of Pennsylvania, as a commissioner of the Delaware River Port  Authority and as a member of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission  and the Pennsylvania Environmental Quality Board. He was appointed by  the U.S. Secretary of State to the Commission on Security and  Cooperation in Europe's Conferences on the Human Dimension in Paris and  on Democratic Institutions in Oslo and was a Presidential appointee to  the White House Coal Advisory Commission. He was a steadfast supporter  of St. Patrick's College in Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland, for more  than two decades. He was recognized twice for his efforts in 1995 when  Cardinal Cahal B. Daly of Ireland dedicated the Salamanca Archives at  the college in his honor and in 2001 when Cardinal Desmond Connell  conferred upon him the Gold Medal of St. Patrick.   John received many accolades during his lifetime. He was awarded an  LL.D. by his alma mater, St. Vincent College, and The Legal  Intelligencer's 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award. His greatest  achievement and source of pride was his family. Those fortunate enough  to receive John's oversized holiday card every year were treated to  references to his children and their families and candid images of each  one of his grandchildren. The passing of John M. Elliott is a terrible  loss for his wife, Eileen; his brother Thomas and sister Margaret Mary;  his children, Jack, Heather, Kirwan, Kyle, and Thomas; his 14  grandchildren; and the rest of his family and many friends as they  mourn his loss. His death is also a loss for our Commonwealth. May he  rest in peace.                            ____________________
