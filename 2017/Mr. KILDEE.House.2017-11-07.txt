 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think the House should note that the Speaker and the  two gentlemen controlling the time are from the greatest State, the  great State of Michigan, so I think we are in good hands.                                time  1415    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3911, which is offered,  as my colleague has said, in a bipartisan fashion by Representatives  Wagner and Foster.   This legislation would allow the Securities and Exchange Commission  to focus on the most high-risk areas when conducting annual  examinations of certain credit rating agencies known as nationally  recognized statistical rating organizations.   Credit rating agencies did, in fact, play a central role in the  subprime mortgage meltdowns by routinely assigning inflated credit  ratings to high-risk structured mortgage products. These ratings, which  were issued by agencies operating under conflicts of interests, allowed  banks to assume unreasonable amounts of risk and resulted in the loss  of trillions of dollars when the mortgages underlying those risky  investments began to default.   In the wake of the ensuing financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act  strengthened oversight of credit rating agencies, including by  directing the SEC to create an Office of Credit Ratings responsible for  conducting annual examinations of the rating organizations.   Currently, each rating organization examination must include a review  of eight topic areas designed to assess the adequacy of each agency's  internal controls, conflicts of interests, and rating methodologies,  among other areas.   This legislation, H.R. 3911, is responsive to former SEC Chair Mary  Jo White's 2013 request to the Financial Services Committee for  legislation that would allow the SEC staff to take a risk-based  approach to annual rating organization examinations. Such an approach  would allow the SEC to focus valuable resources on the areas where  problematic conduct is most likely to exist.   H.R. 3911 is designed to strengthen regulatory efforts rather than  provide a basis for reduced accountability. So I do urge the SEC to use  the discretion afforded under H.R. 3911 in order to focus on areas that  present the greatest risk of misconduct.   It is vital that our ratings organizations are accountable, and I  believe this bill is an important step to ensure that the inflated  ratings that led up to the financial crisis are not repeated.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3911. I thank Representatives Foster and  Wagner for their bipartisan work on this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just reiterate two  things. One, I think here is an opportunity for us to demonstrate that  there are times when we come together to deal with specific problems in  a bipartisan fashion. We ought to encourage it, and I am pleased to be  a part of it.   Again, I would like to reiterate the point that this legislation is  not intended to weaken oversight; in fact, it is intended to focus  oversight on those areas of greatest risk. It is my hope and my sincere  belief that that is the approach that the SEC will take upon passage  and enactment of this legislation. It is a step in the right direction,  and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to support H.R. 2148, and I want to  start by thanking the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott) and the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger) for their work on this  bipartisan legislation, a bill that deals with capital rules for  commercial real estate loans, including acquisition, development, or  construction loans.   It is critical that Federal bank regulators maintain the strong  capital rules that have been implemented after the enactment of Dodd- Frank. These rules have made the U.S. financial system much safer,  while protecting consumers, investors, and taxpayers in promoting  stable economic growth.   Unlike some proposals that have been introduced that would gut the  regulatory framework of Dodd-Frank, I am pleased that this bill  reasonably seeks to resolve a valid concern raised by community banks  that certain capital rules relating to high volatility commercial real  estate, or HVCRE, loans are far too complex. This is an issue that  financial regulators like the FDIC have also acknowledged must be  addressed and must be fixed.   The problem, in fact, was highlighted in their Economic Growth and  Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act report, which was published earlier  this year.   In September, financial regulators released a proposal to revise the  capital rules to make the calculations more straightforward. This is a  good step in resolving this issue.   Although I am supportive of H.R. 2148, there are some concerns that I  have heard and that I can appreciate, including that it could provide  for more rigid definitions relating to capital rules.   The highly technical standards are important, though, to demonstrate  congressional intent. But Congress may not need to act, if bank  regulators correct the problem on their own.   In addition, according to the FDIC Inspector General, commercial real  estate loans generally account for more than one-third of community  bank lending. The GAO found that failure of many small banks in the  last crisis were ``driven by credit losses on CRE  [[Page H8549]]  loans, particularly loans secured by real estate to finance land  development and construction.'' We have to be cautious, and we should  be sensitive to these risks.   Notwithstanding all of those legitimate concerns that we should keep  in mind, I support this legislation and hope that it will send a clear  signal to the regulators that they should consider and address any  comments on their proposed rule without delay that is fully sensitive  to the risks that I have discussed.   Importantly, in committee, Congresswoman Maloney offered an amendment  that I was pleased was adopted. This amendment better aligns this bill  with the regulators' proposed rule to fix this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, H.R.  2148, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), a distinguished  member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Huizenga, for his work on this. I  also thank Mr. Pittenger and Mr. Scott as well.  [[Page H8550]]    This is a piece of legislation, again, as the previous legislation  did, that demonstrates that we do have the capability of solving a  problem and coming together on specific issues when we can.   In this case, we have legislation that, I think, strikes that  important balance in maintaining important regulations and standards in  place that prevent the kind of catastrophes that we have seen in the  past, but also, in this case, anticipates that there is a legitimate  problem that needs to be solved, particularly in this case, in ensuring  that development can occur in those places where it is often very  difficult to see development take place. This is something that is  absolutely critical and makes sense. This legislation strikes a good  balance between those competing interests.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
