 Mr. President, let me commend Senator Whitehouse for his  consistent efforts to illuminate and discuss the problem of climate  change, which affects not just the United States but the entire world.  It is a pleasure to join him and once again call attention to this  urgent threat.   We know that climate change impacts our health, our communities, our  economy, and our infrastructure, but today I would like to focus on how  climate change is affecting our national security--some of the points  Senator Whitehouse also made.   Beginning with the 2008 National Defense Strategy, the administration  of President George W. Bush stated that ``changes with existing and  future resource, environmental, and climate pressures may generate new  security challenges . . . These risks will require managing the  divergent needs of massively increasing energy demand to maintain  economic development and the need to tackle climate change.''   With increasing frequency in recent years, climate change has been  commonly referred to as a threat multiplier. Simply put, climate change  can and will exacerbate conditions in regions with already tenuous  stability.   Numerous intelligence assessments have reached the same conclusion.  Climate change will have broad impacts for U.S. national security  interests over the next 30 years and beyond.   In their words, the National Intelligence Council has found that  ``rising sea levels, flooding, droughts, higher temperatures, and more  frequent extreme weather events will increasingly threaten military  capabilities and facilities on both U.S. and foreign territory,  including military bases and training ranges.''   Furthermore, the National Intelligence Council identified six key  pathways: threats to the stability of countries, heightened social and  political tensions, adverse effects on food prices and availability,  increased risks to human health, negative impacts on investments and  economic competitiveness, and potential climate discontinuities and  secondary surprises.   The former Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis, has stated to the Senate  Armed Services Committee that ``where climate change contributes to  regional instability, the Department of Defense must be aware of any  potential adverse impacts.'' He also noted that ``climate change is  impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are  operating today.''   More recently, Gen. Joe Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, was asked about climate change at an event held by Duke  University's Program in American Grand Strategy. He said:         When we look at, when I look at, climate change, it's in       the category of sources of conflict around the world and       things we have to respond to. So it can be great devastation       requiring humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, which the       U.S. military certainly conducts routinely. In fact, I can't       think of a year since I've been on active duty that we       haven't conducted at least one operation in the Pacific along       those lines due to extreme weather in the Pacific. And then,       when you look at source of conflict--shortages of water and       those kind of things--those are all sources of conflict. So,       it is very much something that we take into account in our       planning as we anticipate when, where and how we may be       engaged in the future and what capabilities we should have.    The Department of Defense has already observed many negative impacts  to readiness and resources due to extreme weather as a result of  climate change.   The Congressional Budget Office has concluded ``costs associated with  hurricane damage will increase more rapidly than the economy will  grow''--$39 billion annually by 2075.   In 2017, the Government Accountability Office found that ``weather  effects associated with climate change pose operational and budgetary  risks'' to the Department of Defense.   The GAO also found that ``even without knowing precisely how or when  the climate will change--[DOD] knows it must build resilience into its  policies, programs, and operations in a thoughtful and cost-effective  way.''   Last year, the Pentagon also submitted its screening level  vulnerability assessment surveys to Congress. It found that roughly  half of all military installations that responded stated they had  experienced adverse impacts from climate change: damage from high  winds, flooding due to storm surge and non-storm surge events, extreme  temperatures, droughts, and wildfires. However, that figure is likely  much higher because the other half of military installations around the  globe didn't even respond to the survey. Oddly enough, those military  installations that said they had not experienced negative impacts from  climate change were very close to other installations, which said they  had. Clearly, this is a broad problem for our military.   The Department's most recent report on climate change was like an  introductory primer and carried about as much value as a phonebook. It  failed to provide many required elements, such as a top 10 list of the  most vulnerable  [[Page S1945]]  installations from each military service. Instead, the report focused  on 79 installations important for mission assurance and found that  about two-thirds of them are--in their words--``vulnerable to current  or future recurrent flooding [and] more than half are vulnerable to  current or future drought, and wildfires.''   Perhaps the most recent and high-profile impacts occurred this month  when a particular type of storm in the Midwest, called a bomb cyclone,  left at least one-third of Offutt Air Force Base underwater from  flooding.   Just a few months ago, Hurricane Michael made a direct hit on Tyndall  Air Force Base in Florida, which was only shortly after the astonishing  1,000-year event of Hurricane Florence in North Carolina, which caused  severe damage at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune. In other words, the  amount of observed rain during Hurricane Florence had a 1-in-100 chance  of occurring each year.   While initial reporting indicated at Tyndall that roughly 17 F-22s  were destroyed or severely damaged after being left at the base during  Hurricane Michael, fortunately, the actual damage to aircraft turned  out to be minimal. However, the fact that over a dozen advanced  fighters costing roughly $130 million per aircraft had to be abandoned  in the first place is a fundamental flaw in readiness and aircraft  maintenance.   Despite the minimal damage to aircraft, the projected cost to rebuild  Tyndall is still roughly $4.1 billion. The underlying issue that must  be addressed is that hangars and other facilities are not adequately  designed and built to withstand an increased trend of heavy winds above  130 miles per hour or other extreme weather. Meanwhile, the estimated  cost to rebuild what was at Camp Lejeune--according to the Commandant  of the Marine Corps--is roughly $3.7 billion.    Fortunately, at Camp Lejeune, several hangars survived and did not  flood. This is because they were appropriately designed in the first  place.   These glaring examples of Offutt Air Force Base, Tyndall Air Force  Base, and Camp Lejeune clearly demonstrate that we must plan for  climate adaptation now or we will pay much, much more in the future.   General Neller, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, recently wrote to  the Secretary of the Navy saying that the Marine Corps ``faces fiscal  challenges without precedent'' given that ``Hurricane Florence damage  is negatively impacting Marine Corps readiness.''   To put some of that in context, the Commandant said the ``total  recovery cost is 9 percent of our annual budget; the building repair  cost is 150 percent of our total annual building repair budget; and the  building replacement cost is four years' worth of non-Guam MILCON.''  The Commandant closed the letter by warning that the next hurricane  season is only 3 months away.   Beyond these most recent events, climate change continues to cost DOD  significant resources, measured in taxpayer funding and negative  impacts on readiness.   In 2017, the trio of hurricanes--Maria, Irma, and Harvey--cost the  Department over $1.3 billion in military construction and facilities  sustainment restoration and modernization alone. Hurricane Harvey was  the third 500-year flood in the Houston area in the last 3 years--we  are getting 500-year floods every 3 years in parts of the United  States--and it left four times more than the entire flow of the  Mississippi River on the city of Houston, TX.   At Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, there were 81 black flag  training days. These are days where training is canceled due to heat.  That was in 2012. In 2016, there were 226 black flag days.   The Marine Corps experienced 478 heat-related injuries in 2013. By  comparison, there were 688 in 2017 and 744 in 2016.   In Alaska, three locations of early warning radar infrastructure have  been damaged and moved due to coastal erosion that was not expected to  occur until 2030.   In 2016, a 10,000-acre wildfire in California closed the south side  of Vandenberg Air Force Base, stalling the launch of an Atlas V rocket.  Wildfires also led to training range closures for multiple months in  North Carolina, South Carolina, Idaho, Florida, and New Mexico.   In Arizona last summer, a heat wave caused 40 flights to be canceled,  with clear implications for DOD aircraft, ships, and vehicles that must  be able to continue to operate in extreme hot and cold temperatures.  Yet current adaptation measures attempted by DOD have yet to be  comprehensive or entirely successful.   In what could be the beginning of a startling trend, the Air Force  recently had to cancel a fiscal year 2018 military construction project  in Alaska due to ``thawing permafrost under the existing facility  causing significant settling'' with the facility foundation.   Warming Arctic temperatures at Thule Air Force Base in Greenland have  caused extensive airfield pavement repairs at a cost of over $30  million, which is roughly the cost of one Army Combat Training Center  rotation. So instead of getting brigades down to Ft. Irwin for the  training exercises they need, we are going to have to repave and repave  bases that are exposed to some of these climate effects.   Meanwhile, melting ice caps continue to open up new sea lanes in the  Arctic--a topic that the Presiding Officer knows better than anyone  else in this body--increasing commercial traffic and prompting several  countries, including Russia, to vie for influence and control over the  region.   Notably, the current force structure of the Navy is not adequately  postured to respond and operate in the Arctic, and the GAO recently  found that even the Navy admits ``significant limitations for operating  surface ships in the Arctic.''   Protecting our national security requires tough decisions that are  made through a careful evaluation of risks, which, as I have described,  must include the real risks posed by climate change.   I am concerned by many actions coming by the current administration,  not only to downplay these risks but also to actively undermine the  scientific consensus on climate change. Instead of heeding the warnings  of scientists, including those from the 13 Federal Agencies that worked  on the ``National Climate Assessment,'' the administration is working  to create a climate security panel led by a noted climate denier to  contradict these warnings.   I will continue--and I know others will continue--fighting any  efforts to cast doubt on the fact that climate change is real and that  it is human-caused. We need to be able to acknowledge these basic facts  so that we can quickly come together to work toward meaningful  solutions.   Again, let me thank Senator Whitehouse for inviting me to join him  today to highlight the impacts of climate change on national security.  The dangers of inaction are many, and as ranking member of the Armed  Services Committee, I will be continuing to sound the alarm on this  critical issue.   I have tried to emphasize the effects of climate change on our  training facilities, on our bases here in the United States, and on our  regions that are close by, where we prepare our forces to be sent  overseas. But if you look overseas in areas that are suffering drought,  in areas where agricultural land is diminishing, and in areas where  farming used to be the mainstay of the population and now has  disappeared and the population is unemployed, if you look at places  like Pakistan, which has significant environmental problems,  significant financial problems, and significant problems with terrorist  organizations, if you look in thousands of places around the globe,  those are real threats that are being accelerated by climate change  that our military will have to adapt and adjust to.   This is a multiphase issue. We have to take steps here at home to  preserve our training bases and to make sure that our airfields can  operate in all types of weather so that we can have the Marine Corps  facilities in Camp Lejeune in A-1 condition.   It is the major force-generating position for the Marine Corps on the  Atlantic coast. We have to be able to do that. That is just part of the  problem.   The other part of the problem is the potential for conflict overseas.  In many countries, it is accelerating because they are losing their  quality of life, their economic ability, and all these things. There is  drought, severe weather, hurricanes, and storms. There was  [[Page S1946]]  huge cyclonic activity just reported last week in parts of Africa. That  is causing disruption for families, death, and a host of problems that  are causing not particularly stable governments to become less stable.   This is an issue that we must address. I look forward to working with  all of my colleagues in order to provide the resources and the  direction to do that.   I yield the floor.
