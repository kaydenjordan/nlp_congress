 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 469, an unwarranted and  costly intrusion into Congress' powers under Article I of the  Constitution that will undermine the enforcement of statutory  deadlines.   When passing laws, Congress routinely establishes mandatory deadlines  for agency action. These statutory deadlines serve several purposes.  They establish congressional priorities, attempt to reduce undue delay  in an agency's compliance with the law, and communicate the importance  of a legal requirement to the public. But because agency resources are  limited, there is widespread noncompliance with statutory deadlines, as  the Administrative Conference of the United States has long observed.   Accordingly, a plaintiff with standing may file a lawsuit to complete  a schedule for an agency to complete an action required by Congress,  often referred to as a ``deadline suit.'' As the nonpartisan Government  Accountability Office, the GAO, reported earlier this year, ``Most  deadline suits are resolved through a negotiated settlement agreement  because, in the majority of them, it is undisputed that a statutory  deadline was missed,'' and there was no legal defense to the lawsuit.   But proponents of H.R. 469 assert that these settlements undercut  applicable administrative law and short-circuit review of new  regulations. This premise is based on a report by the Chamber of  Commerce that the so-called sue and settle process is increasingly  being used as a technique to shape agencies' regulatory agendas. This  concern, however, is unsupported by any independent evidence and has  been debunked by the GAO.   In two reports on deadline suits, the GAO has found that, ``the  settlement agreements did not affect the substantive basis or  procedural rulemaking requirements,'' of the agencies it studied.   In its December 2014 report on deadline lawsuits involving the  Environmental Protection Agency, the GAO determined that none of the  settlements finalized under the Obama administration ``included terms  that finalized the substantive outcome of a rule.'' The GAO underscored  this point in the title of its report: ``Impact of Deadline Suits on  EPA's Rulemaking is Limited.''   In its February 2017 report on deadline suits involving the  Endangered Species Act, the GAO found that ``the settlement agreements  did not affect the substantive basis or procedural rulemaking  requirements the agencies were to follow in completing the actions,  such as providing opportunities for public notice and comment on  proposed listing rules.''   Leading experts have also debunked the Chamber's sue and settle  narrative. John Cruden, a senior career official at the Justice  Department for more than two decades during two Republican and two  Democratic administrations, testified on a substantially identical bill  that he was ``not aware of any instance of a settlement that could  remotely be described as collusive, but that the Justice Department  vigorously represented the Federal agency, defending the agency's legal  position, and obtaining in any settlement the best possible terms that  were consistent with the controlling law.''   Other administrative law experts, such as Robert Weissman, the  president of Public Citizen, have similarly testified that sue and  settlement allegations are patently false.   This bill is also unnecessary because current law and agency practice  already restrict the use of settlement policy to shape regulatory  priorities. During its exhaustive review of deadline litigation, the  GAO found that the Justice Department is guided by the Meese memo of  1986, when litigating deadline suits. This policy, as the GAO noted  earlier this year, limits the settlement of a deadline suit to ``only  include a commitment to perform a mandatory action by an agreed upon  schedule and would not otherwise predetermine or prescribe a specific  substantive outcome for the actions to be completed by the agencies.''   The Meese memo was codified in 1991, in the Code of Federal  Regulations, and applies to settlement policy today. The Meese policy  primarily restricts agencies from using settlement policy to contravene  the law or congressional intent.                                time  1630    As the majority noted in its report on a substantially identical  version of the bill considered last Congress, this policy is grounded  in separation of powers concerns. There is no evidence that agencies do  not follow this policy, and the majority's witnesses in prior hearings  on this proposal have been unable to provide examples of settlements  that violate the Meese policies.   H.R. 469 is also wasteful and undermines Congress' powers under  Article I of the Constitution. Congress, not agencies, establish  regulatory priorities through statutes. Agencies do not have discretion  to pick and choose regulatory priorities where Congress has expressly  instructed that certain actions be undertaken by a specific date. By  imposing a series of onerous procedures that will constrain the use of  settlements to resolve a Federal agency's noncompliance with the law,  H.R. 469 erodes the constitutional function of the legislative branch.   Finally, the bill is also costly. The Congressional Budget Office  notes that this bill greatly lengthens the settlement process, costing  millions of dollars and straining the Treasury's Judgment Fund through  increased attorney's fees.   In closing, I strongly oppose this measure.   I now yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Conyers), our ranking member, to control.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I just want to again remind folks that, during the course of this  argument, we have heard this narrative about the problems with the sue  and settle, as Mr. Nadler described it, an imagined, concocted vast  conspiracy, but without any evidence that it actually exists, a  solution in search of a problem.   Just to remind folks, there were two reports done by the GAO--I have  them in my hand; they are thick--that, in fact, undermine the  suggestion that there is any such problem.   In response to requests from the Republican committee chairs, the  Government Accountability Office has twice concluded that agencies  cannot and do not circumvent the rulemaking system through settlements  relating to statutory deadlines.   Finally, we received testimony earlier this year from Attorney  General Jeff Sessions' Justice Department that current agency policy,  which was codified in 1991, prohibits circumventing the rulemaking  process through deadline lawsuits. We have heard similar testimony from  career Justice Department officials in prior administrations.   I ask the question: How is H.R. 469 necessary in light of this  complete lack of support for this so-called sue and settle phenomenon  and the presence of controls against this from happening in the first  instance?   Mr. Chair, again, there is just no evidence to support the necessity  for this. I think it has been articulated very well by my colleagues  what the dangers are of moving forward with this legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I just want to say I am baffled by the gentleman from  Louisiana's assertion that this legislation improves accountability. It  is very hard to imagine how undermining the enforcement of duly enacted  legislation by Congress of the United States improves accountability.   This is like the upsidedown world. How does that improve  accountability, making it more difficult to enforce the laws passed by  Congress of the United States?   Mr. Chairman, I just want to say in closing that it is very important  to note that my opposition to H.R. 469 is joined by a very broad  spectrum of organizations, including the American Federation of Labor  and Congress of Industrial Organizations, or AFL-CIO; the American  Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; Public Citizen;  Consumer Federation of America; the National Consumer Law Center; the  Natural Resources Defense Council; the Sierra Club; Earthjustice; and  People for the American Way; among many others.   Mr. Chairman, I think that is company, which should suggest to my  colleagues that this legislation does not benefit the American people,  it will undermine the actions of Congress.   Mr. Chairman, I urge everyone to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is very important to say at  the outset this is not about clarifying anything. This is about a major  change in policy.   This amendment will permit the publication of a victim's sensitive  information, such as the individual's name and case history, on the  internet. This overrides the Privacy Act.   So let's be clear about what this is. This is not a clarification.  This is a major change in policy.   This amendment will make a bad bill even worse. It specifies that the  Privacy Act does not prohibit the publication of a victim's sensitive  information, such as his or her name and case history.   Under current law, the Treasury Department cannot, for the purposes  of the Judgment Fund, publish the sensitive information of individuals  who are victims of government abuse or misconduct, such as a name or  case history. This is because the Privacy Act requires an individual's  consent prior to publishing their name or other sensitive information.   Although proponents of this amendment may claim that this information  is, in some instances, already publicly available, the Supreme Court  has recognized that a person's privacy interests and their personal  information collected in government records does not automatically  dissolve because such information may be available to the public  already in some other format. Individuals have the right to control the  dissemination of their own personal information. This amendment makes  it clear that the bill will infringe on an individual's personal  privacy if he or she is compensated from the Judgment Fund.   Moreover, this amendment does not further the public interest in  government transparency. Publishing an individual person's name on the  internet sheds no significant light on the inner workings of government  and has no value; and so, to the contrary, it will result in  potentially grave harassment or even intimidation.   Revealing this information is an unwarranted intrusion on personal  privacy of individuals harmed by government misconduct, which could  include victims of medical malpractice as well as racial and sexual  discrimination. In effect, it revictimizes the victims of government  misconduct or abuse--a terrible result.   So, therefore, I oppose this amendment which does not do anything to  improve the bill and, in fact, makes it considerably worse.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.  And if you vote for it, recognize that you will have to go home and  tell your constituents that you have agreed to a serious invasion of  their personal privacy and that it will allow individuals who are  victims of government misconduct to have that personal information put  on the internet and shared with millions of people all over the world.   I yield back the balance of my time.
