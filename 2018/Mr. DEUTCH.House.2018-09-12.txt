 Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to rise in support of  the Ileana Ros-Lehtinen U.S.-Israel Security Assistance Authorization  Act of 2018.                                time  1730    I am proud to have worked on this critical security bill with my  colleague and friend, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.   The U.S.-Israel relationship has been and must continue to be a  bipartisan priority regardless of the party in power at either end of  Pennsylvania Avenue. With today's vote, we have the chance to reinforce  that point.   The threats against Israel remain numerous and complex. Iran is  seeking to secure a permanent foothold in neighboring Syria. Hezbollah  continues to stockpile an estimated 150,000 missiles near Israel's  border, and a humanitarian crisis looms in Gaza, threatening stability  in Israel.   Israel must be prepared to defend itself from threats coming from  every direction, from everything from the most rudimentary of weapons-- as we have seen with the ``arson kites'' from Hamas, the ``terror  kites''--to advanced Iranian-made missiles.   The 2016 memorandum of understanding between our countries committed  unprecedented levels of security. That assistance is $38 billion over  [[Page H8149]]  10 years, and this bill will enshrine that figure into law. Notably,  nearly all of this American taxpayer money will come back to the United  States and support American jobs.   This bill will codify this memorandum and ensure that Israel has the  capability to defend itself from any and all threats. That means  strengthening Israel's qualitative military edge, authorizing  cooperation on UAV technology, and expanding cooperation in new areas,  such as space, and through a new effort to work together to provide  humanitarian assistance around the globe.   When we consider legislation like this, we must remember that threats  against Israel are also a threat to our security interests in the  region. Enhancing Israel's security is a step towards strengthening our  own national security, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill  and strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship.   Finally, I would like to thank Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen for her  service to our Nation and particularly for her ardent and unwavering  support for our ally, Israel, throughout her nearly three decades in  Congress. Her long and decorated career in this Chamber, as historic as  it was effective, will live on through her incredible achievements in  our Nation's robust foreign policy.   Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has been the leading voice on a foreign  policy that stands up to rogue regimes wherever they are and always,  always values human rights. Without a doubt, her contributions to  strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship will take their place in  this body's history. There has been no greater champion than Ileana  Ros-Lehtinen.    Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman's contributions to the  strengthening of the U.S.-Israel relationship will take their place in  this body's history because there has been no greater champion than  Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. It has been an honor to work with her on this most  recent effort to broaden and enhance the U.S.-Israel relationship, so  it is only fitting that this piece of legislation should bear her name.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and colleague. This bill is but a  small part of the legacy that she leaves behind in this great Chamber.  It has been an honor and a privilege to work with her. It has been an  honor and a privilege to work with the chairman, Mr. Royce. I am  grateful for their leadership, as I am for Mr. Engel and the great job  he does as ranking member.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Ranking Member Engel. I  rise in support of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti- Semitism Act, and I thank Congressman Chris Smith for leading this bill  and all of my colleagues for their support.   It has been more than a year and a half since this administration  came into office, and this position remains vacant. Aside from some  rumors around Washington, we don't know when this role will be filled.   This position was created in 2004 with bipartisan support. I am sure  my colleagues would agree that Congress doesn't pass laws for them to  be ignored.   It is imperative that there is someone at the State Department  working to combat anti-Semitism globally. They should be working with  Jewish communities, building coalitions, tracking cases, and pushing  governments to do more to combat it. We need someone who will be our  Nation's leading global advocate to combat anti-Semitism.   We are seeing Jewish communities outside the United States and Israel  shrink because they no longer feel safe in their own cities. We are  hearing truly appalling stories, horrific stories like the Holocaust  survivor who was brutally murdered in her apartment. We are feeling the  hate speech rise, whether by politicians on extreme sides of the  political spectrum or individuals empowered and amplified by social  media.   We urgently need someone in our government charged with addressing  this scourge. This is not a time to abdicate our proud and historic  leading role of pushing governments to protect their Jewish community,  because if there is anti-Semitism that is growing in a country, it  means that there is hatred growing in that country, and, ultimately,  everyone is at risk.   Our government cannot be silent in these moments. Filling this  position must be a top priority. I call on my colleagues to support  this bill, which will send a strong statement to the world that the  United States remains committed to combat this bigotry and to defend  Jewish communities and to fight hatred.
