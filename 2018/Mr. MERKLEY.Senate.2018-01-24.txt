 Mr. President, on August 25, a minority group of  Rohingya militants proceeded to attack a number of Burmese police  outposts in northern Rakhine State, and they inflicted injuries and  killed about 12 members of the country's security forces in the  process. These attacks certainly must be condemned, but they have  triggered a response by the Burmese Government and military that is  beyond horrific--attacks by the Burmese Government and military that  have inflicted a massive humanitarian crisis in that nation.   The Burmese military, aided by mobs of local vigilantes, carried out  the violence against the Rohingya people in a systematic way. These are  people who have been in Burma for generations, but they have been  stripped of their citizenship under Burmese law. In the attacks that  followed, Doctors Without Borders estimates that well over 6,000 men,  women, and children were murdered in just the first month of this  ongoing assault, and that included hundreds of children--an estimated  700 children ages 5 and under.   The survivors have shared countless stories of women being raped, men  murdered, children murdered in the most inhumane ways imaginable. Human  Rights Watch has reported that the Burmese military and the associated  vigilantes have burned 354 villages to the ground. The response of the  Rohingya has been to flee the country, desperately fleeing as fast as  they could the systematic violence inflicted upon them--systematic  rape, systematic shooting, the murder of children. The result is that  650,000 people have fled to the adjoining country of Bangladesh, where  they are now establishing refugee camps.   These camps are a big improvement from being attacked, shot,  murdered, and raped inside Burma, but the camps themselves are just a  jumble of split bamboo frames with plastic draped over the tops of  them. You can see here in this photo that the ground has been cleared  away and people have shoveled out relatively flat sections of the  hillside, split bamboo into little pieces, tied them together with  threads, and draped plastic over the top of them.   I wonder what will happen when the monsoons come or a severe  windstorm comes. I don't think these shelters are going to hold up.   The overcrowded conditions and poor sanitation in these camps put  them directly at risk for diseases like diphtheria and cholera, and  these camps--full of displaced, disenfranchised, angry young men--are  also recruiting grounds for violent extremist groups like ISIS. This  is, in the words of the United Nations, the fastest growing refugee  emergency in the world. It is unacceptable, and America needs to pay  attention and respond.   The flow of refugees has continued, even until now. The numbers have  dropped. There aren't that many Rohingya left inside of Burma. The  Governments of Burma and Bangladesh are discussing a repatriation  strategy on how these individuals may be able to return to Burma, and  they have a framework for a plan. Burma says that they will welcome  them and let them go home. They have even said that they can return to  where their villages were burned and have assistance in rebuilding  their homes and community structures.   In the first step, they say that they will house them in reception  camps, and they also say that they may put them into model villages.  These words ``reception camps'' and ``model villages'' are words for  encampments that are based on what is already in much of Rakhine,  central Rakhine State, which are long-term camps that are essentially  prison camps--prison camps for the Rohingya.   If this is not going to unfold in this manner, the world has to be  engaged. Right now, of course, the Rohingya who have fled this horrific  violence are  [[Page S490]]  not anxious to return immediately because they don't believe the  government will protect them. If you had been subjected to a horrific  rampage of slaughter and violence, why would you immediately go back to  that unless the circumstances were dramatically modified? Can they  depend upon the Burmese Government to protect them when they haven't  protected them since August? Can they depend upon the Burmese military  to protect them when the Burmese military perpetrated these crimes?   Repatriation is important. The ability to go back to the villages and  rebuild them is important, and time is of the essence for it to happen  in a way that is really going to work. The international community is  going to have to be involved.   Let's understand that this assault, which went from August even until  now, is not a one-time occurrence. It is the latest in a long line of  atrocious assaults on the Rohingya people. In 1978, Burma's military  launched Operation King Dragon, causing more than 200,000 Rohingya to  flee to Bangladesh. There were similar campaigns of assault in 1992 and  in 2012 and in 2015 and in 2016, none as horrific as what was witnessed  just a few months ago, in August of 2017, but terrible assaults  nonetheless.    Time and again, the Rohingya people have been subjected to abuse,  persecution, and violence, and recognize this isn't just a tactic that  the Burmese Government and Burmese military have used against the  Rohingya. They have used it against other minorities--this systematic  strategy of burning the village, shooting people as they flee, and  raping the mothers and daughters. We have seen this with assaults on  ethnic minorities in the Shan and Kachin States, where people have  faced very similar persecution. In fact, in those States, over 100,000  people have been displaced by the military since 2011. So the United  States and the world must not only stand up and say that this ethnic  cleansing against the Rohingya is wrong, but also say that this  strategy being used by the Burmese military against minorities is  absolutely unacceptable under any code of moral conduct, under any  religious vision, under any civilized understanding of the treatment of  citizens.   Much of what took place over the last few decades was out of sight of  the world because Burma was closed off to the world. But then Burma  went through a diplomatic awakening, the budding of democratic  institutions, and they have been more open to the world, so now we can  see very vividly what is going on. They are not hidden, and there is no  excuse for the world to turn away and not engage.   Neither the Burmese Government nor the military is ready for  international cooperation. They have left the international community  out of the process of trying to address these issues. They have  rejected the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees--no  international monitoring allowed and freedom of the press curtailed.   The Rohingya people are right to be wary of how they will be  repatriated without significant international involvement, without  strongly developed measures for their safety, without a changed  attitude by the government.   That is why, yesterday in the Senate, I introduced a resolution  calling for international pressure and oversight to be brought to bear  on the repatriation process. It calls upon the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees to play a central role in ensuring that any  repatriation of the Rohingya people is safe, voluntary, and dignified.   The concern for the treatment of the Rohingya is bipartisan. I  appreciate the 14 Senators who have already cosponsored my resolution.  Particular thanks go to Senator John McCain and to Senator Todd Young  not only for supporting this resolution but also for being advocates  for the Rohingya people and for global human rights.   I was profoundly shocked when the Burmese military started these  massive assaults back in August. I knew it was important for our  government to pay attention, for the people of the United States to pay  attention, and for Members of this Senate to pay attention and to weigh  in and try to create pressure to end the persecution and create a  different path for the future.   In the month that followed, there was a lot of international outcry  about how wrong this was, and First State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi,  who is Burma's head of state, responded with a speech to the world  through the United Nations. She invited the world ``to go with us into  the troubled areas. . . . See for yourself what is happening and think  for yourself: what can we do to remove these problems?''   I applauded that attitude and that invitation to the world to be  engaged and be involved and see what was happening. Senator Durbin and  I, along with three Members of the House--Congresswoman Betty McCollum  from Minnesota, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky from Illinois, and  Congressman David Cicilline from Rhode Island--came together and  accepted her invitation. We accepted her offer, and we planned a trip  for November to go see the troubled areas in Burma, just as Aung San  Suu Kyi had suggested.   We intended to go to the afflicted areas. We intended to see for  ourselves what was happening. We intended to talk to those left behind  to get as full a story as possible. And we intended, as she indicated,  to think of what we can do to reverse the situation.   The Burmese Government worked with us to plan this trip. It involved  a tremendous amount of logistics on how we could get to northern  Rakhine State. But at the very last moment, just as we were getting  ready to leave Washington, DC, the government reversed course. The  Government of Burma said: We invited you, but now we will block you  from visiting these afflicted areas.   Clearly, the Burmese Government and military had a lot to hide. Their  invitation to the world from the Nobel laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi,  turned out not to be sincere. She did not stand behind her invitation.  She did not ensure that the world could come and see what was going on.   We were not allowed to visit the villages that had been burned. We  were not allowed to visit camps from the previous repatriation of  individuals, called internally displaced persons camps, or IDP camps.   We were allowed to fly into the capital of Rakhine State, Sittwe. In  the capital of Sittwe, there was something there that I didn't expect  at all. In the capital, there is a section of the city that is referred  to as the Muslim quarter, the Muslim neighborhood. It is called Aung  Mingalar. We were told we could go visit the Muslim quarter, Aung  Mingalar, and so we did. This is a street in Aung Mingalar. At the end  of the street, you have a police station, and you have a fence. In  fact, every route out of this neighborhood is blocked by police.    The people who live there are not currently trapped by high walls and  extensive barbed wire, but it is illegal for them to leave this  neighborhood--think of the early stages of the Warsaw ghetto in Poland.  I had no idea this existed, and it is an indication of the situation  the Rohingya live in, not just in this quarter, but there are 120,000  of them in camps that have been set up where they are not allowed to  operate as a normal individual, in a normal economy, in a normal  village. This neighborhood is functionally sealed off from the rest of  the city. They cannot leave and go a short distance away to open their  shops, so they have no means to support themselves. They are trapped in  a neighborhood cage with the barriers, police station, and consequences  if they leave without permission.   If they have a medical emergency, then what they have to do is get  permission to leave to travel to an IDP camp--internally displaced  persons camp--see a doctor at the IDP camp, get a referral to the  hospital, return back to their neighborhood, and then go to the  hospital that is just 5 minutes away. So it is a trip of many hours in  order to go to the healthcare facility that is just minutes away. Can  you imagine what that is like in a health emergency? Why? It is just a  direct affliction on these Muslim residents in this Buddhist nation.   They are dependent to survive on relatives who have found a path to  other countries who can send money back to them so they can purchase  goods, and they are also dependent upon the government. The government  provides teachers for the higher high school-level classrooms, and  those teachers disappeared after the August assaults and haven't  returned. The children of this neighborhood are not allowed to go to  the universities. So this may not  [[Page S491]]  look so horrific unless you know the facts; that it is a zone that is  essentially a prison inside the capital city for the Muslim residents.   In order to learn more, our delegation traveled to Bangladesh to the  refugee camps. We went to a camp called Balukhali, and that visit  brought home the breadth and horror of the human rights crisis that  these men, women, and children have endured. Speak to any member of the  delegation, and they will tell you that articles and reports written  about what has happened are not the same as hearing firsthand and face- to-face the stories of the atrocities the Rohingya refugees have  suffered. At Balukhali, Senator Durbin and I went into a temporary  classroom with tarp over the top where women had gathered to learn  about sanitation and disease prevention, and I asked the interpreter  who was with us: Would you ask these women if they have stories they  would like to share? I wasn't sure these Muslim women, covered in  traditional Muslim clothing, would be willing to share a story with an  outsider, but they immediately responded. One woman jumped up, and she  pulled the cloth off her arm to show the scars from the burns she had  as her village hut came down around her as she tried to escape. Then  other women jumped up to tell other stories--of a child being killed in  front of her, of a husband being slaughtered, of the trials and  tribulations of trying to escape the assault from the military. Every  person in that room had tragic and horrifying stories to share--entire  villages burned to the ground, entire villages fleeing for the border,  being shot at by solders as they tried to cross the border into  Bangladesh. They themselves did not share stories about the rapes, but  they shared those stories with the doctors and others who shared the  stories with us.   As you walk around the camp, you see a lot of young kids, a lot of  children. Some are helping out with their families. Some are orphans.  Some are kicking balls around. I watched one young man run with a  little sheet of plastic that he had put split bamboo on to create a  little tiny kite, and they could get that thing about 10 feet in the  air. He had a smile on his face, and you could almost envision these  were regular children growing up like others around the world.   Then I went and visited with a group of the children who were doing  drawings, and when you saw their drawings, you realized what they had  been through. Here I am talking to a young boy who is showing me his  drawing of a helicopter and a military vehicle coming into the village.  Here is one of the drawings that was held up. You see the helicopter  shooting at the village and the drawing of the machineguns. The village  house is under assault. Here is another child's drawings, and again  there are helicopters. You see the houses built on stilts. Here is a  military man on the ground shooting at them as they are playing. These  children have been through horrific, horrific trauma. Their families  have been fractured, they may not have a mother or father, and somehow  they are going forward in life.    I would like to say that the situation has improved since our trip,  but the situation is still extremely bad. Take a look at this map from  Human Rights Watch. These red dots are villages that have been burned-- all of these, these two lines of villages. At last count, 354 villages  burned, and it wasn't just in August and September but the burning  continued. The Human Rights Watch said in October and November, another  40 villages were burned. In fact, one was burning on November 25 right  after our delegation returned to the United States of America.   Is it any wonder the Burmese Government didn't want us going in to  see any of these sites firsthand? We are not the only ones who were  denied access. All of the U.N. organizations, including a factfinding  mission and an investigator named Yanghee Lee, were stopped from  visiting these afflicted areas. International aid groups like the Red  Cross were denied access.   A mass grave containing the bodies of a group of Muslims was  uncovered in Rakhine State's Inn Din village just north of Sittwe, the  capital where we were. In a rather shocking first, the Burmese military  actually accepted responsibility for the deaths, claiming that soldiers  and villagers reacted to provocation from terrorists and that those who  were involved would be punished. Do you think they are really going to  be punished? I will tell you who gets punished. It is reporters, and  these are the two reporters who reported it. Where are they? They are  in prison--Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, two reporters for Reuters.  Shouldn't the United States and the international community demand that  they be set free and demand those who perpetrated these crimes against  humanity be the ones in prison? These two young men have been charged  with violating the country's Official Secrets Act and are facing 14  years in prison for ``illegally'' acquiring information and sharing it  with foreign media. It sounds to me like these two reporters were doing  exactly what Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate, said: Come and see.   There is a continuing cycle of violence and radicalization. Burma  justifies their actions as a response to attacks by ARSA, but let's  recognize a very small group of attacks occurred, and then the response  was hundreds of thousands of people had their villages burned to the  ground and were driven out of the country.   Well, there is going to be perpetuation of a cycle of violence unless  the mindset of the Government of Burma changes dramatically. Right now,  we need to be engaged in the possibility of repatriation because it is  urgent that these refugees get a chance to return to their villages and  rebuild them, but it will not happen unless we insist on deep  involvement by the United Nations.   Reflecting on the Rwandan genocide 4 years afterward, President  Clinton said:         We owe to those who died and to those who survived who       loved them, our every effort to increase our vigilance and       strengthen our stand against those who would commit such       atrocities in the future here or elsewhere.        Indeed, we owe it to all the peoples of the world who are       at risk because each bloodletting hastens the next as the       value of human life is degraded and violence becomes       tolerated, the unimaginable becomes more conceivable.    For the thousands of Rohingya slaughtered and the hundreds of  thousands more who survived and fled, the unimaginable has become all  too conceivable. Five months after these atrocities began, 5 months  tomorrow, in fact, the world has not heard from our President about  this horrific ethnic cleansing.   I encourage President Trump to weigh in on this, to speak with moral  clarity, to condemn the Burmese Government for executing this horrific  case of ethnic cleansing, to praise and support Bangladesh for opening  its doors, to call on the world to provide Bangladesh with  international resources to help address the plight of the refugees, to  demand the safe and internationally monitored opportunity for the  Rohingya refugees to return to their villages, rebuild their homes, and  rebuild their lives.   We in the Senate must not be silenced. Thank you, again, to my 14  colleagues who have already signed on to this resolution. Our  repatriation resolution calls on Nobel laureate and head of state Aung  San Suu Kyi and Burma's other civilian leaders and military leaders to  recognize that longstanding prejudices haunt Burma and commit to  implementing all the recommendations of Kofi Annan's Advisory  Commission on Rakhine State, which seeks to end the discrimination  against the Rohingya and reduce the tension with other minorities.   The Burmese Government could begin doing so immediately by lifting  restrictions on the IDP camps and the Aung Mingalar, while planning to  shut down the IDP camps entirely and restoring the opportunity for full  participation in society.   We call upon Burma to work with Bangladesh and the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees to ensure the voluntary and safe repatriation  of refugees. Safety must be assured for these refugees. There must be  no forcible repatriation. It must be voluntary, it must be safe, and it  must be monitored by an international organization. We can make sure  they get assistance in returning to rebuild their homes and their  lives.   We must call on Burma and Aung San Suu Kyi to embrace transparency,  to grant humanitarian aid groups access, to release the two journalists  in prison for doing their jobs. Finally, we  [[Page S492]]  must call on the international community to invest in the future of the  Rohingya people. Everyone has a part to play in the economic  development of the Rakhine State--the poorest state in Burma--for the  benefit of all.   In closing, anyone who looks at the events that have occurred since  last August can plainly see the massive scale of human catastrophe. Let  it not continue. The world that cried out ``never again'' so  passionately decades ago, that rallied against the war crimes of  Kosovo, that condemned the Rwandan genocide has an obligation to stand  up once again--this time in Burma--for the universal right of every  human to live in peace, free from fear and free from persecution.   Thank you.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.
