 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on my amendments  to this legislation, which represent key central Virginia priorities as  we rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic.   I thank the chairwoman for her tremendous work, and I look forward to  moving forward with this legislation.   My 340B-related amendment sends a message to big pharmaceutical  companies: stop hiking drug prices on consumers and discriminating  against 340B providers and pharmacies.   My amendment to boost funding for the Emergency Food Assistance  Program reflects the requests I have heard directly from central  Virginia food banks, their staff, and their volunteers, as they fight  hunger.   My bipartisan amendment to increase support for NRCS field staff  would help crop and livestock producers implement conservation  practices that help their bottom lines.   As we look to maintain telehealth services that expanded during the  pandemic, my amendment to strengthen Federal funding for telehealth  resource centers would directly benefit providers like the Karen S.  Rheuban Center for Telehealth at UVA, which serves so many of my  constituents.   Finally, my amendment to strengthen ReConnect funding demonstrates  our continued commitment as a Congress and as a community to closing  [[Page H4069]]  the digital divide and expanding broadband internet access throughout  our communities.    Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 226.
