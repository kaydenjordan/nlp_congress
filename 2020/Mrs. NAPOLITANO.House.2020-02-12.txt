 Mr. Chair, I thank Ms. DeGette for yielding.   I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 2215, the San Gabriel  Mountains Foothills and Rivers Protection Act, which is included in  H.R. 2546, and I associate my remarks with those of Ms. Chu, my  distinguished colleague.   As the representative of the San Gabriel foothills community, I am  very proud of our community members and local organizations that have  worked tirelessly on preserving and expanding the mountains for future  generations.   The San Gabriel Mountains, foothills, and river corridor attract  millions of visitors a year and provide some of the only outdoor  options for the open space-poor Los Angeles County.   H.R. 2215 expands the boundaries of the monument and allows the San  Gabriel Mountains, foothills, and river corridor to be eligible for  Federal funding to help clean, protect, and develop our beloved  mountain recreation areas.   The bill will improve recreation opportunities for millions of  families and bring much-needed resources to the communities that serve  as the gateway to the mountains, while respecting local rights. Water  agencies and communities from the area all agree this is a good thing.   As California has continued to be faced with drought, forest fires,  and the growing impacts of climate change, it is critical that we  support policies such as this that protect our environment.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''                                time  1300
