 Mr. President, desperate to distract from the $93 trillion  price tag of their so-called Green New Deal, the Democratic leadership  here in the Senate has been coming down to the floor to claim that  Republicans are ignoring climate change.   On February 14, the Democratic leader came to the floor and said:  ``Since Republicans took control of this Chamber in 2015, they have not  brought a single Republican bill to meaningfully reduce carbon  emissions to the floor of the Senate. Not one bill.'' That is a quote  from the Democratic leader just a month ago.   That would be news to me, and I think it would be news to some  Democratic Senators here, as well. On January 14 of this year, for  example, the President signed into law the Nuclear Energy Innovation  and Modernization Act. That legislation, led by Republican Senator  Barrasso and cosponsored by both Republicans and Democrats, paves the  way for new advanced nuclear technologies, which will help further  reduce carbon emissions.   Here is what the Democratic ranking member of the Environment and  Public Works Committee had to say about this bill:         Nuclear power serves as our nation's largest source of       reliable, carbon-free energy, which can help combat the       negative impacts of climate change and at the same time,       foster economic opportunities for Americans. . . . This is       another important step in our fight against climate change.    That is from the Democratic ranking member of the Senate Environment  and Public Works Committee. Let me repeat that. ``This is another  important step in our fight against climate change.'' That is coming  from a key Democrat on a key committee that deals with this issue. That  is not a Republican talking; that is the Democratic ranking member of  the Environment and Public Works Committee.   Then, of course, there is the Furthering Carbon Capture, Utilization,  Technology, Underground Storage, and Reduced Emissions Act. Granted,  that is a fairly long title. Several Republicans are original  cosponsors of that. It became law as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act  of 2018. The FUTURE Act, as it is referred to, extends and expands tax  credits for facilities with carbon capture, utilization, and  sequestration technologies, which are referred to as CCUS technologies.   Here is what the Clean Air Task Force had to say about this  legislation:         [T]he U.S. Congress took a landmark step by passing one of       the most important bills for reducing global warming       pollution in the last two decades.    That is a quote from the Clean Air Task Force and what they had to  say about that legislation.   Then there is the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, led by  Republican Senator Mike Crapo, which  [[Page S1812]]  became law in September. This legislation will help support the  development of advanced nuclear reactor designs, which will increase  America's supply of clean and reliable energy.   Here is what the junior Democratic Senator from Rhode Island had to  say about this legislation:         Partnerships between the private sector and our world-class       scientists at national labs will help bring new technologies       forward to compete against polluting forms of energy. . . . I       am proud to have worked with Senator Crapo to get this       bipartisan energy legislation over the finish line.    Here is what the junior Democratic Senator from New Jersey had to  say:         Reducing our carbon emissions as quickly as possible       requires prioritizing the development and commercialization       of advanced nuclear reactors, which will be even safer and       more efficient than current reactors. Passage of this       legislation will provide critical support to startup       companies here in the United States that are investing       billions of dollars in these next generation reactor designs.    Here is what the Democratic whip himself had to say:         I was proud to join Senator Crapo on this bipartisan bill.    I could go on. I could talk about the 2018 farm bill, which, in the  words of Earth Justice, contains ``a number of provisions that  incentivize more climate-friendly practices.'' I serve on that  committee. I was involved in the conservation title and the drafting of  that, including a number of provisions in there. I could talk about the  provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 to ensure the completion  of our first two new nuclear reactors in a generation, which will  prevent 10 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually; or the  extension of wind and solar clean energy tax credits; or the bipartisan  America's Water Infrastructure Act, which will help advance hydropower  projects--a significant source of emission-free energy.   Suffice it to say that Republican Senators have passed more than one  bill to protect our environment and help America achieve a clean energy  future, and we are not stopping here. So why all the misdirection on  the part of the Democrats? I am sure Democrats think it is politically  advantageous to portray themselves as the only party that is invested  in clean energy.   Then, of course, Democrats are desperate to distract from the details  of the $93 trillion Green New Deal that their Presidential candidates  have embraced. That is right--I said $93 trillion. One think tank has  released the first estimate of what the Green New Deal will cost, and  the answer is between $51 trillion and $93 trillion over 10 years. That  is an incomprehensible amount of money.   For comparison, the entire Federal budget for 2019 is less than $5  trillion. The 2017 gross domestic product for the entire world, the  entire planet, came to $80.7 trillion--more than $10 trillion less than  Democrats are proposing to spend on the Green New Deal. Ninety-three  trillion dollars is more than the amount of money the U.S. Government  has spent in its entire history. Since 1789, when the Constitution went  into effect, the Federal Government has spent a total of $83.2  trillion. That is right--it has taken us 230 years to spend the amount  of money Democrats want to spend in 10.   Even attempting to pay for the Green New Deal would devastate working  families, who would be hit with incredibly high new taxes. Let's be  very clear about this. This is not a plan that can be paid for by  taxing the rich. Taxing every family making more than $200,000 a year  at a 100-percent tax rate for 10 years wouldn't get Democrats anywhere  close to $93 trillion. Taxing every family making more than $100,000 a  year at a 100-percent tax rate for 10 years would still leave Democrats  short of $93 trillion.   Of course, the amount of money we are talking about, as horrifying as  it is, is just one negative aspect of the Green New Deal. Democrats'  Green New Deal is a full-blown socialist fantasy that would put the  government in charge of not just energy but healthcare and all the  other various aspects of the American economy.   One of the Green New Deal's authors posted and then deleted a  document from her website noting that the Green New Deal would provide  economic security for those unable or unwilling to work. That is  right--in the Democrats' socialist fantasies, apparently the government  will provide you with economic security if you are unwilling to work.  Let's hope there are enough willing workers to fund those who are  unwilling to work. After all, that $93 trillion has to come from  somewhere.   It is no wonder that Democrats are trying to change the subject when  it comes to the Green New Deal. They don't want to have to defend the  specifics of their plan because their plan is, frankly, indefensible.   If the Democrats would like to have a serious discussion about  energy, they should repudiate the unfathomably expensive Green New Deal  and join Republicans in focusing on ways to secure a clean energy  future without devastating the economy or bankrupting working families.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 765         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Goods and Services       Tax Fairness Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. MULTIPLE AND DISCRIMINATORY TAXES PROHIBITED.         (a) Multiple Taxes.--No State or local jurisdiction shall       impose multiple taxes on the sale or use of a covered       electronic good or service.

Subject to section 6(a), taxes on the sale of a covered       electronic good or service may only be imposed by a State or       local jurisdiction whose territorial limits encompass the       customer tax address.       SEC. 4. CUSTOMER TAX ADDRESS.         (a) Seller Obligation.--        (1) In general.--Subject to subsection (e)(2), a seller       shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining in the       ordinary course of business the customer tax address with       respect to the sale of a covered electronic good or service,       and shall be responsible for collecting and remitting the       correct amount of tax for the State and local jurisdictions       whose territorial limits encompass the customer tax address       if the State or local jurisdiction has the authority to       require such collection and remittance by the seller.        (2) Certain transactions.--When a customer tax address is       not a business location of the seller under clause (i) of       section 7(4)(A)--        (A) if the sale is a separate and discrete transaction,       then a seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a       customer tax address, as such efforts are described in       clauses (iii), (iv), and (v) of section 7(4)(A), before       resorting to using a customer tax address as determined by       clause (vi) of such section 7(4)(A); and        (B) if the sale is not a separate and discrete transaction,       then a seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a       customer tax address, as such efforts are described in       clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of section 7(4)(A), before       resorting to using a customer tax address as determined by       clause (vi) of such section 7(4)(A).        (b) Reliance on Customer-Provided Information.--A seller       that relies in good faith on information provided by a       customer to determine a customer tax address shall not be       held liable for any additional tax based on a different       determination of that customer tax address by a State or       local jurisdiction or court of competent jurisdiction, unless       and until binding notice is given as provided in subsection       (c).        (c) Address Correction.--If a State or local jurisdiction       is authorized under State law to administer a tax, and the       jurisdiction determines that the customer tax address       determined by a seller is not the customer tax address that       would have been determined under section 7(4)(A) if the       seller had the additional information provided by the State       or local jurisdiction, then the jurisdiction may give binding       notice to the seller to correct the customer tax address on a       prospective basis, effective not less than 45 days after the       date of such notice, if--        (1) when the determination is made by a local jurisdiction,       such local jurisdiction obtains the consent of all affected       local jurisdictions within the State before giving such       notice of determination; and        (2) before the State or local jurisdiction gives such       notice of determination, the customer is given an opportunity       to demonstrate in accordance with applicable State or local       tax administrative procedures that the address used is the       customer tax address.        (d) Coordination With Sourcing of Mobile Telecommunications       Service.--        (1) In general.--If--        (A) a covered electronic good or service is sold to a       customer by a home service provider of mobile       telecommunications service that is subject to being sourced       under section 117 of title 4, United States Code, or the       charges for a covered electronic good or service are billed       to the customer by such a home service provider; and        (B) the covered electronic good or service is delivered,       transferred, or provided electronically by means of mobile       telecommunications service that is deemed to be provided by       such home service provider under section 117 of such title,       then the home service provider and, if different, the seller       of the covered electronic good or service, may presume that       the customer's place of primary use for such mobile       telecommunications service is the customer tax address       described in section 7(4)(A)(ii) with respect to the sale of       such covered electronic good or service.        (2) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection, the       terms ``home service provider'', ``mobile telecommunications       service'', and ``place of primary use'' have the same       meanings as in section 124 of title 4, United States Code.        (e) Multiple Locations.--        (1) In general.--If a digital service, audio or video       programming service, or VoIP service is sold to a customer       and available for use by the customer in multiple locations       simultaneously, the seller may determine the customer tax       addresses using a reasonable and consistent method based on       the addresses of use as provided by the customer and       determined in agreement with the customer at the time of sale       or at a later time.        (2) Direct customer payment.--        (A) Establishment of direct payment procedures.--Each State       and local jurisdiction shall provide reasonable procedures       that permit the direct payment by a qualified customer, as       determined under procedures established by the State or local       jurisdiction, of taxes that are on the sale of covered       electronic goods or services to multiple locations of the       customer and that would, absent such procedures, be required       or permitted by law to be collected from the customer by the       seller.        (B) Effect of customer compliance with direct payment       procedures.--When a qualified customer elects to pay tax       directly under the procedures established under subparagraph       (A), the seller shall--        (i) have no obligation to obtain the multiple customer tax       addresses under subsection (a); and        (ii) not be liable for such tax, provided the seller       follows the State and local procedures and maintains       appropriate documentation in its books and records.       SEC. 5. TREATMENT OF BUNDLED TRANSACTIONS, DIGITAL CODES, AND                     OTHER RULES.         (a) Bundled Transaction.--If a charge for a distinct and       identifiable covered electronic good or service is aggregated       with and not separately stated from one or more charges for       other distinct and identifiable goods or services, which may       include other covered electronic goods or services, and any       part of the aggregation is subject to taxation, then the       entire aggregation may be subject to taxation, except to the       extent that the seller can identify, by reasonable and       verifiable standards, one or more charges for the nontaxable       goods or services from its books and records kept in the       ordinary course of business.        (b) Digital Code.--The tax treatment of the sale of a       digital code shall be the same as the tax treatment of the       sale of the covered electronic good or service to which the       digital code relates.        (c) Application of Fixed Charges to VoIP Service.--With       respect to VoIP service, if any tax is based on a fixed       charge, such fixed charge shall be based on the number of       simultaneous outbound calls the customer has purchased the       right to place, regardless of actual usage or the number of       the customer's phone numbers.        (d) Rule of Construction.--The sale of a digital code shall       be considered the sale transaction for purposes of this Act.       SEC. 6. NO INFERENCE.         (a) Customer Liability.--Subject to the prohibition       provided in section 2, nothing in this Act modifies, impairs,       supersedes, or authorizes the modification, impairment, or       supersession of any law allowing a State or local       jurisdiction to impose tax on and collect tax directly from a       customer based upon use of a covered electronic good or       service in such State.

SEC. 4. CUSTOMER TAX ADDRESS.         (a) Seller Obligation.--        (1) In general.--Subject to subsection (e)(2), a seller       shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining in the       ordinary course of business the customer tax address with       respect to the sale of a covered electronic good or service,       and shall be responsible for collecting and remitting the       correct amount of tax for the State and local jurisdictions       whose territorial limits encompass the customer tax address       if the State or local jurisdiction has the authority to       require such collection and remittance by the seller.        (2) Certain transactions.--When a customer tax address is       not a business location of the seller under clause (i) of       section 7(4)(A)--        (A) if the sale is a separate and discrete transaction,       then a seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a       customer tax address, as such efforts are described in       clauses (iii), (iv), and (v) of section 7(4)(A), before       resorting to using a customer tax address as determined by       clause (vi) of such section 7(4)(A); and        (B) if the sale is not a separate and discrete transaction,       then a seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a       customer tax address, as such efforts are described in       clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of section 7(4)(A), before       resorting to using a customer tax address as determined by       clause (vi) of such section 7(4)(A).

(c) Address Correction.--If a State or local jurisdiction       is authorized under State law to administer a tax, and the       jurisdiction determines that the customer tax address       determined by a seller is not the customer tax address that       would have been determined under section 7(4)(A) if the       seller had the additional information provided by the State       or local jurisdiction, then the jurisdiction may give binding       notice to the seller to correct the customer tax address on a       prospective basis, effective not less than 45 days after the       date of such notice, if--        (1) when the determination is made by a local jurisdiction,       such local jurisdiction obtains the consent of all affected       local jurisdictions within the State before giving such       notice of determination; and        (2) before the State or local jurisdiction gives such       notice of determination, the customer is given an opportunity       to demonstrate in accordance with applicable State or local       tax administrative procedures that the address used is the       customer tax address.

(2) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection, the       terms ``home service provider'', ``mobile telecommunications       service'', and ``place of primary use'' have the same       meanings as in section 124 of title 4, United States Code.

(2) Direct customer payment.--        (A) Establishment of direct payment procedures.--Each State       and local jurisdiction shall provide reasonable procedures       that permit the direct payment by a qualified customer, as       determined under procedures established by the State or local       jurisdiction, of taxes that are on the sale of covered       electronic goods or services to multiple locations of the       customer and that would, absent such procedures, be required       or permitted by law to be collected from the customer by the       seller.        (B) Effect of customer compliance with direct payment       procedures.--When a qualified customer elects to pay tax       directly under the procedures established under subparagraph       (A), the seller shall--        (i) have no obligation to obtain the multiple customer tax       addresses under subsection (a); and        (ii) not be liable for such tax, provided the seller       follows the State and local procedures and maintains       appropriate documentation in its books and records.

(b) Digital Code.--The tax treatment of the sale of a       digital code shall be the same as the tax treatment of the       sale of the covered electronic good or service to which the       digital code relates.        (c) Application of Fixed Charges to VoIP Service.--With       respect to VoIP service, if any tax is based on a fixed       charge, such fixed charge shall be based on the number of       simultaneous outbound calls the customer has purchased the       right to place, regardless of actual usage or the number of       the customer's phone numbers.        (d) Rule of Construction.--The sale of a digital code shall       be considered the sale transaction for purposes of this Act.       SEC. 6. NO INFERENCE.
