 Madam Speaker, the inflation crisis that is being  caused by President Biden's destructive policies has hurt small  businesses throughout the United States.   According to a recent survey, 37 percent of small business owners  were unable to pay their rent just last month alone.  [[Page H8501]]    These businesses are struggling because of Joe Biden's decision to  put socialist priorities ahead of working Americans. Instead of  supporting businesses and improving supply chains, he paid workers to  stay home. Instead of returning to American energy dominance, he turned  to Green New Deal policies. Instead of fighting inflation, Joe Biden  proudly wasted trillions of dollars and sent prices skyrocketing.   More than 60 million Americans are employed by small businesses, and  they are being crushed by these radical policies. It is time to return  to fiscal constraint; it is time to stop the reckless spending; and it  is time to once again support our great American small businesses.                            ____________________
