 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the need  for better oversight of cable and internet providers.   Between price increases, slow internet speeds, and baffling fees,  customers in all regions of the country, and in my district in New York  State, are overcharged by their cable company and don't always get what  they have paid for.   For customers on fixed incomes, a sudden jump in the cable bill can  put a painful squeeze on other parts of the family budget. Customers in  rural areas often find their broadband speeds are not nearly as fast as  advertised, if they are lucky enough to have broadband at all. That is  why I am introducing the Transparency for Cable Consumers Act.   Under this bill, if a cable or internet company is fined by the State  public service commission, the company would be required to report to  the FCC what they are charging customers and what they are delivering  in return.   By bringing more transparency into the market, we can help increase  competition and improve services for consumers across the country.                            ____________________
