 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor an outstanding member of  New Jersey.   John Lynch has made it his life's work to give to the youth of South  Jersey, including creating learning experiences in schools and helping  children with life-threatening illnesses.   He established the Lunch With Lynch Foundation to help facilitate  educational opportunities and learning experiences for the children of  Wildwoods, New Jersey. As well, he established a ThumbsUp4Kindness  organization to change the world one random act of kindness at a time.   For his outstanding community service, Lynch received the  Presidential Community Service Lifetime Achievement Award after 30  years and 4,000 hours of serving his community.   Thank you, Mr. Lynch. Thank you for what you do for our community.  South Jersey is honored to have you.   Let's all take a page out of John's book and try to be a little  kinder to each other in this House, in this country, and in this world.                            ____________________
