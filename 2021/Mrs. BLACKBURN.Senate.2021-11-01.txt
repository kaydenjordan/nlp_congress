 Mr. President, I am beginning to feel a little bit  like a broken record when I am here on the floor and talking about all  the ways that Tennesseans feel like this administration has backed them  into a corner.   It doesn't matter if I am going to fill up the car with that rising  price in gas, or if I am at the grocery store and could not believe  this weekend there is so little on the shelves and they are so short- staffed.   People are very anxious about this. I had a lady that just about was  not going to let me go there in the dairy section of the grocery store  because she was really upset with what this administration is doing.  Whether it is inflation or the vaccine mandate, she is really upset  with what she would like to call the ``White House P.R. operation.''  And she knows that inflation and supply chain problems are here. It is  not temporary. It wasn't transient. It is something that they are  dealing with every day, and Tennesseans are seeing this at every stop  along their busy days.   They have watched this administration abandon the southern border.  You know, they don't use that term lightly, but I think it is  instructive to focus in on that. This administration has abandoned the  southern border.   These actions are intentional actions--intentional. Whether you talk  to Border Patrol or the local sheriff, they look at what Democrats in  Washington are doing, and they see this as being intentional.   They also look at how this administration chose to abandon a  productive energy policy. In January, we were an exporter--an  exporter--of energy. And, today, we have a President--a very weak  President--who is groveling to OPEC, begging them--begging them--to  sell us more fuel. What a difference. What a difference.    And this administration--when I was up in Clarksville where Fort  Campbell is located, I was out on post, and I was visiting with  Tennesseans there in Clarksville. They feel as if this administration  has abandoned our troops, abandoned civilians and allies in Afghanistan  as we handed over 20 years' worth of hard-fought territory to the  [[Page S7532]]  new ``axis of evil,'' which is Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea-- abandoned, left, forgotten about. Over the past few weeks, they have  learned that even their recreational social media use might be putting  their families at risk.   Meanwhile, things here on Capitol Hill are such a mess that, from  their perspective, it is neither reasonable nor rational to believe  that the Democratic majority is willing to put country before party and  politics and fix this mess that this administration has made this year.  In fact, the Democrats are so focused on their own Big Government  narrative that they have managed to outdo themselves with the mandate  from on high that goes further than ever before to control deeply  personal healthcare decisions.   Of course, the Democrats are no stranger to this. They championed the  Affordable Care Act and all its bureaucracy, but this time, they have  truly put the full force of the executive branch of the U.S. Government  between a patient and a doctor. That is right. The decision is not one  you will make with your doctor; it is one that the Federal Government  is making and forcing--forcing--on you. This COVID-19 vaccine mandate  has people really upset. They see this as a power play.   Today, I talked to a lady who works for a government contractor. All  of the family's insurance and benefits come through her. Her husband is  a small business person, and she has a child with disabilities. She  begged me to keep fighting against this mandate.   She said: You know, I am in the position that I had to get this--even  though a family member of hers had a terrible adverse reaction, and she  was concerned being the primary breadwinner for her family and the one  that provides their healthcare insurance benefits. And she had a  reaction, a bad reaction.   But she feels like what we are seeing is another opportunistic power  play that betrays the very people who risked their safety to prevent  the economy from collapsing during the pandemic--that is right, the  essential workers, people who showed up and did their job.   The lady I talked to today was an essential worker. She did her job  all through the pandemic. The States deemed these individuals essential  workers because they showed up. They spent their days transporting food  and clothing across the country, stocking shelves in grocery stores,  and keeping armed rioters at bay.   They never stopped working. They never missed a beat. They put  themselves in danger and adapted to circumstances made worse by forced  lockdowns. These are the people who couldn't have worked from home if  they wanted to. They are the cop on the beat. They are the truck driver  who is in the cab of that truck. They are the healthcare worker  standing at a bedside. They are an airline worker who is making certain  that people are safe and planes are safe to fly.   And, now, they are the ones that Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and this  administration have chosen to threaten with an executive ultimatum: Get  the shot, or we are going to get you fired.   That is right. Imagine that. The President of the United States says:  You go get the jab, or I am going to get you fired from your job--what  an ultimatum, what a way to run a country.   But that is what he is doing. The White House crossed so many lines  with this one: practical lines, ethical lines, constitutional lines. So  last week, I introduced the Keeping Our COVID-19 Heroes Employed Act to  push this administration back on the rails and protect these essential  workers from having to choose between submitting to the mandate or  losing the right to provide for their families.   It is a simple solution to a very big problem. It would lock in the  definitions of essential worker used by the States during the pandemic  and then protect those workers from being fired under COVID vaccine  requirements. It would nullify the Executive orders mandating vaccines  for essential Federal workers and contractors and preempt OSHA from  issuing regulations that would require employees to vaccinate if those  employees qualify as an essential worker.   We are getting a tremendous amount of support for this legislation.  On the national level, we have heard from the Fraternal Order of  Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, the Chicago Fraternal Order  of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the  National Border Patrol Council, and from the Tennessee Chamber of  Commerce, Tennessee Ambulance Service Association, Owner-Operator  Independent Drivers Association, the National Association of Small  Trucking Companies, and then from several individual officials-- Democrat and Republican alike--and from different organizations.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this list be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Keeping Our COVID-19 Heroes Employed Act List of Endorsements                           national law enforcement         --Fraternal Order of Police        --National Sheriffs' Association        --Chicago Fraternal Order of Police        --Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association        --National Border Patrol Council                              industry advocacy         --Tennessee Chamber of Commerce        --Tennessee Ambulance Service Association        --Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA)        --National Association of Small Trucking Companies                             tennessee officials         --Congressman Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.)        --Glenn Jacobs, Mayor of Knox County Tennessee        --Justin Hanson, Mayor of Covington, Tennessee        --Sheriff Russell Barker, Anderson County Tennessee        --Sheriff Tim Fuller, Franklin County Tennessee        --Sheriff Tom Spangler, Knox County Tennessee                            activist organizations         --Texas Public Policy Foundation        --Heritage Foundation        --FreedomWorks        --American Principles Project    Mr. President, see, these are individuals on the  front line, and they take exception to what is going on with this  administration and this Executive order that is forcing them to get a  shot that maybe their doctor is saying: Hey, this is not one for you to  take.   Maybe they are a young woman trying to have a baby. Maybe they are  somebody who has a history of heart disease or lung disease or  neuromuscular issues in their family and someone has had an adverse  reaction.   You know what? People are smart. They are going to figure this out  and figure out what works best for them. During the pandemic, the  essential workers figured this out, and they ought to be exempt.   The Biden administration claims that this mandate is the ticket to  freedom, return to normal. But here is the problem with this and why  that falls on deaf ears. These essential workers returned to normal  months ago--if they ever left a normal routine--and their working  conditions have been made more difficult now than ever.   Businesses are desperate for workers. In August, the U.S. economy had  10.4 million jobs waiting to be filled. That is right, 10.4 million  jobs. We are going to get unemployment numbers this weekend on Friday.  I think it is going to be interesting to see what those numbers tell  us.   Oh, the supply chain--I mentioned the grocery store and what I found  there. Well, the supply chains are a mess. We need 80,000 truck drivers  right now--today--if we want to make an honest attempt at filling the  need there to get products to stores. We can't afford the toll these  mandates are taking on the supply chain workforce or on law enforcement  or border security or the healthcare sector or the airline industry,  the transportation and logistics industry.   And make no mistake, the day of reckoning is already here. As I said,  these workers have figured this out. They are smart. They don't hate  the country. And it is ridiculous that some people try to equate those  that don't get the vaccine with hating the country. These individuals  are not anti-vaxxers. They are not anti-science. What they are is this:  They are anti-unconstitutional mandate and a government overreach that  is going to interfere in their relationship with their doctor. That is  what they are against.   Mr. President, don't we all remember the lie of the decade in 2010  with  [[Page S7533]]  ObamaCare: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.   And what we are looking at right now is something that is an equal  overreach: You can't keep your job if you won't get this jab. It is an  overreach.   People that I am talking to are really anti these mandates that would  force them into submission or, in some cases, into poverty, like the  young mom that I talked to who works for a government contractor--sole  supporter of her family at this point, has one child, wants to have  another child, and because of this mandate, she is going to lose her  job, a job she loves--and her employer loves her. But she is wanting to  make certain she can have that second child.   These workers are very pro-freedom, and they are taking a stand on  principle. They are pro-freedom. They are pro-individual rights, and  what they want is for this administration to stop it, to stop their  push to this socialist agenda, stop trying to force them into taking a  vaccine, which is another step to having government control of their  healthcare.   You know, they look at what the Democrats in Washington, DC, are  doing, and they see that they are trying to take one vote. They want to  win. They want to win on putting everything together--one vote--and  then flipping the country to their socialist agenda--one vote:  government control of your kids, of your healthcare, of your bank  account, of your life, cradle to grave, daylight to dark, sunup to  sundown, 24/7, 365.   You know, I have to tell you, we thought that when the Obama campaign  came out with their little caricatures and cartoon-type character--only  it was really frightening--``The Life of Julia,'' we thought, this is  ridiculous how Julia never needed anybody or anything but the Federal  Government.   Well, some of that same crowd in the White House has now come up with  ``The Life of Linda,'' and Linda must be related to Julia because Linda  has the same type life experiences as Julia. There is no mention of a  family or a husband, but Linda has a child. Linda works for the  government. The government is in control.   See, that is what the Democratic Party wants--socialism. They are  very happy with that--cradle to grave; daylight to dark; total control;  tell you what to do; tell you what your job is going to be; tell you  what you are going to study in school; take control of your children;  send them to study whatever they want; and then have them work in a way  that the government tells them they are going to work.   But what we are seeing play out in this country is the American  people standing up and saying: Enough is enough. We don't want your  mandate. We are tired of all of your chaotic cycle of gaslighting and  government overreach. We are pushing back on your push to a socialist  agenda.   I am heartened that they are not afraid to say ``no, no, no'' to what  the Democrats are trying to push, and they are going to continue to  push back because they see what is happening for what it is--a  destructive, radical agenda that will destroy freedom of choice, free  people, free markets, and opportunity for their children and future  generations.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
