 Mr. Speaker, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the  CFPB, was designed by liberals to harass American businesses and has  been compromising American consumers' access to financial services.   The CFPB is unconstitutional, duplicative, and full of bad ideas. For  example, it is currently pursuing a rule that would effectively ban  banks from offering overdraft protection, a benefit utilized by  millions of Americans.   The CFPB is part of a Federal bureaucracy that Republicans have  promised and pledged to do away with.   Today, I am introducing the Mandating the Abolition of a Threat to  Consumer Happiness, the MATCH Act, which will impose a permanent hiring  freeze at the CFPB, prohibit it from establishing any new positions and  transferring employees, and halt any new appointments.   The CFPB is nothing more than Joe Biden's DEI enforcement bureau. It  is an agency that needs to be burned to the ground, and I am providing  the match.                            ____________________
