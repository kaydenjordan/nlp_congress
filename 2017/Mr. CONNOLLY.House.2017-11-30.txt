 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4182, the Ensuring a  Qualified Civil Service Act. This bill potentially weakens the Federal  civil service by increasing the probationary period for career civil  servants and those in the Senior Executive Service from 1 year to 2  years.   I might add, almost no private sector company I know of would have a  2-year probationary period because they know it would make it hard to  recruit talented employees.   Unlike what has just been said in terms of protections that remain in  place, during the probationary period, Federal employees have very  little due process or appeal rights if disciplinary action is taken  against them, and the action we would take today would be to extend  those diluted rights instead of providing them with robust rights of  every civil servant beyond the probationary period. They can be fired  without notice. They have limited rights to an attorney or  representative, and they generally may not appeal their removal.   Due process protections are critical to ensuring the integrity of the  Federal civil service. In fact, that is the very heart of having a  professional civil service.   These protections help prevent the politicalization of the workforce  and protect whistleblowers from retaliation, which our committee, the  Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has passionately documented  as a very real danger in the past.   The Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act is a solution in search of  a problem. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee has not held  one single hearing to determine whether extending the probationary  period an additional year for every single Federal job in the  competitive and Senior Executive Service is something that agencies  need or want to help them better manage their workforce. Not a single  hearing, and this would have a profound impact on every Federal agency.                                time  1530    In February of 2016, the Government Accountability Office issued a  report which my friend from Kentucky cited at the request of the  chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs. The request asked GAO to examine the rules and trends relating  to the review and dismissal of employees for poor performance. Now  supporters of this bill are using this report as a basis for extending  the probationary periods of Federal civil service employees; however,  nothing in this report calls for doing that. In fact, the title of the  report is ``Improved Supervision and Better Use of Probationary Periods  Are Needed to Address Substandard Employee Performance.'' The focus  ought to be, the GAO says, on improving the supervision of the  probationary period we have in place.   In conducting its study, GAO found that supervisors do not always  have the skills necessary to do that and help address employee  performance issues during the probationary period. GAO also found that  supervisors sometimes do not even use the probationary period to make  performance-related decisions about an employee's ability to do their  job and may not always know when the probationary period even ends.   The report's recommendations were mainly focused on ensuring  qualified supervisors have the training and skills they need to deal  with poor performers  [[Page H9550]]  and making better use of the existing probation period for all new  employees.   Instead of focusing on addressing the gaps identified by GAO and  encouraging agencies to implement the recommendations made in that  report, Congress is now attacking Federal employees and the merit-based  system.   I am especially concerned about the bill's impact on recruiting the  workforce of the future. Currently, 40 percent of the current Federal  workforce is either eligible for retirement or soon will be--40  percent. Federal agencies need to be able to recruit their replacements  and get the requisite skill sets we need for these challenging jobs,  just like the private sector is challenged with that.   Extending the probationary period to 2 years, governmentwide, creates  a climate of more uncertainty, less protection, and diminishes,  clearly, the attraction of Federal service for many people, especially  those whom we want to be attracted to the civil service, especially  millennials.   Some of my colleagues have referenced the 2-year probationary period  for Department of Defense civilian employees enacted in the NDAA, the  National Defense Authorization Act of last fiscal year. They argue that  it should serve as precedent for the rest of the Federal Government.   There are a few things I need to point out about that. First, the  Department of Defense did not request an extension of the probationary  period or even indicate a need for it. Second, now that the 2-year  probationary period for civilian defense employees has been enacted,  the Department isn't even making use of this new authority.   According to the former Acting Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness, Peter Levine, who testified before the Senate  Armed Services Committee in March of this year on civilian personnel  reform, ``the Department has done little to take advantage of that  legislation.''   Mr. Levine also warned that changing the law to address a small  number of problem employees could hurt recruitment and retention and  worker productivity. He stated: ``If legislation that is intended to  address a problem with 1 percent of the workforce is perceived as  threatening and hostile by the other 99 percent, it may undermine  morale and reduce the Department's ability to attract and retain the  capable employees that it needs. The civilian workforce will not become  more productive if problems with a small number of poor performers is  addressed with measures that are perceived as a declaration of war on  all employees.''   In closing, 2 weeks ago, Congress passed legislation that would pave  the way toward evidence-based policymaking, and we all supported that.  For the sake of consistency, if nothing else, ought we not see the  evidence of whether lengthening the probationary period is materially  different and what impacts, both positive and negative, it would have  for Federal agencies and employees?   Absent such evidence and careful study, I certainly am not willing to  take the risk that this bill will not do more harm to both agencies'  ability to recruit and retain qualified employees and that it would not  be used to arbitrarily punish hardworking Federal employees.   However, if the GAO studies the impact of this policy at DOD and  finds that this new policy has been wonderful for morale and has indeed  improved employee performance and helps employee recruitment, then sign  me up. But I do think we ought to rely on data and hearings before the  requisite committee when making such a major change to how we manage  our Federal workforce.   I plan on offering an amendment, Mr. Chairman, that would arm us with  the information we need to make an evidence-based decision regarding an  extension of the probationary period of the Federal workforce, which is  what we ought to be doing before consideration of this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record statements in opposition or  expressing deep concern about this legislation from the American  Federation of Government Employees; the International Federation of  Professional & Technical Engineers; the National Treasury Employees  Union; and a group of organizations, including the Government  Accountability Project, the Liberty Coalition, the Project on  Government Oversight, Public Citizen, and Taxpayers Protection  Alliance.                                              American Federation of                                   Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                  Washington, DC, November 28, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Federation       of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE), which represents       approximately 700,000 federal and District of Columbia       employees, in more than 70 agencies across the nation, I       strongly urge you to oppose H.R. 4182, the ``Ensuring a       Qualified Civil Service Act of 2017,'' introduced by       Representative James Comer (R-KY) when it comes to the floor       this week. If enacted, this legislation would arbitrarily       extend the probation period for a minimum of two years for       newly hired federal employees. AFGE opposes this legislation       as it does not address any issues surrounding employee       performance evaluation or management's ability to properly       evaluate employees during the probation period. Instead, all       it will do is penalize federal workers and weaken their due       process rights.        The extension of probation periods for competitive service       federal employees from one year to two years is unnecessary       and damaging to due process and the merit system. Candidates       for federal jobs are put through an extensive selection       process prior to being hired and one year is sufficient time       for a competent manager to determine if a new employee has       the ability to accomplish the duties for which he or she was       hired.        Specifically, H.R. 4182 would extend the probation period       to a minimum of two years after completion of a ``formal       training'' program or after the date on which a required       license is granted. Such a change could leave employees in       probation limbo for many years. For example, government       agencies require initial training for prolonged periods of       time that could result in employees serving three to five       year probation periods, or longer. Employees should not be       subject to an almost perpetual state of probation because of       comprehensive agency training, certification or licensing       programs.        Additionally, extending the probation period reduces the       due process rights of employees. While on probation,       employees have few civil service protections and almost no       appeal rights in the event of an adverse action. Civil       service protections and the merit system exist to protect the       government from politicization. Without these rights,       employees on probation will have little to no protection       against discrimination and employer retaliation and more       exposure to termination not based on cause, but rather       arbitrary and unjust reasons.        Extending the probation period does not solve any problems       regarding poor performance. Supervisors should be responsible       and held accountable for identifying and addressing issues of       poor performance of new employees quickly and efficiently.       Supervisors need better training to manage new employees.       Extending the probation period does nothing to better train       supervisors nor does it provide any accountability for       supervisors to effectively manage new employees.        Please Vote NO on H.R. 4182, ``Ensuring a Qualified Civil       Service Act of 2017.''            Sincerely,                                                    Thomas S. Kahn,      Director, Legislative Affairs.                                   ____           International Federation of Professional & Technical             Engineers, AFL-CIO & CLC,                                 Washington, DC, November 27, 2017.        Dear Representative: As behalf of the International       Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE),       representing upwards of 90,000 workers, including tens of       thousands of federal employees, I am writing regarding H.R.       4182, the so-called Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act of       2017. This bill has been scheduled for full house       consideration this week and IFPTE urges you to oppose it.        H.R. 4182 aims to extend the probationary period for       federal civilian workers from one year to a minimum of two       years. Under this bill, the probation period would not       necessarily begin at the time a federal worker arrives for       their first day of work. Rather, the period would, ``end on       the date that is 2 years after the date on which such formal       training is completed.'' This is also true for federal jobs       that require a license, in which the probationary clock would       not start ticking until the license is achieved. In other       words, probations for many federal workers under this       legislation will be longer than two years, and dramatically       more than the current 1 year period.        IFPTE is opposed to this bill for several reasons. First,       this legislation is punitive in nature and serves no logical       policy objective. For example, it does nothing to address       performance issues, as supporters of this bill will       erroneously argue, and is silent on addressing the ongoing       challenges that management faces in properly evaluating new       employees, regardless of whether the probationary period is       for one year, or two years. For example, this past March       former Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and       Readiness, Peter Levine, testified in the Senate regarding       the DOD's use of their new two-year probationary period for       federal workers. Mr. Levine testified that even though       managers at the DOD were granted two years to determine if a       newly hired DOD civilian employee should stay or go, that       authority is rarely, if ever used.        Unfortunately, this is yet another in a long list of bills       from this Congress that attempts  [[Page H9551]]       to legislate good management, while creating more useless and       unnecessary requirements that end up costing taxpayers more       money. It is illogical to think that a manager who will not       act on a problem employee within one year of being hired       would act within two years. Mr. Levine's testimony confirms       as much. Federal managers already have the authority to       discipline and ultimately fire employees, BUT they actually       need to use the many authorities they already have to do so.        IFPTE believes that one year is more than enough time for       managers to determine whether a newly hired employee can       perform their job. Instead of creating more bureaucracy, as       this bill will do, Congress should simply require managers to       use the flexibilities they currently have, including the one       year probationary period, to retain or release federal       workers who have yet to fulfill their probationary periods.       Please vote against H.R. 4182.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                               Gregory J. Junemann,      President.                                   ____                                               The National Treasury                                                 Employees Union,                                                  November 28, 2017.        Dear Representative: As National President of the National       Treasury Employees Union, representing over 150,000 federal       employees in 31 different agencies, I am writing to express       NTEU's opposition to H.R. 4182, the Ensuring a Qualified       Civil Service Act of 2017 or the EQUALS Act of 2017, which       would drastically extend the probationary period for       individuals hired into the competitive service from one year       to two years, reflecting changes in policy based on a handful       of individual instances of concern that would--and can be--      much better handled by improved management than by changing       the law. With respect to any position that requires formal       training, the two-year time period would begin after the       required formal training. Given how limited an employee's due       process rights and a labor organization's representational       abilities are during the probationary period, NTEU believes       that the current one year is the proper time period for       agency management to assess and determine whether the       individual is suitable for the position and capable of       performing its duties. It is also important to recognize that       the end of a probationary period does not mean that an       employee cannot be disciplined or removed. It merely allows       the employee to challenge such actions that are done without       merit. Well trained managers can and do impose disciplinary       and adverse actions that stand up to such challenges. In       fact, in 2015, the Government Accountability Office found       that the probationary period of one year was not working, for       the most part, because those in supervisory positions are       only there for a higher grade, that no one had trained the       supervisor in how to supervise people, or that agencies are       not properly using the probationary periods for supervisors       who are not up to the task. Therefore, we question why this       bill is necessary when, instead, increased and improved       supervisor training is what is needed. NTEU has long       supported and advocated Congress enacting federal supervisor       training.        NTEU strongly opposes subjecting frontline federal       employees--who are not tasked with managing agencies and       long-term strategic responsibilities--to longer durations of       assessment that preclude due process and collective       bargaining rights. By extending the probationary period, the       federal workforce essentially becomes an at will workforce,       with limited rights and protections. In fact, the lack of       these due process rights has a chilling effect on employee       use of the few protections they do have, namely protection       against discrimination, sexual harassment, and whistleblower       retaliation. Congress has long recognized and valued the       importance of these protections for federal employees, which       would be undermined by this bill.        We also have significant outstanding questions about what       constitutes ``formal training'' under the bill as training       programs differ greatly by agency. NTEU represents a variety       of employees who undergo long periods of significant training       that occurs at multiple points in time (non-consecutive in       nature) and where the employee is already executing the       actual job in between training sessions.        We are greatly concerned that the language in this bill       could translate into 3 or 4 year--or even indefinite--      probationary periods for some of the employees we represent,       even though that may not be the intent. At this time, it is       unclear how agencies would categorize various types of       training that some of our members undergo under this new       definition. It is also important to note that for positions       that require extensive training, these individuals are       subject to ongoing evaluations by management during any       period of training.        For all of these reasons, we strongly oppose H.R. 4182 and       urge you to vote against it.            Sincerely,                                                Anthony M. Reardon,      National President.                                   ____       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker,      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: We are       writing to express our concerns that H.R. 4182, the EQUALS       Act of 2017, could undermine protection for government       employees who blow the whistle. The legislation extends the       probationary period for civil service employees from one to       two years.        We recognize that the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA)       covers probationary employees, and that there are provisions       in H.R. 4182 that directly address those rights. But       probationary employees already are at a handicap, because an       agency has almost unlimited discretion to defeat a       retaliation lawsuit through independent justification reasons       entirely within its discretion. Second, probationary       employees only have rights against partisan discrimination       and under Sec. 2302(b)(8). This means an extra year that they       will not be protected under the recently-enacted Follow the       Rules Act or under 5 USC 2302(b)(9)(D) when they refuse to       violate the law. The taxpayers could suffer the consequences.        We request that the House of Representatives consider these       concerns before there is action on this legislation. The bill       states its goal is to strengthen government accountability.       Reducing whistleblower protection will undermine it.            Respectfully submitted,      Tom Devine,        Government Accountability Project.      Michael D. Ostrolenk,        Liberty Coalition.      Elizabeth Hempowicz,        Project on Government Oversight.      Shanna Devine,        Public Citizen.      David Williams,        Taxpayers Protection Alliance.     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), who is my dear friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. DeSaulnier), who is a perspicacious member of the  Oversight and Government Reform Committee, someone who grasps these  issues fundamentally, and is my good friend.    Mr. Chairman, could I inquire of the Chair the schedule  on the amendments.    I thank the Chair for that clarification.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin), who is a professor and a very able member of the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform.                                time  1545     Will the gentleman yield?    Did my colleague just say there was not a single  hearing on a bill that affects the entire Federal Government?    Will the gentleman yield?    Did we act on evidence-based policymaking? Were there  studies and data that showed how successful extending the probationary  would be for all of these Federal agencies?    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers at this time,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, as indicated, I appreciate the intent of  my friend from Montana, but this is a bad bill. We ought to be studying  the effect of the existing pilot program at the Department of Defense  to see how it works, and we ought to be adopting the GAO recommendation  of better training for supervisors whom the GAO found, frankly, were  ill-equipped to evaluate employees during a 1- or 2-year probationary  period.   We ought to have a hearing, and my friend from Montana might even  agree with this, since he is the newest Member, one of the newest  Members of our committee. Our committee is the locus for government- wide initiatives such as this.   We have not had a single hearing on this bill, or, frankly, on this  subject, and I think that is a huge mistake. We are putting the cart  before the horse; so I think we ought to return to a more empirical- based policymaking, especially when it is a policy that will affect  every future Federal employee, and those numbers are huge, given the  baby boom bulge ready to retire. That is 40 percent of the workforce,  and it has to be replaced.   So while I very much appreciate the intent of my friend from Montana,  it is in that context I rise in opposition.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, under H.R. 4182, the probationary period for all  Federal employees is extended for an additional year, regardless of the  job they are hired to do. All new employees are punished equally, and  supervisors are given no new tools to improve their use of the existing  probationary period.   In February 2016, as I have mentioned before, the GAO reports  studying the rules and trends relating to review and dismissal of  employees for poor performance, suggests that the Office of Personnel  Management look into whether there are certain occupations, due to the  nature or complexity of the position, in which the probationary period  should be extended beyond 1 year or not.   We heard testimony before the Rules Committee from a number of  colleagues who represent areas with big Federal concentration, Federal  employee concentrations with specialized agencies, such as the weather  service in Oklahoma and CDC in Atlanta where a 2-year probationary  period may very well impede the ability to hire the skilled workers we  need.   The report goes on to say that it is something that should be looked  into. It does not call for a government-wide extension of the  probationary period. That is why I filed this amendment to require the  GAO to conduct a study on the Department of Defense and other Federal  agencies that have used this tool, a 2-year probationary period.   A 2-year probationary period for civilian employees at DOD was  enacted in 2016, and as the largest Federal agency, this extension  would provide a good case study on the potential impacts: good, bad,  and indifferent on the legislation before us. It is a study we ought to  do before we adopt a bill.   Some of my colleagues believe that since extending the probationary  period has been working out so well, it ought to be extended across the  entire Federal Government. There are a few things I need to point out  for us. This policy only affected those who were hired after November  25, 2015, the day the law went into effect.   Secondly, the former Under Secretary of Defense, as I mentioned in  earlier statements, Peter Levine, testified before the Armed Services  Committee that the Department has done little to take advantage of that  legislation. That is his testimony. Therefore, there are only a small  number of employees who have completed the 2-year probationary period,  and it is too soon to declare it a success or failure.   That is why my amendment would have the GAO give us guidance. How has  it worked? Has it helped? Has it hurt? Are there some things we haven't  anticipated that we need to address?   The study would also look into whether extending the probationary  period has any effect on the ability of an agency to recruit and  retain. And, again, I pointed out 40 percent of the existing workforce  is eligible for retirement now or in the next few years. That is a huge  number of people. And we have got to worry about recruitment.   Gathering the data is a necessary first step, not a last step or an  afterthought, before deciding to change a law with such profound impact  on Federal agencies. This bill, as I said to my friend from Kentucky  (Mr. Comer), may yet prove to be a good idea, but we don't know. There  remain a lot of questions about the efficacy of this proposal. It is  risky, and it can have terrible negative consequences that we haven't  even foreseen and some of which we can predict today.   Two weeks ago, this body adopted a policy of evidence-based  policymaking, so let's put it into implementation with this bill. Let's  look for some evidence, empirical evidence, systematically done to  justify the adoption of such a sweeping bill.   Mr. Chairman, I call for the adoption of my amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
