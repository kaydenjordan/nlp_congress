 Madam Speaker, I congratulate General  John W. Raymond, who was sworn in yesterday as the first Chief of Space  Operations for the newly established U.S. Space Force.   As a senior Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am  grateful to President Donald Trump for General Raymond's confirmation  and for being able to attend the National Defense Authorization Act  signing which officially established the U.S. Space Force.   General Raymond is a Clemson University alumnus and has over 30 years  of military experience. ``This establishment is absolutely critical to  our national security,'' he said during his remarks after being sworn  in.   I am grateful that the U.S. Space Force is in strong, capable hands.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th, defeating terrorists overseas, in the global war on  terrorism with the courageous leadership of President Donald Trump.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Chris  Smith for his dedication and leadership, and I thank Congressman  Grothman from Wisconsin for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court struck down State  and Federal right-to-life laws in their decision on Roe v. Wade. Since  then over 61 million unborn children have been stripped of their right  to life, and our country has denied itself future teachers, doctors,  farmers, neighbors, friends, and loved ones.   I am grateful to stand with my colleagues in Congress to defend the  right to life for the unborn. In the House we have worked to pass  commonsense pro-life legislation such as H.R. 962, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This bill would give a child the  right to live if he or she is born alive following an abortion or  attempted abortion. With over 191 cosponsors, this bill has been  shamefully dropped by House Democrats for a vote 80 different times.    Last weekend I attended the Right to Life Dinner featuring Governor  Henry McMaster and First Lady Peggy McMaster and appreciated  participating with thousands of citizens across the State for a program  emceed by Attorney General Alan Wilson at the Statehouse in Columbia.   South Carolina Citizens for Life work tirelessly to protect innocent  human lives, and I appreciate the leadership of Lisa Van Riper, Holly  Gatling, Alexia Newman, Karen Iacovelli Forster, Brenda Hucks, and  Sally Zaleski for their hard work and dedication.   I look forward to welcoming next weekend the participants for the  March for Life in Washington. Each year tens of thousands of students  from across America will show their appreciation of life.   This year is special in that my oldest grandson and namesake, Addison  Wilson III, will attend with a delegation from Holy Trinity Classical  Christian School of Beaufort, South Carolina.                                time  1915
